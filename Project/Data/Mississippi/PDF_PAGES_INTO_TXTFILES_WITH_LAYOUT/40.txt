(6)   Requirements to Comply with Plans

      The Permit Board, if it deems necessary, may impose any further requirements
      under the terms and conditions of a State, UIC, or NPDES permit to comply with
      an area-wide waste treatment management plan, or amendments thereto, prepared
      by a management agency pursuant to Section 208(b) of the Federal Act, or a
      facilities plan prepared in accordance with Title II or Title VI of the Federal Act.

(7)   Interim Requirements

      Prior to promulgation of regulations by the Administrator of EPA relating to
      applicable effluent standards or limitations or standards of performance set forth
      in Rule 1.1.4.A.3, the Permit Board may impose any standard, limitation or
      condition within the State or NPDES permit to ensure compliance with the State
      law and the Federal Act.

(8)   Calculating and Determining Permit Limits

      The permit shall contain conditions calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 122.45,
      which is incorporated herein and adopted by reference. When issuing a State,
      UIC, or NPDES permit pursuant to the State law and this regulation, the Permit
      Board shall specify therein, where applicable, average and maximum daily
      quantitative limitations for the level of wastewater constituents in the authorized
      discharge in terms of weight and, if appropriate, average or maximum
      concentration limits.

(9)   Schedules of Compliance

      (a)    A person issued a State, UIC, or NPDES permit by the Permit Board
             pursuant to Rule 1.1.3.H and who is not in compliance with applicable
             effluent standards and limitations or other requirements contained therein
             at the time the permit is issued, shall be required to achieve compliance
             within a period of time as set forth by the Permit Board, with effluent
             standards and limitations, with water quality standards, or with specific
             requirements or conditions set by the Permit Board. The Permit Board
             shall require compliance with terms and conditions of the permit in the
             shortest reasonable period of time. For UIC permits, this time shall not
             exceed three (3) years.

      (b)    If a time schedule for compliance specified in a State, UIC, or NPDES
             permit which is established by the Permit Board pursuant to Rule
             1.1.4.A.9.a above exceeds one year, the time schedule shall provide for
             interim target dates for compliance with selected terms and conditions of
             the permit. Each interim target date specified in the permit shall not
             exceed one year.
