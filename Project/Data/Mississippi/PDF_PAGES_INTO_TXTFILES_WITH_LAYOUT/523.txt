E. TMDL Successes (Category 4a to Category 2)

The objective of any TMDL is to determine the loading capacity of the waterbody and to allocate
that load among different pollutant sources so that the appropriate control actions can be taken
and water quality standards achieved. The TMDL process is important for improving water
quality because it serves as a link in the chain between water quality standards and
implementation of control actions designed to attain those standards. The waters listed in Table 8
have been the subject of one or more TMDLs and through corrective action to reduce the
pollutant load are now successfully supporting the designated use. Maps of the TMDL
Successes can be found in Appendix B.
