              noncompliance, shall not constitute a final administrative action subject to
              judicial review.

       (c)    Conditions necessary for demonstration of upset. A permittee who wishes
              to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
              properly signed contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant
              evidence that:

              (1)    an upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s)
                     of the upset;

              (2)    the permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;

              (3)    the permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in 40 CFR
                     122.41(L)(6)(ii)(B)(24-hour notice of noncompliance); and

              (4)    the permittee complied with any remedial measures required under
                     40 CFR 122.41(d) (duty to mitigate).

       (d)    Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee seeking to
              establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.

(28)   Monitoring of Discharges Authorized by All Permits: Requirements

       (a)    The Permit Board may prescribe monitoring requirements for any
              discharge authorized by a State, UIC, or NPDES permit issued pursuant to
              this regulation. A State, UIC, or NPDES permit issued pursuant to this
              regulation may be subject to such monitoring requirements as may be
              reasonably required by the Permit Board to determine compliance with
              permit conditions or State Water Quality Criteria. Such monitoring may
              include the discharge point, instream monitoring, and, include the
              installation, use, and maintenance of monitoring equipment or methods
              including, where appropriate, biological monitoring methods. Ambient
              instream monitoring may be required by the Permit Board to assure that
              WQBELs are protective of State water quality criteria through
              consideration of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

              (1)    variance to any water quality criteria,

              (2)    the complexity of the receiving water body,

              (3)    magnitude and impact or potential impact of the discharge,

              (4)    amount of available data, and

              (5)    aquatic life and human health concerns.
