       (c)    A discharger who fails or refuses to comply with either an interim or final
              date of compliance specified in a State, UIC, or NPDES permit may be
              deemed by the Commission to be in violation of the permit and may be
              subject to enforcement action prescribed in the State law or this regulation.

       (d)    Unless otherwise provided in these regulations, the total length of time for
              the following to be accomplished shall not exceed three years:

              (1)    the determination that a particular limit is needed,

              (2)    the length of a compliance schedule to achieve that limit, and

              (3)    any instream or other study to determine an alternative limit or
                     water quality criterion

       (e)    An NPDES permit may, when appropriate, specify a schedule of
              compliance leading to compliance with the Federal Act and regulations in
              accordance with 40 CFR 122.47 which is incorporated herein and adopted
              by reference.

(10)   Compliance Schedule Reports by Dischargers

       Within 14 days after either an interim or final date of compliance specified in a
       State, UIC, or NPDES permit, a permittee shall provide the Permit Board with
       written notice of his compliance or noncompliance with the requirements or
       conditions specified to be completed by that date. Failure to submit the written
       notice to the Permit Board shall be considered a violation of the compliance
       requirements of the permit, for which the Commission may be asked to take
       enforcement action.

(11)   Closure Requirements

       When issuing a State or NPDES permit pursuant to the State law and this

       (b)    within 90 days of decommissioning the treatment works.
              The Closure Plan shall address how and when all manufactured products,
              by-products, raw materials, stored chemicals, and solid and liquid waste
              and residues will be removed from the premises so that no potential
              environmental hazard to the waters of the State will be presented.
