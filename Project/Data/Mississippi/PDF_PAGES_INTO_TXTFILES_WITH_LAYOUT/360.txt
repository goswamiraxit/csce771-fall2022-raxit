                                          APPENDIX E

                                    Debarment and Suspension

The Department is prohibited from entering into loan agreements with loan applicants that have
been debarred or suspended by any state or federal agency.

Loan recipients are prohibited from entering into contractual agreements with individuals,
businesses, organizations, or any other entities that have been debarred or suspended by any state
or federal agency.

Loan recipients are responsible for ensuring that prime contractors utilized on the project are not
debarred or suspended. Likewise, prime contractors are responsible for ensuring that
subcontractors utilized on the project are not debarred or suspended.

Anyone may contact the Department concerning the existence of a cause for debarment or
suspension. The Department may refer the matter to the State Attorney General or other
appropriate office for further investigation. If, after review or investigation, the Department
reasonably believes that a cause for debarment exists, the Department may propose debarment or
suspension and may initiate procedures similar to, but not necessarily identical to, federal
regulation 40 CFR Part 32: Debarment and Suspension Under EPA Assistance Programs.

Such above described debarment or suspension actions will not affect existing executed
contractual agreements, unless such agreements have been terminated or suspended under the
terms of the agreement by the loan recipient.
