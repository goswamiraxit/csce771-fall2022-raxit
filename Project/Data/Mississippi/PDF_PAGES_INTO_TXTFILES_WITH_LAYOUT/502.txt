       capitalization grant. During the Spring 2014 legislative session, the Legislature provided a direct appropriation of $1,000,000 to be used for state match
       funds. These appropriated funds were used to match an additional $5,000,000 of the FY-13 capitalization grant. During the Spring 2015 legislative session,
       the Legislature provided a direct appropriation of $1,000,000 to be used for state match funds. However, due to a State Capital Expense Fund shortfall,
       $80,583 of that amount was rescinded, and another $77,859 may be rescinded if an upcoming ballot initiative (Initiative 42/MAEP) passes. Therefore, only
       $841,558 of the $1,000,000 appropriation can currently be counted as match. These appropriated funds are being used to match the remaining $3,380,785 of
       the FY-13 capitalization grant, and $827,005 of the FY-14 capitalization grant. The ballot initiative did not pass, and the Legislature restored $65,583 of the
       rescission in the 3rd Quarter of FY-16, resulting in an additional $143,442 available for match. During the Spring 2016 legislative session, the Legislature
       provided a direct appropriation of $2,380,000 to be used for state match funds, which were used to match the remainder of the FY-14 capitalization grant,
       and a portion or the FY-15 capitalization grant. During the Spring 2018 Regular Legislative session, the Legislature provided bonding authority for
       $5,000,000 in general obligation bonds to be used for state match funds. These bond proceeds will be used to match the remainder of the FY-15
       capitalization grant and the entire FY-16 capitalization grant, and to provide $241,643 in match money for the FY-17 capitalization grant. During the Spring
       2019 Regular Legislative session, the Legislature provided bonding authority for $7,940,000 in general obligation bonds to be used for state match funds.
       These bond proceeds will be used to match the remainder of the FY-17 capitalization grant, the entire FY-18 capitalization grant, the entire FY-19
       capitalization grant, and to provide $37,443 in match money for the FY-20 capitalization grant. During the Spring 2020 Regular Legislative session, the
       Legislature provided bonding authority for $2,830,000 in general obligation bonds to be used for state match funds. These bond proceeds will be used to
       match the remainder of the FY-20 capitalization grant.

       The FY-2013 Federal payment schedule $ that can be matched with $719,382 in proceeds from the sale of $1,000,000 in general obligation bonds authorized
       by the State Legislature during the Spring 2013 Legislative session.

       The FY-2013 Federal payment schedule $ that can be matched with the remaining $10,062 in proceeds from the sale of $1,000,000 in general obligation
       bonds authorized by the State Legislature during the Spring 2013 Legislative session, and with $1,000,000 of direct appropriation authorized by the State
       Legislature during the Spring 2014 Legislative session.

       The remainder of the FY-2013 Federal payment schedule $ that can be matched with $676,157 of the $1,000,000 of direct appropriation authorized by the
       State Legislature during the Spring 2015 Legislative session.

       The FY-2014 Federal payment schedule $ that can be matched with the $165,401 of the $1,000,000 direct appropriation authorized by the State Legislature
       during the Spring 2015 Legislative session. (Note, due to a “budget shortfall” in the State Capital Expense Fund, $80,583 of that appropriation was not
       received. Also, there is a potential for that appropriation to be reduced by another $77,859 if an upcoming ballot initiative (Initiative 42/MAEP) passes.
       Therefore, the resulting total of $158,442 has been deducted from the 2015 $1,000,000 appropriation, and only $841,558 has currently been counted as
       match.)

       $65,583 of the rescission in the 3rd Quarter of FY-16.)
