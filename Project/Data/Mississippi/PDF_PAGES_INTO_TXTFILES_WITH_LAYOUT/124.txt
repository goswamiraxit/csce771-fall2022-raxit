Alternatives Analysis

An analysis of alternatives is required to ensure that the applicant has considered alternatives that
would reduce impacts to state surface waters. The analysis should include a description of each
alternative in terms of both technical and economic feasibility. Alternatives to be considered
should include (but are not limited to):

(1)    a centralized no discharge system;
(2)    connection to an existing wastewater treatment facility;
(3)    an alternative discharge point; and
(4)    product or raw material substitution.

Alternatives may also consider:
(5)     other treatment options which would reduce the predicted impact to the stream;
(6)     improved operation and maintenance of existing treatment operations;
(7)     seasonal or controlled discharge options to avoid critical conditions; and
(8)     pollution prevention, increased efficiency, water conservation, recycle or reuse
alternatives.

Socio-Economic Impacts Analysis

Socio-economic or environmental / public health issues may be considered as justifications for
lowering water quality. This analysis is not necessary if a non-degrading alternative is chosen
following the alternatives analysis.

Factors to be considered in making a determination include:

(1)    employment (increasing production and jobs, maintaining, or avoiding reduction in
employment);
(2)   improved community tax base; and
(3)   correction of an environmental or public health problem; and
(4)   providing a social benefit to the community.

The Interim Economic Guidance for Water Quality Standards Workbook, published by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, March 1995, may be used as a guide in preparing this
analysis.

Public Review / Input

Prior to issuance of an individual NPDES permit, the proposed permit is sent to public notice in
accordance with the Environmental Permits Divisionâ€™s administrative procedures. The NPDES
permit public notice will state that an antidegradation report has been prepared for the project
and is available for public inspection. All applications for coverage under a general permit will
