      of the pollutant or pollutant parameter in the effluent, the
      sensitivity of the species to toxicity testing (when evaluating whole
      effluent toxicity), and where appropriate, the dilution of the
      effluent in the receiving water.

(3)   When the Permit Board determines, using the procedures in
      A.3.a.(2) of this Rule, that a discharge causes, has the reasonable
      potential to cause, or contributes to an instream excursion above
      the allowable ambient concentration of a State numeric criteria
      within a State water quality standard for an individual pollutant,
      the permit must contain effluent limits for that pollutant.

(4)   When the Permit Board determines, using the procedures in
      A.3.a.(2) of this Rule, that a discharge causes, has the reasonable
      potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion above
      the numeric criterion for whole effluent toxicity, the permit must
      contain effluent limits for whole effluent toxicity.

(5)   Except as provided in this subparagraph, when the Permit Board
      determines, using the procedures in A.3.a.(2) of this Rule, toxicity
      testing data, or other information, that a discharge causes, has the
      reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an instream
      excursion above a narrative criterion within an applicable State
      water quality standard, the permit must contain effluent limits for
      whole effluent toxicity. Limits on whole effluent toxicity are not
      necessary where the Permit Board demonstrates in the fact sheet or
      statement of basis of the NPDES permit, using the procedures in
      A.3.a.(2) of this Rule, that chemical-specific limits for the effluent
      are sufficient to attain and maintain applicable numeric and
      narrative State water quality standards.

(6)   Where the State has not established a water quality criterion for a
      specific chemical pollutant that is present in an effluent at a
      concentration that causes, has the reasonable potential to cause, or
      contributes to an excursion above a narrative criterion within an
      applicable State water quality standard, the Permit Board must
      establish effluent limits using one or more of the following.

      (i)    Establish effluent limits using a calculated numeric water
             quality criterion for the pollutant which the Permit Board
             demonstrates will attain and maintain applicable narrative
             water quality criteria and will fully protect the designated
             use. Such a criterion may be derived using a proposed
             State criterion, or an explicit State policy or regulation
             interpreting its narrative water quality criterion,
             supplemented with other relevant information which may
