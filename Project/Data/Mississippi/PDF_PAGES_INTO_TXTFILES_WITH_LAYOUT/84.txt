             (i)     The Linear Partition Coefficient is calculated from Table 5-
                     4 in the Technical Guidance Manual using the following
                     formula:

                        K p = K po * TSS a

      Where: Kp    = Linear Partition Coefficient
      Kpo = Regression Coefficient (from table)
      TSS = Total Suspended Solids Concentration (site specific 15th
              percentile)
      a     = Exponent Constant (from table)

             (ii)    The Dissolved Fraction is then calculated as follows:

                    C            1
                      =
                    CT 1 + K p * TSS *10 âˆ’6

      Where: C/CT = Dissolved Fraction of metal

      (2)    Alternately, the permittee may determine the dissolved fraction
             directly by analyzing paired samples of site water for dissolved and
             total recoverable metals using EPA's "clean" analytical techniques
             and sampling procedures. This determination may be made in one
             of two ways.

             (i)     Collect four paired samples during the low flow period,
                     defined as no greater than twice the 7Q10, analyze paired
                     samples of site water for dissolved and total recoverable
                     metals using EPA's "clean " analytical techniques and
                     sampling procedures, take the arithmetic mean of the four
                     analyses, and calculate the dissolved fraction based on the
                     mean values for dissolved and total recoverable metals.

             (ii)    Collect 20 paired samples on randomly selected dates
                     throughout the year, analyze as described in (2)(i) above,
                     calculate the dissolved fraction for each sampling, and use
                     the 95th percentile highest dissolved fraction.

      (3)    The permittee is responsible for providing all the site specific data
             needed for these calculations.

(c)   The third method is to assume that there is no difference between the
      dissolved and total recoverable metals concentrations.
