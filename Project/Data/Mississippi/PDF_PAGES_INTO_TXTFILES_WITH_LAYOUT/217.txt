G.   Federal Title II Requirements. All projects which receive loan assistance from the fund
     and which will be constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with funds
     directly made available by capitalization grants must meet the Title II requirements under
     Sections 201(b), 201(g)(1), 201(g)(2), 201(g)(3), 201(g)(5), 201(g)(6), 201(n)(1), 201(o),
     204(a)(1), 204(a)(2), 204(b)(1), 204(d)(2), 211, 218, 511(c)(1) and 513 of the Act.
     Current EPA regulations promulgated under these sections of the Act will apply, except
     as noted below. These requirements will be superceded by any subsequent federal law or
     regulation if so specified by that law or regulation. The Department may establish state
     procedures accepted by EPA. In applying these EPA regulations, the word "Department"
     shall be substituted for the word "EPA" or "Regional Administrator" and the words "loan
     recipient" shall be substituted for the word "grantee". A summary of these Title II
     requirements and the applicable regulations is as follows:

     (1)    (Section 201(b), which requires that projects apply best practicable waste
            treatment technology (see 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(7): Definition of BPWTT; 40 CFR

     (2)    Section 201(g)(1), which limits assistance to projects for secondary treatment,
            advanced treatment or any cost-effective alternative, new interceptors and
            appurtenances, and infiltration-inflow correction. This section retains the
            Governor's discretionary set-aside by which a State can use up to 20 percent of its
            allotment for other projects within the definition of treatment works in Section
            212(2), and for certain non-point source control and groundwater protection
            purposes, as defined in section 319 of the Act (40 CFR 35.2015(b)(2)(ii-iv): State
            Priority System and Project Priority List);

     (3)    Section 201(g)(2), which requires that alternative technologies be considered in

     (5)    Section 201(g)(5), which requires that applicants study innovative and alternative
            treatment technologies and take into account opportunities to construct revenue
            producing facilities and to make more efficient uses of energy and resources (40
            CFR 35.2030: Facilities Planning);

     (6)    Section 201(g)(6), which requires that the applicant analyze potential recreation
            and open space opportunities in the planning of the proposed facility (40 CFR
            35.2030(b)(5): Facilities Planning);

     (7)    Section 201(n)(1), which provides that funds under Section 205 may be used for
