Subchapter 3: Water Quality Certification of Activities Requiring Federal Licenses or Permits


Rule 1.3.1 Background and General Requirements.

A.      Background. Section 401 of the Federal Act, 33 U. S. C. Section 1341, requires any
applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct any activity which may result in any
discharge into the waters of the United States to provide the licensing or permitting agency a
certification from the State in which the discharge originates or will originate that any discharge
will comply with the applicable provisions of §§ 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the Federal Act,
33 U. S. C. §§ 1311, 1312, 1313, 1316 and 1317. Miss. Code Ann. § 49-2-7 provides that the
Department shall be responsible for conserving, managing, developing and protecting the natural
resources of the State of Mississippi. In addition, Miss. Code Ann. § 49-17-28 authorizes the
Mississippi Environmental Quality Permit Board to issue water quality certifications required by
Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act.

B.     General Requirements of Section 401 Certification.

       (1)     These regulations establish procedures and policies for implementing State water
               quality certification requirements of Section 401 of the Federal Act, 33 U.S.C. §
               1341 ("§ (Section) 401 Certification"), which is incorporated herein and adopted
               by reference.

       (2)     Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 49-17-28(3) and § 49-17-28(3)(a), the Executive
               Director is authorized to make decisions on issuance, reissuance, denial,
               modification, and revocation of water quality certifications on projects regarding
               which the Department has received no written adverse comments. Additionally,
               the Permit Board may authorize the Executive Director to implement these
               regulations and to make decisions on issuance, reissuance, denial, modification,
               and revocation of water quality certifications for other projects, including projects
               regarding which the Department receives adverse written comments. The
               Executive Director may further delegate this authority to appropriate Department
               staff members, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §§ 49-2-13(a) and (c) and 49-17-
               29(3)(a). For purposes of Miss. Code Ann. § 49-17-29(3)(a), the word “permit”
               in the phrase “ permit issuance, reissuance, denial, modification or revocation”
               and in the phrase “all other permits within the jurisdiction of the Permit Board,”
               includes water quality certification actions taken pursuant to these regulations.
               The term "Department" in Rule 1.3.2 through 1.3.4 means:

               (a)    In a case where the Permit Board has authorized the Executive Director or
                      Department staff to act on a certification, the Department acting through
