Table 2 Assessment Categories

Assessment Categories        Definitions of Categories
Category 1                   All uses associated with the Assessment Unit have a use attainment
                             status of “Fully Supporting”
Category 2                   All uses associated with the Assessment Unit that have been
                             assessed are “Fully Supporting” but there is insufficient data to
                             determine if remaining designated uses are met
Category 3                   Insufficient data to determine whether any designated uses are met
Category 4                   More specific categories of 4A, 4B, and 4C are required
4A                           TMDL has been completed
4B                           Other required control measures will result in
                             attainment of WQS
4C                           Impairment or threat not caused by a pollutant
Category 5                   Available data indicate that at least one designated use is not being
                             supported and a TMDL is needed

5-alt                        Available data indicate that at least one designated use is not being
                             supported, but an alternative restoration approach is being
                             implement rather than development of a TMDL.



The §303(d) list includes streams that are impaired that do not have completed Total Maximum
Daily Loads (TMDLs). Once the TMDL is completed, but prior to the stream being restored,
MDEQ modifies the assessment category of the stream. An impaired stream without a TMDL is
assessed in category 5. A stream with a TMDL, but still impaired, is assessed in category 4A.
The §303(d) lists all of the category 5 waters. Completed TMDLs may be found on the TMDL
website at:

Quality Assessment Report listed below:

E. Monitoring Data

Assessments for 2020 are based on current site-specific monitoring data believed to accurately
portray existing water quality conditions. A water body is considered monitored if sufficient (in
quantity, quality, and frequency) physical, chemical, biological, bacteriological, and/or fish
tissue data were collected and assessed on the water body data from January 1, 2014 to
December 31, 2018.
