     (1)    feasible alternatives to the activity;

     (2)    mitigation;

     (3)    initial and secondary impacts on all existing and all classified uses of the waters
            of the State;

     (4)    degree of compliance of the proposed activity with the State of Mississippi Water
            Quality Criteria for Intrastate, Interstate, and Coastal Waters;

     (5)    degree of physical, chemical, and biological impacts on waters of the State;

     (6)    the effect on circulation patterns and water movement on waters of the State;

     (7)    degree of alteration of the aquatic ecosystem;

     (8)    degree of consistency with approved water quality management plans adopted by
            the Commission;

     (9)    storm water management;

     (10)   compliance history of the applicant; and

     (11)   any other factors deemed to be necessary by the Department to protect water
            quality.

B.   Denial. After consideration of the factors in Rule 1.3.4.A, a decision to issue or deny
     certification shall be made. However, it is the policy of the Department to deny
     certification when any of the following determinations are made unless the Department is
     assured that appropriate measures will be taken to eliminate unreasonable degradation
     and irreparable harm to waters of the State.

     (1)    The proposed activity permanently alters the aquatic ecosystem such that water
            quality criteria are violated and/or it no longer supports its existing or classified
            uses. An example is the channelization of streams.

     (2)    There is a feasible alternative to the activity which reduces adverse consequences
            on water quality and classified or existing uses of waters of the State.

     (3)    The proposed activity adversely impacts waters containing State or federally
            recognized threatened or endangered species.
