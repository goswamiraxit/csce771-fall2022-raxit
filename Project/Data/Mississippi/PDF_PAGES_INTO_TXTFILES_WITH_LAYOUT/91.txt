The conversion factor to cfs is slightly less than 1.01 and is generally ignored. Attached to Rule
1.1.2 collectively as Exhibit "C" and incorporated herein by reference is a table of runoff
coefficients and a map showing average storm event intensity over Mississippi. The area is
estimated using GIS software applications.

Calculation:

                             Q = I * ((C1 * A1 ) + (C2 * A2 ) + ....)

For large watersheds without an applicable gaging station, Best Professional Judgment (BPJ)
will be used.

       (2)     Stormwater Limits Determination

               (a)    Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG)


                     (1) The Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), Title 40, provides effluent
                         limitations guidelines that address storm water discharges for the
                         following facilities: Cement Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 411);
                         Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) (40 CFR Part 412);
                         Fertilizer Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 418); Petroleum Refining (40
                         CFR Part 419); Iron and Steel Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 420);
                         Phosphate Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 422); Steam Electric (40 CFR
                         Part 423); Bleached Papergrade Kraft and Soda Subcategory of the Pulp,
                         Paper and Paperboard (40 CFR Part 430) Meat and Poultry Products (40
                         CFR Part 432); Coal Mining (40 CFR Part 434); Oil and Gas (40 CFR
                         Part 435); Mineral Mining and Processing (40 CFR Part 436);
                         Centralized Waste Treatment Point Source (40 CFR Part 437); Metal
                         Products and Machinery (40 CFR Part 438); Pharmaceutical
                         Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 439); Ore Mining and Dressing (40 CFR
                         Part 440); Transportation Equipment Cleaning (40 CFR Part 442);
                         Asphalt Emission (40 CFR Part 443);.and Concentrated Aquatic Animal
                         Production (40 CFR Part 451). All of the foregoing CFR parts are
                         incorporated herein and adopted by reference.

                     (2) When limits are given in the CFR, they are generally concentration
                         values in mg/l. These concentration values will be used for the permit
                         limits if protective of human health, welfare, or the environment.

                     (3) When concentration limits are not given in the CFR, Water Quality
                         Standards and/or best professional judgment will be used to determine
                         the facility's discharge limits.

               (b)    Water Quality Standards (WQS).
