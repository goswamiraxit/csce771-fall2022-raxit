I.  EMPIRICAL STREAM, LAKE, and ESTUARY MODEL ASSUMPTIONS FOR
CONVENTIONAL POLLUTANTS

A.     7Q10 Flow Values

1.     The 7Q10 flow in unregulated, natural streams is to be determined from Low-flow and
Flow-Duration Characteristics of Mississippi Streams, U.S.G.S., Report 90-4087 (hereinafter
"Report 90-4087") or the most recent update of this publication.

2.     7Q10 value of a gage will be used directly if gaging station is at or near the point of
discharge.

3.      7Q10 flow coefficients (7Q10 value in CFS/drainage area in square miles) of a gaging
station will be used to calculate a 7Q10 value for a point discharge if there is a gaging station on
the stream or on a nearby stream. An average 7Q10 flow coefficient may be used if there is more
than one nearby gaging station.

4.     7Q10 flow coefficients can be taken from Report 90-4087 if no gaging station is available.
The value will be assumed to be in the middle of the given range.

5.     A 7Q10 flow coefficient of 0.0 cfs will be used for intermittent streams or when the
Report 90-4087 lists the 7Q10 flow coefficient as less than 0.01 cfs per square mile.

6.      The annual 7Q10 flow will be used for seasonal winter allocations, unless data is available
to determine seasonal or monthly 7Q10 flows.

7.     Semi-annual, quarterly or monthly 7Q10 flows with their respective average maximum
temperatures may be used to determine various seasonal wasteload allocations.

8.     In regulated streams the legally guaranteed minimum flow will be used for allocations
unless otherwise provided in these regulations.

9.     Spatially distributed flow will be included to account for flow gained at 7Q10 from
sources other than major tributaries.

10.    Spatial flow will be calculated between gaging stations if available.

11.     Spatial flows will be determined by using 7Q10 flow coefficients where sufficient gaging
stations are not available.
