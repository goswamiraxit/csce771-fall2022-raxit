C.   RECREATION CLASSIFICATION:

     Waters in this classification are to be suitable for recreational purposes, including such
     water contact activities as swimming and water skiing. In considering the acceptability of
     a proposed site for disposal of bacteria latent wastewater in or near waters with this
     classification, the Permit Board shall consider the relative proximity of the discharge to
     areas of actual water contact activity.

     (1)    Bacteria: Culturable e.coli should not exceed a geometric mean of 126 per 100 ml,
            nor should the samples examined during a 30-day period exceed 410 per 100 ml
            more than 10% of the time. There should be a minimum of 5 samples taken over a
            30-day period with no less than 12 hours between individual samples.

            For both marine and estuarine coastal recreational waters, Enterococci should not
            exceed a 90-day geometric mean of 35 per 100 ml, nor should the samples examined
            during a 90-day period exceed 130 per 100 ml more than 10% of the time. Coastal
            recreational waters do not include inland waters upstream of the mouth of a river or
            a stream having a natural connection to the open sea.

     (2)    Specific Conductance: There shall be no substances added to increase the
            conductivity above 1000 micromhos/cm for freshwater streams.

     (3)    Dissolved Solids: There shall be no substances added to the water to cause the
            dissolved solids to exceed 750 mg/l as a monthly average value, nor exceed 1500
            mg/l at any time for freshwater streams.

D.   FISH AND WILDLIFE CLASSIFICATION:

     Waters in this classification are intended for fishing and for propagation of fish, aquatic life,
     and wildlife. Waters that meet the Fish and Wildlife Criteria shall also be suitable for
     secondary contact recreation. Secondary contact recreation is defined as incidental contact
     with the water during activities such as wading, fishing, and boating, that are not likely to
     result in full body immersion.

     (1)    Bacteria: Culturable e.coli should not exceed a geometric mean of 126 per 100 ml
            over a 30-day period, nor should the samples examined during a 30-day period
            exceed 410 per 100 ml more than 10% of the time. There should be a minimum of 5
            samples taken over a 30-day period with no less than 12 hours between individual
            samples.


     (2)    Specific Conductance: There shall be no substances added to increase the
            conductivity above 1000 micromhos/cm for freshwater streams.

     (3)    Dissolved Solids: There shall be no substances added to the waters to cause the
            dissolved solids to exceed 750 mg/l as a monthly average value, nor exceed 1500
            mg/l at any time for freshwater streams.
