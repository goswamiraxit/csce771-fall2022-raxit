               WPCELF Loan Recipient Accounting and Auditing Requirements

All WPCELF loan recipients must maintain project accounts in accordance with generally
accepted government accounting standards, as defined by the Guidelines of the Municipal
Accounting and Audit Manual, as prescribed by the State Auditor's Office. Charges to the project
account must be properly supported, related to allowable construction costs, and documented by
appropriate records. These project accounts must be maintained as separate accounts.

The Department and its representatives shall have access to and the right to audit, inspect, copy
and examine all books, financial records and other documents relating directly to the receipt and
disbursement of WPCELF funds. Failure to cooperate with the Department regarding access to
project records or refusal to provide such records when requested by the Department may be
considered justification for debarment of the Loan Recipient and/or its Contractor, Engineer,
attorney, or other person or company providing any services in conjunction with the project.
