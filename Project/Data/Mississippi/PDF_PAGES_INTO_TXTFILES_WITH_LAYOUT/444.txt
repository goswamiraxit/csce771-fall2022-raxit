                                            If the loan recipient is pursuing a RUS

                    grant/loan to cover part of the cost of construction, the loan recipient

                    has the option to include the anticipated RUS grant /loan amount in

                    the detailed cost breakdown in the application, or may request 100%

                    WPCRLF funding with the possibility of amending the loan

                    application later if the loan recipient is awarded a RUS grant/loan

                    prior to receipt of bids for construction. However, the WPCRLF loan

                    application must be consistent with the WPCRLF facilities plan for

                    the project.




                            05/2020      MDEQ provides notification to RUS that

                    complete WPCRLF loan applications have been received.




03/2020 - 09/2020   Loan applicants receive WPCRLF loan awards from MDEQ. The

                    amount of the loan will be the total WPCRLF eligible cost less the

                    RUS award amount to be applied to WPCRLF eligible costs.




                    Upon Loan Award         MDEQ copies RUS on the award letter.




                    Upon RUS Award          RUS provides notification that RUS awards

                    have been made.
