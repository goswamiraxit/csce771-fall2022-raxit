(14)   Facility Expansion and/or Modification

       Any facility expansion, production increases, process modifications, changes in
       discharge volume or location or other changes in operations or conditions of the
       permittee which may result in a new or increased discharge of waste, shall be
       reported to the Permit Board by submission of a new application for a permit
       pursuant to Rule 1.1.2.A., or if the discharge does not violate effluent limitations
       specified in the permit, by submitting to the Permit Board a notice of a new or
       increased discharge.

(15)   Reporting Requirements

       (a)    Planned changes. The permittee shall give notice to the Permit Board as
              soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions, including
              but not limited to, a change of operation to the permitted facility. Notice
              is required in the circumstances that follow:

              (1)     The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of
                      the criteria for determining whether the facility is a new source in
                      40 CFR 122.29(b);

              (2)     The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or
                      increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This notification
                      applies to pollutants which are not subject to either effluent
                      limitations in the permit or notification requirements under 40 CFR
                      122.42(a)(1); or

              (3)     The alteration or addition results in a significant change in the
                      permittee's sludge use or disposal practices, and such alteration,
                      addition, or change may justify the application of permit conditions
                      that are different from or absent in the existing permit, including
                      notification of additional use or disposal sites not reported during
                      the permit application process or not reported pursuant to an
                      approved land application plan.

       (b)    Anticipated noncompliance. The permittee shall give advance notice to
              the Permit Board of any planned changes in the permitted facility or
              activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.

       (c)    Monitoring reports. Monitoring results shall be reported at the intervals
              specified in the permit.

              (1)     Monitoring results must be reported on a Discharge Monitoring
                      Report (DMR) and/or forms provided or specified by the Permit
