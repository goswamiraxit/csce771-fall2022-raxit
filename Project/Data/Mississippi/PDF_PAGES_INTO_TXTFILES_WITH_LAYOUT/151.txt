A.     Marinas shall be located in areas that eliminate or minimize the loss of wetland
vegetation.

B.     Marinas shall not be sited in open shellfish harvesting waters.

C.     Marina design shall not disrupt normal water circulation patterns or restrict tidal flow in
adjacent water bodies.

D.     Marina basins shall provide for water circulation and be designed to accommodate tidal
flushing by incorporating flow through breakwaters or similar structures.

E.      Marina basins excavated from uplands shall be designed to optimize tidal flushing and
internal circulation.

1.     The basin should be rectangular and have a length to width ratio between 0.5 and 2.0.

2.     Corners in the basin interior should be rounded.

3.      The basin should have a symmetric entrance(s) with maximum width and minimum
length.

4.      The basin shall not be greater in depth than the entrance channel which shall be no deeper
than the controlling navigational depth.

5.     Basin and channel depths shall gradually increase toward open water.

II.    Sewage Treatment Guidelines

A.     No persons shall live on boats moored at the marina unless the boats are equipped with a
Type III (non-discharging) marine sanitation device (MSD).

B.     A wastewater pumpout facility shall be provided for the following:

1.     marinas that are located within one tidal cycle of open shellfish harvesting waters,

2.     marinas that berth more than twenty-five (25) boats,

3.     marinas that berth any boats used in a live-aboard status,

4.     marinas that berth a majority of commercial boats,
