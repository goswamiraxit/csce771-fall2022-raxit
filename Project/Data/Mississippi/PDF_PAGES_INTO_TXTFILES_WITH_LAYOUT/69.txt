      (3)    The Permit Board shall follow the same procedures in reissuing an NPDES or
             UIC permit as in issuing one.

      (4)    If the applicant submits a timely and complete application or NOI pursuant to
             subparagraph 1. above, and the Permit Board, through no fault of the applicant,
             fails to reissue the permit or coverage and/or to act on the application or NOI on
             or before the expiration date of the existing permit or coverage, the existing
             permit or coverage shall remain in effect until final action on the permit and/or
             application or NOI is taken by the Permit Board. The provisions of 40 CFR
             122.6(d) are incorporated herein and adopted by reference. In no event shall any
             permit or coverage remain in effect beyond the expiration date provided in B.6.
             below.

      (5)    A copy of any NPDES or UIC permit reissued by the Permit Board shall be
             transmitted to the Regional Administrator (or his/her designee) with any
             appropriate forms or other applicable information relating thereto as agreed upon
             in the State/EPA Memorandum of Agreement.

      (6)    An NPDES general permit or state general permit issued by the Permit Board
             pursuant to this regulation shall continue in effect beyond its expiration date if, at
             least thirty days prior to the expiration of the general permit, the Department
             issues a notice of intent to seek reissuance of the permit (with or without
             modification) by the Permit Board. The general permit then will remain in effect
             until the Permit Board takes action on the Departmentâ€™s reissuance request.
