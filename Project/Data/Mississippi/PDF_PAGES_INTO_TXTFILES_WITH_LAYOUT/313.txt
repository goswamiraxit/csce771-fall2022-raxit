                                     Waste, Fraud and Abuse

It is the loan recipient's responsibility for preventing, detecting, and prosecuting waste, fraud,
abuse, and all other corrupt practices which may occur in relation to the WPCELF loan project.

If the loan recipient becomes aware of allegations, evidence, or the appearance of corrupt
practices, the loan recipient must:

       (1)     Immediately inform the Department in writing.

       (2)     Promptly pursue available state and local legal, administrative, and contractual
               remedies.

The Department may disallow costs under the WPCELF loan agreement where it is determined
that such costs are related to waste, fraud, abuse, or other corrupt practices. The Department may
also require repayment of WPCELF loan funds paid for such costs in accordance with Rule
5.3.E.(6) of these regulations.
