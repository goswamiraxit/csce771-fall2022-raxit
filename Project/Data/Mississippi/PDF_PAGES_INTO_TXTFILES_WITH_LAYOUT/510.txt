RULE 9.1 INTRODUCTION
Mississippi’s 2020 Section 303(d) List of Impaired Water Bodies fulfills the state's obligation
with respect to §303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act to develop a listing of the state’s
impaired waters. MDEQ provides two reports, this §303(d) list and a §305(b) report. These are
not physically integrated, but the lists are meant to have a one-to-one relationship in that all of
the water body segments found in the §305(b) report listed in category 5 are also listed in this
document in Table 10 below. These basins are shown on the map on page 4.

A.   Big Black River Basin
B.   Coastal Streams Basin
C.   North Independent Streams Basin
D.   Pascagoula River Basin
E.   Pearl River Basin
F.   South Independent Streams and Lower Mississippi River Basins
G.   Tennessee River Basin
H.   Tombigbee River Basin
I.   Yazoo River and Upper Mississippi River Basins

RULE 9.2 REGULATORY REQUIREMENT
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act and the implementing federal regulations at 40 C.F.R.
§130.7 require the state to identify those waters within its jurisdiction for which effluent
limitations are not sufficient to implement one or more applicable water quality standards and for
which TMDLs are not yet completed. The state is to establish a priority ranking for such waters,
taking into account the severity of the pollution and the designated uses to be made of such
waters.

RULE 9.3 ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

A. Consolidated Assessment Listing Methodology (CALM)

All data used to make formal assessments of the quality of the state’s waters, regardless of its
source, are evaluated in keeping with the requirements and guidelines in the state’s Mississippi
CALM [Consolidated Assessment Listing Methodology] for 2020, [CALM] (MDEQ, 2020). The
2020 CALM can be found online at:
