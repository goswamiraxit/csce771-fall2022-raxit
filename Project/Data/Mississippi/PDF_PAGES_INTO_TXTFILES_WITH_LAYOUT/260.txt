                                     Waste, Fraud, and Abuse

It is the loan recipient's responsibility for preventing, detecting, and prosecuting waste, fraud,
abuse, and all other corrupt practices which occur in relation to the SRF loan project.

If the loan recipient becomes aware of allegations, evidence, or the appearance of corrupt
practices, the loan recipient must:

       a.      Immediately inform the Department in writing.

       b.      Promptly pursue available state and local legal,
               administrative, and contractual remedies.

The Department may disallow costs under the SRF loan agreement where it is determined that
such costs are related to waste, fraud, abuse or other corrupt practices. The Department may also
require repayment of SRF loan funds paid for such costs in accordance with Rule 4.3.G.(6) of
this regulation.
