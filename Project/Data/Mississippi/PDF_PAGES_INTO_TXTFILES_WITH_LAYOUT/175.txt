Rule 2.3 Specific Water Quality Criteria:

A.      PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION:

Waters in this classification are a source of raw water supply for drinking and food processing
purposes. The water treatment process shall be approved by the Mississippi State Department of
Health. The raw water supply shall be such that after the approved treatment process, it will satisfy
the regulations established pursuant to Section 1412 of the Public Health Service Act as amended
by the Safe Drinking Water Act (Pub. L. 93-523). Information regarding surface water intakes for
Public Water Supply is provided in Table 3.

Waters that meet the Public Water Supply criteria shall also be suitable for secondary contact
recreation. Secondary contact recreation is defined as incidental contact with the water during
activities such as wading, fishing, and boating, that are not likely to result in full body immersion.
In considering the acceptability of a proposed site for disposal of bacteria latent wastewater in or
near waters with the public water supply classification, the Permit Board shall consider the relative
proximity of the discharge to water supply intakes.
