(g)   For carcinogens, the concentrations of toxic substances will not result in
      unacceptable health risk and will be based on a Cancer Potency Factor
      (CPF). An unacceptable health risk for cancer will be considered to be
      more than one additional case of cancer per one million people exposed
      (10-6 risk level). Water quality standards or criteria used to calculate
      water quality-based effluent limitations (and for all other purposes of
      water quality criteria under Section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act) to
      protect human health through the different exposure routes are determined
      as follows:

      (1)    Fish tissue consumption:


             WQC = (Risk) x Body Weight / (CPF x (FCR x BCF))


             where: WQC = water quality criterion
             Risk = risk factor (10)
             CPF = cancer potency factor
             FCR = fish consumption rate (17.5 gm/person-day)
             BCF = bioconcentration factor

      BCF values are based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
      publications pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Clean Water Act. FCR
      values are average consumption rates for a 70 kg adult for a lifetime of the
      population; alternative FCR values may be used when it is considered
      necessary to protect localized populations which may be consuming fish at
      a higher rate.

      (2)    Water consumption (including a correction for fish consumption):


             WQC = Risk x Body Weight / (CPF x (WCR + (FCR x BCF)))


             where: WQC = water quality criterion
             Risk = risk factor (10)
             CPF = cancer potency factor
             FCR = fish consumption rate (17.5 gm/person-day)
             BCF = bioconcentration factor
             WCR = water consumption rate (assumed to be 2 liters/day for
             adults)

      The equations listed in this subparagraph will be used to develop water
      criteria or standards on a case-by-case basis for toxic substances that are
