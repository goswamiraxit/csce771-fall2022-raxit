                    EXHIBIT B to Chapter 1, Subchapters 1 and 2
             DISINFECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR SANITARY SEWAGE

I.     DISCHARGE TO WATERS CLASSIFIED PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY.

Disinfection shall be required regardless of the quantity of receiving water for discharges to or
within close proximity, both in distance and travel time, to public water supply waters.

II. DISCHARGES TO WATERS CLASSIFIED RECREATION AND TO
WATERS OF OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS WITH KNOWN RECREATIONAL SITES.

Disinfection shall be required regardless of the quantity of receiving water.

III.   DISCHARGES TO WATERS CLASSIFIED SHELLFISH HARVESTING.

1.     Disinfection shall be required for discharges to or within one tidal cycle of approved or
conditionally approved shellfish harvesting areas.

2.     Disinfection shall be required for discharges within close proximity to closed shellfish
harvesting areas, if, after mixing at the most unfavorable hydrographic and pollutional
conditions, the geometric mean concentration of fecal coliform is expected to exceed 14 colonies
per 100 ml.

IV.    DISCHARGES TO WATERS CLASSIFIED FISH AND WILDLIFE.

1.      Disinfection shall be required for discharges to or within close proximity, both in distance
and/or travel time, to waters with known recreational sites regardless of the quantity of receiving
water.

2.     Disinfection shall be required for discharges to or within close proximity to public water
supply waters, if, after mixing at the most unfavorable hydrographic and pollutional conditions
(normally the 7Q10 low flow), the geometric mean concentration of fecal coliform is expected to
exceed 200 colonies per 100 ml.

3.      Disinfection shall be required for discharges to or within close proximity to fish and
wildlife waters, if, after mixing at the most unfavorable hydrographic and pollutional conditions
(normally the 7Q10 low flow), the geometric mean concentration of fecal coliform is expected to
exceed 200 colonies per 100 ml during May through October and 2000 colonies per 100 ml from
November through April.

V.     DISCHARGES TO WATERS CLASSIFIED EPHEMERAL.

Disinfection shall be required where the probability of a public health hazard or other
circumstances so warrant.

VI.    CONSISTENCY WITH WATER QUALITY STANDARDS
