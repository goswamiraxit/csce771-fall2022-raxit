      (2)   Within 30 days after the final construction observation performed by the
            Department, the loan recipient must submit: the final payment request; summary
            change order(s), if applicable, for all construction contracts; a complete set of
            record drawings for any and all other new construction work requiring design by a
            registered engineer and, if applicable, a certification from the engineer, or other
            qualified personnel when applicable, that the project has been constructed
            substantially in accordance with the design; final construction phase services
            contract amendments, if any; and all other administrative forms and documents
            required by the loan agreement and the Department. Payment requests
            submitted after this date are not allowable, regardless of when the costs were
            incurred.

      (3)   Any other submittals or actions required by the loan agreement must be
            performed when so required and are subject to review and approval by the
            Department.

      (4)   Following receipt of the final payment request from the loan recipient, or upon
            expiration of the deadline established in Rule 5.3.D.(2) above, the
            Department or other designated parties may perform an audit of
            the WPCELF loan project for the purpose of determining
            compliance with the WPCELF loan agreement and to determine final allowable
            costs, payments made to date, and any additional payments due the loan recipient
            or repayment due the Department.

      (5)   Upon completion of the WPCELF audit, or if an audit is not performed, following
            expiration of the deadline established in Rule 5.3.D.(2) above, the
            Department will transmit to the loan recipient a copy of the
            audit, if performed, a final determination of allowable
            costs and payments due the loan recipient or repayments
            due the state, and a final loan agreement. The final determination will
            establish a 30-day appeal deadline, as required by Rule 5.3.D.(6)
            below, and will require repayment of any overpayment with
            an interest penalty to begin accruing on the appeal deadline. The
            interest penalty will be as established in Rule 5.3.E.(6) of these
            regulations.

(6)         Within 30 days after the date of the above final determination of allowable costs,
            the loan recipient may submit a written appeal of the final determination including
            a written justification of the reason for the appeal, and supporting documentation
            for any disputed costs of the final determination; otherwise, the final
            determination of allowable costs will become the final allowable costs for
            purposes of WPCELF loan payments and the WPCELF loan repayment
            agreement.


(7)         Should an appeal be submitted in accordance with Rule 5.3.D.(6)
