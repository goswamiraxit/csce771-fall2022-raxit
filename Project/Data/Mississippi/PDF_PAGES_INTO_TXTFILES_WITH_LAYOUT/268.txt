                              SRF Procurement Protest Procedures

This Appendix sets forth the process for the resolution of procurement protests filed with the
loan recipient by an adversely affected party.

       (a)     Prior to advertisement for such awards, the loan recipient shall establish its own
               procedures for prompt consideration of initial protests concerning solicitations or
               subagreement awards. A "protest" is a written complaint concerning the
               recipient's solicitation or award of a subagreement. It must be filed with the
               recipient by a party with a direct financial interest adversely affected by a
               recipient's procurement action, and must be filed in accordance with and within
               the time frame established by the recipient's protest procedures.

       (b)     Any party which transmits any document concerning the protest during the course
               of a protest and protest resolution must simultaneously furnish all other affected
               parties and the Department with a copy of all documents in the transmittal.

       (c)     Upon receipt of a protest, the loan recipient must make a determination on the
               protest in accordance with the recipient’s protest procedures within thirty (30)
               days after such receipt, or sooner if so required by the recipient’s procurement
               protest procedures.

       (d)     The party with a direct financial interest adversely affected by a loan recipient’s
               determination of the protest may appeal such a determination only through the
               appropriate court of competent jurisdiction, provided such appeal is initiated
               within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of determination.

       (e)     Any delay due to a protest or protest resolution will not relieve the loan recipient
               of the requirement to meet the project schedule established in the loan agreement,
               nor will such delays prevent the Department from pursuing the remedies for
               default established in the loan agreement.
