                         disposal of the sludge, shall apply to the Permit Board for a State
                         permit.

     (3)   Both existing and proposed discharges and/or existing and proposed facilities
           from which no discharge occurs shall be subject to the permit application and
           special NPDES Program requirements contained in 40 CFR 122.21-.37 as of the
           date the permit is issued, which requirements are incorporated herein and adopted

C.   Permits: Preliminary Determinations and Siting Criteria

     (1)   Preliminary Determinations

           (a)    (1)    The Permit Board shall strive to minimize the number of permits
                         issued by encouraging the consolidation (regionalization) of
                         separate treatment facilities where technically and economically
                         feasible.

                  (2)    When an existing wastewater disposal system is available, no
                         permit shall be issued for a new wastewater treatment facility,
                         unless the permit applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of
                         the Permit Board that the wastewater cannot or should not, because
                         of economic or other reasons, be connected to the existing sewage
                         system.

                  (3)    Existing wastewater systems treating municipal or domestic wastes
                         shall cease discharge and connect to a regional, municipal or other
                         available sewage system when such system becomes available.
                         The Permit Board, in its discretion, may exclude non-compatible
                         industrial wastes.

           (b)    New connections to an existing wastewater collection and treatment
                  system will not be considered unless the existing system is in substantial
                  compliance with permit conditions.

           (c)    No permit for the construction or operation of a wastewater treatment
                  facility shall be issued unless the applicant can demonstrate to the
                  satisfaction of the Permit Board that a qualified operator will be made
                  available to operate and maintain the facility.

           (d)    All wastewater treatment facilities must be inaccessible to the general
                  public and be identified as a waste treatment facility by signs posted in a
                  reasonable manner.

           (e)    The Permit Board may deny a permit if it determines that the discharge
                  from the proposed facility will adversely affect use of the receiving

                                          19
