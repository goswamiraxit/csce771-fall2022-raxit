ANTIDEGRADATION INSTRUCTION FORM
FOR NEW/EXPANDING DISCHARGES TO TIER 2 WATERS
Individual Permits

Project Information

The information in this section is not required again if it has already been provided with
the NPDES permit application or request for coverage under a general permit.

      •   Name of project
      •   Location of project (map showing proposed discharge point and location of treatment
          facility)
      •   Proposed treatment type
      •   Proposed influent constituents
      •   Proposed design flow
      •   Name of discharge stream
      •   Latitude and Longitude of discharge point if available
      •   Contact information for permit applicant
      •   Is the applicant seeking coverage under a general permit for this discharge?

Alternatives Analysis

The demonstration should include, but not be limited to, consideration of the alternatives listed
below:

(1)       a centralized no discharge system;
(2)       connection to an existing wastewater treatment facility;
(3)       an alternative discharge point; and
(4)       product or raw material substitution.

Alternatives may also consider:
(5)     other treatment options which would reduce the predicted impact to the stream;
(6)     improved operation and maintenance of existing treatment operations;
(7)     seasonal or controlled discharge options to avoid critical conditions; and
(8)     pollution prevention, increased efficiency, water conservation, recycle or reuse
alternatives.


The applicant should consider if the alternative is technically feasible. If it is technically
feasible, then the applicant must consider if it is economically feasible. If the alternative is
economically feasible, then degradation of the stream may not occur. If the alternative is not
feasible, then the next alternative should be considered. Documentation is required for all
technical and economic feasibility considerations.
