            (5)     Develop acute, chronic, and human health tables listing parameters, Xw, Xwa, Xta,
                    and appropriate criteria.
                                              (Q * X r ) + (Qw * X w )
                                         Xt = r
                                                    Qr + Qw
Where: IWC = Instream Wastewater Concentration (where facility water supply is not
        receiving water)
Qw      = maximum 30-day average wastewater flow, if available
Qr      = receiving stream flow
Xr      = receiving stream concentration
Xw      = historical effluent data
Xwa     = permit limits from previous permit or from effluent guidelines
Xta     = the calculated instream concentration based on existing permit limits or the calculated
limit based on current effluent guidelines
Xt      = the calculated instream concentration based on historical effluent data from application

If IWC is < one percent, do not develop the chronic table.

If Qr = 0 then Xt = Xw * IWC/100

NOTE:               To calculate Xta substitute Xwa for Xw Xwa = Permit Limit

Where:              Number of samples is >12 & 7Q10 is >0 then;

            TABLE                      Xw 5, 6                         Qr                     Xr7
    Acute                       Maximum                         7Q10                Instream Background

                                Concentration                                       Concentration

The appropriate criteria to use in each table are as follows:
  IWC                   Acute                              Chronic                           Human Health
 >1%     Compare Xt and Xta to Acute          Compare Xt and Xta to Chronic                  TSD
         Water Quality Criterion Value Water Quality Criterion Value
 <1%     Same as above                        Do Not Compare                                 Same as above

    from 2C application and/or other appropriate data sources

6
  if number of samples is <12 then Xw = (appropriate concentration * 10). The permittee may request utilization of
alternative methods for determining reasonable potential set forth in the Technical Support Document for Water
Quality-Based Toxics Control (EPA/505/2-90-001) or its amendments (TSD), subject to prior Permit Board review
and approval of the method's implementation.
7
    if no instream background concentration exists Xr = 0
