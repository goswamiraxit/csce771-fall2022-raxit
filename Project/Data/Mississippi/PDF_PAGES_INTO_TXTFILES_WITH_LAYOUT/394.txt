              recipients through submission of monthly repayments, in accordance with state

       (4)    The repayment interest rate and the frequency of interest compounding will be as
              established in the IUP under which the project is funded.

J.     Administrative Fee.

       An administrative fee in the amount of five percent (5%) of the final loan principal
       amount will be collected from the loan repayment amounts to defray the costs of
       administering the WPCRLF program. Beginning with the initiation of the repayment
       process and until such time that the total administrative fee is collected, the interest
       portion of each repayment will not be charged, and, in lieu of the interest portion, an
       equal amount of the repayment will be collected as the administrative fee.
