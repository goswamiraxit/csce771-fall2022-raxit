consider available alternatives and socio-economic issues. Public notice of proposed general
permit coverage is accomplished by website notification.

Final Action

At the completion of the public review / input process, any comments received will be reviewed
and considered to determine if changes should be made to the proposed discharge permit.
Significant changes may require an update to the antidegradation report for the project and/or an
additional public notice.
