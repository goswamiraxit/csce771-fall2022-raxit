     (13)    Section 218, which assures that treatment systems are cost-effective and requires
            that projects of over $10 million include a value-engineering review (40 CFR
            35.2030(b)(3): Cost Effectiveness, Facilities Planning, and 35.2114:Value
            Engineering); except that the provisions of Rule 4.3.B.(2) of this regulation

            projects receiving Title II grants (40 CFR 35.2113: Environmental Review). The

            locality by the U.S. Department of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (Section
            513, applies 40 U.S.C. 276, et seq.).
