Calculation of Average Flow Rate:


                             [( A * xC * XRO ) + ( A2 * C 2 * RO ) + ( A3 * C3 * RO )...]
                     AFR =
                                                        TO
Where:
AFR = Average Flow Rate in cu. ft./min
A      = Area in acres
C      = Runoff Coefficient
Rx     = Runoff for area
TO     = Total Runoff
