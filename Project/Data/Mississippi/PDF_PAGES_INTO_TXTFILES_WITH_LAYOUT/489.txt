X.   Expected Environmental Outcomes and Performance Measures

     The objective of this program is to disperse all loan funds available in a timely manner in
     order to achieve the intended cost-effective environmental protection benefits, and to ensure
     compliance with loan agreements, as required by state and federal laws and regulations.

     The State agrees to complete a one-page worksheet for all binding commitments (final loan
     agreement). The State will also provide copies of the completed worksheets upon EPAâ€™s
     request in order to demonstrate compliance with the EPA Order 5700.7.
