PART 2 – Additional Federal Requirements for Fiscal Year 2016 and After

I. Introduction

The Water Resources Reform and Development Act, 2014 (WRRDA), which was passed by
Congress and signed into law by the President on June 10, 2014, included amendments to the
Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program authorized by Title VI of the Federal
Clean Water Act. Those amendments, along with the exhaustion of “banked equivalency/cross-
cutter compliance,” utilized by the Water Pollution Control Revolving Loan Fund (WPCRLF)
Program since FY-2001, required significant changes to the WPCRLF Program for loans
awarded October 1, 2014, and after. Some of those changes were implemented in FY-2015 as
required, and the remaining requirements were implemented in FY-2016. Additional optional
WRRDA-related changes will be considered for implementation in future fiscal years.

II. Supplemental Guidance

To assist in complying with the new requirements, MDEQ has prepared a supplemental guidance
document to be used in conjunction with the previously existing WPCRLF Regulations and
checklist/guidance. The document is entitled, “GUIDANCE FOR WATER POLLUTION
CONTROL REVOLVING LOAN FUND PROJECTS FUNDED BEGINNING FEDERAL FY
2016 (OCTOBER 1, 2015 AND AFTER),” is dated December 11, 2015, and is available for
viewing/downloading on MDEQ’s WPCRLF Program webpage by going to www.mdeq.ms.gov,
then under “For Government,” follow the links for “Grants, Loans, Trust Funds” then “Water
Pollution Control (Clean Water) Revolving Fund Loan Program.”
