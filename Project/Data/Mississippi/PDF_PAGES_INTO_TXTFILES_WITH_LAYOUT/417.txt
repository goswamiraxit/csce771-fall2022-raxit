                                    Waste, Fraud and Abuse

The loan recipient is responsible for preventing, detecting, and prosecuting waste, fraud, abuse,
and all other corrupt practices which occur in relation to the WPCRLF loan project.
If the loan recipient becomes aware of any allegation, evidence, or the appearance of corrupt
practices, the loan recipient must:

       (1)    Immediately inform the Department in writing.

       (2)    Promptly pursue available state and local legal, administrative, and contractual
              remedies.

The Department may disallow costs under the WPCRLF loan agreement when the costs are
determined to be related to waste, fraud, abuse or other corrupt practices. The Department may
also require repayment of WPCRLF loan funds paid for such costs in accordance with Rule
7.3.H.(6) of these regulations.
