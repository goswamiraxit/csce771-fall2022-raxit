Where:
CSSA = Chemical Specific Screening Acute
CSSC = Chemical Specific Screening Chronic
WET = Whole Effluent Toxicity Data
CSL = Chemical Specific Limits= WQS/(IWC/100)
WETL = Whole Effluent Toxicity Limits W/Monitoring
WETM = Whole Effluent Toxicity Monitoring Only
YesA = Yes/Acute WET Limit = LC50 = 3 * IWC
YesC = Yes/Chronic WET Limit = IC25 = IWC
N/A = Not Applicable
YAM = Yes, Acute WET Monitoring Only
YCM    = Yes, Chronic Monitoring Only
Pass = Acute: LC50 > 3 * IWC
       = Chronic: IC25 > IWC
Fail = Acute: LC50 < 3 * IWC
       = Chronic IC25 < IWC

Human health shall be evaluated in accordance with "USEPA, Technical Support Document".
When a parameter violates the human health criteria either for "water and organisms" or
"organisms only", as appropriate, numerical limitations shall be placed in the permit.

F.       Screening Storm Water Discharges

         (1)      General

 Where application form data are reported as "less than" (<) compare the method detection limit (MDL) as defined
in Appendix B of 40 CFR 136 which is incorporated herein and adopted by reference. MDLs will be utilized in
determining the reasonable potential of a given pollutant to violate water quality criteria. If a pollutant is reported as
"non-detectable" above the MDLs as defined in Appendix B of 40 CFR 136, the pollutant will be assumed to be
present at that reported level of sensitivity.
