                           any available wasteload allocation for the discharge
                           prepared by the State and approved by EPA pursuant to 40
                           CFR 130.7.

      (b)   Attain or maintain a specified water quality through water quality related
            effluent limits established under section 302 of the Federal Act;

      (c)   Conform to the conditions of a State certification under section 401 of the
            Federal Act that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 124.53 when EPA is
            the permitting authority. If a State certification is stayed by a court of
            competent jurisdiction or an appropriate State board or agency, EPA shall

            finally effective State certification is received within sixty days from the
            date of the notice. If the State does not forward a finally effective
            certification within the sixty day period, EPA shall include conditions in
            the permit that may be necessary to meet EPA's obligation under section
            301(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Act;

      (d)   Conform to applicable water quality requirements under Section 401(a)(2)

            schedule of compliance requirements established under federal or State
            law or regulations in accordance with section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Federal
            Act;

      (f)   Ensure consistency with the requirements of a Water Quality Management

      (i)   Incorporate any other appropriate requirements, conditions, or limitations
            (other than effluent limitations) into a new source permit to the extent
            allowed by the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et
            seq. and Section 511 of the Federal Act, when EPA is the permit issuing
            authority. (See 40 CFR 122.29(c)).
