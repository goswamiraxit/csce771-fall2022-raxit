Waters that meet the Public Water Supply criteria shall also be suitable for secondary contact
recreation. Secondary contact recreation is defined as incidental contact with the water during
activities such as wading, fishing, and boating, that are not likely to result in full body immersion.
In considering the acceptability of a proposed site for disposal of bacteria latent wastewater in or
near waters with the public water supply classification, the Permit Board shall consider the relative
proximity of the discharge to water supply intakes.
