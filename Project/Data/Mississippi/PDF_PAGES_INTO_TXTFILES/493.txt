Executive Order 11246-Equal Employment Opportunity (Cross-Cutter):
In order to ensure compliance with this executive order, all WPCRLF-funded
construction contracts must include MDEQ’s “Supplementary Information for Bidders”

Davis Bacon Prevailing Wage Rates (WRRDA Section 5002)
The Davis Bacon (DB) requirements [as referenced in Section 513 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1372)] now apply to all treatment works projects
constructed in whole or in part with WPCRLF funds. These are effectively the same
requirements applied to FY-2012 through FY-2015 WPCRLF projects based on EPA’s
interpretation of the FY-2012 CWSRF appropriations language. WRRDA reaffirmed
that the DB requirements are applicable for all future WPCRLF projects. Specific
details regarding compliance with these requirements are outlined in MDEQ’s
“Supplemental General Condition” dated August 13, 2013, which must be included in
all WPCRLF-funded construction contracts.

L.

American Iron and Steel (WRRDA Section 5004):
The American Iron and Steel (AIS) requirement now applies to all contracts associated
with projects funded in whole or in part with WPCRLF funds. This is effectively the
same requirement applied to FY-2014 WPCRLF projects by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). WRRDA made this AIS requirement
applicable for all future WPCRLF projects. For details on what “Iron and Steel”
products are covered by this requirement, see the AIS guidance memorandum entitled
“Implementation of American Iron and Steel provisions of P.L. 113-76, Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2014” issued by EPA Headquarters on March 20, 2014. The
information provided therein should be helpful to Loan Recipients and Consultants in
crafting bidding documents and ensuring compliance for a given project. Also, specific
details regarding compliance with this requirement are provided in MDEQ’s “Guidance
For Water Pollution Control Revolving Loan Fund Projects Funded Beginning Federal
FY 2016 (October 1, 2015 and After).”

Federal Procurement for Engineering Services (WRRDA Section 5002):

All WPCRLF-funded contracts for program management, construction management,
feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, design, engineering, surveying, mapping, or
architectural related services must now be negotiated in the same manner as a contract
for architectural and engineering services is negotiated under 40 U.S.C. 1101 et seq. A
corresponding Procurement Certification must be submitted with the loan application.
