APPENDIX G
SRF Disputes Procedures
Only SRF loan recipients may submit a notice of dispute (disagreement) with a decision made by
the Department, with the exception of that allowed by the resolution of adverse comments
procedures included within the environmental review process of Appendix C. The following
procedures will be used to resolve disputes between the loan recipient and the Department:
a.

The loan recipient must submit a written notice of dispute with a Department
decision, including a summary of the dispute and reasons for why the loan
recipient believes the Department decision should be reversed.

b.

The Department staff will then render a written decision on the dispute and will
include reasons for the decision.

c.

Should the loan recipient desire to appeal the Department staff decision, a request
for an informal hearing must be received by the Department within 30 days after
the date of the Department staff decision. Upon receipt of such a request, an
informal hearing will be held with staff members, as designated by the Head of
the Office of Pollution Control, and the affected parties. The Office Head, or his
designee, will render a decision on the appeal as a result of the informal hearing.

d.

Should the loan recipient desire to appeal the above informal hearing decision, a
request for a formal hearing before the Commission on Environmental Quality
must be received by the Department within 30 days after the date of such
decision. Upon receipt of such a request, the Commission on Environmental
Quality will hold a formal hearing to consider the matter, and will render a
decision.

e.

Appeals of the above formal hearing decision may be made to the Chancery Court
in accordance with state law.
