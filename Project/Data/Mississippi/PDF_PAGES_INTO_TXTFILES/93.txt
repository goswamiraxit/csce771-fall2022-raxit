Calculate Permit Limits. Using the flows determined under Rule
1.2.6.F.2.b and the Mississippi, or EPA (when there is no State
criteria) Water Quality Criteria for Toxic Pollutants, calculate
maximum allowable concentrations in the storm water runoff for
all parameters of concern. Since the acute water quality criteria are
based on 96 hours exposure and the EPA storm water sampling
protocol requires first 30 minutes of grab and 3 hours of composite
samples during a storm after 72 hours of dry weather, only the
acute criterion will be used to establish permit limits. Also, the
average storm event duration in Mississippi is about 8 hours.

Calculation:

PL = CMC *

QI + QS
QI

Where:
PL
= Permit Limit
CMC = Criteria Maximum Concentration (Acute)
QI
= Flow from industry
QS
= Flow from stream
When the model or calculated limit is higher than the maximum concentration reported
on the 2F application, the permit will generally only require monitoring.

Best Professional Judgment

When there are no ELG or WQS numeric limitations or standards, BPJ will be used to set permit
limits or to require Best Management Practices (BMPs) to protect water quality.

Determining Compliance with Non-Detect or Below Detection Limitations.

It is recognized that the calculated limits for specific chemicals may be below the analytical
minimum quantitation level for the pollutant of concern. However, in this case the permit limit
will be this calculated value. In such cases, compliance with the permit limits shall be
determined as follows:
(1)

The permit will specify the analytical procedure to be used.
