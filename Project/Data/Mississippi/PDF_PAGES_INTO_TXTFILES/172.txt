TABLE 2 Notes
a

The CMC = 1/[(f1/CMC1) + (f2/CMC2)] where f1 and f2 are the fractions of total selenium
that are treated as selenite and selenate, respectively, and CMC1 and CMC2 are 185.9 µg/l
and 12.83 µg/l. The value in the table is calculated assuming a worst case scenario in
which all selenium is present as selenate.

b

Hardness dependent parameter. Criteria are indicated at hardness of 50 mg/l as CaCO3.
Equations for criteria calculation of hardness dependent parameters can be found in Quality
Criteria for Water. The equation is applicable for instream hardness ranges from 25 mg/l
to 400 mg/l. If instream hardness is less than 25 mg/l, then a hardness value of 25 mg/l
should be used to calculate the criteria. If instream hardness is greater than 400 mg/l, then
a hardness of 400 mg/l should be used to calculate the criteria.

c

Criteria for pentachlorophenol are based on a pH dependent equation as found in Quality
Criteria for Water. Values listed are for a pH of 7.0 s.u.

d

Site specific criteria for Mississippi Sound.

e

Parameter subject to water effects ratio equations where:
CMC = WER * Acute
CCC = WER * Chronic

f

Ammonia criteria are dependent on pH, temperature, and/or salinity. See Section II.10.C.

g

Expressed as µg free cyanide (as CN)/L.

h

Refers to the inorganic form only.

i

Applies to the sum of  and  isomers.

j

Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry numbers, which provide a unique identification
for each chemical.

k

This criterion applies to total PCBs (e.g., the sum of all congener or all isomer or homolog
or Aroclor analyses).
