The applicant must complete the Calculation of Total Annualized Project Costs worksheet for
each technically feasible alternative considered. Then the Total Annualized Project Cost for
each alternative must be compared to the chosen alternative. Those alternatives that have a Total
Annualized Project Cost less than 110% of the chosen alternative are considered economically
feasible.
Social and Economic Impact Analysis
All applicants for a new or expanded discharge must demonstrate that the proposed discharge is
necessary for important economic or social development in the area. This section is not
applicable if a non-degrading alternative such as a no discharge system or connection to an
existing treatment facility has been selected.
Socio-economic or environmental / public health issues which would justify the proposed
discharge may include:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

employment (increasing production and jobs, maintaining, or avoiding reduction in
employment);
improved community tax base; and
correction of an environmental or public health problem; and
provide a social benefit to the community.

The applicant should estimate the number of new jobs (both direct and indirect jobs) created as a
result of the project. Documentation should also predict the effect of the new jobs on the local
and state tax base – i.e. tax revenues expected to be gained by local and state governments and/or
any other economic benefits.
The permit applicant should document any existing environmental or public health problem, as
well as the expected effect of the proposed project on the existing problem.
For example, a description of the environmental benefits from a proposed wastewater treatment
plant which will take failing septic tanks offline.
Others – Please list and describe.
MDEQ may require additional documentation and calculations or require consideration of
other alternatives as necessary to justify the proposed degradation.
