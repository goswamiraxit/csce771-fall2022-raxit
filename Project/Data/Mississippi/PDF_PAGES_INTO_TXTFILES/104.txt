Final ammonia allocations will be reported as ammonia nitrogen.
NH3-N = NH3 x 0.822

CONVENTIONAL WATER QUALITY MODELS

The Department's freshwater quality model is a steady-state modified Streeter-Phelps dissolved
oxygen sag model. The model includes the stream's carbonaceous and nitrogenous BOD
ultimate demand, the stream's reaeration rate, the net photosynthetic demand and production, and
the benthic oxygen demand. The model was developed in 1973 by the staff of the Civil
Engineering Department at Mississippi State University. The STREAM model was updated by
MSU in 2004 to work in a java and oracle computer environment. The model is used for both
empirical and calibration purposes.
For salt water modeling, nutrient modeling, and highly complex hydrology, the Department will
use a combination of the Environmental Fluids Dynamic Code EFDC model for the hydrology
and the WASP model. Both of these models are supported by EPA and are accessible in the
public domain.
The Department may utilize other models and/or documents which are approved by both the
Department and EPA, are scientifically defensible and/or have been duly promulgated through
the Federal Administrative Procedure Act.
