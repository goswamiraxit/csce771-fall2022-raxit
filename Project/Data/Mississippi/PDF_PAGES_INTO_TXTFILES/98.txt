E.

Depth

Depth will be used if accurate stream depth profiles are available as determined by measurement
or available flood plain maps. For larger, slow-moving rivers, depths may also be estimated. In
the WASP models, minimum depth will be one-half of the estimated or measured depth.
F.

Slope

1.
Stream slope determinations will be made from GIS computer software, NHD Plus
values, USGS quad maps, or flood plain reports.
2.
Stream slope profiles will be analyzed (elevation vs. mile) to determine if the slope
changes along the stream length being modeled.
3.

Model stream segments will correspond to noticeable stream slope changes.

G.

Kd (Carbonaceous Deoxygenation Rate)

1.
When usable field data are not available, the stream's Kd rate will be based on both the
type of wastewater, type of treatment and/or the instream CBODu concentration.
2.

The temperature correction equation is:

Kd (T ) = Kd (20 C) *1.047 T −20
3.
When instream CBODu values approach background conditions the Kd rate will be set to
0.15/day and the ratio of Ka/Kd = 2 or Ka = 0.3/day.
4.
When actual data are available, the Kd rate will be determined according to the
procedures outlined in Rates, Constants, and Kinetics Formulations in Surface Water Quality
Modeling (Second Edition), EPA/600/3-85/040 or most current version.
5.
Kd is assumed equal to Kr (overall rate of CBODu removal from the water column) in
most model applications.
6.
Normally, a laboratory-derived “bottled” CBODu decay rate taken from the effluent only
(Kl) will not be used in modeling. Typically, an instream decay rate will be used for modeling
purposes.
7.
Kd = 0.3/day (base e) at 20°C will be used for streams receiving upgraded lagoon
effluent (single or multi-cell lagoons upgraded with sand filters, artificial wetlands, etc.).
8.

The following clarification can be used in the estimation procedure for Kd, CBODu rate.
