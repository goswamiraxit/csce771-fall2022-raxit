Cost of royalties for the use of, or rights in, a patented process or product.
Royalties associated with the procurement of the right to use, or the rights
in, a patented product, apparatus, or process are allowable costs, provided
that they are based on a published fee schedule or on reasonable fees
charged to other users under similar conditions.

(e)

Buildings
Allowable costs for buildings include those portions of the buildings
which are directly related to the project, including buildings housing
equipment and unit processes, laboratories; employee locker rooms;
workshop areas, storage facilities for operational supplies, spare parts and
equipment; necessary lavatory facilities, operator office space; etc. Those
portions of an administration building which are not necessary for the
daily operation and maintenance of the project are unallowable costs,
including portions of the building used for public works functions (other
than wastewater treatment), general accounting functions, conference
rooms with associated audio-visual equipment, or other general uses not
necessary for the operation of the project. Where larger facilities include
conference rooms to be used exclusively for training of employees, such
space is allowable if reasonable and if approved by the Department as part
of the loan award.
Where unallowable building space is included in an otherwise allowable
administration building, the allowable cost is determined by using the ratio
of allowable floor space divided by the total floor space in the building.
The costs of buildings and portions of buildings which are unallowable are
to be deducted from the allowable project construction costs for loan
computation purposes. Costs associated with unallowable buildings and
portions of buildings (e.g., landscaping, driveways, parking spaces,
electrical service, and other utility costs) are also unallowable and must be
deducted proportionately from the allowable construction costs.

(f)

Facilities For Income Generation from Processed Sludges and Crops
Facilities which have the potential for generating project income to offset
O&M costs are allowable if they are necessary to provide stabilized and
processed sludges which are to be managed for income generation or
crops which are grown for sale as an integral part of the wastewater land
treatment or sludge utilization process.
Facilities and equipment built for processing crops grown on land to
which sludge or wastewater has been applied may be an allowable cost if
the recipient has all financial interest in the crop and if those facilities are
