Disinfection

1.
Bacteria allocations for effluents will be assigned so as to meet the State's water quality
standards for the designated use of the receiving water. A background coliform concentration of
200#/100 ml will be assumed in fresh water at the low-flow condition, unless site-specific data
taken from an upstream site, approved by the Department, during a low-flow event indicates that
another background level should be used.
2.
Marine waters (recreational salt-waters) will have a background concentration of 35
colonies/100 ml at the low-flow condition, unless site-specific data taken from the water body,
approved by the Department, during a low-flow event indicates that another background level
should be used.
3.

Allocations will be derived according to the following dilution mix equation:

CE =

(CT * QT ) − (CH * QH )
QE

where:
CE
= allowable effluent bacteria concentration in colonies /100ml
QE
= daily average effluent flow in cfs
CH
= headwater bacteria concentration of 200 colonies /100ml
QH
= headwater flow (7Q10) in cfs
CT
= bacteria standard after mixing (usually 200 colonies /100ml May through October or
2000 col/100ml November through April)
QT
= total stream flow after mixing in cfs
4.

Disinfection may be required for hydrograph controlled release (HCR) lagoons.

Chlorine Toxicity

Residual chlorine allocations for all municipal and industrial effluents will be developed so as to
meet the State's water quality criteria. To properly select the final in-stream target concentration,
the type of receiving water (fresh or estuarine) and the IWC* (instream waste concentration)
must be known. Once this information is known, allocations will be determined using the
following dilution mix equation:

CE =

(CT * QT ) − (CH * QH )
QE

where:
CE
= allowable effluent chlorine concentration in ug/l
QE
= daily average effluent flow in cfs
CH
= headwater chlorine concentration (usually 0.0 ug/l)
QH
= headwater flow (7Q10) in cfs
CT
= chlorine standard in ug/l (after mixing)
