Develop acute, chronic, and human health tables listing parameters, Xw, Xwa, Xta,
and appropriate criteria.
(Q * X r ) + (Qw * X w )
Xt = r
Qr + Qw

Where: IWC = Instream Wastewater Concentration (where facility water supply is not
receiving water)
Qw
= maximum 30-day average wastewater flow, if available
Qr
= receiving stream flow
Xr
= receiving stream concentration
Xw
= historical effluent data
Xwa
= permit limits from previous permit or from effluent guidelines
Xta
= the calculated instream concentration based on existing permit limits or the calculated
limit based on current effluent guidelines
Xt
= the calculated instream concentration based on historical effluent data from application
If IWC is < one percent, do not develop the chronic table.
If Qr = 0 then Xt = Xw * IWC/100
NOTE:

To calculate Xta substitute Xwa for Xw Xwa = Permit Limit

Where:

Number of samples is >12 & 7Q10 is >0 then;

if number of samples is <12 then Xw = (appropriate concentration * 10). The permittee may request utilization of
alternative methods for determining reasonable potential set forth in the Technical Support Document for Water
Quality-Based Toxics Control (EPA/505/2-90-001) or its amendments (TSD), subject to prior Permit Board review
and approval of the method's implementation.

if no instream background concentration exists Xr = 0
