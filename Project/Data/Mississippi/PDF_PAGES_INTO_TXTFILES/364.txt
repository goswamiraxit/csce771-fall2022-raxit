APPENDIX I
Procurement Protest Procedures
This Appendix sets forth the process for the resolution of procurement protests filed with the
loan recipient by an adversely affected party. The Loan Recipient’s protest procedures must
include these requirements:
(1)

Prior to advertisement for bids, the loan recipient must establish its own
procedures for prompt consideration of initial protests concerning solicitations or
contract awards. A “protest” is a written complaint concerning the loan
recipient’s solicitation or award of a contract. The protest must be filed with the
loan recipient by a party with a direct financial interest adversely affected by a
loan recipient's procurement action and must be filed in accordance with and
within the time frame established by the loan recipient’s protest procedures.

(2)

Any party which transmits any document concerning the protest during the course
of a protest and protest resolution must simultaneously furnish all other affected
parties with a copy of all documents in the transmittal.

(3)

Upon receipt of a protest, the loan recipient must make a determination on the
protest in accordance with the loan recipient’s protest procedures within thirty
(30) calendar days after such protest or sooner, if so required by the loan
recipient’s procurement protest procedures.

(4)

The party with a direct financial interest adversely affected by a loan recipient’s
determination of the protest may appeal such a determination only through the
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction, provided such appeal is initiated
within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the determination.

(5)

Any delay due to a protest or protest resolution will not relieve the loan recipient
of the requirement to meet the project schedule established in the loan agreement,
nor will such delays prevent the Department from pursuing the remedies for
default established in the loan agreement.
