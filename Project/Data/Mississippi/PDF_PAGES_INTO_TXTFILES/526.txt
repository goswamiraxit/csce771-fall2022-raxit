Listing Change

RULE 9.7 TMDLs SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS
MDEQ has developed a new collaborative framework for implementing the Clean Water Act in
compliance with a new national initiative by EPA. The Priority Framework Process is designed
to help coordinate efforts to advance the effectiveness of the water program. In order to select
priority watersheds MDEQ used landscape information to characterize and rank watersheds by
resource value and potential stressors. This new framework does not change regulation, policy
or issue new mandates. It is intended to provide focus for MDEQâ€™s water programs so as to
better manage the activities and promote collaboration to achieve water quality goals. More
information on the Priority Framework Process can be found here:
http://www.mdeq.ms.gov/water/surface-water/priority-framework/
Table 9 below lists the TMDLs MDEQ has planned for development in 2020 and 2021 based on
resource availability. These TMDLs are also dependent on completion of stressor identifications
for the biological listings included.
