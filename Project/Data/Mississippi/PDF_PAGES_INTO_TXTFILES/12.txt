The “Method Detection Limit (MDL)” is defined as the minimum concentration
of a substance that can be measured and reported with 99% confidence that the
analyte concentration is greater than zero and is determined from analysis of a
sample in a given matrix containing the analyte.

(42)

“Minimum Quantitation Level (MQL)” – is the concentration in a sample that is
equivalent to the concentration of the lowest calibration standard analyzed by a
specific analytical procedure, assuming that all of the method-specified
calculations, sample weights, volumes, and processing steps have been followed,
and also allowing for matrix interference.

"Mitigation" means the following (in order of preference):
(a)

avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or part of an
action;

(b)

minimizing impacts by limiting the degree of magnitude of the action and
its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking
affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

(c)

rectifying the impacts by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
environment;

(d)

reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and
maintenance operations during the life of the action; or

(e)

compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing
