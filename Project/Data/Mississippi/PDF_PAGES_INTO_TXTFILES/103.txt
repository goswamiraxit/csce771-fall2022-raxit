The instream waste concentration (IWC) is the resulting percentage of effluent after complete
mixing with the receiving water body at the headwater flow appropriate to the allocation
procedure, normally the 7Q10. Acute or chronic pollutant target criteria are selected based on the
resulting IWC.
IWC =

QE
*100

For IWC < 1% use acute criteria; For IWC > 1% use chronic criteria.
Q.

Ammonia Toxicity

Ammonia must not only be considered due to its effect on dissolved oxygen in a receiving water,
but also its toxicity potential. It is recognized that effluent ammonia concentrations may be more
restricted due to toxicity than due to oxidation. Consequently, the modeler of conventional
pollutants must consider ammonia toxicity.
Ammonia as nitrogen (NH3-N) allocations for effluents will be developed to meet the water
quality criteria given in Quality Criteria for Water, 1986, EPA 440/5-86-001. Generally,
ammonia limits will be placed in permits of municipal facilities utilizing lagoon type treatment.
To properly select the final in-stream target concentration, the IWC (instream waste
concentration) must be known and the warm water target values used. Stream temperature and
pH after mixing must also be known or assumed. For empirical modeling a pH of 7.0 and a
stream temperature of 25oC are assumed limitations. Once this information is known, allocations
will be determined using the following dilution mix equation:

CE =

(CT * QT ) âˆ’ (CH * QH )
QE

where:
CE
= allowable effluent NH3 concentration in mg/l
QE
= daily average effluent flow in cfs
CH
= headwater ammonia concentration of 0.1 mg/l
QH
= headwater flow (7Q10) in cfs
CT
= ammonia criteria in mg/l (after mixing)
QT
= total stream flow in cfs (after mixing)
