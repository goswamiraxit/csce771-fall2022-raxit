In determining limits for an Individual Storm Water Permit, a distinction
is made between conventional pollutants and priority toxic pollutants (i.e.,
metals, organic chemicals, etc.). For oxygen demanding pollutants the
Storm Water Section, after making preliminary determinations for wet
weather flows, will request a wasteload allocation determination from the
Surface Water Division to establish limits for oxygen demanding
pollutants. For toxics, including metals and organic chemicals, MDEQ
will calculate limits at wet weather flows in two steps as follows:
(1)

Determine stream and facility storm water flow rates:
(i)

for streams with a gaging station, determine the site 7Q2
stream flow by use of the following equation:

Q = Site7Q2 = Gage7Q2 *
Where:
SWA = Site Watershed Area
GWA = Gage Watershed Area

(ii)

SWA
GWA

for small watersheds without a gaging station, measure the
watershed area using GIS computer software applications.
An appropriate runoff coefficient, C, for the entire
watershed region is used. The average storm event
intensity, I, is used. The stream flow rate is calculated as
follows:

QW S = C * I * AW S

Where:
Qws
= flow from the watershed in cfs
Aws
= Area in acres
I
= average storm event intensity in inches per hour
C
= appropriate runoff coefficient
WS
= watershed

(iii)

Storm water flow rate from the industrial site can be
estimated by using the procedure set forth in (ii) above.
The drainage areas (pervious and impervious) are reported
in the application.

QIndustry = I * ((C1 * A1 ) + (C2 * A2 ) + ....)
