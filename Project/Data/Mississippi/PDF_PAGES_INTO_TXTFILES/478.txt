the loan recipient’s political boundaries and to cause the wastewater treatment facility
to meet final effluent limits at the time the collection project is predicted for funding.

Except as allowed in Section IV.E.11, collection sewers will not be funded prior to
funding of the treatment portion of a project necessary to cause the wastewater
treatment facility to meet final effluent limits.

If a project in this category is identified as a high priority BMA project, that project
will be ranked at the beginning of the list within this category.

7.

The seventh category of projects will be the Wastewater Overflow/Bypass
Elimination Projects. The scope of these projects may include only the replacement,
rehabilitation, and/or repair of existing transportation facilities that are necessary to
eliminate documented bypasses and/or overflows of raw sewage from these
transportation facilities for a 2 year, 24-hour rainfall event, as documented in the
facilities plan for the project and approved by the Department.

To be eligible for this category the bypasses and/or overflows documented in the
facilities plan must have been reported, by the deadline for submission of the
facilities plan, to the Department in accordance with the requirements of the loan
applicant’s NPDES permit.

These projects will be ranked in order of the highest receiving stream classification
that will be negatively impacted by the bypass and/or overflow. Receiving stream
classifications will be ranked in the following order:
