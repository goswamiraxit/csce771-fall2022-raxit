1.
In the STREAM Model, sediment oxygen demand ("SOD") (mg/l/day) will be assumed
to be 0.0. In WASP and other dynamic models, SOD rates may be used to calibrate the model.
All values used for SOD rates will be within normal ranges found in the ecoregion being
modeled.
2.
Where SOD rates have been determined or sludge blankets are known to exist, SOD will
be incorporated in models.
3.

SOD rates in g/m2/day will be converted to mg/l/day according to the following equation:
SOD =

B(1000 mg / g )
H (0.3048 meters / ft.) * (1000 liters / meter 3 )

where:
S
= SOD rate in mg/l/day @ 20°C
B
= SOD rate in g/m2/day @ 20°C
H
= average reach depth in feet
M.

Wastewater Inputs

1.
The Department’s water quality model, STREAM uses first order kinetics to characterize
ultimate CBOD decay. Once effluent limits are set using this model, CBOD5 will be determined
for inclusion in the permit.
2.
The following ultimate CBOD to CBOD5 ratios will be used when actual data are not
available.
Wastewater
Sanitary (mechanical secondary)
Sanitary (advanced)
Food Processing
Meat/Poultry Processing
Pulp/Paper
Tannery
Textile

Ratio
1.5
2.3

3.
Industries will be encouraged to provide actual ultimate CBODU and NBODU values for
the wastewater under evaluation. The method of choice for determining these values will be the
method outlined by NCASI in Ultimate Oxygen Demand (Biochemical), NE87-03.
4.
The model uses first order kinetics to characterize oxidizable nitrogen or NBODU decay.
Wastewater inputs/outputs are NH3-N (as nitrogen). The value is converted to oxygen demand
using the factor 4.57.
