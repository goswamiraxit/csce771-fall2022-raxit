APPENDIX F
WPCRLF Loan Recipient/Department Disputes Procedures
Only WPCRLF loan recipients may submit a notice of dispute (disagreement) with a decision
made by the Department, with the exception of decisions regarding Appendix B, State
Environmental Review Process, of these regulations. The following procedures will be used to
resolve disputes between the loan recipient and the Department:
(1)

Within any deadlines established by the Department, the loan recipient must
submit a written notice of dispute with a Department decision, including a
summary of the dispute and reasons the loan recipient believes the Department
decision should be reversed.

(2)

The Department staff will then render a written decision on the dispute and will
include reasons for the decision.

(3)

Should the loan recipient desire to appeal the Department staff decision, a request
for an informal hearing must be received by the Department within 30 days after
the date of the Department staff decision. Upon receipt of such a request, an
informal hearing will be held with staff members, as designated by the Executive
Director, and the affected parties. The Executive Director will render a decision
on the appeal as a result of the informal hearing.

(4)

Should the loan recipient desire to appeal the above informal hearing decision, a
request for a formal hearing before the Commission must be received by the
Department within 30 days after the date of such decision. Upon receipt of such a
request, the Commission will hold a formal hearing to consider the matter and
will render a decision.

(5)

Appeals of the above formal hearing decision may be made to the Chancery Court
in accordance with state law.
