Rule 7.1 Introductory Provisions.
A.

Scope of Regulations. These regulations, adopted pursuant to Sections 49-17-81 through
89, Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended, shall govern the Mississippi Water Pollution
Control Revolving Loan Fund (WPCRLF) Program. These WPCRLF regulations may be
superceded by the WPCRLF loan agreement when such a variance is determined prudent
by the Executive Director and when not in conflict with any state or federal law,
regulation, or executive order.

B.

Federal Equivalence and Cross-Cutter Requirements. Federal regulation 40 CFR
35.3135(f) requires that “equivalency” projects funded under the State Water Pollution
Control Revolving Fund must comply with sixteen specific requirements of Title II (the
EPA Construction Grants Program) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
“Equivalency” projects are generally defined as wastewater projects constructed with
funds which equal the amount of the federal grants to the State for this program.
