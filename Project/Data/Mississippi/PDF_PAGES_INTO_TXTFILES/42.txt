(a)

(b)

For facilities which have bulk storage of materials (including but not
limited to, all raw, finished and/or waste material), the permit shall contain
terms and conditions necessary to prevent the potential release of these
materials and storm water contaminated with these materials. Such
requirements may include the requirements for a Spill Prevention Control
and Countermeasures Plan or a Best Management Plan.
For those
facilities that have above ground bulk storage not subject to Hazardous
Waste Management Regulations or 40 CFR 112 (Oil Pollution Prevention)
regulations, secondary containment or equivalent protective measures
must be provided for storage of materials and/or liquids with chronic or
acute potential for pollution impact on waters of the State regardless of
whether it is a raw material, product, waste, or by-product. Secondary
containment requirements as found in 40 CFR 112 (for petroleum
products), which is incorporated herein and adopted by reference, shall be
utilized for these non-petroleum facilities unless an equivalent amount of
protection may be provided by measures including trenches or waterways
which would conduct any tank releases to a permitted treatment system or
sufficient equalization or treatment capacity needed to prevent
chronic/acute pollution impact.
Tank Systems with High Potential for Pollution Impact.
The Permit Board may require permits to contain secondary containment
or other engineering practices for tank systems with chronic or acute
potential for pollution impact on waters of the State.

(l3)

(c)

The Permit Board may require the development of, and approval of, Best
Management Practices Plans addressing any activity at a facility which
may impact the environment or compliance with the permit.

(d)

Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the Permit Board
may require a facility that has above ground storage of liquids and/or
materials with the potential to cause chronic or acute pollution impact on
waters of the State (which are not subject to Hazardous Waste
Management Regulations or 40 CFR 112 [Oil Pollution Prevention]
regulations) to provide either secondary containment or demonstrate an
equivalent amount of protection from discharge of pollutants in amounts
which have the potential to cause chronic or acute pollution impact if such
secondary measures are necessary to protect human health, welfare or the
environment.

Compliance with Permit Conditions
All discharges authorized by the permit shall be consistent with the terms and
conditions of the permit and the permittee shall make all reasonable efforts to
meet any interim or final dates for compliance specified therein.
