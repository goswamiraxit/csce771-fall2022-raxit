Table 1. Mississippi Water Body Classifications and Designated Uses
MS Water Body Classification

U.S. EPA Associated Designated Use

Public Water Supply

Drinking Water Supply

Recreation

Primary Contact Recreation

Shellfish Harvesting

Shellfish Consumption

Fish and Wildlife

Aquatic Life Use
Fish Consumption
Secondary Contact Recreation

A water body classified as Public Water Supply, Recreation, or Shellfish Harvesting shall
meet not only the criteria to support its respective classification, but also shall meet the
criteria to support the Fish and Wildlife classification.
C.

Dissolved Oxygen: Dissolved oxygen concentrations shall be maintained at a daily
average of not less than 5.0 mg/l with an instantaneous minimum of not less than 4.0
mg/l.
When possible, samples should be taken from ambient sites according to the following
guidelines:
For waters bodies that are not stratified, samples should be taken:
At mid-depth if the total water column depth is 10 feet or less.
At 5 feet from the water surface if the total water column depth is greater
than 10 feet.
For waters that are stratified, samples should be taken:
At mid-depth of the epilimnion if the epilimnion depth is 10 feet or less.
At 5 feet from the water surface if the epilimnion depth is greater than 10
feet.

D.

pH: The normal pH of the waters shall be 6.0 to 9.0. The discharge of waters or
wastewaters should not cause the pH to vary more than 1.0 unit within this range, nor be
less than 6.0, nor be greater than 9.0. Variations may be allowed on a case-by-case basis
if the Commission determines that there will be no detrimental effect on the water bodyâ€™s
designated uses as a result of the greater pH change. In black water streams and in those
watersheds with highly acidic soils, the pH may be lower than 6.0 due to natural
conditions.
