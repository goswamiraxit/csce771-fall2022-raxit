3.
O'Conner-Dobbins equation may be used for streams with depths greater than 5 feet and
where there are adequate stream depth profiles or reasonable estimates available. If stream flow
is less than 280 cfs, Tsivoglou escape coefficient values should be considered.
Ka =

12 .9 *V 0.5
D1.5

where:
V
= velocity in ft./sec.
D
= depth in ft.
Ka
= reaeration rate 1/day (base e @ 20Â°C).
4.
A minimum Ka value of 0.15/day will be used except in the case mentioned under Kd
where Ka/Kd is not less than 2.
5.

In the WASP model COVAR may be considered.

Stream Background Conditions

Assume the following stream background conditions unless data show otherwise.
1.

DO = 85% of saturation at assumed stream temperature (table attached)

2.

CBODU = 2.0 mg/l

3.

CBOD5 = 1.33 mg/l

4.

NBODU = 0.5 mg/l

5.

NH3-N = 0.10 mg/l

K.

Photosynthesis / Respiration

1.

Input values for P and R (mg/l/day) can be determined in stream studies using the:

(a)

Delta Method

(b)

Diurnal Curve Method

(c)

Light/Dark Bottle Method

2.
In the absence of field data, P and R will be assumed to be 0.0 mg/l/day.
assumption will be reevaluated for streams dominated by algae.
