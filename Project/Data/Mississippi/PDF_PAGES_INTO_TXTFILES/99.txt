Kn (Nitrogenous Deoxygenation Rate)

1.
Kn has been found to range from 0.3 to 1.5 per day (at 20°C) in free-flowing streams
containing greater than 2 to 3 mg/l of dissolved oxygen. Impounded streams or streams with low
DO levels will exhibit Kn's as low as 0.0 to 0.3 per day.
2.
In the absence of measured values, Kn (base e @ 20°C) will be assumed as 0.3 per day
for streams with slope less than or equal to 20 ft./mile and 0.5 per day for streams with slope
greater than 20 ft./mile. When actual data are available, the Kn rate will be determined
according to the procedures outlined in EPA/600/3-85/040.

Ka (Reaeration Rate)

1.
For small streams in Mississippi the most appropriate formula for calculating the
reaeration coefficient is the one developed by E. C. Tsivoglou.
Ka = C * S *V

Where:
Ka
= reaeration rate, 1/day
C
= escape coefficient, 1/ft.
S
= slope, ft./mile
V
= velocity, mile/day
2.

Assume escape coefficients recommended for Mississippi.

(a)

C = 0.11 for stream flow less than 10 cfs

(b)

C = 0.0597 for greater than or equal to 10 cfs to a stream flow less than 280 cfs
