APPENDIX C
Debarment and Suspension
Loan recipients are prohibited from entering into contractual agreements with individuals,
businesses, organizations, or any other entities that have been debarred or suspended by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, any other federal agency, state agency or by the
Department. Entities debarred or suspended by the federal agencies are identified in the
General Services Administration (GSA) publication entitled "List of Parties Excluded from
Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Program."
Loan recipients are responsible for ensuring that prime contractors utilized on the project are
not on the federal or state debarment lists. Likewise, prime contractors are responsible for
ensuring that subcontractors utilized on the project are not on the federal or state debarment
lists.
Anyone may contact the Department concerning the existence of a cause for debarment or
suspension. The Department may refer the matter to the state Attorney General or other
appropriate office for further investigation. If, after review or investigation, the Department
reasonably believes that a cause for debarment exists, the Department may propose
debarment or suspension and may initiate procedures similar to, but not necessarily identical
to, federal regulation 40 CFR Part 32: Debarment and Suspension Under EPA Assistance
Programs.
Such above described debarment or suspension actions will not affect existing executed
contractual agreements, unless such agreements have been terminated or suspended under
the terms of the agreement by the loan recipient.
