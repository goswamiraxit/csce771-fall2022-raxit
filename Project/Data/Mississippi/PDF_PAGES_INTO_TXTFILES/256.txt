APPENDIX F
Debarment and Suspension
SRF loan recipients are prohibited from entering into contractual agreements with individuals or
organizations that have been debarred or suspended by the Environmental Protection Agency,
any other federal or state agency, or by the Department. Individuals and/or businesses that have
been debarred or suspended are identified in the General Services Administration (GSA)
publication entitled "List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement
Program." This list, along with information concerning debarment and suspension actions by the
State, is available from the Office of Pollution Control.
The loan recipient is responsible for ensuring that the prime contractor utilized on the project is
not on the federal or state debarment lists. Likewise, the prime contractor is responsible for
ensuring that the subcontractors utilized on the project are not on the federal or state debarment
lists.
Anyone may contact the Executive Director concerning the existence of a cause for debarment or
suspension. The Executive Director may refer the matter to the State Attorney General or other
appropriate office for further investigation. If, after review or investigation, the Executive
Director reasonably believes that a cause for debarment exists, the Executive Director may
propose debarment or suspension and may initiate procedures similar to, but not necessarily
identical to, federal regulation 40 CFR, Part 32: Debarment and Suspension Under EPA
Assistance Programs.
Such above described debarment or suspension actions shall not affect existing executed
contractual agreements, unless such agreements have been terminated or suspended under the
terms of the agreement by the loan recipient.
