C. Water Quality Standards
Most of Mississippi’s waters are classified as Fish and Wildlife. For each of the water body
classifications listed above, there are various water quality criteria that apply to those water body
uses. These standards are used in the assessment process. A water body (part or all of a stream,
river, lake, estuary or coastline) should support one or more of these uses. Mississippi’s WQS
specify the appropriate levels for which various water quality parameters or indicators support a
water body’s designated use(s). Each use assessed for a water body is determined to be either
“Attaining” or “Not Attaining” in accordance with the applicable water quality standards and
EPA guidelines for assessments pursuant to §305(b). For the 2020 assessments, all monitoring
data were collected prior to the approval of the current Water Quality Criteria for Intrastate,
Interstate, and Coastal Waters. The applicable criteria was approved in 2016. Mississippi's
WQS may be found here:

D. Assessment Categories
After assessing attainment status of the water body’s designated use(s), each water body is
assigned to an assessment unit that defines the length of the reach assessed and is placed into one
of five assessment categories as per EPA guidance. These categories are summarized in Table 2.
