Coordination of Water Pollution Control Revolving Loan Fund Program (WPCRLF)
and Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Grant and Loan Program on Jointly Funded
Wastewater Projects
General Guidance regarding WPCRLF/RUS coordination: The RUS is an agency of
the United States Department of Agriculture which provides loans and grants for
water and wastewater projects. Eligible applicants must be public bodies, nonprofit
organizations, or Indian tribes that serve communities with populations under 10,000.
RUS funds may be used in conjunction with other Federal, State, or local funds.
Applications for RUS funds will be accepted at any time during the year, and involve
an environmental review that includes public notifications and comment periods.
RUS projects are funded at any time during the year as long as funds are available.
RUS funds are allocated by Congress in October of each year, and are usually spent
as complete applications are received. Therefore, it is generally to the applicantâ€™s
advantage to file applications earlier in the fiscal year.
