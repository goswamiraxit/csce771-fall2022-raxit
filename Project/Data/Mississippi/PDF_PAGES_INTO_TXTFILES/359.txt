APPENDIX D
Minority and Women’s Business Enterprise Requirements (MBE/WBE)
These MBE/WBE requirements apply to all projects funded within a fiscal year in which federal
capitalization grants to the Department require such compliance. The Department will establish
“fair share” objectives for participation by minority and women’s business enterprises in
WPCRLF funded projects. The loan recipient must undertake the following steps in the
procurement of materials, equipment, supplies, and construction:
(1)

Include qualified minority and women’s businesses on solicitation lists,

(2)

Assure that minority and women’s businesses are solicited whenever they are
potential sources,

(3)

Divide total requirements, when economically feasible, into small tasks or
quantities to permit maximum participation by minority and women’s businesses,

(4)

Establish delivery schedules, when practical which will encourage participation
by minority and women’s businesses,

(5)

Use the services of the Office of Minority Business Enterprises of the Mississippi
Department of Economic and Community Development and the Contract
Procurement Centers of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as appropriate, and

(6)

Require the contractor to take the five (5) steps listed above, if the contractor
awards subcontracts.

The loan recipient, engineer, and prime contractor(s) must also follow the guidance in the
Department document “Utilization of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises.”
Minority and women’s business enterprises must be certified by the Mississippi Department of
Economic & Community Development, Office of Minority Business Enterprises or the
Mississippi Department of Transportation.
