APPENDIX C
Environmental Review Process
Introduction
Each project which receives SRF funding will undergo a review to determine whether there will
be any significant adverse environmental impacts. It should be recognized that wastewater
treatment projects nearly always have a substantial beneficial impact.
For any project, one or more of the following environmental actions will be taken by the
Department:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

Categorical Exclusion
Finding Of No Significant Impact on the Environment
Amendment to a Finding of No Significant Impact on the Environment
Environmental Impact Statement
Reaffirmation of an Environmental Action
No Action

Categorical Exclusion
A project will receive categorical exclusion (CE) from environmental review if it meets all of the
following criteria:
a.

The project will not create a new discharge or result in a significant relocation of
an existing discharge.

b.

The project will not substantially increase the volume of discharge or load of
pollutants to the receiving stream.

c.

The project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment.

d.

The action will not adversely affect cultural resources, habitats of endangered or
threatened species, or environmentally important natural resource areas.

e.

The action is cost effective and should cause no significant public controversy.

It is expected that most projects which include only sewer system rehabilitation will receive a
CE.
The CE will be issued to the appropriate contact agencies and will be published in the Jackson
Clarion-Ledger and an appropriate local newspaper. See Attachment 1.
The Department will generally wait 30 days after issuing a CE before funding a project.
However, funding may be awarded immediately after issuing a CE, if necessary.
