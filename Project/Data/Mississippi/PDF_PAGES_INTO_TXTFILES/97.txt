12.
Spatial flow will be included at equal increments over the length of a given stream
segment.
B.

7Q2 Flow Values

The 7Q2 flow in unregulated, natural streams will be used in conjunction with the other
assumptions contained herein for establishing permit limitations for storm water permits. The
7Q2 flow will be determined from Low-Flow and Flow-Duration Characteristics of Mississippi
Streams, U.S.G.S., Report 90-4087 or the most recent update of this publication. In cases in
which either (1) the data is indefinite or inconclusive, or (2) the 7-day, 2-year minimum flow
and/or the 7-day, 10-year minimum flow are inappropriate because of the hydrology of the area,
other appropriate State and federal agencies will be consulted in establishing the applicable
stream flow.
C.

Temperature

The criteria for temperature selection are as follows:
1.
For streams for which sufficient temperature data is available, the design temperature will
be the average daily maximum temperature for the months of July and August.
2.

For streams with insufficient or no temperature data, the following will be assumed:

Stream Size
Streams with minimum low
flows > 300 cfs
Streams with minimum low
flows > 50 cfs and < 300 cfs
Streams with minimum low
flows < 50 cfs

Velocity

Time-of-travel measurements will be used when available. Average reach velocity can be
determined by completion of a dye tracer study. A minimum velocity of 0.1 fps will be used.
