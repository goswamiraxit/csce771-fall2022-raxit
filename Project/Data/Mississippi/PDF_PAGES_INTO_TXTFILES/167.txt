of Mississippiâ€™s Wastewater Regulations for National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permits, Underground Injection Control
(UIC) Permits, State Permits, Water Quality Based Effluent Limitations
and Water Quality Certification, Title 11, Part 6, Chapter 1. In these
instances, the criterion for the specific metal in the affected water body
shall be equal to the criterion concentrations calculated using the
following equations:

CMC = WER * Acute and CCC = WER * Chronic

Where:

CC = Criteria Continuous Concentration
CMC = Criteria Maximum Concentration
WER = Water Effects Ratio for a Specific Pollutant
Acute = Acute Criterion from Table 2
Chronic = Chronic Criterion from Table 2

When a WER has not been conducted, the criterion listed in Table 2 of this regulation
shall apply because the value of the WER is presumed to equal one in the absence of
data to indicate otherwise.
