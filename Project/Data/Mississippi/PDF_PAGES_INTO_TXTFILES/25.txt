(3)

(4)

receiving stream characteristics, including possible or known water
quality impairment, receiving stream classification, and whether
the facility discharges to a coastal water or a water designated as
an outstanding natural resource; and

(5)

other considerations (including but not limited to the history of
toxic impact and compliance problems of the POTW), which the
Permit Board determines could cause or contribute to adverse
water quality impacts.

The Permit Board may exempt a facility from the application WET testing
requirements of Rule 1.1.2.D.1 of this chapter if it satisfies one or more of the
conditions that follow:
(a)

the Department may delay effluent characterization for whole effluent
toxicity for existing facilities that are under a compliance schedule in a
permit or administrative order to implement technology-based controls or
to achieve compliance with water quality-based effluent limits;

(b)

once-through non-contact cooling water without additives;

(c)

dewatering of sand or gravel mining operations;

(d)

sump pump discharges of uncontaminated groundwater or rainwater only;

(e)

construction dewatering only;

(f)

discharges from fish hatcheries and other aquaculture;

(g)

non-POTW facilities discharging only treated domestic wastewater, unless
the Department determines the facility has the potential for toxicity;

(h)

is a seafood processor; or

(i)

the Department determines that the facility's discharge does not have the
potential to contain toxics in toxic amounts.

Facilities required under Rule 1.1.2.D.1 or 2. to conduct toxicity testing shall use
Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents to Freshwater and Marine
Organisms, Fourth Edition, (EPA-600/4-90/027), or most recent edition for acute
tests and Short-Term Methods for Estimating the Chronic Toxicity of Effluents
and Receiving Waters to Fresh water Organisms, (EPA/600/4-89/001) or most
recent edition for chronic tests. Such testing must be conducted subsequent to the
most recent NPDES permit reissuance or permit modification under40 CFR
122.62(a), whichever occurs later.
