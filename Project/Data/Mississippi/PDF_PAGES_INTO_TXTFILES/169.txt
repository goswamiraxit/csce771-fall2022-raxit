amended unless a more recent RfD is issued by the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency as listed in the Integrated Risk Information System
(IRIS) file, in which case the more recent value will be used. Water
quality standards or criteria used to calculate water quality-based effluent
limitations (and for all other purposes of water quality criteria under
Section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act) to protect human health through
the different exposure routes are determined as follows:
(1)

Fish tissue consumption:

WQC = (RfD) x Body Weight / (FCR x BCF)

where: WQC = water quality criterion
RfD = reference dose
FCR = fish consumption rate (17.5 gm/person-day)
BCF = bioconcentration factor
BCF values are based on U. S. Environmental Protection Agency
publications pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Clean Water Act. FCR
values are average consumption rates for a 70 kg adult for a lifetime of the
population; alternative FCR values may be used when it is considered
necessary to protect localized populations which may be consuming fish at
a higher rate.
(2)

Water consumption and fish tissue consumption:

WQC = (RfD) x Body Weight / (WCR + (FCR x BCF))

where: WQC = water quality criterion
RfD = reference dose
FCR = fish consumption rate (17.5 gm/person-day)
BCF = bioconcentration factor
WCR = water consumption rate (assumed to be 2 liters/day for
adults)
The equations listed in this subparagraph will be used to develop water
criteria or standards on a case-by-case basis for toxic substances that are
not presently included in the water quality standards. Alternative FCR
values may be used when it is considered necessary to protect localized
populations that may be consuming fish at a higher rate.
