include; EPA's Water Quality Standards Handbook, 2nd
Edition September 1993, risk assessment data, exposure
data, information about the pollutant from the Food and
Drug Administration, and current EPA criteria documents.

(ii)

Establish effluent limits on a case-by-case basis, using
EPA's water quality criteria, published under Section
307(a) of the Federal Act, supplemented where necessary
by other relevant information.

(iii)

Establish effluent limitations on an indicator parameter for
the pollutant of concern, provided:
(A)

the permit identifies which pollutants are intended
to be controlled by the use of the effluent limitation;

(B)

the fact sheet required by 40 CFR 124.56 sets forth
the basis for the limit, including a finding that
compliance with the effluent limit on the indicator
parameter will result in controls on the pollutant of
concern which are sufficient to attain and maintain
applicable water quality standards;

(C)

the permit requires all effluent and ambient
monitoring necessary to show that during the term
of the permit the limit on the indicator parameter
continues to attain and maintain applicable water
quality standards; and

(D)

the permit contains a reopener clause allowing the
Permit Board to modify or revoke and reissue the
permit if the limits on the indicator parameter no
longer attain and maintain applicable water quality
standards.

When developing water quality based effluent limits under this
paragraph the Permit Board shall ensure that:
(i)

the level of water quality to be achieved by limits on point
sources established under this paragraph is derived from,
and complies with all applicable water quality standards;
and

(ii)

effluent limits developed to protect a narrative water
quality criterion, a numeric water quality criterion, or both,
are consistent with the assumptions and requirements of
