APPENDIX N
NPDES and Siting Criteria Regulations
The loan recipient shall insure that all current regulations of the Commission on Environmental
Quality and the Environmental Quality Permit Board are complied with during the planning,
design, and construction of the SRF loan project. These regulations include "Wastewater Permit
Regulations for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), Underground and
Injection Control (UIC) and State Operating Permits" and "Guidelines for Review of Siting
Criteria in Applications for Air and Water Pollution Control Permits". It is the loan recipient's
responsibility to insure that the project is in compliance with these regulations and all future
amendments. Also, the loan recipient shall comply with the following requirements:
1.

All planning documents submitted to the Department for review shall clearly
indicate that a 150-foot buffer zone between the treatment facility and the nearest
adjoining property line is provided. This shall be shown on a plan view of the
treatment facility site. If it is not possible to provide a 150-foot buffer zone, the
planning document shall indicate that a written waiver from the adjoining
property owners will be necessary.

2.

All design plans submitted to the Department for review shall clearly display the
150-foot buffer zone. If it is not possible to provide a 150-foot buffer zone, a
written waiver from the adjoining property owners shall also accompany the
design plans. When a waiver is necessary, it is strongly suggested that this be
obtained prior to substantial work on the treatment facility design.
An NPDES permit application shall accompany all design plans for wastewater
treatment facilities, if a permit or permit modification is required.

3.

All appraisals, negotiations, purchase agreements, and site certificates shall
include the required buffer zones, unless a waiver was previously submitted along
with the design plans.
