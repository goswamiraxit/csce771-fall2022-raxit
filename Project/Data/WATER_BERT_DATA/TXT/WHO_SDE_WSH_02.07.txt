FOREWORD

Around 2.2 million die of basic hygiene related diseases, like diarrhoea, every year. The great
majority are children in developing countries. Interventions in hygiene, sanitation and water supply
make proven contributors to controlling this disease burden. For decades, universal access to safe
water and sanitation has been promoted as an essential step in reducing this preventable disease
burden

Nevertheless the target “universal access” to improved water sources and basic sanitation remains
elusive. The “Millenium Declaration” established the lesser but still ambitious goal of halving the
proportion of people without access to safe water by 2015. Achieving “universal access” is an
important long-term goal. How to accelerate health gains against this long-term backdrop and
especially amongst the most affected populations is an important challenge.

There is now conclusive evidence that simple, acceptable, low-cost interventions at the household
and community level are capable of dramatically improving the microbial quality of household
stored water and reducing the attendant risks of diarrheal disease and death.

Many different water collection and storage systems and strategies have been developed, described
and evaluated on the basis of various criteria for household and community use in developed and
developing countries. A variety of physical and chemical treatment methods to improve the
microbial quality of water are available and many have been tested and implemented to varying
extents in developed and developing countries. Some of these water treatment and storage systems
have been tested under controlled conditions in the laboratory and implemented in field to evaluate
their ability to produce drinking water of acceptable microbiological quality and to maintain this
quality during storage and use. Some of them also have been evaluated in the field for their ability
to reduce diarrheal and other waterborne diseases among users.

Because of the importance of education, socio-cultural acceptance, changing people's beliefs and
behaviors, achieving sustainability and affordability in the provision of safe water, some of the
most promising household water treatment and storage systems and their implementation strategies
include or are accompanied by efforts to address these considerations.

This report describes and critically reviews the various methods and systems for household water
collection, treatment and storage. It also presents and critically reviews data on the ability of these
household water treatment and storage methods to provide water that has improved microbiological
quality and lower risk of waterborne diarrheal and other infectious disease.

The target audience for this report is intended to be scientists, engineers, policy makers, managers
and other public health, environmental health and water resources professionals who are
knowledgeable about the fundamentals of drinking water and related health sciences and water
engineering technology.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A large fraction of the World's population around 1.1 billion people - does not have access to
improved sources of water. For many others, contamination of water during transport and in the
household presents a significant health risk. For this segment of the world's population, use of
effective technologies for household water treatment and storage is likely to have direct beneficial
effects in the form of reduced infectious diseases and also contribute to greater productivity and
other associated benefits from improved health. Household treatment often can provide these
benefits to underserved populations much more quickly than it will take to design, install and
deliver piped community water supplies.

Identifying the most accessible and effective methods for household water storage and treatment are
matters of considerable importance and are the subject of this report.

The purpose of this report is to critically review the various candidate technologies and systems for
providing microbiologically improved household water and to identify the most promising ones
based on their technical characteristics and performance criteria. The characteristics and
performance criteria for these are: effectiveness in improving and maintaining microbial water
quality, reducing waterborne infectious disease, technical difficulty or simplicity, accessibility,
cost, socio-cultural acceptability, sustainability and potential for dissemination.

This critical review considers methods and systems to protect water during storage, collection and
use that improve microbial quality and thereby reduce pathogen exposure and risks of diarrheal and
other waterborne diseases. Because it has been repeatedly demonstrated and is generally accepted
that the most important and immediate risks to human health from using contaminated drinking
water are those from enteric microbes of fecal origin or other sources, this review focuses on
strategies and systems to protect and improve the microbiological quality of household water to
prevent and control waterborne microbial diseases.

Systems for Household Storage of Collected Water to Protect Microbiological Quality

A review of the existing literature on collection and storage of household water revealed that such
water often comes from fecally contaminated sources and therefore poses infectious disease risks to
consumers. Furthermore, regardless of whether or not collected household water is initially of
acceptable microbiological quality, it often becomes contaminated with pathogens of fecal origin
during transport and storage due to unhygienic storage and handling practices.

Studies show that the use of containers with narrow openings for filling, and dispensing devices
such as spouts or taps/spigots, protect the collected water during storage and household use. Many
container designs also have handles, are lightweight, are made from durable, UV-resistant plastic
and are affixed with a label containing informational/educational on their cleaning and use. Other
appropriate containers for safe storage are those in which water can be directly treated by the
physical method of solar radiation and then directly stored and dispensed for household use. These
improved containers protect stored household water from the introduction of microbial
contaminants via contact with hands, dippers, other fecally contaminated vehicles or the intrusion
of vectors.

Treatment Technologies to Improve the Microbiological Quality of Household Water

A variety of candidate technologies for treatment of household water have been described and
many are widely used in different parts of the world. The technologies to improve the microbial
quality of household water and reduce waterborne disease include a number of physical and
chemical treatment methods. The physical methods, include boiling, heating (fuel and solar),
settling, filtering, exposing to the UV radiation in sunlight, and UV disinfection with lamps. The
chemical methods include coagulation-flocculation and precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange and
chemical disinfection with germicidal agents (primarily chlorine). Some water treatment and
storage systems use chemicals and other media and materials that can not be easily obtained locally
at reasonable cost and require relatively complex and expensive systems and procedures to treat the
water. Such systems may be too inaccessible, complex and expensive to employ for treatment and
storage of household water in some places and settings.

The efficacy of some treatment methods to physically remove particles (turbidity) and microbes or
to inactivate microbes in household water has been documented, primarily for indicator bacteria.
Some treatment methods, such as boiling, solar disinfection, UV disinfection with lamps,
chlorination and the combined treatments of chemical coagulation-filtration and chlorination have
been evaluated for reductions of bacteria, viruses and in some cases protozoans. However, the
ability of some of these methods to remove or inactivate a wide range of known waterborne
pathogens has been inadequately investigated and documented. The differences in the technologies
of candidate treatment and water storage systems as well as the differences in the types, sizes and
other properties of waterborne microbes that need to be removed or inactivated, have contributed to
a lack of documentation of the efficacy of these methods for household treatment and storage of
water.

With exception of chlorination and storage in a safe container and solar disinfection “SODIS” UV
plus heat), most technologies for household water treatment and storage have not been studied for
their ability to reduce diarrheal and other waterborne disease in household use.             Such
epidemiological studies of an intervention are essential in establishing the performance of the
technology as well as its acceptance and sustainability by users.

Several candidate technologies for household water treatment and storage appear to be accessible,
simple and economical for use in both the developed and developing countries. Some of these
systems have been characterized for microbial efficacy and reduction of waterborne disease, and for
community acceptance sustainability and cost recovery. Of the systems now available, the
following appear to be the most widespread and promising for further development,
characterization, implementation and dissemination:

•   Boiling
•   Solar disinfection by the combined action of heat and UV radiation
•   Solar disinfection by heat alone ("solar cooking")
•   UV disinfection with lamps
•   Chlorination plus storage in an appropriate vessel
•   Combined systems of chemical coagulation-filtration and chlorine disinfection.




                                                iv
The performance characteristics, advantages, disadvantages and estimated costs of these most
promising technologies for household water treatment to improve microbial quality and reduce
diarrheal disease are presented in the report.

Treating turbid water: a special concern
For the most promising household water treatment systems of chlorination with an improved
storage vessel, solar disinfection with UV plus heat in clear bottles for sunlight penetration
(SODIS), and UV irradiation with lamps, effective treatment of turbid water remains a challenge.
This is because microbial reductions are decreased or prevented by turbidity particles that reduce
access to target microbes or otherwise protect them from inactivation by other mechanisms.
Suspended matter in water reduces the microbiocidal efficacy of chlorine and other chemical
disinfectants, and it physically shields microbes from the UV radiation that is present in sunlight
and emitted from mercury arc lamps and responsible for much of its disinfection activity. There is
a need to investigate, characterize and implement physical and physical-chemical technologies for
practical and low cost pre-treatment of treatment of household water prior to chlorination, solar
disinfection with UV plus heat and UV disinfection with lamps. Appropriate physical and physical-
chemical methods for effective pre-treatment for household water needed to be established, taking
into consideration turbid waters of different quality with respect to particle characteristics and their
removal efficiencies. In principle, some physical or physical-chemical methods may be highly
effective for treatment of stored household water on their own. Pre-treatment technologies for
removal of turbidity (suspended matter) from water suitable for such applications potentially
include:

•   Settling or plain sedimentation
•   Fiber, cloth or membrane filters
•   Granular media filters and
•   Slow sand filter.

These methods will vary in their ability to remove interfering turbidity from water, depending on
the nature of the turbidity particles. Especially important in this regard is their size and density. Of
the listed methods, slow sand filtration is the least likely to be implementable and sustainable at the
household level. This is because the preferred filter designs and installations often are larger and
capable of treating more water than needed by individual households and because they require
technical skills for maintenance and operation that may not be accepted by individual users.

Need for behavioral, motivational, and economic support
The use of technologies to treat and safely store household water is best accomplished if it is
accompanied by or supported with economic incentives and other cost recovery methods and with
programs designed to support community participation, education and other efforts to achieve
acceptance and sustainability. Where such additional socio-cultural, behavioral and economic
components of household water treatment and storage technologies are absent or lacking, successful
implementation and sustained use are unlikely to be achieved. The importance of economic
analyses and community participation, education and responsibility for household water treatment
and safe storage can not be over stressed in future efforts to establish and disseminate this
intervention for water sanitation.

Conclusions
Numerous studies have clearly shown that improving the microbiological quality of household
water by on-site or point-of-use treatment and safe storage in improved vessels reduces diarrheal
and other waterborne diseases in communities and households of developing as well as developed
countries. The extent to which improving drinking water quality at the household level reduces
diarrheal disease probably depends on a variety of technology-related as well as site-specific
environmental and demographic factors that require further investigation, characterization and
analyses. Reductions in household diarrheal diseases of 6-90% have been observed, depending on
the technology and the exposed population and local conditions.

Further development, refinement, implementation, evaluation and comparison of household water
treatment and safe storage technologies is both justified and encouraged.

Greater efforts to disseminate information about household water treatment and storage
technologies and their benefits and advantages are merited.

The most promising and accessible of the technologies for household water treatment are filtration
with ceramic filters, chlorination with storage in an improved vessel, solar disinfection in clear
bottles by the combined action of UV radiation and heat, thermal disinfection (pasteurization) in
opaque vessels with sunlight from solar cookers or reflectors and combination systems employing
chemical coagulation-flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination. All of these systems
have been shown to dramatically improve the microbiological quality of water. At least two of
them, solar disinfection in clear plastic bottles (heat plus UV radiation) and chlorination plus
storage in an improved vessel, have been shown in epidemiological studies of the intervention type
to significantly reduce diarrheal and other infectious diseases, including cholera. These household
water treatment and storage systems are considered the most promising and effective, based on their
documented ability to improve the microbiological water and reduce waterborne infectious disease
risks.

All of the household water treatment technologies described here have been tested independently
and so far none have been tested in combination. Historically and with renewed recent interest,
water treatment technology and practice have focused on the use of two or more treatment
technologies as a multiple barrier approach. There is considerable interest and potential merit in the
use of two or more treatment systems in succession for improved treatment and the creation of
multiple barriers. In particular those treatments that provide no residual disinfectant, such as
boiling, solar treatment, UV disinfection with lamps and filtration could be followed by
chlorination and storage in a protected or improved vessel to prove a multibarrier approach that
would result in appreciable microbial reduction, continued protection with a disinfectant residual
and storage that is less prone to post-treatment contamination. Research and demonstration of such
multibarrier treatment and storage approaches deserve consideration and are recommended as next
steps in the development, evaluation and implementation of improved treatment and storage of
water at the household level.

The introduction of improved water treatment and storage at the household level, if done
effectively, is likely to increase personal and community knowledge and awareness of the
importance of water hygiene and sanitation and the benefits to be derived therefrom. It is likely



                                                 vi
that involvement in preparing and using safe water at the household level results in increased
knowledge of water hygiene and sanitation, recognition and appreciation of its contribution to
infectious disease prevention and control and improved health. Such awareness of the role of safe
drinking water in health promotion and diseased prevention support and facilitate the ultimate goal
of providing all of the world's population with community piped water that is accessible, safe and
affordable.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

A large proportion of the World's people do not have access to improved or microbiologically
safe sources of water for drinking and other essential purposes: (WHO/UNICEF, 2000) has
estimated that 1.1 billion people do not have access to “improved drinking-water sources”.
Consumption of unsafe water continues to be one of the major causes of the 2.2 million diarrheal
disease deaths occurring annually, mostly in children (WHO/UNICEF, 2000).

Despite major efforts to deliver safe, piped, community water to the World's population, the
reality is that water supplies delivering safe water will not be available to all people in the near
term (Argawal et al., 1981; Feachem et al., 1978; IDRC, 1980). The millenium declaration
established as a goal halving the proportion of the global population without access to safe water
by 2015. One reason for this is that fecal contamination of source and treated water is a
persistent, worldwide problem. Sanitation coverage is inadequate in many parts of the world and
is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. Fecal contamination of source and treated water is
further exacerbated by increasing populations, urban growth and expansion, peri-urban
settlement and continued and perhaps increasing pollutant transport into ground and surface
water due to deforestation, global climate change, recurrent disastrous weather events
(hurricanes, cyclones, floods, tsunamis, etc.) and increasing coverage of the earth's surface with
impervious materials.

Current estimates of the number of people using microbiologically unsafe water are probably
low. This is because the assumptions about the safety or quality of water based on its source,
extent of treatment or consumer handling do not take into consideration several well-documented
problems. One problem is that co-called protected or improved sources, such as boreholes and
treated urban supplies, can still be fecally contaminated and deliver microbially unsafe water. In
some cities the water systems abstract unsafe water from unprotected or contaminated sources
and deliver it to consumers with no or inadequate treatment, yet these water systems are
classified or categorized as improved and safe. Another problem contributing to the
underestimation of the population served by unsafe water is contamination of water during
distribution whether water is piped or carried into the home. Many communities have protected
or improved water supplies and treated water that is microbiologically safe when collected or
when it leaves a treatment plant. However, substandard water distribution systems, intermittent
water pressure due to power outages and other disruptions, and illegal connections to the
distribution system often lead to the introduction of fecal contamination and therefore,
microbiologically contaminated water at the consumer's tap or collection point. In some urban
water supplies the infrastructure for water distribution to consumers is so inadequate that
pressure drops, losses and other intermittent pressure changes, deteriorating, open or leaking
conveyances and other distribution system deficiencies lead to infiltration or intrusion of
contaminated water and increased waterborne disease risks. Such deficiencies result in the
delivery of unsafe water to consumers, even though the water may have been obtained from a
high quality, protected source and centrally treated by physical and chemical methods to improve
quality. Furthermore, in many large cities, including some of the World's megacities, peri-urban
settlements are not served by the centralized water system for socio-cultural, economic, political,


                                                 1
technological and other reasons. Because these unserved urban dwellers are forced to obtain
water from any available source, including informal and clandestine connections to the central
water supply system, their water is typically contaminated.

People now drinking unsafe household water also include those in rural as well as urban settings.
Many rural dwellers lack indoor plumbing or nearby outdoor piped water from a safe supply
(from wells, boreholes, protected or upland surface water sources, etc.). Often they have to
travel considerable distances to reach any water source, regardless of quality, for collection and
household use (White et. al., 1972). Many urban dwellers are also lack safe water (WHO, 2000;
Swerdlow et. al., 1992; Ries et. al., 1992; Weber et. al., 1994).

A further problem is that water collected for domestic use often becomes re-contaminated or
further contaminated by unsafe consumer storage and handling practices at the household level.
Many of the world's people continue to obtain their water on a daily or other frequent basis from
any available source and either carry it or otherwise have it delivered to the home for personal
use. Typically, this water is gathered and stored in vessels of various designs and materials.
Often, the water is not treated or otherwise protected from subsequent contamination during use.
Such household water is at high risk of being contaminated by various pathogenic viruses,
bacteria and parasites associated with fecal wastes and other sources. This is because water is
typically obtained from the most convenient source, which is often fecally contaminated, and
typically, additional contamination occurs due to a variety of unsanitary conditions and practices
during storage and use. Microbial contamination of collected and stored household water is
caused not only by the collection and use of fecally contaminated water that was not safe to
begin with but also by contamination of initially microbiologically safe water after its collection
and storage. Factors contributing to this problem are unsanitary and inadequately protected
(open, uncovered or poorly covered) water collection and storage containers, the use of
unsanitary methods to dispense water from household storage vessels, including fecally
contaminated hands and dippers, lack of protection against contamination introduced by vectors
(flies, cockroaches, rodents, etc.) and inadequate cleaning of vessels to prevent biofilm formation
and accumulation of sediments and pathogens.

Improving and protecting the microbial quality and reducing the infectious disease risks to
consumers of collected water stored in households requires alternative or interim strategies and
approaches that can be implemented effectively, quickly and affordably. As will be described in
this report, technically feasible, effective, socio-culturally acceptable and affordable methods for
treatment and storage of household water to improve microbial quality and reduce waterborne
disease risks are now available. Waiting for the provision of piped, microbiologically safe
community water systems to the many people lacking such services is an inappropriate response
to the basic need for safer drinking water that can be met on at least a provisional basis by
available technologies. Effective measures are needed immediately to provide at risk
populations with safer water at the household level until the long-term goal of providing safe,
piped, community water supplies can be achieved.

 There is now conclusive evidence that simple, acceptable, low-cost interventions at the
household and community level are capable of dramatically improving the microbial quality of
household stored water and reducing the risks of diarrheal disease and death in populations of all



                                                 2
ages in the developed and developing world. A variety of physical and chemical treatment
methods to improve the microbial quality of water are available and many have been tested and
implemented to varying extents in a variety of settings and for a diverse range of populations.
Many different water collection and storage systems and strategies have been developed,
described and evaluated on the basis of various criteria for household and community use. Some
of them have been tested under controlled conditions in the laboratory and implemented in field
to evaluate their ability to produce drinking water of acceptable microbiological quality and to
maintain this quality during storage and use. Some of them also have been evaluated in the field
for their ability to reduce diarrheal and other waterborne diseases among users. Because of the
importance of education, socio-cultural acceptance, changing people's beliefs and behaviors,
achieving sustainability and affordability in the provision of safe water, some of the most
promising household water treatment and storage systems and their implementation strategies
include or are accompanied by efforts to address these considerations.

The purpose of this report is to critically review the various candidate technologies and systems
for providing microbiologically improved household water and to identify the most promising
ones based on their technical characteristics and performance criteria. These characteristics and
performance criteria are: effectiveness in improving and maintaining microbial water quality,
reducing waterborne infectious disease, technical difficulty or simplicity, accessibility, cost,
socio-cultural acceptability, sustainability and potential for dissemination. The focus of this
critical review is on technologies and systems to protect water during storage collection and use,
improve the microbial quality of the collected water, and thereby reduce pathogen exposure and
risks of diarrheal and other waterborne diseases. This is not intended to be a comprehensive
review of water treatment methods that reduce and thereby minimize exposures to various
chemical contaminants. While toxic chemicals in drinking water are an important public health
concern, it has been repeatedly demonstrated and generally accepted that the most important and
immediate risks to human health by using contaminated drinking water are those from enteric
microbes of fecal origin or other sources. Hence, the focus herein is on strategies and systems
for protection and improvement of the microbiological quality of household water and
prevention and control of waterborne microbial diseases. However, some of the technologies
that reduce waterborne microbes also reduce certain toxic chemicals, such as arsenic.

1.2. Purposes and Benefits of Household Water Treatment and Storage

The purposes of household water treatment and storage addressed in this review are those
intended to improve and maintain the microbial quality of the water for drinking and other
potable purposes, such as food preparation and essential hygiene in child care and treatment of
illness (breast feeding and preparation of infant foods and oral rehydration solutions) and thereby
reduce disease transmission. The main benefit of microbiologically safe water for these purposes
should be obvious: reducing the risks of diarrheal and other waterborne infectious diseases. The
alternative, unsafe water, is a major source of pathogen exposure and increased risk of
waterborne infection, illness and death. Hence, the provision of microbiologically safe
household water has the potential to reduce the infectious burden of the developing world's
population. Recent estimates put this burden at 4 billion cases of diarrhea and 2.2 million deaths
annually, mostly in children under five years of age. A compelling reason to accept and promote
treatment and safe storage of collected household water to improve microbial quality is the



                                                3
ability of this health-related intervention to reduce the infectious disease burden of the user
population. Notably, it is now well documented that the provision of safe water alone will
reduce diarrheal and other enteric diseases by 6 to 50%, even in the absence of improved
sanitation or other hygiene measures. Reducing household diarrheal disease by more than 5% is
an important achievement, because this is the minimum achievable target reduction in disease
burden considered worthy of promotion and implementation by health authorities. Furthermore,
as will be documented later in this report, reductions in diarrheal disease burdens in excess of 5%
by household water treatment and safe storage have been achieved for children under 5 years of
age. This outcome clearly shows that children under age 5 are protected by the intervention of
household treatment and safe storage of collected water, despite the likely opportunities for
transmission of these diarrheal disease agents by other exposure routes. Hence, treating water at
the household level and storing it safely to improve microbial quality apparently reduces the
frequency and magnitude of encounters of children under age 5 with diarrheal pathogens in the
home.

Although the combined roles of safe water and adequate hygiene and sanitation in reducing
diarrheal and other diseases are clear and well documented, there is uncertainty and even debate
over the magnitude of the contribution of safe water to this outcome (Esrey et al., 1985; 1991).
Some studies have suggested that improved hygiene and sanitation are more important than safe
water in reducing diarrheal and other water-borne and water-washed diseases (US Agency for
International Development, 1993). In the minds of some, the provision of safe water alone is
unlikely to result in reductions of diarrheal and other infectious diseases. This is because the
other transmission routes of these potentially waterborne diseases, such as person-to-person
contact, food, fomites and vectors are not being controlled and continue to be major sources of
pathogen transmission. Hence, it is assumed that provision of microbiologically safe water alone
will have little or no beneficial effect on infectious disease transmission in the absence of
improved sanitation and other hygiene measures.          This assumption is now known to be
incorrect. Recent studies of only safe water interventions clearly document not only the
improved microbiological quality of household water but also significant reductions in diarrheal
disease (Handzel, 1998; Mintz et. al., 2001; Quick, 1997; Quick et. al., 1999; Semenza et. al.,
1998). This beneficial effect is especially achieved when the technological intervention for
improved household water treatment and storage is supported by educational and motivational
efforts to transfer the technology and develop individual and community understanding and
support to maintain compliance and assume responsibility for its continued use and
dissemination. It is also clear that the combined roles of safe water and adequate hygiene and
sanitation are likely to achieve the greatest reduction in infectious disease burden compared to
either intervention alone. However, it is now apparent that improving household water
collection, treatment and storage is one option for achieving a beneficial health effect by
reducing diarrheal and other infectious diseases. Household water treatment and storage systems
are one of many waster, sanitation and hygiene options that deserve due consideration in the
identification, prioritization and implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene measures for
use at household, community and regional levels.

It is assumed that treated community water supplies in developed countries generally are of high
microbiological quality and therefore safe with respect to waterborne microbial disease risks.
However, significantly increased risks of waterborne gastrointestinal illness have been attributed



                                                4
to a centralized community water supply system in a large city of a developed country (Laval,
Quebec, Canada) where water was extensively treated by modern methods and met all microbial
quality requirements (Payment et al, 1991; 1996). These findings suggest that pathogens at
levels below detection but high enough to cause measurable gastrointestinal illness either
penetrated the multiple treatment barriers or they entered the treated water subsequently in the
community distribution system or within household plumbing. Hence, even extensively treated
community drinking water of high microbiological quality and assumed to be of low risk in
developed countries may still be contributing significantly to community diarrheal illness. It is
noteworthy that the apparent risks of waterborne diarrheal illness from the treated community
water delivered by the distribution system were significantly decreased either by point-of-use
water treatment or by protecting the treated water from post-treatment contamination (i.e.,
bottling it at the treatment plant and delivering the bottles to consumers). Additionally, the
infectious disease risks from fecally contaminated and microbially unsafe water in developed
countries is considered even greater in the water supplies of smaller communities than the larger
ones. Small community water supplies are at greater risk than larger ones because they often
lack the technical expertise and financial resources to adequately protect source waters, provide
sufficient and technically reliable treatment and maintain the integrity of their distribution
systems. For example, most waterborne outbreaks in the United States of America are due to
systems with no or inadequate treatment, vulnerable watersheds and aquifers, distribution system
deficiencies and serving smaller communities. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that in
communities throughout the world, improving household water quality by point-of-use treatment
reduces risks of diarrheal disease and significantly improves microbial quality.

In this review the candidate technologies and approaches for household water treatment and
storage are examined on the basis of their technical feasibility, practicality and availability,
effectiveness in improving the microbiological quality of the water and reducing waterborne
disease, cost, and potential for sustainability and dissemination.

2. Storage and Treatment of Household Water

2.1. Household Water Storage, Microbial Quality and Infectious Disease Risks
Key factors in the provision of safe household water include the conditions and practices of
water collection and storage and the choice of water collection and storage containers or vessels.
As shown in Table 1, numerous studies have documented inadequate storage conditions and
vulnerable water storage containers as factors contributing to increased microbial contamination
and decreased microbial quality compared to either source waters or water stored in improved
vessels. Some studies also have documented increased risks of waterborne infectious diseases
from inadequately stored water compared to water stored in an improved vessel (safe storage),
treated in the home to improve microbial quality, or consumed from a quality source without
storage (Table 1). Higher levels of microbial contamination and decreased microbial quality are
associated with storage vessels having wide openings (e.g., buckets and pots), vulnerability to
introduction of hands, cups and dippers that can carry fecal contamination, and lack of a narrow
opening for dispensing water. Some studies have noted the vulnerability of storage vessels with
these undesirable characteristics to fecal and other contamination without having reported
microbiological data on water quality or increased levels of diarrheal disease (Miller, 1984).
Other factors contributing to greater risks of microbial contamination of stored water are higher


                                                5
temperatures, increased storage times, higher levels of airborne particulates (dust storms),
inadequate handwashing and the use of stored water to prepare weanling and other foods that
also become microbiologically contaminated and contribute to increased infectious disease risks
(Black et al., 1983; Dunne, 2001; Echeverria et al., 1987: Iroegbu et al., 2000; Knight et al.,
1992; Luby et al., 2001a, van Steenbergen et al., 1983).

As summarized in Table 1, collection, storage and use of fecally contaminated water containing
excessive levels of fecal bacteria poses health risks to consumers, regardless of where or how the
water have become contaminated. In some cases water is collected from a contaminated source
to begin with. In other cases water is obtained from a source of high microbiological quality,
including treated supplies containing residual chlorine, but it becomes contaminated in the home
due to inadequate and unsanitary storage conditions that allow for the introduction and/or
proliferation of disease-causing microbes. In either situation, the microbially contaminated
water poses health risks that can be reduced by improved storage conditions and household
treatment, as will be further documented in this report. A few studies in the literature suggest
that contamination of water within households does not pose increased health risks to consumers,
perhaps because these pathogens are already present in household members and their contacts.
However, evidence to support this interpretation based on sound study design with adequate data
and data analyses are lacking. The majority of studies suggesting such lack of risk are based on
inadequate study designs, low sample sizes, measurement of waterborne microbes not adequately
predictive of health risks (e.g., plate count or coliform bacteria) and/or inadequate data analyses.
The majority of studies document decreases in microbial quality, including increased pathogen
levels, and increased health risks from consumption of fecally contaminated and inadequately
stored household water.

2.2 Collection Methods and Storage Vessels for Household Water

Since ancient times, water for household use is collected by a variety of physical methods
ranging from manual (e.g., dipping), to passive (e.g., roof catchments and diversions) to
mechanical (e.g., pumps), and it is stored in a variety containers. In developing countries, many
of the traditional types of water collection and storage methods employing vessels of various
compositions and sizes are still widely used today (CDC, 2001; Mintz et al., 1995; White et al.,
1972). These include traditional pots or urns fashioned from natural materials (e.g., gourds or
wood) or fabricated from clay, copper, brass and other impervious materials, and flexible bags or
other vessels made of animal hides, other animal parts or fabrics treated to seal and prevent
leakage. Today, other metals, including aluminum, steel and iron, as well as other materials,
primarily plastics, have come into widespread use for water collection and storage in the form of
buckets, jerry cans, picnic coolers and other vessel types and shapes. Cisterns and other basins
are also still widely used for water collection and bulk storage near or adjacent to dwellings, as
they have been since ancient times.

Some of the key factors influencing the impact of storage vessels and conditions on household
water quality are: (1) portability and ease of use, based on capacity, size, shape, weight, presence
of handles, (2) durability, weight and other properties related to resistance and longevity, (3)
presence of a coverable (preferably screw-cap) opening for filling and cleaning access but small
enough to reduce the potential for introducing contaminants by contaminated hands, dipping
utensils and other vehicles (e.g., airborne dust), vectors, or other sources, (3) ability to withdraw
water in a sanitary manner, such as via a tap, spigot, spout or other narrow orifice, and (4)
presence and accessibility of documentation describing how to properly use the container for
water treatment and sanitary storage. The advantages and disadvantages of different types of
water collection and storage containers in relation to the development of systems for safe storage
and use of household water have been reviewed and summarized by the US Centers for Disease

a
 Oxfam vessel is used primarily for emergency water storage and delivery. But, vessels of similar size and shape
have been used for household water collection and storage worldwide.

The most desirable water storage vessels for many household treatment and storage options are:
(1) between 10-25 liters capacity, rectangular or cylindrical with one or more handles and flat
bottoms for portability and ease of storage, (2) made of lightweight, oxidation-resistant plastic,
such as high-density polyethylene or polypropylene, for durability and shock resistance, (3) fitted
with a 6-9 cm screw-cap opening to facilitate cleaning, but small enough to discourage or
prevent the introduction of hands or dipping utensils, (4) fitted with a durable, protected and
easily closed spigot or spout for dispensing water, and (5) provided with pictorial and/or written



                                                               9
instructions for use affixed permanently to the container, as well as an affixed certificate of
approval or authenticity. The cost of water storage vessels is also an important consideration, as
they must be affordable or be subsidized. Locally available buckets, pots, urns, jerry cans,
barrels, used beverage containers and flexible bags and flagons are usually low in cost and
readily available. However, only some of these, in particular jerry cans, some plastic beverage
containers, some urns and some flexible vessels, have properties and characteristics that are
preferred or desirable as readily transported water storage vessels. Others, such as some buckets,
cooking pots, some plastic beverage containers and other cylindrical vessels are less desirable for
household water storage, but may be suitable for water collection and transport, especially if they
are lightweight, have protective lids and are composed of easily cleaned materials (e.g., plastics).

Another consideration of household water storage vessels is their compatibility with household
water treatment methods. In some cases, water treatment takes place in the collection and
storage vessel or the treated water is delivered to the storage vessel. The design and composition
of the vessel should be compatible with these tasks and also protect water quality. In some
household water treatment systems, multiple containers are needed, for example, one for raw,
untreated water and another for treated water. The materials of which the vessel is composed
must be compatible with the physical and chemical agents used for water treatment. In the case
of treatment chemicals, such as oxidant disinfectants (e.g., chlorine), the vessel must not exert
excessive oxidant demand or result in chemical reactions forming excessive concentrations of
toxic disinfection by-products. In the case of solar or heat treatments, the vessel must be capable
of withstanding high temperatures, and depending on the type of solar treatment, they must allow
the penetration of UV radiation and/or the absorption of heat energy.

Overall, the properties of household water collection, treatment and storage vessels must be
compatible with the intended uses (collection, treatment and storage), meet the daily water
volume needs of the household, be practical and manageable for the users (women, men or
children) and be socio-culturally acceptable.

2.3. Water Treatment Methods - Overview and Historical Perspective
The various physical and chemical methods for water treatment at the household level or point-
of-use are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. These methods are listed along with
categorizations (listed as high medium and low) of their availability and practicality, technical
difficulty, cost and microbial efficacy. Availability, practicality and technical difficulty are
considered on a worldwide basis, including availability, practicality and technical difficulty for
use at the household level. Cost is categorized as low, medium and high on a worldwide basis
including the poorest people. Categories for annual household cost estimates in US dollars are
less than $10 for low, >$10-100 for moderate and >$100 for high. Clearly, these cost categories
will be different for different economic situations in different regions and countries of the world.
The categories for microbial efficacy are based on estimated order-of-magnitude or log10
reductions of waterborne microbes by the treatment technology. The categories are <1 log10
(<90%) is low, 1 to 2 log10 (90-99%) is moderate and >2 log10 (>99% is high). The values of
these categories also may differ in different situations and settings, but they are intended to
distinguish among the various water treatment technologies available for use at the household
level. On this basis, clear differences are discernable in the available candidate technologies for
household water treatment.



                                                10
Most of the methods or processes to purify water and make it safe for drinking and other potable
purposes can be historically traced to ancient versions of them used since recorded history
(Baker, 1948; Jahn, 1980). The practice of many of these water purification methods since
ancient times has been documented by pictorial, written and archaeological records from a
variety of original sources and recounted by scholars and historians of water treatment and water
quality (Baker, 1948). Although the ancients may not have been aware of how such treatments
improved the microbiological quality of water, they apparently were aware of and appreciated
the benefits of these methods in making the water more healthful by reducing disease and
improving its aesthetic qualities. Recorded in ancient history are the physical methods of
sedimentation, filtration, boiling or heating, and exposure to sunlight (UV irradiation and
heating), and the chemical methods of coagulation or adsorption with alum, lime, and plant
extracts, adsorption with carbon (charcoal), clay and plant materials, and exposure to germicidal
metals such as silver and copper. However, the development and use of chlorine and other
chemical oxidants, such as ozone and chlorine dioxide, for water disinfection are more recent
developments, dating back only to the mid-nineteenth century or later, when modern chemistry
emerged as a science. Two of the earliest methods of generating chlorine, electrolyzing brine
(NaCl) to produce sodium hypochlorite and reacting lime with chlorine gas to produce bleaching
powder (calcium hypochlorite), are still widely used today. They are the basis for some of the
most promising systems to produce chlorine for water treatment at the household level.

Most of the physical and chemical methods for on-site or point-of-use treatment of household
water in developing countries are also employed in developed countries, either at point-of-use or
in community (municipal) water treatment systems, using the same or similar technologies
(AWWA, 1999; LeChevallier and Au, 2000). In developed countries, a number of point-of-use
treatment technologies not widely employed in community water systems also have been
employed, including various filters, adsorbents, ion exchange resins and softeners (Geldreich and
Reasoner, 1990).      Key differences in the application of these technologies in developing
countries compared to developed countries are in the availability and affordability of the
materials and the need to adapt the technologies to local conditions and personal or community
preferences. Furthermore, point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment devices or systems in
developed countries are often being applied to waters already subjected to extensive treatment,
including disinfection, or withdrawn from high quality water sources. Hence, such waters are
already likely to be relatively safe or low risk with respect to microbial quality and waterborne
disease risks without point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment. In many developing countries as
well as in many settings in developed countries, point-of-use, point-of-entry and household
treatment often must be applied to water that is microbiologically contaminated. Therefore, the
treatment requirements to achieve acceptable microbiological quality can be substantial and only
some technologies or unit process will be capable of meeting this objective.

3. Heat and UV Radiation
Overall, the results of both microbiological and epidemiological indicate that solar disinfection
of household water has the ability to appreciably improve its microbial quality and to reduce
household diarrheal disease of consumers.           Additional epidemiological studies to better
document the extent of diarrheal disease reduction are recommended because available studies
are limited to only one geographic region, Kenya, and study population, Maasai children.
Apparently, additional epidemiological studies are now in progress (Mintz et al., 2001). Because
of its simplicity, low cost, and the need for only beverage bottles and sunlight, solar disinfection
is an appropriate technology for disinfection of household water in the developing world.

The UV radiation technology is simple to use and highly effective for inactivating microbes in
drinking water, and it does not introduce chemicals or cause the production of harmful
disinfection by-products in the water. While UV lamp disinfection systems have been widely
used to disinfect drinking water at the community and household levels, no epidemiological
studies of intervention type that document health impacts at the household level have been
reported for this technology. There are no reasons to doubt the efficacy of sound UV lamp
disinfection technology to adequately disinfect either household or community drinking water
when properly applied. However, field studies documenting the ability of this technology to
disinfect household drinking water and reduce diarrhea and other waterborne diseases are
recommended. Such studies would validate the expected performance of this technology and
provide further evidence that the technology is reliable and capable of being used successfully by
individuals and communities. Such documentation is needed because UV lamp disinfection has
some disadvantages for use as a drinking water disinfectant at the household level. It does not
provide a chemical disinfectant residual to protect the water from recontamination or microbial
regrowth after treatment. Particulates, turbidity and certain dissolved constituents can interfere
with or reduce microbial inactivation efficiency. A reliable and affordable source of electricity is
required to power the UV lamps. The UV lamps require periodic cleaning, especially for
systems using submerged lamps, and they have a finite lifespan and must be periodically
replaced. The technology is of moderate to high cost when used at the household level. Despite
these drawback and limitations, UV irradiation with lamps is a recommended technology for
disinfection of household and community water.

3.1 Boiling or heating with fuel
Boiling or heating of water with fuel has been used to disinfect household water since ancient
times. It is effective in destroying all classes of waterborne pathogens (viruses, bacteria and
bacterial spores, fungi and protozoans and helminth ova) and can be effectively applied to all
waters, including those high in turbidity or dissolved constituents. Although some authorities
recommend that water be brought to a rolling boil for to 1 to 5 minutes, the WHO GDWQ
recommend bringing the water to a rolling boil as an indication that a high temperature has been
achieved. These boiling requirements are likely to be well in excess of the heating conditions
needed to dramatically reduce most waterborne pathogens, but observing a rolling boil assures
that sufficiently high temperatures have been reached to achieve pathogen destruction.

Although boiling is the preferred thermal treatment for contaminated water, heating to
pasteurization temperatures (generally $60o C) for periods of minutes to tens of minutes will
destroy most waterborne pathogens of concern. Even heating to as little as 55o C for several



                                                13
hours has been shown to dramatically reduce non-sporeforming bacterial pathogens as well as
many viruses and parasites, including the waterborne protozoans Cryptosporidium parvum,
Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica (Feachem et al., 1983; Sobsey and Leland, 2001). In
many situations, however, it is not possible to monitor the temperature of the water with a
thermometer or other temperature sensor such as a melting wax visual indicator system. Unless
such temperature monitoring is possible, caution is recommended in attempting to pasteurize
waters at non-boiling temperatures.

It is also recommended that the water is stored in the same container in which it has been boiled
or heated, preferably one with a lid or other protected opening, in order to reduce opportunities
for recontamination. It is further recommended that boiled or heat-treated water be consumed
soon after it has cooled and preferably within the same day. This is because of the potential for
microbial recontamination during prolonged storage. Introduction of microbes from hands,
utensils and other sources is a major concern. A major disadvantage of boiling is its
consumption of energy in relation to the availability, cost and sustainability of fuel. It is
estimated that 1 kilogram of wood is needed to boil 1 liter of water. In areas of the world where
wood, other biomass fuels or fossil fuels are in limited supply and must be purchased, the costs
of boiling water are prohibitive. Therefore, boiling household water is unrealistic and
inaccessible for many of the world's poorest people due to the scarcity and high cost of fuels and
the lack of sustainability of biomass or fossil fuels in the community or region. In some areas of
the world the use of wood and wood-derived fuels is also a concern because it contributes to the
loss of woodlands and the accompanying ecological damage caused by deforestation. However,
where affordable and sustainable sources of fuel are available without causing environmental
degradation, heating household water to a rolling boil is an effective and accessible method of
treatment for collected household water.

3.2 Thermal Treatment with Solar Radiation and Solar Cooking
Although boiling with fuel may be a prohibitive option for household treatment of water, heating
water, other liquids and other foods to lower temperatures using solar radiation is a more
accessible, economical and technologically feasible option than heating with fuel. Treatment of
water with solar radiation was practiced in ancient India more than 2000 B.C.E. The ability of
solar radiation to disinfect has been recognized in modern times at least since studies at by Acra
at al. (1984) at The American University of Beirut, Lebanon. Since then, it has been shown that
water can be heated to temperatures of $55o C in transparent bottles (e.g., clear plastic beverage
bottles) exposed to sunlight for several hours, especially if the bottle is painted black on one side
or is lying on a dark surface that collects and radiates heat (Wegelin et al., 1994; Joyce et al.,
1996). This method of treatment utilizes both the UV radiation in sunlight as well as the thermal
effects of sunlight to inactivate waterborne microbes, and will be discussed in detail in the next
section of this report. Alternatively, if the exterior of the vessel is completely black or similarly
capable of absorbing heat (e.g., most metal containers), only thermal effects occur and
temperatures can reach >60o C. At these temperatures, water and other liquids can be pasteurized
because most enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites are rapidly inactivated (Ciochetti and
Metcalf, 1984). Furthermore, if a dark, opaque container is more highly exposed to solar
radiation using a solar reflector or solar cooker, the water temperature can reach $65o C, a
pasteurization temperature capable of inactivating nearly all enteric pathogens within several
tens of minutes to hours (Safapour and Metcalf, 1999).



                                                 14
In those parts of the world where solar cooking already is available and widely practiced, solar
pasteurization of water, other beverages and weanling foods is a practical, accessible and
affordable option for household water treatment. Low cost solar reflectors or cookers can be
made from materials as simple and economical as cardboard and aluminum foil. This
technology for water treatment and food preparation has been field tested in many parts of the
world, including Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Vietnam and some countries in the Americas. A
major limitation of solar heating is that only small volumes (#10 liters) of water can be exposed
conveniently at one time per water container and solar reflector. However, using multiple water
containers and alternative solar collectors (e.g., metal roofing material), the volume of water
treatable with solar heat at one time can be substantially increased. Another important limitation
of solar heating is the availability of sunlight, which varies greatly with season, daily weather
(meteorological) conditions and geographic location. However, in many regions of the
developing world, sunlight conditions are suitable for solar heating of water and for cooking
nearly all year long on full sun or part sun days (approximately 200-300 days per year). A third
potential limitation of solar heating to disinfect water is the determination of water temperature.
Thermometers are relatively expensive and may not be available or affordable in many regions
of the developing world. However, several simple, low cost temperature indicators have been
devised. One of the simplest and most effective is a reusable water pasteurization indicator
(WAPI) based on the melting temperature of soybean wax. The WAPI consists of a clear plastic
tube partially filled with a soybean wax that melts at about 70o C and a piece of nylon (e.g., fish)
line attached on each end to stainless steel washers. The WAPI is placed in the water to be
heated with the wax at the top of the tube. When the wax reaches 70o C, it melts and falls to the
bottom of the tube, thereby giving a simple visual indication of when pasteurization conditions
have been achieved. Similar wax indicators have been devised for other target melting
temperatures, depending on the type of wax.

3.3 Solar treatment by combined UV and thermal effects
Treatment to control waterborne microbial contaminants by exposure to sunlight in clear vessels
that allows the combined germicidal effects of both UV radiation and heat also has been
developed, evaluated and put into field practice (Acra et al., 1984; Conroy et al., 1996; 1996;
1999; Joyce et al., 1996; McGuigugan et al., 1998; 1999; Sommer et al., 1997; Wegelin and
Sommer, 1998; Wegelin et al., 1994). A number of different solar treatment systems have been
described, but one of the technically simplest and most practical and economical is the SODIS
system developed by scientists at the Swiss Federal Agency for Environmental Science and
Technology (EAWAG) and its many collaborators and partners. The SODIS system consists of
three basic steps: (1) removing solids from highly turbid (>30 NTU) water by settling or
filtration, if necessary, (2) placing low turbidity (<30 NTU) water in clear plastic bottles of 1-2
liter volume (usually discarded beverage bottles and preferably painted black on one side), and
(3) aerating (oxygenating) the water by vigorous shaking in contact with air, and (4) exposing the
filled, aerated bottles to full sunlight for about 5 hours (or longer if only part sunlight). The
water is exposed to UV radiation in sunlight, primarily UV-A and it becomes heated; both effects
contribute to the inactivation of waterborne microbes. The system is suitable for treating small
volumes of water (<10L), especially if the water has relatively low turbidity (<30 NTU). Clear
plastic bottles are considered preferable by some workers over glass because they are lighter, less
likely to break, and less costly. Bottles made of polyethylene terephthlate (PET) are preferred to



                                                15
those made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), other plastics and most types of glass because they are
less likely to leach harmful constituents into the water. In addition, they are lightweight,
relatively unbreakable, chemically stable and not likely to impart tastes and odors to the water.
PET bottles require period replacement because they can be scratched and they become
deformed if temperatures exceed 65o C. The use of an internal temperature sensor is encouraged
as an aid to determining if a minimum target temperature of 50o C and preferably 55o C or higher
is reached. The reusable sensor contains paraffin wax attached to a screw weight. When the
paraffin melts, the weight drops to indicate that the target temperature has been attained.

The effects of several factors influencing microbial inactivation by solar disinfection are
summarized in Table 5 below. Microbial inactivation by the SODIS system is attributed to the
combined effects of UV radiation in the UV-A range (320 to 400 nm), which is somewhat
germicidal, and heating to temperatures of 50-60o C, which are high enough to extensively
($99.9%) inactivate many enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites in about 1 hour to several hours.
It has been reported that the combined exposure to UV plus heat in the SODIS process has a
synergistic effect on microbial inactivation, producing greater inactivation than predicted by
comparable levels of exposure to either one of the two agents alone. During the exposure period,
UV dose increases to $100 Wh/m2 and the water temperature reaches 55o C or even higher.
However, others report that even non-UV transmissible sunlight when used to heat water to 60o C
in a commercial solar panel system, will inactivate enteric bacteria, spores and viruses (Rijal and
Fujioka, 2001). When treated with heat and no UV or heat with UV for 2-5 hours, fecal
coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, HPC bacteria and coliphage MS2 were reduced by >3 log10 and
Clostridium perfringens spores were 1-2 and nearly 3 log10 , respectively. Under cloudy
conditions bacterial and spore reductions were much lower, they were lower with heat-no UV
than with heat plus UV and temperatures did not reach 50o C. Therefore, achieving a sufficiently
high temperature (preferably 55o C or higher for several hours) is an important factor for
microbial inactivation by solar disinfection systems. Overall, studies have shown that various
bacteria, such as fecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci, and viruses, such as coliphage f2,
rotavirus and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus, in water bottles are reduced extensively (by
several orders of magnitude) when exposed to sunlight for periods of several hours and
sufficiently high temperatures are achieved.


Studies also show that dissolved oxygen in the water contributes to bacterial inactivation, with
much greater reductions of E. coli and enterococci after 3 hours in oxygenated water (~6 log10 )
than in anaerobic water (<2 and <1 log10 , respectively) (Reed, 1996). In subsequent studies total
and fecal coliforms were inactivated by >3 log10 in 6 and 4 hours, respectively, in aerated water
and by #1.5 log10 in anoxic water or water kept from sunlight (indoors) (Meyer and Reed, 2001).
Therefore, aeration of the water by mechanical mixing or agitation is recommended before solar
treatment in bottles. The combined process of oxygenation (aeration) by mixing, followed by
solar radiation exposure for several hours in a clear plastic bottle is also referred to as solar
photooxidative disinfection of SOLAR. Enteric bacteria inactivated by the SOLAR or SODIS
process do not appear to regrow or recover their infectivity.

3.4 Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of solar treatment systems
The advantages of disadvantages of solar treatment systems are summarized in Table 6 below.
Potential limitations of this and perhaps other solar disinfection systems are: the availability of
suitable water containers and other needed materials, lack of sunlight for disinfection, potential
difficulties in treating highly turbid water and the availability of simple methods for reducing the
turbidity of water before solar treatment, lack of a residual disinfectant to protect water during
handling and storage, potential user objections to the technology due to the length of time to treat
the water (several hours or longer) and possible objectionable tastes and odors leached into the
water from the plastic bottles. Despite these limitations, solar disinfection in clear plastic bottles
is one of the most promising and extensively tested methods for disinfection of household water
stored in a container.

In addition to the essential technical components, the SODIS system for drinking water
disinfection also includes important educational, socio-cultural, behavioral and motivational
components, such as education and training, behavior modification and motivational training.
SODIS has been field-tested in many different parts of the world and in many countries,
including South America (Colombia and Bolivia), Africa (Burkino Faso and Togo), Asia (China)
and Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Thailand). It has been introduced and disseminated by both
governments and NGOs and subjected to economic analysis based on actual costs (estimated at 3
US$ per year for a household of 5 people) for willingness to pay. Acceptance rates, based on
willingness to continue use after its introduction as a demonstration project, is reported at to be
>80%. However, when introduction was not adequately supported by community involvement
activities to address educational, socio-cultural, behavioral and motivational issues, community
support for continued use was lower.

3.5 Epidemiological Studies of Solar Disinfection of Household Water
The SODIS system has not been extensively tested for reduction in waterborne disease in
epidemiological studies of the intervention type. However, as shown in Table 7, three reported
studies found measurable reductions in diarrheal disease and cholera in Maasai (Kenyan)
children drinking solar disinfected water (several hours of full sunlight) compared to children
drinking undisinfected water (kept indoors) in the same plastic bottles (Conroy et al., 1996;
1999; 2001). While it is clear from these intervention studies that reductions in diarrheal disease
and cholera by solar disinfection in bottles are achieved in children under 6 years of age, more
studies of this type are needed. This is because it is important to determine the extent of
reduction of diarrheal and other waterborne disease by this system in different geographic



                                                          18
locations having different water quality conditions and different populations at risk.       The
measurement of the microbial quality of the water used by intervention and control groups also
would be desirable to further document the efficacy of the solar disinfection system. While there
are reliable laboratory and field data from studies documenting the inactivation of waterborne
microbes by solar disinfection systems, such documentation has not been included in the
epidemiological studies reported to date. Therefore, the extent of pathogen or microbial
indicator reduction in waters used by those consuming the water and being monitored for
diarrheal and other enteric disease is not known.

3.6 UV Irradiation with Lamp Systems
The germicidal activity of ultraviolet radiation from lamps was recognized in the late 1800s and
disinfection of drinking water and other media with UV lamps has been practiced since the early
part of the 20th century (Baker 1948, Blatchley and Peel, 2001; 1948; Sobsey, 1989; Ward,
1893). This method of drinking water disinfection has received renewed interest in recent years
because of its well-documented ability to extensively (>99.9%) inactivate two waterborne,
chlorine-resistant protozoans, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts, at
relatively low doses (<10 mJ/cm2 ).

UV disinfection is usually accomplished with mercury arc lamps containing elemental mercury
and an inert gas, such as argon, in a UV-transmitting tube, usually quartz. Traditionally, most
mercury arc UV lamps have been the so-called "low pressure" type, because they operate at
relatively low partial pressure of mercury, low overall vapor pressure (about 2 mbar), low
external temperature (50-100o C) and low power. These lamps omit nearly monochromatic UV
radiation at a wavelength of 254 nm, which is in the optimum range for UV energy absorption by
nucleic acids (about 240-280 nm). In recent years medium pressure UV lamps that operate at
much higher pressures, temperatures and power levels and emit a broad spectrum of higher UV
energy between 200 and 320 nm have become commercially available. However, for UV
disinfection of drinking water at the household level, the low-pressure lamps and systems are
entirely adequate and even preferred to medium pressure lamps and systems. This is because
they operate at lower power, lower temperature, and lower cost while being highly effective in
disinfecting more than enough water for daily household use. An essential requirement for UV
disinfection with lamp systems is an available and reliable source of electricity. While the power
requirements of low-pressure mercury UV lamp disinfection systems are modest, they are
essential for lamp operation to disinfect water.




                                                 19
3.7 UV Inactivation of microbes in water
At sufficiently high doses, all waterborne enteric pathogens are inactivated by UV radiation. The
general order of microbial resistance (from least to most) and corresponding UV doses for
extensive (>99.9%) inactivation are: vegetative bacteria and the protozoan parasites
Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia at low doses (1-10 mJ/cm2 ) and enteric viruses
and bacterial spores at high doses (30-150 mJ/cm2 ). Most low-pressure mercury lamp UV
disinfection systems can readily achieve UV radiation doses of 50-150 mJ/cm2 in high quality
water, and therefore efficiently disinfect essentially all waterborne pathogens. However,
dissolved organic matter, such as natural organic matter, certain inorganic solutes, such as iron,
sulfites and nitrites, and suspended matter (particulates or turbidity) will absorb UV radiation or
shield microbes from UV radiation, resulting in lower delivered UV doses and reduced microbial
disinfection. Another concern about disinfecting microbes with lower doses of UV radiation is
the ability of bacteria and other cellular microbes to repair UV-induced damage and restore
infectivity, a phenomenon known as reactivation. UV inactivates microbes primarily by
chemically altering nucleic acids (pyrimidine dimers and other alterations). However, the UV-
induced chemical lesions can be repaired by cellular enzymatic mechanisms, some of which are
independent of light (dark repair) and others of which require visible light (photorepair or
photoreactivation). Therefore, achieving optimum UV disinfection of water requires delivering
a sufficient UV dose to induce greater levels of nucleic acid damage and thereby overcome or
overwhelm DNA repair mechanisms.

3.8 UV disinfection systems using lamps
Two alternative configurations or physical systems are used for UV disinfection of small or
household water supplies, submerged lamps or lamps in air and mounted above a thin layer of
the water to be irradiated. In the units with submerged lamps, the lamps are covered with a
protective, UV-penetrable as protection from the electrical hazards associated with water. Water
can be treated on a batch basis by placing the lamp in a container of water for several minutes or
longer, or on a flow-through basis in a housing or channel, with the water flowing parallel or
perpendicular to the lamp(s). In units having the lamps mounted in the air, the UV lamps are in a
metal housing with reflective surfaces that direct the UV radiation downward onto a thin layer of
water flowing through a channel or tray below the lamps. The advantage of the submerged
systems is intimate lamp contact with the water, water-mediated cooling of the lamps, and the
use of housing designs that maximize UV exposure of the water. However, the protective
sleeves over the lamps must be mechanically or chemically cleaned on a regular basis to
overcome fouling by a physical, chemical or biological film that can forms on the sleeve surface,
reducing UV passage into the water. The non-submerged, in-air lamp units have the advantage
of no need for lamp cleaning due to lamp fouling, but there is some loss of UV radiation due
atmospheric and surface absorption. However, both types of UV disinfection system designs are
available for disinfection of household water at point- of-use, point-of-entry or at the community
level .


UV disinfection with lamps has the advantages of being effective for inactivating waterborne
pathogens, simple to apply at the household and community levels, and relatively low cost, while
not requiring the use of chemicals or creating tastes, odors or toxic chemical by-products. The
disadvantages of UV disinfection with lamps are the need for a source of lamps, which have to



                                                20
be replaced periodically (typically every year or two), the need for a reliable source of electricity
to power the lamps, the need for period cleaning of the lamp sleeve surface to remove deposits
and maintain UV transmission, especially for the submerged lamps, and the uncertainty of the
magnitude of UV dose delivered to the water, unless a UV sensor is used to monitor the process.
In addition, UV provides no residual chemical disinfectant in the water to protect against post-
treatment contamination, and therefore care must be taken to protect UV-disinfected water from
post-treatment contamination, including bacterial regrowth or reactivation.

3.9 Costs of UV disinfection for household water
Because the energy requirements are relatively low (several tens of watts per unit or about the
same as an incandescent lamp), UV disinfection units for water treatment can be powered at
relatively low cost using solar panels, wind power generators as well as conventional energy
sources. The energy costs of UV disinfection are considerably less than the costs of disinfecting
water by boiling it with fuels such as wood or charcoal.

UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of
water at the community level are estimated to have costs of 0.02 US$ per 1000 liters of water,
including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit. On
this basis, the annual costs of community UV treatment would be less than US$1.00 per
household. However, if UV lamp disinfection units were used at the household level, and
therefore by far fewer people per unit, annual costs would be considerably higher, probably in
the range of $US10-100 per year. Despite the higher costs, UV irradiation with lamps is
considered a feasible technology for household water treatment.

4. Physical removal processes: sedimentation and filtration

4.1 Microbe size and physical removal from water
Microbes and other colloidal particles can be physically removed from water by various
processes. The sizes of the microbes are especially important for their removal by sedimentation
and filtration. Viruses are the smallest waterborne microbes (20 to about 100 nanometers in size)
and the most difficult to remove by filtration and other size exclusion methods. Bacteria are
somewhat larger than viruses (about 0.5 to 3 micrometers) but too small to be readily removed
by plain sedimentation or settling. Protozoan parasites are the next largest in size (most are
about 3 to 30 micrometers) and only the largest ones are likely to gravity settle at appreciable
rates. Protozoan removal efficiency by filtration varies with parasite size and the effective pore
size of the filter medium. Helminths are multicellular animals, but some are important
waterborne pathogens because their eggs (ova) and waterborne larval stages can be waterborne.
Most helminths of concern in water are large enough to gravity settle at appreciable rates; they
are readily removable by settling and various filtration processes.

Although viruses, bacteria and the smaller protozoans are too small to gravity settle, these
waterborne pathogens are often associated with larger particles or they are aggregated (clumped).
Aggregated or particle-associated microbes are easier to remove by physical processes than the
free or dispersed microbes. Consequently, observed reductions of waterborne microbes by
physical removal processes are sometimes greater than expected or anticipated based strictly on
their individual sizes. In some situations, efforts are made to promote the association of



                                                 21
pathogens with larger particles, such as by coagulation-flocculation, to promote their physical
removal. Such methods will be described in later sections of this report.

4.2 Plain sedimentation or settling
The microbial quality of water sometimes can be improved by holding or storing it undisturbed
and without mixing long enough for larger particles to settle out or sediment by gravity. The
settled water can then be carefully removed and recovered by decanting, ladling or other gentle
methods that do not disturb the sedimented particles. Sedimentation has been practiced since
ancient times using small water storage vessels or larger settling basins, reservoirs and storage
tanks. The advantages and disadvantages of plain sedimentation for household treatment of
water are summarized in Table 8.

Storing water for as little as a few hours will sediment the large, dense particles, such as
inorganic sands and silts, large microbes and any other microbes associated with larger, denser
particles. However, clay particles and smaller microbes not associated with large or dense
particles will not settle under these conditions. Longer settling times, such as overnight or for 1-
2 days, will remove larger microbes, including helminth ova and some parasites, some nuisance
microbes, such as certain algae, and the larger clay particles. Most viruses and bacteria and fine
clay particles are too small to be settled out by simple gravity sedimentation. Therefore,
microbial reductions by plain sedimentation or gravity settling are often low and inconsistent.
Overall reductions of viruses and bacteria by sedimentation rarely exceed 90%, but reductions of
helminth ova and some protozoans can exceed 90%, especially with longer storage times of 1-2
days.

Sedimentation of household water can be done in simple storage vessels, such as pots and
buckets. Care must be taken to avoid disturbing the sedimented particles when recovering the
supernatant water by decanting or other methods. Typically, at least two containers are needed
to settle water: one to act as the settling vessel and another to be the recipient of the supernatant
water after the settling period. Water also can be settled in larger bulk storage systems, such as
cisterns, basins and tanks. Regardless of the sedimentation vessel, it is essential that solids are
removed and the vessel cleaned on a regular basis. When water is sedimented in small collection


                                                       22
or storage vessels, the sediment should be removed and the vessel cleaned after each use. At
minimum, cleaning should be by rinsing with freshly collected source water. More rigorous
physical or chemical cleaning is recommended to avoid the microbial colonization of the vessel
surfaces and the resulting accumulation of a biofilm. For sedimentation in larger, stationary
vessels and basins, such as cisterns and sedimentation tanks (some of which are designed to
collect and store water for individual or small groups of households), protection of the water
during storage, sanitary collection of the supernatant water after settling, and systems and
procedures to clean the storage vessel also are critical

Sedimentation often is effective in reducing water turbidity, but it is not consistently effective in
reducing microbial contamination. However, turbidity reductions often improve microbial
reductions by physical and chemical disinfection processes, such as solar treatment and
chlorination, respectively. Hence, plain sedimentation or gravity settling of highly turbid water
for household use is recommended as a pre-treatment for systems that disinfect water with solar
radiation, chlorine or other chemical disinfectants. Furthermore, sedimentation of particles
improves the aesthetic qualities of the water and thereby increases its acceptance by consumers.
Pre-treatment of turbid household water by sedimentation is recommended because is easy to
perform and requires a minimum of materials or skill. It can be done with as little as two or
more vessels by manually transferring (e.g., pouring and decanting) the water. For turbid waters
containing non-settable solids, sedimentation will be ineffective and alternative methods of
particle removal, such a filtration, are needed.

4.3 Filtration
Filtration is another ancient and widely used technology that removes particles and at least some
microbes from water. As shown in Table 9, a variety of filter media and filtration processes are
available for household or point-of-use treatment of water. The practicality, ease of use,
availability, accessibility and affordability of these filtration media and methods vary widely and
often depend on local factors. The effectiveness of these filtration methods in reducing microbes
also varies widely, depending on the type of microbe and the type and quality of the filtration
medium or system

pathogens, but low (<90%) reductions of viruses and free bacteria, assuming no pre-treatment. With pre-treatment (typically
coagulation), pathogen reductions are typically >99% (high).
**High pathogen reduction means >99%.


4.4 Granular media, rapid rate filters and filter media
Filtration through porous granular media, typically sand or successive layers of anthracite coal
and sand, is the most widely used physical method for water treatment at the community level,
and it has been used extensively for on-site treatment of both community and household water
since ancient times (Oza and Chaudhuri, 1975; Chaudhuri and Sattar, 1990; Logsdon, 1990;
LeChevallier and Au, 2002). A number of different granular media filters for household and
other small-scale uses have been described, including so-called bucket filters, drum or barrel
filters, roughing filters in the form of one or more basins, and above or below grade cistern
filters. Granular media used for water filtration include sand, anthracite, crushed sandstone or
other soft rock and charcoal. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the performance
of granular filter media for removing microbial contaminants by coating or co-mingling sand,
coal and other common negatively charged granular media with metal oxides and hydroxides of
iron, aluminum, calcium or magnesium (Chaudhuri and Sattar, 1990; Chaudhuri and Sattar,
1986; Prasad and Chaudhuri, 1989). Such modified media are positively charged and therefore,
more effective for removing and retaining the negatively charged viruses and bacteria by
electrostatic adsorption (Chaudhuri and Sattar, 1986). Some improved granular media filter-



                                                            24
adsorbers have incorporated bacteriostatic agents, such as silver, in order to prevent the
development of undesirable biofilms that release excessive levels of bacteria into the product
water (Ahammed and Chaudhuri, 1999). The production of these more advanced filter media
containing charge-modified materials and bacteriostatic agents requires specialized skills and
facilities, which are beyond the capabilities of most household users. Such media would have to
be prepared and distributed to communities and households from specialized facilities.
However, naturally occurring, positively charged granular media, such as naturally occurring
iron oxide-coated sands or deposits of iron, aluminum, calcium or magnesium minerals, may be
no more difficult or costly to obtain and prepare for household water filtration than otherwise
similar negatively charged granular media.

A number of different designs and scales (sizes) of rapid, granular media filters are available for
household and community water treatment. For household use bucket filters, barrel filters and
small roughing filters are the main choices. The advantages and disadvantages of these filter
designs are summarized in Table 10.

4.4.1 Bucket filters
 Bucket filter systems of granular media for household use usually require two or three buckets,
one of which has a perforated bottom to serve as the filter vessel. The bucket with the perforated
bottom is filled with a layer of sand, layers of both sand and gravel, or other media. Gravel and
sand media of specified sizes often can be purchased locally. Alternatively, these media can be
prepared locally by passing sand and gravel through metal sieves of decreasing mesh size and
retaining the material in the appropriate size ranges (between 0.1 and 1 mm for sand and about 1-
10 mm for gravel). Sand or other local granular media are placed in plastic or metal buckets
approximately 2.5-gallon (10-liter) to 10-gallon (40-liter) capacity and having bottoms with
perforations (punched with small holes and fitted with a mesh strainer, such as window screen or


                                                   25
piece of cloth) to allow water to drain out. Buckets are filled with several cm of gravel on the
bottom and then a deeper layer of sand (about 40 to 75 cm) on top of the gravel. The granular
medium bucket filter is suspended above a similar size empty bucket with a solid bottom to
collect the water that drains from the filter as water is poured through it. The media of newly
prepared bucket filters, as well as that of larger drum and roughing filters, must be cleaned
initially with water to remove fine material and other impurities. So, the dirty water draining
from new filters is discarded until the filtrate water has a low turbidity. The media of bucket
filters must be cleaned or replaced on a regular basis to remove accumulated particles and to
prevent the development of excessive microbial growths that will degrade water quality. The
frequency of filter media replacement and cleaning depends on local conditions, but typically it
is after a use period of perhaps several weeks.

A number of commercial sources of bucket filters are available and some have been used in both
developing countries for small community and household water treatment. On of the better
known and more widely distributed of these is the so-called commercial, two-bucket, point-of-
use, media filter system. It consists of two 5-gallon plastic buckets with lids, filters and
accompanying assembly fittings and contains both a particulate and a carbon filter. It is
recommended that water be chlorinated before filtration. Use of chlorination adds complexity to
the operation of the filter system and make its use more difficult, less practical and more costly,
especially for the developing world. The system sells for about $US 50.00 and is designed to
provide drinking water for up to 10 people per day. Replacement filter units are about $US
20.00 plus shipping. These costs are beyond the means of the world's poorest people in
developing countries. However, the commercial, two-bucket, point-of-use, media filter system
has been subsidized and distributed in developing countries by NGOs and is used in small
communities, primarily in disaster relief settings.

4.4.2 Drum or barrel filters
A number of different designs for drum or barrel filters having either up-flow or down-flow of
water have been described for use as rapid granular medium filters. These filters are usually 55-
gallon (about 200-liter) capacity steel drums and contain sand and gravel media similar to that
used for bucket filters (Cairncross and Feachem, 1986; IDRC, 1980; Schiller and Droste, 1982).
The filters generally have a cover to prevent the introduction of airborne and other contaminants.
Down-flow filters have a perforated pipe at the bottom to collect the water passing through the
medium and discharge it from the side of the drum. The outlet pipe for filtered water may
discharge the water at the bottom of the drum or it may be configured with an upward bend or
loop to discharge the water at the same level as the top of the media in the filter. Upward flow
filters have a bottom inlet and a rigid perforated or porous plate to support the filter media, which
is usually coarse sand. Water flows in an upward direction and discharged through a side
opening near the top of the drum. As with other granular media filters, the media of drum filters
must be cleaned initially and on a regular basis. Cleaning down-flow filters tends to be
technically more difficult and inconvenient. Water either has to be forced through the filter
media in an up-flow direction in place, so-called backwashing, and the backwash water
discarded, or the media has to be physically removed and replaced with cleaned or fresh media.
Stopping the upward flow of product water and opening a bottom drain plug to discharge down-
flowing dirty water that passes through the filter medium more easily cleans up-flow filters. An
upward flow granular medium filter consisting of two tanks in a vertical series, with the lower



                                                 26
tank containing a layer of charcoal sandwiched between two layers of fine sand and the upper
tank the collector of the filtrate has been designed by UNICEF to treat 40 L of water per day
(Childers and Claasen, 1987). The extent to which this filter reduces microbial contaminants in
water has not been reported. However, if it is anticipated these filters function as typical rapid
granular media filters, pathogen reductions are likely to be no more than 90% and even less
(~50%) for the smallest pathogens, the enteric viruses.

4.4.3 Roughing filters
Simple, low cost, low-maintenance, multi-stage roughing filters for household and community
use have been described and characterized (Galvis et al., 2000; Wegelin and Schertenlieb, 1987;
Wegelin et al., 1991). Typically, these filters are rectangular, multi-compartment basins
constructed of concrete or other materials. They require modest skills for operation and
maintenance, and therefore, are best suited for use by communities or at least multiple
households. However, it is possible for these multi-compartment tanks to be centrally fabricated
and distributed at low cost for placement and final installation at their locations of use. Many of
these filters are designed to use two different sizes of low cost, coarse granular media in two or
three compartments or stages, and such media are generally locally available. In a typical,
design water flows horizontally (or vertically in either an upflow or downflow mode) into an
initial chamber containing fine gravel or coarse sand and then into another chamber or (two
successive chambers) containing coarse or medium sand having smaller particle sizes than the
initial chambers and from which is then discharged as product water. For highly turbid water
containing settleable solids, a horizontal or vertical sedimentation basin to remove this coarse
material prior to filtration precedes the filter. The filter has provision for backwashing the
medium from a valved inlet (at the bottom of the filter medium chamber in the horizontal and
downflow filter designs). Roughing filters usually consist of differently sized filter material
decreasing successively in size in the direction of flow. Most of the solids are separated by the
coarse filter medium near the filter inlet, with additional removal by the subsequent medium and
fine granular media in subsequent compartments. Roughing filters are operated at relatively low
hydraulic loads or flow rates. Regular backwashing is required to main flow rates and achieve
efficient particulate removals, and therefore, some skill and knowledge is required to properly
operate and maintain a roughing filter. Removal of indicator bacteria by roughing filters has
been reported to be 90-99%. Although not reported, it is expected that compared to bacteria
removals, virus removals would be lower and parasite removals would be similar to or higher.

4.4.4 Filter-cisterns
Filter-cisterns have been in use since ancient times in areas heavily supplied with rainwater or
other water sources but lacking land area for reservoir or basin storage (Baker, 1948). In this
filtration system cisterns or large diameter well casings, partially below grade, are surrounded by
sand filters, such that water flows through the sand and into the casing or cistern either from the
bottom or though side of the casing near the bottom. Such filter-cisterns function as infiltration
basins to remove turbidity and other particulates. Among the best known of these filter-cistern
systems were those of the city of Venice, which date back at least several hundred years (to the
mid-15th century). The sand filter rings were several meters deep and in the shape of an inverted
cone or pyramid in the center of, which was a cylindrical cistern or well casing that, collected the
filtered water. The Venetian filter-cisterns were recognized for their ability to provide "clear and




                                                27
pure" water free "bad qualities". Today, filter-cisterns are being used in Sri Lanka to treat and
store rainwater from roof catchment systems (Stockholm Water Symposium, 2000).

4.4.5 Biomass and fossil fuel granular media filters
Historically, depth filters composed of filter media derived from vegetable and animal matter
have been employed for water treatment. Coal-based and charcoal filter media have been used
since ancient times and carbon filter media are widely used today for both point-of-use and
community water filtration systems (Argawal and Kimondo, 1981; Baker, 1948; Chaudhuri and
Sattar, 1990). Filters containing sponges were widely used for on-site or point-of-use household
and military water treatment in 18th century France. Water vessels had holes in their sides into
which sponges were pressed, and water was filtered as it passed through the compressed
sponges. Other filter designs consisted of sponges compressed into a perforated plate through
which water was poured. Sponge filters imparted objectionable tastes and odors to the water
unless they were cleaned regularly, indicating that microbial growths and biofilms probably were
a major problem with these filters. Other media also employed in these point-of-use filters
included sand, cotton, wool, linen, charcoal and pulverized glass, either individually or in various
combinations as successive layers. These media also were used in larger scale filters for
community water supply. Other examples of vegetable matter depth filters are those containing
burnt rice hulls (as ash) or those consisting of vessels or chambers containing fresh coconut
fibers and burnt rice husks in series (Argawal and Kimondo, 1981; Barnes and
Mampitiyarachichi, 1983).

4.4.6 Microbial reductions by rapid granular media filters and recommended uses
Rapid granular media filters of the types described above are capable of reducing turbidities and
enteric bacteria by as much as 90% and reducing larger parasites such as helminth ova by >99%.
Because of their small size (typically <0.1 micrometer), enteric viruses are not appreciably
removed by rapid granular media, with typical removals of only 50%-90%. These filters remove
only viruses associated with other, larger particles or aggregated in larger particles. When
roughing filters have been applied to highly turbid surface waters, removals have ranged from
about 50 to 85% for bacteria and yeast's, with microbial removal efficiency depending on the
type of filter medium (El-Taweel and Ali, 2000). The reduction of viruses and bacteria in rapid
granular medium filters can be greatly increased (to >99%) if the filter medium is positively
charged. This is accomplished by combining granular media such as coal (lignite, anthracite,
etc.) with positively charged salts, such as alum, iron, lime or manganese. In positively charged
filter media virus and bacteria reductions of 90->99% have been reported (Gupta and
Chaudhuri, 1995; Chaudhuri and Sattar, 1990; Chaudhuri and Sattar, 1986; Prasad and Malay,
1989). Coal treated with alum or a combination of alum and silver was most effective for
microbial reductions. Vegetable matter filters, such as those composed of burnt rice hull ash,
have been reported to dramatically reduce turbidity, reduce bacteria by about 90% and require
media replacement only every 2-4 months in southeast Asia (Argawal et al., 1981). Rice hull ash
filters operated at a flow rate of 1 m3 /m2 /hr reduced E. coli by 90 to 99%, which was higher than
the E. coli removal by a sand filter tested under similar conditions (Barnes and
Mampitiyarachichi, 1983). However, such vegetable matter filters, as well as many of the other
designs of low cost granular media filters, have not been adequately evaluated for their ability to
reduce a wide range of enteric pathogens, including enteric viruses, or their susceptibility to
microbial growths and biofilms that can degrade the quality of the filtered water. Technological



                                                28
methods to modify granular media, such as chemical modification to impart positive surface
charges, can improve microbial removals by filtration. However, such modifications are to
technically demanding to be applied at the household level and therefore, are recommended
primarily for piped community water supply systems.

Overall, simple granular media filters, including bucket, barrel or drum and roughing filters, are
appropriate technologies for water treatment in at the community and perhaps the household
level. They are effective in reducing turbidity but achieve only low to moderate microbe
reductions, unless modified to make the media positively charged. Of these filter designs, the
bucket filter is probably the most appropriate for household use because of its small scale,
simplicity and manual application to quantities of water collected and used by individual
households. Barrel or drum filters and roughing filters are more appropriate for community use
or for sharing among several households within a community. However, none of these filtration
methods achieve consistently high reductions of pathogens, unless chemically modified filter
media are employed or the filtration process is combined with chemical disinfection such as
chlorination. Therefore, granular media filters are best used at pre-treatment processes to reduce
turbidity and provide product water that is more amenable to pathogen reductions by disinfection
processes, such as solar radiation or chlorination. Due to their variable and potentially low
microbe reductions, typical granular medium filters (not containing chemically modified media)
are not recommended a standalone treatment for household water supplies.

4.5 Slow sand filters
Slow sand filtration of drinking water has been practiced since the early 19th century and various
scales of slow sand filters have been widely used to treat water at the community and sometimes
local or household level (Cairncross and Feachem, 1986; Chaudhuri and Sattar, 1990; Droste and
McJunken, 1982; Logsdon, 1990). Most are designed as either barrel filters, basins or galleries
containing a bed of about 1-1.25 meter of medium sand (0.2 to 0.5mm) supported by a gravel
layer incorporating an underdrain system. The filters operate with a constant head of overlying
water and a flow rate of about 0.1 m/hour. Slow sand filtration is a biological process whereby
particulate and microbial removal occurs due the slime layer ("schmutzdecke") that develops
within the top few centimeters of sand. Reductions of enteric pathogens and microbial indicators
are relatively efficient and generally in the range of 99% or more, depending on the type of
microbe. Therefore, microbial reductions by slow sand filtration can be high, if the filters are
properly constructed, operated and maintained. However, slow sand filters often do not achieve
high microbial removals in practice, especially when used at the household level. This is
because of inadequacies in constriction, operation and maintenance and the lack of institutional
support for these activities.

Because of the development of the schmutzdecke and its accumulation of particles removed from
treated water, the top layer (5-10 cm) of sand must be manually removed and replaced on a
regular but usually infrequent basis. The removed sand is generally cleaned hydraulically for
later reuse. Labor to clean larger scale community sand filters has been estimated at 1 to 5 hours
per 100 m2 of filter surface area. Freshly serviced slow sand filters require time for
reestablishment of the schmutzdecke or "ripening" to achieve optimum performance, and
therefore, multiple filter units are recommended. The performance and operation cycles of slow
sand filters is influenced by raw water quality. Highly turbid waters are difficult to filter directly



                                                 29
and may require a pre-treatment procedure, such as sedimentation or roughing filtration, to
reduce turbidity. Slow sand filters are an appropriate, simple and low cost technology for
community water treatment in developing countries. However, they are not recommended for
individual household use because of their relatively large size (surface area), and the needs for
proper construction and operation, including regular maintenance (especially sand scraping,
replacement and cleaning) by trained individuals. Such demands for achieving good
performance are unrealistic because they are beyond the capacities and capabilities of most
households.

4.6 Fiber, fabric and membrane filters
Filters composed of compressed or cast fibers (e.g., cellulose paper), spun threads (cotton) or
woven fabrics (cotton, linen and other cloths) have been used to filter water and other beverages
(e.g., wine) since ancient times. The use of wick siphons made of wool thread and perhaps other
yarns to filter water was well known in the days of Socrates and Plato (about 350 to 425 BCE)
(Baker, 1948). Various compositions, grades and configurations of natural fiber and synthetic
polymer filter media materials continue to be widely used today for point-of-use and small
community water supply systems. In their simplest applications these filters are simply placed
over the opening of a water vessel through which particulate-laden water is poured. Another
simple application is to place a cone shaped filter in a funnel through which water is poured and
collected in a receiver vessel. The particles are removed and collected on the filter media as the
water is poured into the vessel. Other paper and fibrous media filters are in the form of porous
cartridges or thimbles through which water is poured to exit from the bottom, or alternatively,
which are partially submerged in are water so that filtered water passes to the inside and
accumulates within. More advanced applications employ filter holders in the form of porous
plates and other supports to retain the filter medium as water flows through it.

Paper and other fibrous filter media retain waterborne particles, including microbes, by straining
them out based on size exclusion, sedimenting them within the depth of the filter matrix or by
adsorbing them to the filter medium surface. Therefore, removal is dependent on the size, shape
and surface chemistry of the particle relative to the effective pore size, depth and surface
physical-chemical properties of the filter medium. Most fabric (cloth) and paper filters have
pore sizes greater than the diameters of viruses and bacteria, so removal of these microbes is low,
unless the microbes are associated with larger particles. However, some membrane and fiber
filters have pore sizes small enough to efficiently remove parasites (one to several micrometers
pore size), bacteria (0.1-1 micrometer pore size) and viruses (0.01 to 0.001 micrometer pore size
or ultrafilters). Typically, such filters require advanced fabrication methods, special filter
holders and the use of pressure to force the water through the filter media. For these reasons,
such filters and their associated hardware are not readily available and their costs generally are
too high for widespread use to treat household water in many regions and countries. However,
simple fiber, fabric, paper and other filters and filter holders for them are available for
widespread, practical and affordable household treatment of collected and stored water
throughout much of the world.

Some waterborne and water-associated pathogens are relatively large, such as the free-swimming
larval forms (cercariae) of schistosomes and Faciola species, guinea worm larvae within their
intermediate crustacean host (Cyclops), and bacterial pathogens associated with relatively large



                                                30
copepods and other zooplankters in water, such as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Various types
of filters, including fabric and paper filters can physically remove these larger, free-living
pathogens as well as the smaller ones associated with larger planktonic organisms. Paper filters
have been recommended for the removal of schistosomes and polyester or monofilament nylon
cloth filters have been recommended for the removal of the Cyclops vector of guinea worm
(Imtiaz et al., 1990). Such filters have been used successfully at both the household and
community levels (Aikhomu et al., 2000). Colwell and colleagues have shown that various types
of sari cloth (fine mesh, woven cotton fabric) and nylon mesh can be used in single or multiple
layers to remove from water the zooplankton and phytoplankton harboring V. cholerae, thereby
reducing the V. cholerae concentrations by >95 to >99% (Huq et al., 1996). Where waterborne
schistosomes, guinea worms, Faciola species and zooplanton-associated V. cholerae are a
problem, use of these simple, point-of-use filter methods are recommended and encouraged,
especially if other control measures are not available or difficult to implement.
However, typical fabric, paper, monofilament nylon and similar filters are not recommended for
general treatment of household water. This is because the pore sizes of these filters are too large
to appreciably retain viruses, bacteria and smaller protozoan parasites, especially if such
microbes are free and not associated with large particles or organisms. Therefore, other types of
physical or chemical water treatment processes are usually needed to effectively control a wider
range of waterborne or water-associated microbial pathogens in household drinking water
supplies. However, fabric, paper and similar filters can be used in conjunction with coagulation
processes or disinfection processes to achieve improved reductions of particles (turbidity) and
microbes in water. Such combined or multi-step systems are described elsewhere in this report.
Furthermore, the World Health Organization and the international health community strongly
support the use of filtration with fabric, paper and other mesh filter media as an essential
intervention to eradicate guinea worm (dracunculiasis).

4.7 Porous ceramic filters
Porous ceramic filters made of clay, carved porous stone and other media have been used to filter
water since ancient times and were cited by Aristotle (322-354 BCE). Modern accounts of
ceramic filters for household use date back to at least the 18th century (Baker, 1948). Most
modern ceramic filters are in the form of vessels or hollow cylindrical "candles". Water
generally passes from the exterior of the candle to the inside, although some porous clay filters
are designed to filter water from the inside to the outside. Many commercially produced ceramic
filters are impregnated with silver to act as a bacteriostatic agent and prevent biofilm formation
on the filter surface and excessive microbial levels in the product water. However, all porous
ceramic media filters require regular cleaning to remove accumulated material and restore
normal flow rate. Porous ceramic filters can be made in various pore sizes and most modern
ceramic filters produced in the developed countries of the world are rated to have micron or sub-
micron pore sizes that efficiently remove bacteria as well as parasites. Many ceramic filters are
composed of media capable of adsorbing viruses and in principle can achieve high virus removal
efficiencies. However, because adsorption sites for viruses often become occupied by competing
adsorbents, virus adsorption efficiency decreases with increased use and may become inefficient,
unless physical or chemical cleaning procedures can restore the virus adsorption sites.

Porous ceramic filters are made of various mineral media, including various types of clays,
diatomaceous earth, glass and other fine particles. The media are blended, shaped by manual or



                                                31
mechanical methods, dried and then fired at various temperatures to achieve different pore sizes
and filtration properties. Some are unfired to maintain an open pore structure for filtration. Most
ceramic filters are easy to use and are a potentially sustainable technology. The availability of
suitable raw materials and the appropriate technology to blend these raw materials, shape the
filter units and then perhaps fire them in a kiln are the main technical and accessibility barriers to
their availability in developing countries. The need for inspection and other quality control
measures, as well as appropriate testing for proper pore size are also important requirements for
their production. Some units are brittle and fragile and therefore, can break during use. Broken
filters, even if only slightly cracked, are unsuitable for removal of particles and microbial
contaminants from water.

Ceramic filters for point-of-use water treatment are being produced and have come into
widespread use in many parts of the world. Ceramic filters containing fired clay, limestone, lime
and calcium sulfate have been produced for water filtration in Pakistan (Jaffar et al., 1990).
These filters were found to reduce turbidity by 90% and bacteria by 60%. Ceramic filter candles
that are 6 cm diameter and 11 cm long have been produced commercially in Cote d'Ivoire for
less than US$10 (Ceramiques d'Afrique) and other low cost ceramic filters are being produced in
different parts of the developing world with the assistance of the organization Potters for Peace.
The extent to which ceramic filters being produced in the developing world have been or are
being tested for reductions of waterborne microbes such as viruses, bacteria and parasites and
their waterborne diseases in uncertain at this time. Such performance evaluation for microbial
reductions would be valuable information and provide a basis verifying the quality of the filters.
Ceramic filters manufactured commercially in various countries of the developed world, such as
the United Kingdom and the United States of America, have been extensively tested for efficacy
in reducing various waterborne microbial contaminants and many are certified for their
performance microbial characteristics. Some of these are rated to remove at least 99.9999% of
bacteria, such as Klebsiella terrigena, 99.99% of viruses, such as polioviruses and rotaviruses,
and 99.9% of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts as required for Point-of-Use
Microbiological Water Purifiers in the United States (USEPA, 1987). These filters tend to be
more costly than most of those produced in developing countries, and therefore, their
accessibility, affordability and sustainability for household water treatment by the poorest people
in developing countries is uncertain at this time.

Overall, ceramic filters are recommended for use in water treatment at the household level. The
main barriers to the production, distribution and use of fired or unfired ceramic filter-adsorbers
are the availability of trained workers, fabrication and distribution facilities and cost. Further
efforts are needed to define and implement appropriate manufacturing procedures and product
performance characteristics of these filters in order to achieve products of acceptable quality that
are capable of adequate microbe reductions from water. A simple and affordable method to test
the quality and integrity of these filters also is recommended for use in situations where more
technically demanding and costly testing is not available. . Quality and performance criteria and
data for ceramic filters made in the developing world would provide a basis to judge quality and
verify acceptable performance. However, the use of any intact ceramic filter to treat household
water is likely to provide some improvement in water quality and therefore is preferable to no
water treatment at all.

4.8 Diatomaceous earth filters
Diatomaceous earth (DE) and other fine granular media also can be used to remove particulates
and microbial contaminants from water by so-called precoat and body feed filtration. Such
filters have achieved high removal efficiencies of a wide range of waterborne microbial
contaminants without chemical pre-treatment of the water (Cleasby, 1990; Logsdon, 1990). A
thin layer or cake of the fine granular or powdery filter medium is precoated or deposited by
filtration onto a permeable material held by a porous, rigid support to comprise a filter element.
The water to be filtered often is supplemented with more filter medium as so-called body feed.
As water passes through the filter, particulates are removed along with the body feed filter
medium. This system maintains target flow rates while achieving high efficient particulate
removal. DE filters also are capable of moderate to high pathogen removals (Logsdon, 1990).
Eventually, the accumulation of impurities requires the removal of accumulated filter medium,
cleaning of the filter medium support and reapplication of filter medium precoat to start the
process over again. Although such DE and other precoat-body feed filter systems are used for
small scale and point-of-use water treatment, they require a reliable, affordable source of
filtration medium, regular care and maintenance, and they produce a spent, contaminated filter
medium that may be difficult to dispose of properly. In addition, the filter media are difficult to
handle when dry because as fine particles they pose a respiratory hazard. Because of these
drawbacks, DE filters are not likely to be widely use for household water treatment in many parts
of the world and in many settings, and therefore, they are not recommended for this purpose.

4.9 Aeration
Aeration of water alone is simple, practical, and affordable, especially if done manually in a
bottle or other vessel. Aeration of water as been practiced since ancient times and was believed
to improve water quality by "sweetening" and "softening" it (Baker, 1948). It was later
discovered that aeration indeed oxygenated anaerobic waters and that such a process would
oxidize and precipitate reduced iron, manganese and sulfur, as well as strip volatile organic
compounds, some taste and odor compounds, and radon. However, there is no evidence that
aeration for brief time periods (minutes) has a direct microbiocidal effect. However, aeration of
water introduces oxygen, which can cause chemical reactions, such as precipitation in anaerobic
water containing certain dissolved solutes, and which can contribute indirectly to other process
that may lead to microbial reductions. In addition, studies suggest that aeration has a synergistic
effect with sunlight and heat on disinfection by solar radiation of water held in clear bottles. The
mechanisms of this effect are not fully understood. However, they may involve conversion of
molecular oxygen to more microbiocial chemical species by photooxidation reactions with
microbial components or other constituents in the water, leading to photodynamic inactivation.
Further studies of the ability of aeration to inactivate microbes in water either alone or in
combination with other agents needs further study. Currently, there is no clear evidence that
aeration alone is capable of appreciably and consistently reducing microbes in water.


5. Chemical Methods of Water Treatment

A number of chemical methods are used for water treatment at point-of-use or entry and for
community water systems. These methods can be grouped into several main categories with
respect to their purpose and the nature of the technology. The main categories to consider here
are:    (1) chemical pre-treatments by coagulation-flocculation or precipitation prior to
sedimentation or filtration, (2) adsorption process, (3) ion exchange processes and (4) chemical
disinfection processes. All of these processes can contribute to microbial reductions from water,
but the chemical disinfection processes are specifically intended to inactivate pathogens and
other microbes in water. Therefore, chemical disinfection processes appropriate for household
water treatment in the developing world will be the focus of attention in this section of the report.
Other chemical methods for water treatment will be examined for their efficacy in microbial
reductions and their applicability to household water treatment.

5.1 Chemical coagulation, flocculation and precipitation

5.1.1 Introduction
Chemical precipitation or coagulation and flocculation with various salts of aluminum (e.g.,
alum), iron, lime and other inorganic or organic chemicals are widely used processes to treat
water for the removal of colloidal particles (turbidity) and microbes. Treatment of water by the
addition of chemical coagulants and precipitants has been practiced since ancient times, even
though the principles and physico-chemical mechanisms may not have been understood.
Sanskrit writings refer to the use of vegetable substances, such as the seed contents of Strychnos
potatorum and Moringa oleifera, which are still in use today for household water treatment
(Gupta and Chaudhuri, 1992). Judeo-Christian, Greek and Roman records document adding



                                                 34
"salt", lime, "aluminous earth", pulverized barley, polenta as precipitants to purify water.
Although alum and iron salts are the most widely used chemical coagulants for community
drinking water treatment, other coagulants have been and are being used to coagulate household
water at point of use, including alum potash, crushed almonds or beans and the contents of
Moringa and Strychnos seeds. Table 12 lists some the coagulants that have been and are being
used for water treatment at the community and household level, their advantages and
disadvantages and their costs.

Chemical coagulation-flocculation enhances the removal of colloidal particles by destabilizing
them, chemically precipitating them and accumulating the precipitated material into larger "floc"
particles that can be removed by gravity settling or filtering. Flocculation causes aggregation
into even larger floc particles that enhances removal by gravity settling or filtration. Coagulation
with aluminum or iron salts results in the formation of insoluble, positively charged aluminum or
iron hydroxide (or polymeric aluminum- or iron-hydroxo complexes) that efficiently attracts
negatively charged colloidal particles, including microbes.            Coagulation-flocculation or
precipitation using lime, lime soda ash and caustic soda is used to "soften" water, usually ground
water, by removing (precipitating) calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese and other polyvalent,
metallic cations that contribute to hardness. However, reductions in microbial contaminants as
well as turbidity, and dissolved and colloidal organic matter are also achieved in this process.




                                                         35
5.1.2 Microbial reductions by coagulation-flocculation
Optimum coagulation to achieve maximum reductions of turbidity and microbes requires careful
control of coagulant dose, pH and consideration of the quality of the water being treated, as well
as appropriate mixing conditions for optimum flocculation. Lack of attention to these details can
result in poor coagulation-flocculation and inefficient removal of particles and microbes. Under
optimum conditions, coagulation-flocculation and sedimentation with alum and iron can achieve
microbial reductions of >90 to >99% for all classes of waterborne pathogens (Sproul, 1974,
Leong, 1982, Payment and Armon, 1989). However, poor microbial reductions occur (<90%)
when coagulation-flocculation or precipitation conditions are sub-optimal (Ongerth, 1990). Even
greater microbial reductions (>99.99%) can be achieved with lime coagulation-flocculation or
precipitation if high pH levels are achieved in the process (pH >11) to cause microbial
inactivation as well as physical removal.

5.1.3 Alum and iron coagulation
Because coagulation-flocculation treatment with alum, iron and other coagulants requires
knowledge, skills to optimize treatment conditions, it is generally considered to be beyond the
reach of most consumers. Most authorities consider such treatment to be best performed in
specialized central facilities by trained personnel. This type of treatment is less likely to be
performed reliably at point-of-use for household water treatment. Furthermore, the limited
availability and relatively high costs of alum and ferric salts in some places present additional
obstacles to widespread implementation of this technology at the household level.

Despite the caveats and limitations, alum coagulation and precipitation to remove turbidity and
other visible contaminants from water at the household level has been traditionally practiced for
centuries in many parts of the world (Jahn and Dirar, 1979; Gupta and Chaudhuri, 1992). When
potash alum was evaluated for household water treatment in a suburban community in Myanmar
by adding it to water in traditional storage vessels (160L capacity) at 500 mg/L, fecal coliform
contamination was reduced by 90-98% and consumer acceptance of the treated water was high
(Oo et al., 1993). The ability of the intervention to reduce diarrheal disease was not reported. In
another study, alum potash was added to household water stored in pitchers of families with an
index case of cholera and intervention and control (no alum potash) households were visited to
10 successive days to track cases of enteric illness (Khan et al., 1984). Illness among family
members was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in intervention households (9.6%) than in control
households (17.7%). The authors concluded that household water treatment by adding a pinch of
alum potash was effective in reducing cholera transmission during outbreaks and was an
appropriate and low cost (1 cent per 20 liters) intervention.

5.1.4 Seed extract coagulation-flocculation
Coagulation-flocculation with extracts from natural and renewable vegetation has been widely
practiced since recorded time, and appears to be an effective and accepted physical-chemical
treatment for household water in some parts of the world. In particular, extracts from the seeds
of Moringa species, the trees of which are widely present in Africa, the Middle East and the
Indian subcontinent, have the potential to be an effective, simple and low-cost coagulant-
flocculent of turbid surface water than can be implemented for household water treatment (Jahn
and Dirar, 1979; Jahn, 1981; Jahn, 1988; Olsen, 1987). The effectiveness of another traditional
seed or nut extract, from the nirmali plant or Strychnos potatorum (also called the clearing nut)



                                                36
to coagulate-flocculate or precipitate microbes and turbidity in water also has been determined
(Tripathi et al., 1976; Able et al, 1984). Microbial reductions of about 50% and 95% have been
reported for plate count bacteria and turbidity, respectively. Despite the potential usefulness of
Moringa oleifera, Strychnos potatorum and other seed extracts for treatment of turbid water,
there has been little effort to characterize the active agents in these seed extracts or evaluate the
efficacy as coagulants in reducing microbes from waters having different turbidities. The
chemical composition of the coagulant in Strychnos potatorum has been identified as a
polysaccharide consisting of a 1:7 mixture of galactomannan and galactan. These findings
suggest that such seed extracts may function as a particulate, colloidal and soluble polymeric
coagulant as well as a coagulant aid. The presence of other constituents in these seed extracts are
uncertain, and there is concern that they may contain toxicants, because the portions of the plant
also are used for medicinal purposes. Also, little has been done define, optimize and standardize
conditions for their use. Furthermore, there appears to be little current effort to encourage or
disseminate such treatment for household water or determine its acceptability, sustainability,
costs and effectiveness in reducing waterborne infectious disease.

5.1.5 Summary
The results of several studies suggest that alum and other coagulation-flocculation or chemical
precipitation methods can be applied at the household level to improve the microbiological
quality of water and reduce waterborne transmission of diarrheal disease in developing countries.
However, further studies are needed to determine if this type of treatment can be effectively,
safely, and affordably applied for household water at point of use by the diverse populations
living in a variety of settings. Furthermore, it is uncertain if household use of coagulation-
flocculation can be optimized to provide efficient and consistent microbial reductions on a
sustainable basis. Therefore, household water treatment by coagulation-flocculation and
precipitation is not be widely recommended at this time. More information is needed on the
effectiveness, reliability, availability, sustainability and affordability of these processes when
applied at the household level. However, newer approaches to treatment of collected and stored
household water have combined chemical coagulation-flocculation with chemical disinfection to
achieve both efficient physical removal as well as inactivation of waterborne microbes. These
systems offer great promise as effective, simple and affordable household water treatment
technologies. These systems and their performance are described in a later section of this report.

5.2 Adsorption processes
5.2.1 Introduction
Adsorption processes and adsorbents such as charcoal, clay, glass and various types of organic
matter have been used for water treatment since ancient times. Some of these adsorption
processes tend to overlap with either filtration processes, because the media are often used in the
form of a filter through which water is passed, or coagulation processes, because they may be
combined with chemical coagulants. Therefore, adsorption processes can be carried out
concurrently with filtration or coagulation. The candidate media potentially used for adsorption
treatment of household water are shown in Table 13.

5.2.2 Clay adsorption
Clay continues to be used as an adsorption medium for household water treatment in some
regions and countries, with applications as clay particles in suspension, as filters (usually fired
ceramic) or in conjunction with a chemical coagulant. Porous, fired ceramic clay filters (and
adsorbers), typically as candles or other vessels have been described in a previous section of this
report. The use of clay in conjunction with chemical coagulants also has been described
elsewhere (Lund and Nissen, 1986; Olsen, 1987). When used alone, clays can decrease turbidity
and microbes in water by about 90-95%. However, some microbes may not efficiently or
consistently adsorb to certain, which reduces the overall efficiency of clay adsorption as a
household water treatment process. Furthermore, the use of clay particles as suspensions in
water is limited by the availability of the material and by the need to control the process so that
the particles will settle, either alone or in the presence of a coagulant or coagulant aid. The use
of such technology for clay adsorption requires training and is best supported by specialized
equipment to carry out and monitor treatment effectiveness. Therefore, clay adsorption is not
well suited for household water treatment.

5.2.3 Charcoal and activated carbon adsorption
Charcoal and activated carbon have been used extensively as adsorbents for water treatment in
the developed and developing world. The main application is the reduction of toxic organic
compounds as well as objectionable taste and odor compounds in the water. In developed
countries granular or powdered activated carbon are used in community water treatment and
granular or pressed carbon block is typically used for point-of-use or household water treatment
(AWWA, 1999; LeChevallier and McFeters, 1990. Although fresh or virgin charcoal or
activated carbon will adsorb microbes, including pathogens, from water, dissolved organic
matter in the water rapidly takes up adsorption sites and the carbon rapidly develops a biofilm.
Therefore, carbon is not likely to appreciably reduce pathogenic enteric microbes in water over



                                                           38
an extended period of time. If anything, carbon particles are prone to shedding heterotrophic
plate count bacteria and other colonizing microbes into the product water, thereby reducing the
microbial quality. In many point-of-use devices the carbon is impregnated or commingled with
silver that serves as a bacteriostatic agent to reduce microbial colonization and control microbial
proliferation in the product water. Fecal indicator bacteria, such as total and fecal coliforms, and
opportunistic bacterial pathogens, such as Aeromonas species are capable of colonizing carbon
particles and appearing in product water. For these reasons, activated carbon is not
recommended as a treatment method to reduce pathogenic microbes in drinking water.
Additional treatment, such as chemical disinfection, often is needed to reduce microbe levels in
carbon-treated water. Mixed media containing carbon along with chemical agents effective in
microbial retention have been developed and evaluated. For example, carbon filters containing
aluminum or iron precipitates have been described, and these filters have achieved appreciable
microbial reduction in laboratory scale tests (Farrah et al., 2000). Therefore, it is possible that
granular activated carbon filter media prepared with chemical agents more effective in retaining
microbes may eventually become more widely available for point-of-use treatment of household
water. However, the conventional charcoal and activated carbon media currently available for
water treatment are not recommended for use at the household level to reduce microbial
contaminants. Only charcoal or activated carbon media that been combined with other materials
to improve microbial reductions should be considered for household treatment of collected and
stores water and then only if there are performance data or certifications to verify effective
microbial reductions.

5.2.4 Vegetative matter adsorbents
Historically, other vegetative matter has been used as an adsorbent for water treatment, as has
been previously noted (Baker, 1948). Of these other plant media, burnt rice hulls seems to have
been the most widely used in recent times (Argawal and Kimondo, 1981; Barnes and
Mampitiyarachichi, 1983). The application of this material has been in the form of a granular
medium filter, either alone or in conjunction with another filter medium, such as sand or
activated (burnt) coconut shell. Use of this water treatment medium is still limited, primarily to
those parts of the world where rice agriculture is widely practiced and where other filter media
are not readily available at low cost. However, these adsorbent materials and their technologies
require further development, evaluation and dissemination before they can be recommended for
household water treatment in other parts of the world.

5.3 Ion exchange processes

5.3.1 Introduction
Ion exchange processes in water treatment have been used primarily for softening (hardness
removal) in both community and point-of-use treatment and for disinfection in point-of-use
treatment. Some ion exchange resins are used to deionize, disinfect or scavenge macromolecules
from water. The main classes of ion exchangers used in water treatment and their advantages,
disadvantages and costs are summarized in Table 14.

5.3.2 Softening, deionizing and scavenging resins
Ion exchange typically employs synthetic polymeric resins that must be centrally manufactured
in specialized production facilities. The costs of these synthetic resins are relatively high and
their availability in developing countries is limited. Ion exchange using natural zeolites has been
applied to softening, chemical adsorption and other purposes in water treatment. However,
natural zeolites have only limited availability worldwide, they require mining and processing
systems that may be beyond the capacity of developing countries, and they have not been widely
evaluated or used for microbial reductions in drinking water. The effects on long-term
consumption of deionised water on health are not fully understood.

Water softening resins are intended to remove hardness and they do not remove or inactivate
waterborne microbes on a sustained basis. Furthermore, softening resins often become colonized
with bacteria, resulting in excessive bacterial levels in product water, and they also increase the
levels of sodium in the product water. In developed countries, point-of-use water treatment
systems employing softening or scavenging resins often include addition treatment methods to
reduce microbial loads in product water. Softening resins are relatively expensive, require
regular monitoring and frequent replacement or recharging (regeneration of exchange capacity of



                                                         40
spent resin); therefore, they are not practical for widespread household use to treated collected
stored water. Because of their inability to reduce microbes, their complexities and other
limitations, as described in Table 14, softening and scavenging resins are not recommended for
household water treatment.

5.3.3 Ion exchange disinfection
Ion exchange disinfection is primarily with iodine in the form of tri-iodide or penta-iodide
exchange resins. Portable and point-of-use iodine exchange resins have been developed and
extensively evaluated for inactivation of waterborne pathogens, primarily in developed countries.
Most of these are in the form of pour through cups, pitchers, columns or other configurations
through which water is passed so that microbes come in contact with the iodine on the resin.
Point-of-use iodine resins have been found to extensively inactivate viruses, bacteria and
protozoan parasites (Marchin et al., 1983; 1985; Naranjo et al., 1997; Upton et al., 1988). While
such iodine exchange disinfection resins are both effective and convenient, they are too
expensive to be used by the world's poorest people and the production and availability of these
resins is limited primarily to some developed countries. As described in the next section of this
report, other chemical disinfection methods besides ion exchange halogen resins are available
and preferred for household treatment to inactivate microbes in collected and stored drinking
water.

5.4 Chemical Disinfection Processes

5.4.1 Chemical disinfectants for drinking water
Chemical disinfection is considered the essential and most direct treatment to inactivate or
destroy pathogenic and other microbes in drinking water. The abilities of chemical disinfectants
to inactivate waterborne microbes and reduce waterborne infectious disease transmission have
been well known since the germ theory was validated in the mid-19th century. However, it was
not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that chlorine became widely recognized as an
effective, practical and affordable disinfectant of drinking water. Subsequently, ozone and
chlorine dioxide were developed as drinking water disinfectants and their ability inactivate
waterborne pathogens was determined.

Today, chemical disinfection of drinking water is widely recognized as safe and effective and is
promoted and practiced at the community level as well as at point-of-use. The preferred and
most widely used chemical disinfectants of drinking water are all relatively strong oxidants,
namely free chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, chloramines (primarily monochloramine), and
oxidants generated by electrolysis of sodium chloride solution (primarily or exclusively free
chlorine). Additional chemical disinfectants sometimes used for drinking water are acids and
bases; these agents inactivate microbes by creating either low or high pH levels in the water,
respectively. The combined use of multiple treatment processes or "barriers" is a widely
embraced principle in drinking water science and technology that is widely applied in
community drinking water supplies, especially for surface waters. This approach also has been
adapted to water treatment at the household level by the use of combined chemical treatments
that are designed to chemically coagulate, flocculate, filter and disinfect the water. The
advantages, disadvantages, costs and practicalities of these disinfectants for household treatment
at the household levels are summarized in Table 15.

Iodine, silver, copper, quaternary ammonium compounds and some other chemical agents have
been proposed and are sometimes used to inactivate waterborne pathogens. However, none of
them are considered suitable for long-term use to disinfect drinking water for various important
and valid reasons. Iodine is difficult to deliver to water and can cause adverse health effects,
silver and copper are difficult to deliver to water and primarily only bacteriostatic, and
quaternary ammonium compounds are limited in availability, costly and not effective against
viruses and parasites. However, iodine, either dissolved in water or in the form of an iodinated
exchange resin, has been used for short-term water treatment by outdoor recreationists (campers,
hikers, etc), field military personnel, and persons displaced by natural disasters and human
conflicts (wars and other societal disruptions). Silver is used as a bacteriostatic agent for point-
of-use or household water treatment by storing water in vessels composed of silver or passing
water through porous or granular filter media impregnated with silver. However, the extent to
which silver alone inactivates microbes in water is limited, bacteria may develop silver resistance
and many microbes, such as viruses, protozoan cysts and oocysts and bacterial spores, are not
inactivated at silver concentrations employed for point-of-use drinking water treatment.
Therefore, these agents are not recommended for routine disinfection of household water.

5.4.2 Factors influencing disinfection efficacy
The ability to inactivate waterborne microbes differs among the commonly used disinfectants as
follows (from most to least potent): ozone > chlorine dioxide $ electrochemically generated
oxidant $ free chlorine > chloramines. It is also noteworthy that these disinfectants differ in
their stability and ability to persist in water to maintain a disinfectant residual. Ozone is a gas
and the least stable in water; it is unable to provide a stable disinfectant residual. Chlorine
dioxide is a dissolved gas in water and capable of persisting typically for periods of hours. Free
chlorine is stable in water and can persist for days if there is no appreciable chlorine demanding
material in the water. Because electrochemically generated oxidant from NaCl is primarily free
chlorine (about 80 to nearly 100%, depending on the electrolysis conditions), it is relatively
stable in water. Chloramines (primarily monochloramine) are the most stable of the listed
disinfectants in water and can persist for many days.

Waterborne microbes also differ in their resistance to the chemical disinfectants used for
drinking water as follows (from greatest to least resistant): parasites (protozoan cysts and oocysts
and helminth ova) $ bacterial spores $ acid-fast bacteria (notably the Mycobacteria) > enteric
viruses > vegetative bacteria. Within each of these major microbe groups there are differences in
the resistance of different sub-groups and specific species or strains of microbes. In addition, the
resistance of waterborne microbes to inactivation by chemical disinfectants is influenced by their
physical and physiological states. Microbes in the form of aggregates (clumps) or embedded
within other matrices (membrane, biofilm, another cell, or fecal matter, for example) are
protected from being reached by chemical disinfectants and by the oxidant demand of the
material in which they are present. This makes the microbes more resistant to inactivation.

The quality of the water to be disinfected also influences microbial inactivation by chemical
disinfectants. Particulate, colloidal and dissolved constituents in water can protect microbes
from inactivation by reacting with and consuming the chemical disinfectant. The microbiocidal


                                                        43
activity of some chemical disinfectants is influenced by the pH of the water, with generally better
inactivation at low pH than at high pH for free chlorine, for example. Further details of the water
quality factors influencing microbial inactivation are presented in detail elsewhere (Sobsey,
1989).

5.4.3 Free chlorine treatment
Of the drinking water disinfectants, free chlorine is the most widely used, the most easily used
and the most affordable. It is also highly effective against nearly all waterborne pathogens, with
notable exceptions being Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Mycobacteria species (Sobsey,
1989). At doses of a few mg/l and contact times of about 30 minutes, free chlorine generally
inactivates >4 log10 (>99.99%) of enteric bacteria and viruses. For point-of-use or household
water treatment, the most practical forms of free chlorine are liquid sodium hypochlorite, solid
calcium hypochlorite and bleaching powder (chloride of lime; a mixture of calcium hydroxide,
calcium chloride and calcium hypochlorite). Bleaching powder is less desirable as a drinking
water disinfectant because it may contain other additives that are undesirable in drinking water
(detergents, fragrances, abrasives, etc). and because it is somewhat unstable, especially if
exposed to the atmosphere or to water.

In addition to the well-documented evidence that free chlorine effectively inactivates waterborne
microbes and greatly reduces the risks of waterborne disease in community water supplies, there
is considerable evidence of the same beneficial effects in point-of-use and household water
supplies. Table 16 summarizes the results of carefully designed intervention studies
documenting the ability of free chlorine to reduce microbes and to reduce household diarrheal
disease when used to disinfect household drinking water in developing countries. The results of
these studies show conclusively that chlorination and storage of water in either a "safe"
(specially designed) vessel or even a traditional vessel reduces diarrheal disease by about 20-
48% and significantly improves the microbial quality of water (by reducing thermotolerant (or
fecal) coliforms, E. coli, V. cholerae and other microbial contaminants). Most of the recent
studies on chlorination of household water have been done by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and its many partners and collaborators around the world (CDC,
2001). The CDC intervention includes a hygiene education component and the use of a plastic,
narrow-mouth water storage vessel with a spigot designed to minimize post-treatment
contamination. Therefore, the beneficial effects of this chlorination system in the form of
improved microbial quality and reduced diarrheal and other infectious diseases may also include
the positive effects of the improved storage vessel as well has improved hygienic practices.
However, some water chlorination studies listed in Table 16 tested only the effect of chlorination
or chlorination plus the use of an improved water storage vessel for better protection of the
chlorinated water during storage. These studies of the water intervention only also demonstrate
improved microbiological quality of chlorinated water and reduced diarrheal and other infectious
diseases.

Only a few studies have not demonstrated the ability of household water chlorination to reduce
diarrheal illness. One such study compared microbial water quality and diarrheal illness in
households chlorinating drinking water stored in clay pots at a dose of 6.3 mg/l versus matched
control households not chlorinating in rural village in Northeastern Brazil (Kirchhoff et al.,
1984). Bacterial contamination of water in households chlorinating was significantly lower than
in non-intervention households (70 versus 16,000 colonies per 100 ml, p < 0.001). However,
diarrhea rates were not significantly different between the intervention and control households.
Several factors may account for the lack of differences in diarrheal illness rates between the two
sets of households. First, it is unclear whether or not the treated water was actually used for
drinking purposes and at what consumption level. Second, the drinking water for all families
was heavily contaminated pond water, so it may have continued to harbor appreciable levels of
pathogens despite chlorination. Third, chlorine dose was not rigorously controlled and chlorine
residual in stored household water was not measured. Incorrect chlorine dosing may have
resulted in either too little chlorine to reduce pathogens or too much chlorine that caused families
to stop using the water or drop out of the study. Eight of 9 families who dropped out of the study
reported objectionable taste as the reason for dropping out. Additionally, families were not
involved in the intervention process; they were passive recipients of it and received no hygiene
education. Finally, because overall sanitary conditions were poor and socio-economic status was
very low, a single intervention only on drinking water may not have had sufficient impact on
overall pathogen exposure to observe a significant decrease in diarrheal illness, especially in a
short-term study of only 18 weeks.

As summarized in Table 16, many studies have shown that the microbiological quality of stored
household water can be significantly improved and diarrheal disease can be significantly reduced
by adding chlorine to water stored in a household vessel. Recent studies have attempted to
overcome the limitations and uncertainties of previous efforts by employing uniform and fully
articulated systems of chlorine production, distribution and dosing, an improved, standardized
household water storage container, and the inclusion of participatory education, motivation and
behavior modification components (Mintz et al., 2001; USA CDC, 2000). A simple and low
cost system of adding chlorine to collected household water stored in a dedicated, narrow-mouth
plastic container (preferably with a valved spigot) has typically reduced waterborne microbes by
>99% and reduced community diarrheal disease, including cholera, by as much as 17-90%
(Handzel, 1998; Mintz et al., 1995; 2001; Quick et al., 1999; Semenza et al., 1998). To make the
system sustainable efforts are made to have users purchase concentrated sodium hypochlorite
that is produced in the community by electrolysis of NaCl solution. The concentrated sodium
hypochlorite solution is added to household water stored in a specially designed, rectangular, 20-
liter plastic vessel with a moderate diameter, screw cap opening for filling and cleaning and a
separate valved spigot to dispense the treated, stored water. The treatment and storage
technology is accompanied and supported by an education, motivation (through social
marketing) and behavior modification system to achieve community and household participation
and improve hygiene behaviors related to household water use. This approach to providing
microbially safe household drinking water, called the "CDC Safewater" system, has been
successfully implemented in numerous communities, countries and regions in different parts of
the world, including Latin America (Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Peru), Central Asia
(Uzbekistan), the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan), and Africa (Zambia and Madagascar) (Luby et
al., 2001; May and Quick, 1998; Mong et al., 2001; Quick, et al. 1996; 1999; Semenza et al.,



                                                46
1998). In addition, similar systems have been used to disinfect water for oral rehydration
therapy (ORT) solutions and for water and beverages marketed by street food vendors (Sobel et
al., 1998; Daniels et al., 1999).

Consumer education, participation and social marketing are considered essential and integral to
achieving acceptance and sustainability for this and other household drinking water treatment
systems (Thevos et al., 2000). In addition, pilot and feasibility studies are also encouraged, as is
economic, social and political support from donor agencies, NGOs, government agencies, the
private sector and other sources. Such activities are recognized as essential for designing,
mobilizing for, implementing and assessing this and other water quality management systems at
the household level. Further considerations of the role of these factors in household water
treatment systems are discussed in a later section of this report.

5.4.4 Chloramine treatment
Disinfection of water with chloramines or ammonia-chlorine is widely practiced in community
water supplies in order to provide a long-lasting disinfectant residual and to reduce tastes and
odors associated with the use of free chlorine in some drinking water supplies. Chloramination
also reduces the formation of free chlorine by-products that are considered toxic, such as
trihalomethanes. However, compared to free chlorine, ozone and chlorine dioxide, chloramines
are relatively weak oxidants and germicides. Based on the product of disinfectant concentration,
C, and contact time, T, (CxT) it takes about 10 to 100 times more chloramine than free chlorine
to inactivate an equivalent amount of most waterborne microbes. Chloramination is also more
difficult to apply to water than free chlorine because it requires the combined addition of
controlled amounts of both free chlorine and ammonia. Treatment of water with chloramines is
not commonly practiced at point-of-use and is not recommended for household water treatment.
This is because it requires the availability of both free chlorine and ammonia, it is complicated to
properly apply both free chlorine and ammonia to water at the required doses, the resultant
disinfectant is weak and slow acting, and the cost of using both chlorine and ammonia is higher
than the cost of using chlorine alone.

5.4.5 Ozone
Ozone has been used as a drinking water disinfectant since the early 20th century. It has gained
popularity for community water supplies in developed countries because it is a strong oxidant
capable of rapidly and extensively inactivating a variety of waterborne pathogens, including
chlorine-resistant Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Ozone is a highly reactive gas that must be
generated on site using electricity. It requires specialized equipment to deliver to water at
required doses, and care must be taken to prevent safety hazards from the release of ozone gas by
the treated water. Because ozone is rapidly consumed by dissolved and particulate constituents in
water, achieving appropriate ozone doses in actual practice requires careful attention to water
quality as well as the ability to monitor both ozone dose and ozone residual in the treated water.
Therefore, this method of drinking water disinfection is suitable primarily for community or
other centralized water systems where the specialized equipment and delivery systems required
for its use can be properly applied by trained personnel. Although small, point-of-use ozone
treatment systems are available for consumer use they are relatively expensive and difficult to
maintain, require electricity and therefore are not recommended for household water treatment.




                                                47
5.4.6 Chlorine Dioxide
Chlorine dioxide is used primarily as a bleaching agent and has gained some use for disinfection
of both community and point-of-use drinking water supplies in developed countries. Chlorine
dioxide is a relatively strong germicide capable of inactivating most waterborne pathogens,
including Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, at practical doses and contact times. For community
water treatment, chlorine dioxide is generated on-site from the reaction of sodium chlorite with
chlorine gas or from the reaction of sodium chlorite with acid. Producing chlorine dioxide from
free chlorine and sodium chlorite is technically demanding and requires specialized equipment.
For point-of-use treatment of water, chlorine dioxide is produced on site from the reaction of
sodium chlorite with acid. Such use is primarily for disinfecting temporary or informal water
sources used by outdoors enthusiasts and others requiring short-term applications in developed
countries. The toxicity of chlorine dioxide and its by-products, such as chlorite, limits the use of
this disinfectant, because the amount of toxic by-products is difficult to control or measure. In
addition, the generation of chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorite and acid is relatively
expensive, compared to free chlorine. For these reasons, chlorine dioxide is not widely used and
is not recommended for long-term disinfection of household drinking water.

5.4.7 Combined point-of-use treatment systems
The combined application of chemical coagulation-flocculation, filtration and chlorine
disinfection is widely practiced for community water treatment in developed countries,
especially for surface sources of drinking water. In combination, these processes have been
shown to dramatically reduce microbial contaminants in drinking water, produce product water
that meets international guidelines and national standards for microbial quality and embody the
principles of a multiple barrier approach to drinking water quality (LeChevallier and Au, 2000).
Because of the relative complexity of these processes, they are more difficult to implement at
point-of-use for household drinking water supplies in developed countries. However, purification
of water at point-of-use using tablets or powders that combine a coagulant-flocculent and a
chemical disinfectant have been described (Kfir et al., 1989; Rodda et al., 1993; Powers, 1993;
Procter & Gamble Company, 2001). In South Africa commercial tablets containing chlorine in
the form of Halazone p-triazine-trione or dichloro-S-triazine-trione and either aluminum sulfate
or proprietary flocculating agents have been developed, evaluated and promoted for community
and household water treatment, as well as emergency water treatment. For household use on
non-piped, household water supplies it is recommended that the tablets be added to water in a
20-liter bucket. The mixture is stirred to dissolve the tablet and flocculate, then allowed to stand
unmixed to settle the floc and then supernatant water is poured through a cloth filter into another
bucket. When these tablets were tested for efficacy in reducing bacteria, viruses and parasites,
they were found to achieve extensive reductions and meet US EPA requirements for a
microbiological water purifier. According to the manufacturer, the cost of treatment with these
tablets is low. Epidemiological studies of the effectiveness of these systems to reduce
waterborne diarrheal and other diseases have not been reported.

The Procter and Gamble Company in cooperation with the USA CDC and other collaborators
reports the development and evaluation of a combined flocculent-disinfectant powder supplied in
a small packet that is added to a 10-liter volume of household water by consumers. The powder
contains both coagulants and a timed-release form of chlorine. After stirring briefly,
contaminants settle to the bottom of the container and the supernatant water is poured through a



                                                48
cloth filter into another container for safe storage and use. Initial studies document dramatic
reductions of microbial as well as some chemical contaminants in water, and field
epidemiological studies to determine reductions in household diarrheal disease are under way in
Guatemala villages. The cost of the treatment is estimated at US$0.01 per liter.

Overall, combined coagulation-flocculation and chlorine disinfection systems have shown
considerable promise as microbiological purifiers of household water. Currently, they have not
come into widespread use and their worldwide availability is limited at the present time.
However, further studies that document efficacy in reducing diarrheal disease and improving
microbial quality are apparently forthcoming for some of these systems. Such data documenting
performance and the commercial availability of the materials through widespread marketing and
distribution create the potential for this technology to be not only scientifically supportable but
also widely available in many parts of the world. The relatively high costs of these combined
systems may limit their use by some of the world’s poorest people, but market studies also are
under way to determine consumers' willingness to pay. Therefore, these combined systems may
prove to be appropriate technologies for household water treatment in many settings for the large
segment of the world's population now collecting and storing water for household use.

5.4.8 Lime juice disinfection of V. cholerae
Drinking water disinfection by lowering water pH with lime juice is effective in inactivating V.
cholerae and in reducing cholera risks (Dalsgaard et al., 1997; Mata et al., 1994; Rodrigues et al.,
1997; 2000). Adding lime juice to water (1-5% final concentration) to lower pH levels below 4.5
reduced V. cholerae by >99.999% in 120 minutes (Dalsgaard et al., 1997). Lime juice also killed
>99.9% of V. cholerae on cabbage and lettuce and was recommended for prevention of cholera
by addition to non-acidic foods, beverages and water (Mata, 1994). Epidemiological studies
during cholera outbreaks in Guinea-Bissau showed that lime juice in rice foods was strongly
protective against cholera and laboratory studies showed that the presence of lime juice inhibited
V. cholera growth in rice foods. These studies indicate that adding lime juice to water,
beverages and other foods (gruels, porridges, etc.) has the ability to inactivate V. cholera and
reduce disease risks. Therefore, the use of lime juice in water and foods is a potentially
promising household treatment to control cholera transmission. Further studies to better
characterize the efficacy of this treatment and its ability to reduce cholera transmission are
recommended.


6. Social and Economic Aspects
6.1 Educational, Behavioral and Related Socio-Cultureal Considerations for Household
Water Treatment Systems
A number of studies and considerable field experiences have shown that the introduction of
water treatment technology without consideration of the socio-cultural aspects of the community
and without behavioral, motivational, educational and participatory activities within the
community is unlikely to be successful or sustainable. Therefore, initiatives in water, hygiene
and sanitation must include community participation, education and behavior modification. A
number of systems have been developed and successfully implemented for this purpose. One of
the most widely used and successful of these is termed PHAST, which stands for Participatory
Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (WHO, 1996). It is an adaptation of the SARAR (Self-



                                                49
esteem, Associative strengths, Resourcefulness, Action-planning and Responsibility) method of
participatory learning. PHAST promotes health awareness and understanding among all
members of a community or society in order to change hygiene and sanitation behaviors. It
encourages participation, recognizes and encourages self-awareness and innate abilities,
encourages group participation at the grassroots level, promotes concept-based learning as a
group process and attempts to link conceptual learning to group decision-making about solutions
and plans of action for change and improvement of the current situation. It encourages internally
derived decisions and both material and financial investment of the community to affect change.

Current approaches to participatory education and community involvement in water and
sanitation interventions apply behavioral theory and other related sciences to successfully
implement control measures. The use of water treatment technologies and other water quality
control measures that are consistent with prevailing beliefs and cultural practices and local
resources are promoted by behavioral theory. Community involvement at all levels is important
in achieving community support and sustainability for the technology. Efforts to introduce
improved household water treatment and storage systems have employed health education,
community mobilization, social marketing, motivational interviewing, focus groups, and other
educational, promotional, communication and mobilization techniques to change behaviors,
facilitate learning and elicit participation.

Another example of this approach is a program to facilitate support agencies in developing
community willingness and capacity to take responsibility for their own water supplies called the
MANAGE Dissemination system developed by the International Water and Sanitation Centre
(IRC, 1999). The goal of the system is to facilitate achievement of community management of
and decision-making for rural water supply supplies. The MANAGE Dissemination program
disseminates and shares findings of entities engaged in developing and implementing community
participatory action through an information network intended to enhance multi-institutional
learning approaches and develop training methods and tools that facilitate and support
community management of water supplies. The system employs exchange visits and other
communications activities among participants who are stakeholders in the community's water
supply ranging from local citizens to NGOs and their national and international partners. The
MANAGE Dissemination system has been implemented in many parts of the world, including
Africa (Cameroon and Kenya), the Indo-Asian region (Pakistan and Nepal and Latin America
(Colombia and Guatemala).

The use of social marketing in the effort to gain acceptance and support for household water
treatment and storage systems depends to some extent on the nature of the household water
treatment technology and its use of marketable commodities, such as a disinfectant, other water
treatment chemicals or an improved household water storage vessel. In the case of household
water treatment with liquid chlorine and storage in a narrow-mouth container, social marketing
of the chlorine solution became an important activity to change behavior by motivating potential
users buy and use the product. (USA CDC, 2000; Thevos et al., 2000). It is likely that some
previous efforts to introduce and promote similar practices of household water chlorination and
safe storage in an improved vessel failed or achieved poor results because of inadequate
participatory education, behavioral modification, motivational communication, social marketing
and other community-based participation and responsibility.



                                               50
Assessing the success of water and sanitation interventions is another important consideration. It
not only provides key information about the success of the intervention but also that has been
used to assess and improve water sanitation technologies and systems in developing countries is
the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey. A KAP survey was used to better
understand the impacts of the cholera epidemic in the Amazon region of Peru in the early 1990s
and to assess the socio-cultural aspects of the cholera preventive measures that were introduced
(Quick et al., 1996).


6.2 Economic Aspects of Household Water Treatment Processes and Systems
The affordability, costs and willingness to pay of household water treatment technologies are
important considerations for their implementation, use and sustainability. All systems for
household water treatment and storage require an approach for cost recovery in order to be
sustainable. Approaches to cost recovery include providing all or some system components free
of charge with funding provided by external sources (donors, governments, etc.), partial cost
recovery by sales of some system components (e.g., sale of a household water disinfectant),
recovery of all costs by sales of all system components. A phased approach to cost recovery also
can be employed, with initial subsidies that decrease or stop later on or loans that must be repaid
later on. Often, economic analyses reveal that the costs of prevailing water use, treatment and
storage practices can be shifted to a new system of improved household water treatment and
storage, if communities and consumers are made aware of the substitution, accept that is better
than the existing system and thereby become willing to create an economic demand. Some water
intervention initiatives have employed pricing schemes and short-term subsidies or price
supports to obtain and increase consumer demand, including sales on credit, barter sales and in-
kind payments (work in exchange for goods and services of the technology). The various
approaches for cost recovery and financial management of household water supply systems are
beyond the scope of this review. Many of the principles of financial management for more
centralized water supply and sanitation systems have been described elsewhere (Cairncross et al.,
1980; WHO, 1994). It is likely that these economic approaches to cost recovery and technology
sustainability can be applied or adapted to the more decentralized systems for household
treatment and storage of water described in this report.

The costs of various point-of-use or household water treatment and storage systems have been
estimated previously. However, the cost estimates for specific technologies by different sources
are not always in agreement and for some technologies cost estimates are lacking. Differences in
local conditions and availability of materials also contribute to the variability and uncertainty of
cost estimates for household water treatment and storage technologies. Table 17 lists the cost
estimates of some of the most promising alternative household water treatments, adapted from
estimates made by the USA CDC (2000).

7. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative household water
treatment and storage systems and Hazard Analysis at Critical Control Points
(HACCP)

7.1 Introduction
The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ) are adopting the concept of Water
Safety Plans and HACCP (Hazard Analysis - Critical Control Points). The WHO GDWQ have
long emphasized the identification of key health-related quality constituents for which health-
based guideline values are established. In addition, the GDWQ also identify and specify
methods to monitor drinking water quality for constituents of health concern. However, an
important development in the forthcoming revisions of the guidelines is an increased emphasis
on water quality protection and control from source to consumer. Emphasis will be placed on
management system to manage and monitor water quality from source to consumer according to
a Water Safety Plan (WSP), to encourage stakeholder participation and mobilization, and to
stress the need for communication and education about water quality and how safe water quality
can be achieved. A Water Safety Plan includes: (1) risk assessment to define potential health
outcomes of water supply, (2) system assessment to determine the ability of the water supply
system to remove pathogens and achieve defined water quality targets, (3) process control using
HACCP, and (4) process/system documentation for both steady state and incident-based (e.g.,
failure or fault event) management. It is recommended that HACCP for household water




                                                            52
collection, treatment and storage be applied in the context of a Water Safety Plan that addresses
source water quality, water collection, water treatment, water storage and water use.

7.2 HACCP for recommended household water storage and treatment systems

7.2.1 Household water storage
As shown in Table 18, the application of HACCP to water storage in household vessels is likely
to address three hazards and their critical control points (CCPs): (1) vessel type (appropriate
versus inappropriate), (1) vessel integrity (intact, damaged, parts missing, etc.), and (3) vessel
sanitation (cleaned, not cleaned and a system to monitor and document cleaning frequency). For
each type of storage vessel a set of specific hazards, critical control points and other criteria for a
HACCP plan can be established. For example, for household storage of water according to the
CDC "Safewater" system, a preferred vessel design and alternative vessel designs that are
considered suitable are provided, as are vessel designs and types considered unsafe for sanitation
reasons (no cover, wide opening allowing introduction of hands and dippers, etc.) (CDC
Safewater, 2000). For the solar disinfection system using sunlight for heating and UV-
irradiating water (SODIS and SOLAIR), recommended or preferred vessels are identified
(including vessel size and type of plastic), criteria for the integrity of the vessel are specified
(e.g., absence of scratches and surface damage that would reduce light penetration), and the
maximum time period of water storage is specified (to avoid degradation of the microbial quality
of water and biofilm accumulation due to bacterial regrowth). These and other hazards and their
critical control points can be specified for each type of water storage vessel and system.

                            appropriate, based on        on visible damage (e.g.,       based on frequency of
                            design                       cracks, scratches), broken     cleaning and cleaning
                                                         or missing parts (e.g., cap)   method
                                                         and leaks


7.2.2 Household water treatment
As previously stated above, it is recommended that HACCP for household water treatment be
applied in the context of a Water Safety Plan that addresses source water quality, water
collection, water treatment, water storage and use. For each type of household water treatment
and its application in practice, generic water safety plans can be developed and these can then be
adapted to site-specific conditions and situations of their use for drinking water management. As
shown in Table 19, the hazards and critical control points for household water treatment include:
choice of source water and type of treatment. Also important are methods of source water
collection and conditions of treated water storage and use. The HACCP program within a Water
Safety Plan should identify the hazards and critical control points for all steps and activities in
the overall plan from source water quality to the product at the point of consumer use. Some of
the key hazards and critical control points for source water and for alternative household water
treatments are summarized in Table 19. The hazards and critical control points described here
are not intended to be comprehensive or complete. Instead they are intended to be representative
of the important hazards (failures and deficiencies) and their critical control points for some of
the key household water treatments identified and recommended in this report. Further efforts


                                                    53
will be needed to better specify and develop HACCP plans for these water treatment
technologies on both a generic (general) as well as site-specific basis. It is important to note that
HACCP plans are always best articulated on a site-specific basis, even though the key elements
of the plan are often common to a particular type of commodity, technology and process train.

7.2.3 Summary of HACCP for household water systems
Consistent with the forthcoming WHO GDWQ, collection, treatment and storage of household
water should be developed and managed according to a Water Safety Plan that includes HACCP
as a management tool. For household water, hazards and critical control points can be identified
for the management steps in a water safety plan that includes source water selection and
protection, water collection, water treatment and water storage, including storage vessel type and
its use. The approaches and examples provided here are intended to be only exemplary and not
comprehensive
