(f) Other information the manufacturer deems relevant to the reporting of
the chemical.

(2) No later than January 1, 2012, the manufacturer of infant formula or

A, polycarbonate plastic or epoxy resin is used in the manufacture of the
infant formula or baby food container, jar or can in lieu of identified

including the overall size of the product and/or the component of the
product that contains BPA and whether the product or BPA-containing
component of the product, can be placed in the mouth. A toy can be placed
in a child's mouth if any part of the toy can actually be brought to the mouth
and kept in the mouth by a child so that it can be sucked and chewed. If the
children's product can only be licked, it is not regarded as able to be placed
in the mouth. If a toy or part of a toy in one dimension is smaller than 5
centimeters, it can be placed in the mouth.;

the chemical.

NOTE: Upon review of information submitted pursuant to section 4 of this
chapter, the commissioner may request that a manufacturer clarify the
submittal, supplement incomplete information or provide additional
information not specified in this chapter if the commissioner determines
that the information is needed for the department to complete its evaluation
of the priority chemical. See department rules, 06-096 CMR 880(3)(D); see
also 38 M.R.S.A. ยง1695(2).

retailer of the sales prohibition.

C. Waiver for specific uses. The manufacturer or distributor of a
children's product that is subject to a sales prohibition under subsection
5(A) may apply to the commissioner for a waiver for one or more specific
uses of bisphenol A. The waiver application must be submitted at least 180
days prior to the effective date of a sales prohibition, or prior to a new
product being sold in Maine and must, at a minimum:

(1) Identify the specific children's product use or uses for which the waiver is
sought;

feasible; and

(4) Identify the steps that have and will be taken to minimize the use of the
priority chemical.

finding that there is a need for the children's product in which the priority
chemical is used and there are no technically or economically feasible
alternatives for the use of the priority chemical in the children's product.
Waivers may be granted for a term not to exceed 5 years and may be
renewed for one or more additional 5-year terms upon written application
demonstrating that technically or economically feasible alternatives remain
unavailable. The commissioner shall deny or grant waiver requests within
