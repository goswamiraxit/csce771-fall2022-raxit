The Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State and Provincial Public Health and Environmental
Managers in 1950 created a Water Supply Committee consisting of one associate from each state
represented on the Board. A representative from the Province of Ontario was added in 1978.
Throughout this document the term state shall mean a representative state or the Province of Ontario.
The Committee was assigned the responsibility for reviewing existing water works practices, policies, and
procedures, and reporting its findings to the Board. The report of the Water Supply Committee was first
published in 1953, and subsequently has been revised and published in 1962, 1968, 1976, 1982, 1987,
1992, 1997, 2003, 2007, and 2012.

This document includes the following:

1. Policy Statements - Preceding the standards are policy statements of the Board concerning water
   works design, practice, or resource protection. Some policy statements recommend an approach to
   the investigation of innovative treatment processes which have not been included as part of the
   standards because sufficient confirmation has not yet been documented to allow the establishment of
   specific limitations or design parameters. Other policy statements recommend approaches,
   alternatives or considerations in addressing a specific water supply issue and may not develop into
   standards.

2. Interim Standards - Following the policy statements are interim standards. The interim standards give
   design criteria which are currently being used for new treatment processes, but the use of the criteria
   is limited and insufficient for recognition as a recommended standard.

3. Recommended Standards - The Standards, consisting of proven technology, are intended to serve as
   a guide in the design and preparation of plans and specifications for public water supply systems, to
   suggest limiting values for items upon which an evaluation of such plans and specifications may be
   made by the reviewing authority, and to establish, as far as practicable, uniformity of practice.
   Because statutory requirements and legal authority pertaining to public water supplies are not uniform
   among the states, and since conditions and administrative procedures and policies also differ, the use
   of these standards must be adjusted to these variations.

The terms shall and must are used where practice is sufficiently standardized to permit specific
delineation of requirements or where safeguarding of the public health justifies such definite action. Other
terms, such as should, recommended, and preferred, indicate desirable procedures or methods, with
deviations subject to individual consideration.

Most quantified items in this document are cited in US customary units and are rounded off at two
significant figures. Metric equivalent quantities, also rounded off at two significant figures, follow in
brackets where compound units are involved. The metric unit symbols follow International System
conventions. In the event of a conflict between quantities in US units and the metric equivalent the
quantity in US units shall take precedence.

It is not possible to cover recently developed processes and equipment in a publication of this type.
However, the policy is to encourage, rather than obstruct, the development of new processes and
equipment. Recent developments may be acceptable to individual states if they meet at least one of the
following conditions: 1) have been thoroughly tested in full scale comparable installations under
competent supervision, 2) have been thoroughly tested as a pilot plant operated for a sufficient time to
indicate satisfactory performance, or 3) a performance bond or other acceptable arrangement has been
made so the owners or official custodians are adequately protected financially or otherwise in case of
failure of the process or equipment.

The Board recognizes that many states, other than those of the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River
Board of State and Provincial Public Health and Environmental Managers, utilize this publication as part
                                                       xi
of their design requirements for water works facilities. The Board welcomes this practice as long as credit
is given to the Board and to this publication as a source for the standards adopted. Suggestions from
non-member states are welcome and will be considered.

                                      POLICY STATEMENT
                                             ON
                           PRE-ENGINEERED WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

Pre-engineered water treatment plants are normally modular process units which are pre-designed for
specific process applications and flow rates and purchased as a package. Multiple units may be installed
in parallel to accommodate larger flows.

Pre-engineered treatment plants have numerous applications but are especially applicable at small
systems where conventional treatment facilities may not be cost effective. As with any design the
proposed treatment must fit the situation and assure a continuous supply of safe drinking water for water
consumers. The reviewing authority may accept proposals for pre-engineered water treatment plants on a
case-by-case basis where they have been demonstrated to be effective in treating the source water being
used. In most cases an applicant will be required to demonstrate, through pilot studies and/or other data,
adequacy of the proposed plant for the specific application. A professional engineer is required to
prepare plans and specifications for submittal to the reviewing authority for approval. It is recommended
that a professional engineer be on site to oversee the installation and initial startup of pre-engineered
water treatment plants.

Factors to be considered include:

1.   Raw water quality characteristics under normal and worst case conditions. Seasonal fluctuations
     must be evaluated and considered in the design.

2. Demonstration of treatment effectiveness under all raw water conditions and system flow demands.
   This demonstration may be on-site pilot or full scale testing or testing off-site where the source water
   is of similar quality. On-site testing is required at sites having questionable water quality or
   applicability of the treatment process. The proposed demonstration project must be approved by the
   reviewing authority prior to starting.

3. Sophistication of equipment. The reliability and experience record of the proposed treatment
   equipment and controls must be evaluated.

4. Unit process flexibility which allows for optimization of treatment.

5. Operational oversight that is necessary. At surface water sources full-time operators are necessary,
   except where the reviewing authority has approved an automation plan. See Policy Statement on
   Automated/Unattended Operation of Surface Water Treatment Plants.

6.   Third party certification or approvals such as National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), International
     Underwriters Laboratory (UL) or other acceptable ANSI accredited third parties for; a) treatment
     equipment and b) materials that will be in contact with the water.

7.    Suitable pretreatment based on raw water quality and the pilot study or other demonstration of
     treatment effectiveness. Pretreatment may be included as an integral process in the pre-engineered
     module.

8. Factory testing of controls and process equipment prior to shipment.

9. Automated troubleshooting capability built into the control system.

10. Start-up and follow-up training and troubleshooting to be provided by the manufacturer or contractor.



                                                     xiii
11. Operation and maintenance manual. This manual must provide a description of the treatment,
    control and pumping equipment, necessary maintenance and schedule, and a troubleshooting guide
    for typical problems.

12. In addition to any automation, full manual override capabilities must be provided.

13. Cross-connection control including, but not limited to the avoidance of single wall separations
    between treated and partially or untreated surface water.

14. On-site and contractual laboratory capability. The on-site testing must include all required continuous
    and daily testing as specified by the reviewing authority. Contract testing may be considered for other
    parameters.

15. Manufacturer’s warranty and replacement guarantee. Appropriate safeguards for the water supplier
    must be included in contract documents. The reviewing authority may consider interim or conditional
    project approvals for innovative technology where there is sufficient demonstration of treatment
    effectiveness and contract provisions to protect the water supplier should the treatment not perform
    as claimed.

16. Water supplier revenue and budget for continuing operations, maintenance and equipment
    replacement in the future.

17. Life expectancy and long-term performance of the units based on the corrosivity of the raw and
    treated water and the treatment chemicals used.

Additional information on this topic is given in the State Alternative Technology Approval Protocol dated
June 1996, which was developed by the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and various industry groups.

                              POLICY STATEMENT ON
        AUTOMATED/UNATTENDED OPERATION OF SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

Recent advances in computer technology, equipment controls and Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) Systems have brought automated and off-site operation of surface water treatment
plants into the realm of feasibility. Coincidentally, this comes at a time when renewed concern for
microbiological contamination is driving optimization of surface water treatment plant facilities and
operations and finished water treatment goals are being lowered to levels of <0.1 NTU turbidity and <20
total particle counts per milliliter.

Review authorities encourage any measures, including automation, which assist operators in improving
plant operations and surveillance functions.

Automation of surface water treatment facilities to allow unattended operation and off-site control
presents a number of management and technological challenges which must be overcome before an
approval can be considered. Each facet of the plant facilities and operations must be fully evaluated to
determine what on-line monitoring is appropriate, what alarm capabilities must be incorporated into the
design and what staffing is necessary. Consideration must be given to the consequences and
operational response to treatment challenges, equipment failure and loss of communications or power.

An engineering report shall be developed as the first step in the process leading to design of the
automation system. The engineering report to be submitted to the reviewing authorities must cover all
aspects of the treatment plant and automation system including the following information/criteria:

1.   Identify all critical features in the pumping and treatment facilities that will be electronically monitored,
     have alarms and can be operated automatically or off-site via the control system. Include a
     description of automatic plant shut-down controls with alarms and conditions which would trigger
     shut-downs. Dual or secondary alarms may be necessary for certain critical functions.

2. Automated monitoring of all critical functions with major and minor alarm features must be provided.
   Automated plant shutdown is required on all major alarms. Automated startup of the plant is
   prohibited after shutdown due to a major alarm. The control system must have response and
   adjustment capability on all minor alarms. Built-in control system challenge test capability must be
   provided to verify operational status of major and minor alarms. The computer system must
   incorporate cyberspace security to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information
   and deter identity theft through such means as placing routers and “firewalls” at the entry point of a
   sub network to block access from outside attackers.

3. The plant control system must have the capability for manual operation of all treatment plant
   equipment and process functions.

4. A plant flow diagram which shows the location of all critical features, alarms and automated controls
   to be provided.

5. Description of off-site control station(s) that allow observation of plant operations, receiving alarms
   and having the ability to adjust and control operation of equipment and the treatment process.

6. A certified operator must be on "standby duty" status at all times with remote operational capability
   and located within a reasonable response time of the treatment plant.

7. A certified operator must do an on-site check at least once per day to verify proper operation and
   plant security.



                                                        xv
8. Description of operator staffing and training planned or completed in both process control and the
   automation system.

9. Operations manual which gives operators step by step procedures for understanding and using the
   automated control system under all water quality conditions. Emergency operations during power or
   communications failures or other emergencies must be included. A backup battery shall be provided
   for the control system.

10. A plan for a 6 month or more demonstration period to prove the reliability of procedures, equipment
    and surveillance system. A certified operator must be on-duty during the demonstration period. The
    final plan must identify and address any problems and alarms that occurred during the demonstration
    period. Challenge testing of each critical component of the overall system must be included as part of
    the demonstration project.

11. Schedule for maintenance of equipment and critical parts replacement.

12. Sufficient finished water storage shall be provided to meet system demands and CT requirements
    whenever normal treatment production is interrupted as the result of automation system failure or
    plant shutdown.

13. Sufficient staffing must be provided to carry out daily on-site evaluations, operational functions and
    needed maintenance and calibration of all critical treatment components and monitoring equipment to
    ensure reliability of operations.

14. Plant staff must perform, as a minimum, weekly checks on the communication and control system to
    ensure reliability of operations. Challenge testing of such equipment should be part of normal
    maintenance routines.

15. Provisions must be made to ensure security of the treatment facilities at all times. Incorporation of
    appropriate intrusion alarms must be provided which are effectively communicated to the operator in
    charge.

                                                  FOR
                                         PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES

Bag and cartridge technology has been used for some time in the food, pharmaceutical and industrial
applications. This technology is increasingly being used by small public water supplies for treatment of
drinking water. A number of states have accepted bag and cartridge technology as an alternate
technology for compliance with the filtration requirements of the Surface Water Treatment Rule and the
Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. In addition, bag and cartridge filters are included
in the microbial toolbox options for meeting the Cryptosporidium treatment requirements of the Long Term
2 Enhance Surface Water Treatment Rule.

The particulate loading capacity of these filters is low, and once expended the bag or cartridge filter must
be discarded. This technology is designed to meet the low flow requirement needs of small systems.
The operational and maintenance cost of bag and cartridge replacement must be considered when
designing a system. These filters can effectively remove particles from water in the size range of Giardia
cysts (5-10 microns) and Cryptosporidium (2-5 microns).

At the present time, filtration evaluation is based on Cryptosporidium oocyst removal.

With this type of treatment there is no alteration of water chemistry. So, once the technology has
demonstrated the required removal efficiency, no further pilot demonstration may be necessary. The
demonstration of filtration is specific to a specific housing and a specific bag or cartridge filter. Any other
combinations of different bags, cartridges, or housings will require additional demonstration of filter
efficiency.

Treatment of surface water should include source water protection, filtration, and disinfection sufficient to
meet all applicable surface water treatment rules the Surface Water Treatment Rule, Interim Enhanced
Surface Water Treatment Rule, Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and Long Term 2
Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule.

The following items should be considered in evaluating the applicability of bag or cartridge filtration.

     Predesign/Design

1.   The filter housing and bag/cartridge filter must demonstrate a filter efficiency of at least 2-log
     reduction in particles size 2 micron and above. Demonstration of higher log removals may be
     required by the reviewing authority depending on raw water quality and other treatment steps to be
     employed. The reviewing authority will decide whether or not a pilot demonstration is necessary for
     each installation. This filtration efficiency demonstration may be accomplished by:

     a.   microscopic particulate analysis, including particle counting , sizing and identification, which
          determines occurrence and removals of micro-organisms and other particle across a filter or
          system under ambient raw water source condition, or when artificially challenged;

     b. cryptosporidium particle removal evaluation in accordance with procedures specified in NSF
        Standard 53 or equivalent. These evaluations must be conducted by NSF or by another third-
        party whose certification would be acceptable to the reviewing authority;

     c.   “Protocol for Equipment Verification Testing for Physical Removal of Microbiological and
          Particulate Contaminants” procedure specified by the EPA/NSF Environmental Technology
          Verification Program;

                                                      xvii
    d. challenge testing procedure for bag and cartridge filters presented in Chapter 8 of the Long Term
       2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule Toolbox Guidance Manual.

    e. "nonconsensus" live Cryptosporidium challenge studies that have been designed and carried out
       by a third-party agent recognized and accepted by the reviewing authority for interim evaluations.
       At the present time uniform protocol procedures for live Cryptosporidium challenge studies have
       not been established.;

    f.   methods other than these that are approved by the reviewing authority.

2. System components such as housing, bags, cartridges, membranes, gaskets, and O-rings should be
   evaluated under NSF Standard 61 or equivalent, for leaching of contaminants. Additional testing may
   be required by the reviewing authority.

3. The source water or pre-treated water should have a turbidity less than 3 NTU.

4. The flow rate through the treatment process shall be monitored with a flow valve and meter. The flow
   rate through the bag/cartridge filter must not exceed the maximum flow rate verified by filtration
   efficiency testing.

5. Pretreatment is strongly recommended (if not required by the reviewing authority). This is to provide
   a more constant water quality to the bag/cartridge filter and to extend bag and cartridge life.
   Examples of pretreatment include media filters, larger opening bag/cartridge filters, infiltration
   galleries, and beach wells. Location of the water intake should be considered in the pretreatment
   evaluation.

6. Particle count analysis can be used to determine what level of pretreatment should be provided. It
   should be noted that particulate counting is a 'snap shot' in time and that there can be seasonal
   variations such as algae blooms, lake turnover, spring runoff, and heavy rainfall events that will give
   varied water quality.

7. It is recommended that chlorine or another disinfectant be added at the head of the treatment process
   to reduce/eliminate the growth of algae, bacteria, etc., on the filters. The impact on disinfection-by-
   product formation should be considered.

8. A filter to waste component is strongly recommended (if not required by the reviewing authority), for
   any pretreatment pressure sand filters. At the beginning of each filter cycle and/or after every
   backwash of the prefilters a set amount of water should be discharged to waste before water flows
   into the bag/cartridge filter. Filter to waste shall be provided for the final filter(s) and a set amount of
   water shall be discharged to waste after changing the filters.

9. If pressure media filters are used for pretreatment they must be designed according to Section 4.3.2.

10. A sampling tap shall be provided ahead of any treatment so a source water sample can be collected.

11. Pressure gauges and sampling taps shall be installed before and after the media filter and before and
    after the bag/cartridge filter.

12. An automatic air release valve shall be installed on top of the filter housing.

13. Frequent start and stop operation of the bag or cartridge filter should be avoided. To avoid this
    frequent start and stop cycle the following options are recommended:

    a    a slow opening and closing valve ahead of the filter to reduce flow surges;
                                                     xviii
    b. reduce the flow through bag or cartridge filter to as low as possible to lengthen filter run times;

    c.   install a recirculating pump that pumps treated water back to a point ahead of the bag or cartridge
         filter. Care must be taken to make sure there is no cross connection between the finished water
         and raw water.

14. A minimum of two bag or cartridge filter housings should be provided for water systems that must
    provide water continuously.

15. A pressure relief valve should be incorporated into the bag or cartridge filter housing.

16. Complete automation of the treatment system is not required. Automation of the treatment plant
    should be incorporated into the ability of the water system to monitor the finished water quality. It is
    important that a qualified water operator is available to run the treatment plant.

17. A plan of action should be in place should the water quality parameters fail to meet EPA or the local
    reviewing authorities’ standards.

Operations

1. The filtration and backwash rates shall be monitored so that the prefilters are being optimally used.

2. The bag and cartridge filters must be replaced when a pressure difference of15 psi or other pressure
   difference recommended by the manufacturer or the reviewing authority is observed. It should be
   noted that bag filters do not load linearly. Additional observation of the filter performance is required
   near the end of the filter run.

3. Maintenance (o-ring replacement) shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
   recommendations.

4. Sterile rubber gloves and a disposable face mask covering the nose and mouth should be worn when
   replacing or cleaning the cartridge or bag filters.

5. The filter system shall be properly disinfected and water shall be ran to waste each time the cartridge
   or bag filter vessels are opened for maintenance.

6. The following parameters should be monitored:

    Flow rate, instantaneous
    Flow rate, total
    Operating pressure
    Pressure differential
    Turbidity

                                 ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT DISINFECTION
                            FOR TREATMENT OF PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES

Disinfection utilizing ultraviolet light (UV) is a complex technology that is rapidly evolving based on
ongoing research. The recommendations in the USEPA ULTRAVIOLET DISINFECTION GUIDANCE
MANUAL FOR THE LONG TERM 2 ENHANCED SURFACE WATER TREAMENT RULE (UVDGM)
provides the most current guidance for the design, validation and operation of UV systems used for public
water systems and is the basis for the development of the recommended standards for those systems.
Other validation protocols may be acceptable upon review and approval of the reviewing authority. The
challenge microorganism utilized in validation shall be a conservative representation of the target
microorganism and shall be approved by the reviewing authority.

UV disinfection may also be considered as primary disinfection for public water systems with
microbiologically unsafe groundwater and must meet the same requirements as UV systems used to
meet the recommendations in the UVDGM. The reviewing authority shall be contacted regarding use of
UV disinfection.

Supplemental disinfection for additional virus inactivation or to provide a residual in the water distribution
system may be required by the reviewing authority. When UV light treatment devices are used for non-
health related purpose, the UV device may provide doses less than indicated in the following criteria.

A. CRITERIA FOR UV WATER TREATMENT DEVICES

    1. The UV unit must be validated following an accepted protocol (e.g. USEPA UV Disinfection
       Guidance Manual (UVDGM), German DVGW, or Austrian ONORM). A third-party certification of
       validation must be submitted (in English) or other standards as approved by the reviewing
       authority.

    2. Unit must be validated to provide the required level of inactivation of the target pathogen(s) under
       the design flow and water quality conditions. The validation must demonstrate and the system be
       designed so that the unit is capable of providing a UV light dose of 40 millijoules per square
       centimeter (mJ/cm2). However, the reviewing authority may allow the system to operate at a lower
       dose as needed to achieve the treatment objectives. Maximum and minimum flows should be
       considered. UV transmissivity (UVT) measurements of the water to be treated, covering the range
       of UVTs expected for that water, should be submitted to support selection of the design UVT. The
       sampling shall be of a frequency and duration satisfactory to the reviewing authority and surface
       water may require more frequent sampling and longer sample periods. Consideration should be
       given to the levels of other water quality parameters that can impact UV system performance.
       Levels higher than those listed below may be acceptable to the reviewing authority if experience
       with similar water quality and UV reactors shows that adequate treatment is provided and there are
       no treatment problems or excessive maintenance is required. The water entering the UV unit shall
       meet the following parameters:

        Parameter                                                                              Maximum*
        Dissolved Iron                                                                         0.3 mg/L
        Dissolved Manganese                                                                    0.05 mg/L

        *Higher values may be acceptable to the reviewing authority if experience with similar water
        quality and reactors shows that adequate treatment is provided and there are no treatment
        problems or excessive maintenance required, or if the reactor was validated for parameters
        higher than these maximums.

        Raw water quality shall be evaluated and pretreatment equipment shall be designed to handle
        water quality changes. Variable turbidity caused by rainfall events is of special concern.

   3.   A fouling/aging factor should be applied to ensure that the UV unit will still supply the required dose
        with some level of lamp aging and lamp sleeve fouling.

   4. The UV housing shall be stainless steel 304 or 316L.

   5. The lamp sleeve shall be made of Type 214 clear fused quartz or other sleeve material as approved
      by the reviewing authority.

   6. The UV assemblies shall be accessible for visual observation, cleaning and replacement of the
      lamps, lamp sleeves, and sensor window/lens.

B. PRETREATMENT

   The reviewing authority will evaluate the need for pre and post treatment on a specific case basis
   depending on raw water quality. A 5 um sediment filter or equivalent is recommended for all UV
   installations used on unfiltered systems.

C. INSTALLATION OF UV SYSTEM

   1. Other treatment processes may impact the efficacy of UV disinfection. In evaluating the order of
      treatment processes, the following should be considered:
              filtration, if provided, should be performed prior to UV treatment;
              chlorination prior to UV treatment may increase fouling on UV lamp sleeves, decreasing
              UVT;
              UV treatment of chlorinated water may reduce chlorine residuals;
              ozone, permanganate, ferric iron and thiosulfate absorb UV light; however, addition of UV
              absorbing chemicals prior to UV treatment may be desired, as they can act to increase
              the UVT of water (e.g. by oxidizing organics or precipitating metals) or to suppress algae
              growth in the treatment plant. If chlorine or ozone residuals are to be quenched prior to
              UV treatment, sodium bisulfite is a better choice than thiosulfate.

   2. UV units must be installed in the same configuration or a more conservative configuration than
      that used during validation testing. The following are acceptable:
              the length of straight pipe installed upstream of each UV reactor must be the length of
              upstream straight pipe used during validation plus a minimum of 5 times the diameter of
              the pipe;

            OR

                 the installation configuration is identical to the configuration use during validation testing
                 for at least 10 pipe diameters upstream and 5 pipe diameters downstream of the UV
                 reactor;

            OR

                 velocity profiles of the water upstream and downstream of the UV reactor may be
                 measured during validation testing and after the unit has been installed in the treatment
                                                      xxi
            plant. Velocities must be within 20% of the theoretical velocity for both the validation
            testing and installed conditions. Theoretical velocity is defined as the flow rate divided by
            the interior cross-sectional area of the pipe.

    In addition, the inlet piping should have no expansions within 10 pipe diameters of the UV unit,
    and valves located within the straight pipe section upstream of the unit should be fully open under
    normal operations.

3. A sufficient number (required number plus one) of parallel UV treatment units shall be provided to
   ensure a continuous water supply when one unit is out of service, unless other satisfactory
   disinfection can be provided when the unit is out of service. Other forms of redundancy including
   spare lamps, ballasts etc, or other treatment may be allowed by the reviewing authority.

4. The UV system must have the ability to automatically shut down flow and/or alarm operators in
   the event that treatment requirements/validated conditions are not being met. When power is not
   being supplied to the UV reactor, shut down valves shall be in a closed (fail-safe) position.

5. No bypasses shall be installed unless allowed by the reviewing authority.

6. For systems using an unfiltered surface water supply, screens or other features should be
   installed upstream of the UV units to prevent objects from entering the reactor that might damage
   reactor components.

7. Consideration should be given to providing a sump downstream of the UV reactor to capture
   mercury and debris from broken lamps.

8. At a minimum, the following appurtenances, which are necessary to the operation and control of
   the UV reactors, must be provided:
           flow control valves
           isolation valves
           sample taps upstream and downstream of the reactor
           flow meters
           air relief/vacuum relief valves
           alarms
           instrumentation for monitoring and controlling the system
           on-line UVT analyzers (required for systems for which UVT is integral to dose monitoring
           or as otherwise required by the review authority).

9. Headloss through the UV reactor and associated valves and piping must be evaluated to ensure
   headloss does not exceed the available head. Booster pumps may be required to maintain
   minimum water system pressure after treatment devices.

10. UV units may be impacted by surge events produced by pumps located upstream or downstream
    from the units. Maximum system pressures should be evaluated to ensure that they will not
    exceed manufacturer's specifications for the UV reactor. Alternatively, the design should have
    provisions (equipment or operational) for mitigating surges.

11. A flow or time delay mechanism wired in series with the well or service pump shall be provided to
    permit a sufficient time for lamp warm up per manufacturer recommendations before water flows
    from the unit upon startup. Consideration should be given to UV unit shut down between
    operating cycles to prevent heat build-up in the water due to the UV lamp. If cooling water is
    provided during the warm-up period, the design must allow for wasting this water (since it will be
    inadequately treated), or monitoring this flow to account for the volume of "off-specification" water
    sent to distribution.



                                                xxii
   12. The design shall ensure that the quartz sleeves containing the UV lamps will always be
       submerged in water under normal operating conditions unless the UV units are specifically
       designed with air cooling.

   13. Adequate space shall be provided around the UV unit to allow access for maintenance activities.

   14 A wiper assembly or chemical-in-place system may be installed to allow in-situ cleaning of lamp
      sleeves. Adequate controls shall be in place to prevent contamination of the potable water with
      cleaning chemicals. For cleaning methods that require a UV unit to be off-line while being
      cleaned, treatment and/or storage capacity must be sufficient to ensure adequate water supply at
      all times. Chemical cleaning methods may require chemical storage and delivery facilities and
      provisions for dealing with chemical waste. Cleaning chemicals shall be certified for compliance
      with ANSI/NSF Standard 60.

   15. Drains shall be provided in the UV units or in piping between the units and the isolation valves,
       and floor drains shall be provided in the treatment plant design, to allow draining of the units for
       maintenance or repair. The design for drainage shall comply with cross connection control
       requirements.

D. Associated Instrumentation and Parts

   1. For systems installed to provide treatment in accordance with the Long Term 2 Enhanced
      Surface Water Treatment Rule requirements, equipment must be provided to allow monitoring of
      parameters to ensure the system is operating within validated limits and delivering the required
      UV dose. Parameters required (e.g. flow, UV intensity, UVT, lamp status) will depend on the
      operating mode of the UV unit. Instrumentation must be able to provide the data required to
      determine the volume of water produced that is not within the required specifications (“off-
      specification”).

   2. If an on-line UVT analyzer is required for operation of the UV system (i.e. if it is required for dose
      monitoring), this on-line instrument must be properly calibrated. A benchtop UVT analyzer must
      be available to check the calibration of the on-line meter. Calibration of the on-line meter should
      be checked at least weekly.

   3. A reference sensor must be available to check calibration of the UV sensor(s), which must be
      checked at least monthly.

   4. The need to maintain spare parts for the UV system should be addressed. At a minimum, the
      following parts should be maintained at the treatment plant:
              UV lamps - 10% with a minimum of 2 lamps
              lamp sleeves - 5% with a minimum of 1 sleeve
              O-ring seals - 5% with a minimum of 2 seals
              ballasts - 5% with minimum of 1 unit
              ballast cooling fan - 1 unit
              duty UV sensor - minimum of 2 units
              reference UV sensor - minimum of 2 units
              on-line UVT analyzer - 1 unit if required for dose-monitoring

E. SEASONAL OPERATIONS

   UV water treatment devices that are operated on a seasonal basis shall be inspected and cleaned
   prior to use at the start of each operating season. The UV water treatment system including the filters
   shall be disinfected prior to placing the water treatment system back into operation. A procedure for
   shutting down and starting up the UV treatment system shall be developed for or by each owner
   based upon manufacturer recommendations and submitted in writing to the review authority.

                                                   xxiii
F. RECORD KEEPING AND ACCESS

   A record shall be kept of the water quality test data, dates of lamp replacement and cleaning, a record
   of when the device was shutdown and the reason for shutdown, and the dates of prefilter
   replacement.

   The reviewing authority shall have access to the UV water treatment system and records.

   Water system owners will be required to submit operating reports and required sample results on a
   monthly or quarterly basis as required by the reviewing authority.

                                       INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY

                                         PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES

Review of public water system security infrastructure and practices has shown an industry-wide
vulnerability to intentional acts of vandalism, sabotage and terrorism. Protection from these types of
threats must be integrated into all design considerations. Many public drinking water systems have
implemented effective security and operational changes to help address this vulnerability, but additional
efforts are needed.

Security measures are needed to help ensure that public water suppliers attain an effective level of
security. Design considerations need to address physical infrastructure security, and facilitate security
related operational practices and institutional controls. Because drinking water systems cannot be made
immune to all possible attacks, the design needs to address issues of critical asset redundancy,
monitoring, response and recovery. All public water supplies need to identify and address security needs
in design and construction for new projects and for retrofits of existing drinking water systems.

The following concepts and items should be considered in the design and construction of new water
system facilities and improvements to existing water systems:

1. Security shall be an integral part of drinking water system design. Facility layout shall consider critical
   system assets and the physical needs of security for these assets. Requirements for submitting,
   identifying and disclosing security features of the design, and the confidentiality of the submission and
   regulatory review should be discussed with the reviewing authority.

2. The design should identify and evaluate single points of failure that could render a system unable to
   meet its design basis. Redundancy and enhanced security features should be incorporated into the
   design to eliminate single points of failure when possible, or to protect them when they cannot
   reasonably be eliminated.

3. Consideration should be made to ensure effective response and timely replacement of critical
   components that are damaged or destroyed. Critical components that comprise single points of failure
   (e.g., high volume pumps) that cannot be eliminated should be identified during design and given
   special consideration. Design considerations should include component standardization, availability
   of replacements and key parts, re-procurement lead times, and identification of suppliers and secure
   retention of component specifications and fabrication drawings. Readily replaceable components
   should be used whenever possible and provisions should be made for maintaining an inventory of
   critical parts.

4. Human access should be through controlled locations only. Intrusion deterrence measures (e.g.,
   physical barriers such as fences, window grates and security doors; traffic flow and check-in points;
   effective lighting; lines of sight; etc.) should be incorporated into the facility design to protect critical
   assets and security sensitive areas. Appropriate and effectively operated detection should be
   included in the system design to protect critical assets and security sensitive areas. All cameras and
   alarms installed for security purposes should be connected to SCADA where available and include
   monitors at manned locations. Alternative methods should be considered for primary use where
   there is no SCADA or as a SCADA support system.

5. Vehicle access should be through controlled locations only. Physical barriers such as moveable
   barriers or ramps should be included in designs to keep vehicles away from critical assets and
   security sensitive areas. It should be impossible for any vehicle to be driven either intentionally or
   accidentally into or adjacent to finished water storage or critical components without facility
   involvement. Designated vehicle areas such as parking lots and drives should be separated from
                                                      xxv
    critical assets with adequate standoff distances to eliminate impacts to these assets from possible
    explosions of material in vehicles.

    Sturdy, weatherproof, locking hardware must be included in the design for the access to tanks, vaults,
    wells, well houses, pump houses, buildings, power stations, transformers, chemical storage, delivery
    areas, chemical fill pipes, and similar facilities. Vent and overflow openings should be placed in
    secure areas. When not placed in secure areas, they should be provided with deterrence or intrusion
    detection equipment.

6. Computer based control technologies such as SCADA must be secured from unauthorized physical
   access and potential cyber attacks. Wireless and network based communications should be
   encrypted as deterrence to hijacking by unauthorized personnel. Vigorous computer access and
   virus protection protocols should be built into computer control systems. Effective data recovery
   hardware and operating protocols should be employed and exercised on a regular basis. All
   automated control systems shall be equipped with manual overrides to provide the option to operate
   manually. The procedures for manual operation including a regular schedule for exercising and
   insuring operator's competence with the manual override systems shall be included in facility
   operation plans.

7. Real time water quality monitoring with continuous recording and alarms should be considered at key
   locations to provide early warning of possible intentional contamination events.

8. Facilities and procedures for delivery, handling and storage of chemicals should be designed to
   ensure that chemicals delivered to and used at the facility cannot be intentionally released, introduced
   or otherwise used to debilitate a water system, its personnel, or the public. Particular attention should
   be given to potentially harmful chemicals used in treatment processes (e.g., strong acids and bases,
   toxic gases and incompatible chemicals) and on maintenance chemicals that may be stored on-site
   (e.g., fuels, herbicides, paints, solvents).

                                           POLICY STATEMENT
                                                  ON
                                           ARSENIC REMOVAL

Arsenic in groundwater is an issue that many water systems must deal with following the maximum
contaminant level revision from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb on January 22, 2006. Several
technologies are available to remove arsenic, from fairly simple to more complex. In much of the Upper
Midwest, arsenic typically exists as As (III) in groundwater, and as As (V) in surface waters. Arsenic in
the form of As (V) is easier to remove due to its insolubility and negative charge. Arsenic As (III) can be
changed to As (V) by a simple oxidation process.

With the different removal technologies comes a wide range of monetary investment. In addition, the
issue of discharging concentrated waste water and/or disposal of solid wastes must be resolved. The
safe and proper disposal of all related treatment wastes must comply with all local, state, federal and
provincial requirements. When planning facilities for arsenic reduction, it is recommended that the
treatment be capable of reducing arsenic levels in the water to one-half the MCL (currently 5 ppb) or less.
The reviewing agency should be contacted, prior to initiating design of the arsenic removal facility, to
determine if a pilot plant study is required, and if so, what operating parameters should be studied. The
following list provides information on different types of typical arsenic treatment technologies and options
for optimization:

Adsorptive Media - Uses metal oxide coatings, usually iron, titanium or aluminum, on the filter media to
remove arsenic. Pre- and post-adjustment of pH will enhance removal rates and reduce corrosivity. This
method needs chemical oxidation of arsenic, iron and manganese (if present), a pre-filter to remove iron
and manganese to prevent fouling of the adsorptive media (if iron levels are too high [near or above 1.0
ppm]), followed by the adsorptive filter media. Costs for implementing this technology may be low to
moderate if a system currently has an iron and/or manganese filter. High levels of iron, sulfate, and
dissolved solids may cause interference or reduce the treatment efficiency.

Oxidation/Filtration (Iron & Manganese removal) - This method uses chemical oxidation of arsenic, iron
and manganese with free chlorine, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), ozone or manganese dioxide with
a manganese greensand, anthracite, pyrolusite, or other proprietary filter media. The water is allowed
detention time and filtration after chemical oxidation. Water with low iron (less than a 20 to 1 ratio of iron
to arsenic) may need additional iron in the form of ferric chloride or ferric sulfate to increase arsenic
removal efficiencies.

Coagulation/Filtration – This method typically consists of the chemical oxidation of arsenic, iron and
manganese, pre- and post-adjustment of pH, the use of a coagulant (ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, or
alum), the use of a polymer, and sedimentation to remove arsenic. Other contaminants may be removed
in this process. Sulfate may cause interference or reduce treatment efficiency.

Other Types of Treatment Technologies:

Anion Exchange - This method uses anion exchange resin (chloride (strong-base), sulfate-selective or
nitrate-selective resins), to remove arsenic. This process may also require the chemical oxidation of
arsenic, iron and manganese (if present), and pre-filters to maximize contaminant removal, and to prevent
fouling of the exchange resin. Post-treatment adjustment of pH is required to reduce corrosivity.
Treatment columns may be in parallel or series (avoid sulfate, nitrate and arsenic breakthrough, and
avoid lowered pH breakthrough immediately after regeneration). Treatment may use anion exchange
after cation exchange to remove hardness (mixed beds not recommended - anion resins are lighter and
column becomes service intensive). Other contaminants that can be removed include sulfate (sulfate-
selective resins); nitrate (nitrate-selective resins); and hardness (mixed cation/anion beds). Iron, sulfate,
and dissolved solids may cause interference or reduce treatment efficiency.

Electrodialysis/Electrodialysis Reversal - Uses an electrical charge of a reverse osmosis (R.O.)
membrane to remove arsenic. Chemical oxidation of arsenic, iron and manganese with filtration is used
                                                    xxvii
to remove oxidized iron and manganese to prevent fouling of the R.O. membrane. Pre- and post-
adjustment of pH may be needed to prevent scaling, to enhance filtration, and to reduce corrosivity.
Other contaminants that may be removed using this technology include hardness, dissolved solids,
nitrates, and sulfates. If iron and manganese are too high, this may cause interference with the arsenic
removal process.

Membrane Filtration (Micro, Ultra, Nanofiltration, and Reverse Osmosis) - Membrane removal utilizes
chemical pre-oxidation (except when using polypropylene membranes), a pre-filter to remove oxidized
iron and manganese (to prevent fouling of the membranes), pre- and post-adjust pH (prevent scaling,
enhance filtration; reduce corrosivity). The treatment can also use ferric chloride or ferric sulfate as a
coagulant. Iron, manganese, and other dissolved solids may cause interference or reduce treatment
efficiency. Reverse osmosis membranes will also remove hardness in the water.

Lime Softening - This technology is based on the optimization of Mg(OH)2 precipitation. High iron
concentrations are desired for optimal arsenic removal. Waters with low dissolved iron may require the
addition of ferric chloride or ferric sulfate. Hardness may also be removed in this process. Other issues
include the disposal of lime sludge, and the high labor intensity of handling lime.

                             AT SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

Concern for microbiological contamination is driving optimization of surface water treatment plant facilities
and operations, and finished water treatment goals have been lowered to levels of <0.10 NTU turbidity.

Treatment plant design should allow for the voluntary pursuit of optimized performance goals to provide
improved public health protection and to assure continuous regulatory compliance. The capability for
surveillance and data collection should be provided for each unit process in order to achieve better
process control and operation, to enhance problem diagnostics, and to document overall improvement.

The following optimization goals should be considered during design:

    Minimum Data Monitoring Requirements
              Daily raw water turbidity (every 4 hours)
              Individual basin settled water turbidity (frequency of data acquisition from continuous

              Filtered water turbidity (frequency of data acquisition from continuous meters should be
              not less than every one minute)

                                     PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES

Chloramination is an application of ammonia and chlorine, with ammonia addition usually downstream of
the application of chlorine at a proper mass ratio of chlorine to ammonia to produce a combined chlorine
residual predominantly in form of monochloramine. Proper chlorine to ammonia ratio must be maintained
to prevent the formation of dichloramine and trichloramine which create taste and odor in drinking water.

Monochloramine is rarely suitable for use as a primary disinfectant because it requires very long contact
time to achieve adequate disinfection at the normally used concentration. Because of its high persistence
characteristics, monochloramine is more commonly used to maintain a chlorine residual in the water
distribution system as a secondary disinfectant.

Chloramine residual is more stable and longer lasting than free chlorine, and it provides better protection
against bacterial re-growth in water distribution systems including large storage tanks, lower flow demand
and dead-end water mains. As a result, it is more effective in controlling biofilm growth in the water
distribution system. Chloramine is not as reactive as chlorine with organic material in water, thereby
producing substantially less disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes in the water distribution
system. However, chloramine may provide less protection from contamination of the distribution system
through cross connections, water main breaks and other causes.

Unlike most substances added to water for treatment purposes, chloramine cannot be prepared at high
concentrations. It can only be made by addition of ammonia to pre-chlorinated water or by adding
chlorine to water containing low concentrations of ammonia. Contact of high concentrations of chlorine
with ammonia or ammonium salts must be avoided to prevent the formation of nitrogen trichloride which is
a sensitive and violently explosive substance.

Operating authorities who wish to modify disinfectant practices by using chloramine must show the
reviewing authority clear evidence that bacteriological and chemical protection of consumers will not be
compromised in any way and that aspects of chloramination mentioned below are considered in any
permit application.

1. Chloramine, which is less powerful than free chlorine, may be suitable for disinfection of some ground
   water supplies but it is inadequate in strength for primary disinfection of surface waters.

2. Chloramine can be suitable for protecting potable water in distribution systems against bacterial
   contamination. The chloramine tends to remain active for longer periods and at greater distances
   from the plant than free chlorine. Chloramine concentrations should be maintained higher than for
   chlorine to avoid nitrifying bacterial activity. A range of 1-2 mg/L, measured as combined chlorine,
   on entry to the distribution system and greater than 1 mg/L at the system extremities is
   recommended. Chloramine can be less odorous than chlorine so these concentrations may be
   tolerated well by consumers.

3. Suitable commercial sources of ammonia for chloramine production are either ammonia gas or water
   solutions of ammonia or ammonium sulphate. Ammonia gas is supplied as compressed liquid in
   cylinders which must be stored in separate facilities designed as for chlorine gas. Ammonia solutions
   must be stored in containment with adequate cooling to prevent gas release from storage and gas
   release must be handled with pressure relief systems. Absorption/neutralization systems for ammonia
   gas leaks/spills must be designed specially for ammonia. Ammonium sulphate is available as free
   flowing powdered solid which must be stored in cool dry conditions and dissolved in water for use.



                                                   xxx
4. Thorough and reasonably rapid mixing of chlorine and ammonia in the main plant stream shall be
   arranged so as to avoid formation of organic chloramines and of odorous dichloramine. Sufficient
   ammonia must be added to provide at least a small excess (more than one part of ammonia to
   between 3 and 5 parts of chlorine) over that required to convert all the free chlorine present to
   chloramine.

5. Addition of ammonia gas or ammonia solution will increase the pH of the water and addition of
   ammonium sulphate depresses the pH. The actual pH shift may be small in well buffered water but
   the effects on disinfectant power and corrosiveness of the water may require consideration. Ammonia
   gas forms alkaline solutions which may cause local plugging by lime deposition. Where hard water is
   to be treated, a side stream of pre-softened water may be needed for ammonia dilution so as to
   reduce plugging problems.

6. The use of chloramine in distribution systems which are not well maintained by flushing, swabbing
   and other regular routine maintenance activities can lead to local loss of disinfectant residual,
   increased nitrifying bacterial activity and, possibly over a period of time, to persistent high coliform
   bacterial counts which may not respond to reversion to the use of free chlorine. Early detection of
   nitrifying bacteria activity may be made by checking for reduced dissolved oxygen, elevated free
   ammonia, elevated HPC, and elevated nitrite and nitrate levels.

7. Chloramine in water is considerably more toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms than free chlorine.
   Consideration must therefore be given to the potential for leaks to contaminate and damage natural
   water course eco-systems. Kidney dialysis treatment can be upset by use of chloraminated water.
   Medical authorities, hospitals and commercial and domestic aquarium keepers should be notified so
   they can arrange for precautions to be taken.

                                  INTERIM STANDARD
                  ON MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGIES FOR PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES

Membrane technologies have a wide range of applications from the use of reverse osmosis for
desalination, inorganic compound removal, and radionuclide removal to the use of lower pressure
membranes for removal of surface water contaminants such as giardia and cryptosporidium. Membrane
technologies are typically separated into four categories based on membrane pore size: reverse osmosis,
nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration. When using membranes for treatment of surface water or
groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, the reviewing agency should be contacted to
determine inactivation/removal credits, Quality Control Release Value (QCRV) requirements and Log
Removal Value (LRV) monitoring requirements for the specific membrane and treatment objective.

The following items should be considered when evaluating the applicability of membrane processes.

1.    Treatment objectives. The selection of the specific membrane process should be matched to the
      desired treatment objectives. Removal is generally related to pore size and as such the larger pore
      size membranes are not appropriate for applications such as inorganic compound or radionuclide
      removal.

2.    Water quality considerations. A review of historical source raw water quality data, including
      turbidity and/or particle counts, seasonal changes, organic loading, microbial activity, and
      temperature differentials as well as other inorganic and physical parameters should be conducted.
      The data should be used to determine feasibility and cost of the system. The degree of pre-
      treatment may also be ascertained from the data. Design considerations and membrane selection
      at this phase must also address the issue of target removal efficiencies and system recovery versus
      acceptable transmembrane pressure differentials. On surface water supplies, pre-screening or
      cartridge filtration may be required. The source water temperature can significantly impact the flux
      of the membrane under consideration. At low water temperatures, the flux can be reduced
      appreciably (due to higher water viscosity and resistance of the membrane to permeate), possibly
      impacting process economics by the number of membrane units required for a full scale facility.
      Seasonal variation of design flow rates may be based on documented lower demand during colder
      weather.

3.    Pilot study/preliminary investigations. Prior to initiating the design of a membrane treatment facility,
      the reviewing agency should be contacted to determine if a pilot plant study will be required. In
      most cases, a pilot plant study will be required to determine the best membrane to use, the need for
      pretreatment, type of post treatment, the bypass ratio, the amount of reject water, system recovery,
      process efficiency, particulate/organism removal efficiencies, cold and warm water flux, fouling
      potential, operating and transmembrane pressure and other design and monitoring considerations.
      Any virus removal credit must also be documented through an appropriate piloting process. The
      reviewing authority should be contacted prior to conducting the pilot study to establish the protocol
      to be followed.

4.    Challenge Testing. Membranes treating surface waters or groundwater under the direct influence
      of a surface water must be challenge tested to establish a product specific maximum
      Cryptosporidium log removal credit.

5.    Pretreatment. Acceptable feedwater characteristics are dependent on the type of membrane and
      operational parameters of the system. Without suitable pretreatment or acceptable feed water
      quality, the membrane may become fouled or scaled and consequently shorten its useful life. For
      reverse osmosis and nanofiltration processes pretreatment is usually needed for turbidity reduction,
      iron or manganese removal, stabilization of the water to prevent scale formation, microbial control,
      chlorine removal (for certain membrane types), and pH adjustment. Usually, at a minimum,
      cartridge filters should be provided for the protection of the reverse osmosis or nanofiltration
      membranes against particulate matter. Where the level of organics in the raw water may negatively
      impact the membrane performance, pretreatment shall be provided.

                                                    xxxii
6.    Membrane materials. Two types of membranes are typically used for reverse osmosis and
      nanofiltration. These are cellulose acetate based and polyamide composites. Membrane
      configurations typically include tubular, spiral wound and hollow fiber. Microfiltration (MF) and
      nanofiltration (NF) membranes are most commonly made from organic polymers such as: cellulose
      acetate, polysulfones, polyamides, polypropylene, polycarbonates, and polyvinylidene. The
      physical configurations include: hollow fiber, spiral wound, and tubular. Operational conditions and
      useful life vary depending on type of membrane selected, quality of feed water, and process
      operating parameters. Some membrane materials are incompatible with certain oxidants. If the
      system must rely on pre-treatment oxidants for other purposes, for example, zebra mussel control,
      taste and odor control, or iron and manganese oxidation, the selection of the membrane material
      becomes a significant design consideration.

7.    Useful life of membranes. Membrane replacement represents a major component in the overall
      cost of water production. The life expectancy of a particular membrane under consideration should
      be evaluated during the pilot study or from other relevant available data. Membrane life may also
      be reduced by operating at consistently high fluxes. Membrane replacement frequency is a
      significant factor in operation and maintenance cost comparisons in the selection of the process.

8.    Treatment efficiency. Reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) are highly efficient in removing
      metallic salts and ions from the raw water. Efficiencies, however, do vary depending on the ion
      being removed and the membrane utilized. For most commonly encountered ions, removal
      efficiencies will range from 85% to over 99%. Organics removal is dependent on the molecular
      weight, shape and charge of the organic molecule and the pore size of the membrane utilized.
      Removal efficiencies may range from as high as 99% to less than 30%, depending on the
      membrane type and organic being considered.

9.    Power consumption. Power consumption may be a significant coast factor for reverse osmosis
      plants. The power consumption of a particular membrane under consideration should be evaluated
      during the pilot study or from other relevant data.

10.   Bypass water. Reverse osmosis (RO) permeate will be virtually demineralized. Nanofiltration (NF)
      permeate may also contain less dissolved minerals than desirable. The design should provide for a
      portion of the raw water to bypass the unit to maintain stable water within the distribution system
      and to improve process economics as long as the raw water does not contain unacceptable
      contaminants. Alternative filtration is required for bypassed surface water or ground water under
      the direct influence of surface water.

11.   Reject water. Reject water from reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes may range from
      10% to 50% of the raw water pumped to the reverse osmosis unit. For most brackish waters and
      ionic contaminant removal applications, reject is in the 10-25% range while for seawater it could be
      as high as 50%. The reject volume should be evaluated in terms of the source availability and from
      the waste treatment availabilities. The amount of reject water from a unit may be reduced to a
      limited extent by increasing the feed pressure to the unit. However, this may result in a shorter
      membrane life. Acceptable methods of waste disposal typically include discharge to a municipal
      sewer system, to waste treatment facilities, or to an evaporation pond.

12.   Backflushing or cross flow cleansing. Automated periodic backflushing and cleaning is employed
      on microfiltraion and ultrafiltration on a timed basis or once a target transmembrane pressure
      differential has been reached. Back flushing volumes can range from 5 -15 percent of the
      permeate flow depending upon the frequency of flushing/cleaning and the degree of fouling and this
      should be considered in the treatment system sizing and the capacity of the raw water source

13.   Membrane cleaning. The membrane must be periodically cleaned with acid, detergents and
      possibly disinfection. Method of cleaning and chemicals used must be approved by the state

                                                  xxxiii
      reviewing agency. Care must be taken in the cleaning process to prevent contamination of both the
      raw and finished water system. Cleaning chemicals, frequency and procedure should follow
      membrane manufacturer’s guidelines. Cleaning chemicals should be NSF/ANSI Standard 60
      certified.

14.   Membrane integrity and finished water monitoring. An appropriate level of direct and indirect
      integrity testing is required to routinely evaluate membrane and housing integrity and overall
      filtration performance. Direct integrity testing may include pressure and vacuum decay tests for
      MF& UF and marker-based tests for NF & RO. These are usually conducted at least once per day.
      Indirect monitoring options may include particle counters and/or turbidity monitors and should be
      done continuously. Consult the appropriate regulatory agency regarding specific process monitoring
      requirements.

15.   Cross connection control. Cross connection control considerations must be incorporated into the
      system design, particularly with regard to chemical feeds and waste piping used for membrane
      cleaning, waste stream and concentrate. Typical protection includes block & bleed valves on the
      chemical cleaning lines and air gaps on the drain lines.

16.   Redundancy of critical components. Redundancy of critical control components including but not
      limited to valves, air supply, and computers shall be required as per the reviewing authority.

17.   Post treatment. Post treatment of water treated using reverse osmosis or nanofiltration typically
      includes degasification for carbon dioxide (if excessive) and hydrogen sulfide removal (if present),
      pH and hardness adjustment for corrosion control and disinfection as a secondary pathogen control
      and for distribution system protection.

18.   Operator training. The ability to obtain qualified operators must be evaluated in selection of the
      treatment process. The necessary operator training shall be provided prior to plant startup.

19.   Control systems.

      a. Back-up systems. Automated monitoring and control systems shall be provided with back-up
         power and operational control systems consisting of the following:

          1. dual running programmable logic controllers (PLCs) with synchronized programs and
             memory, or spare PLCs loaded with the most current program;

          2. spare input/output (I/O) cards of each type;

          3.   a minimum of 2 human machine interfaces (HMI);

          4.   backup power supply including uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

      b. Remote or unmanned operational control. Systems designed for remote or unmanned control
         shall be provided alarms, communication systems, and automatic shutdown processes. The
         reviewing authority shall be contacted to determine the extent of operational control required. At
         a minimum the following alarms shall be provided:

         1.    high raw or filtrate turbidity;

         2.    pump failure;

         3.    high pressure decay test;

         4.    high trans-membrane pressure;

TREATMENT                                                                                         PART 4

4.0 GENERAL

   The design of treatment processes and devices shall depend on evaluation of the nature and quality of
   the particular water to be treated, seasonal variations, the desired quality of the finished water and the
   mode of operation planned. The design of a water treatment plant shall consider the worst condition
   that may exist during the life of the facility.

4.1 MICROSCREENING

   Microscreening is a mechanical treatment process capable of removing suspended matter and organic
   loading from surface water by straining. It shall not be used in place of filtration or coagulation.

 4.1.1 Design

   a. consideration shall be given to the:

     1. nature of the suspended matter to be removed;

     2. corrosiveness of the water;

     3. effect of chemicals used for pre-treatment;

     4. duplication of units for continuous operation during equipment maintenance;

     5. provision of automated backwashing

   b. shall provide:

     1. a durable, corrosion-resistant screen;

     2. provisions to allow for by-pass of the screen;

     3. protection against back-siphonage when potable water is used for backwashing;

     4. proper disposal of backwash waters (See Part 9).

4.2 CLARIFICATION

   Clarification is generally considered to consist of any process or combination of processes which
   reduce the concentration of suspended matter in drinking water prior to filtration.

   Plants designed to treat surface water, groundwater under the direct influence of a surface water, or
   for the removal of a primary drinking water contaminant shall have a minimum of two units each for
   coagulation, flocculation, and solids removal. In addition, it is recommended that plants designed
   solely for aesthetic purposes also have a minimum of two units each. Design of the clarification
   process shall:

   a. permit operation of the units either in series or parallel where softening is performed and should
      permit series or parallel operation in other circumstances where clarification is performed;

   b. be constructed to permit units to be taken out of service without disrupting operation, and with
      drains or pumps sized to allow dewatering in a reasonable period of time;


                                                   -33-
TREATMENT                                                                                          PART 4

  c.   provide multiple-stage treatment facilities when required by the reviewing authority;

  d. be started manually following shutdown;

  e. minimize hydraulic head losses between units to allow future changes in processes without the
     need for repumping.

  4.2.1 Presedimentation

       Waters containing high turbidity may require pretreatment, usually sedimentation, with or without
       the addition of coagulation chemicals.

       a. Basin design - Presedimentation basins should have hopper bottoms or be equipped with
          continuous mechanical sludge removal apparatus, and provide arrangements for dewatering.

       b. Inlet - Incoming water shall be dispersed across the full width of the line of travel as quickly as
          possible; short-circuiting must be prevented.

       c.   Bypass - Provisions for bypassing presedimentation basins shall be included.

       d. Detention time - Three hours detention is the minimum period recommended; greater
          detention may be required.

  4.2.2 Coagulation

       Coagulation refers to a process using coagulant chemicals and mixing by which colloidal and
       suspended material are destabilized and agglomerated into settleable or filterable flocs, or both.
       The engineer shall submit the design basis for the velocity gradient (G value) selected,
       considering the chemicals to be added and water temperature, color and other related water
       quality parameters. For surface water plants using direct or conventional filtration, the use of a
       primary coagulant is required at all times.

       a. Mixing – The detention period should be instantaneous, but not longer than thirty seconds with
          mixing equipment capable of imparting a minimum velocity gradient (G) of at least 750 fps/ft.
          The design engineer should determine the appropriate G value and detention time through jar
          testing.

       b. Equipment - Basins should be equipped with devices capable of providing adequate mixing for
          all treatment flow rates. Static mixing may be considered where the flow is relatively constant
          and will be high enough to maintain the necessary turbulence for complete chemical reactions.

       c.   Location - the coagulation and flocculation basin shall be as close together as possible.

       d. If flow is split between basins, it is recommended that a means of measuring and modifying
           the flow to each train or unit be provided.

       e. If flow is split, it is recommended that a means of modifying the flow to each train or unit be
          provided.

TREATMENT                                                                                         PART 4

  4.2.3 Flocculation

      Flocculation refers to a process to enhance agglomeration or collection of smaller floc particles
      into larger, more easily settleable or filterable particles through gentle stirring by hydraulic or
      mechanical means.

      a. Basin Design - Inlet and outlet design shall minimize short-circuiting and destruction of floc.
         Series compartments are recommended to further minimize short-circuiting and to provide
         decreasing mixing energy with time. Basins shall be designed so that individual basins may
         be isolated without disrupting plant operation. A drain and/or pumps shall be provided to
         handle dewatering and sludge removal.

      b. Detention – The detention time for floc formation should be at least 30 minutes with
         consideration to using tapered (i.e., diminishing velocity gradient) flocculation. The
         flow-through velocity should be not less than 0.5 nor greater than 1.5 feet per minute.

      c.   Equipment - Agitators shall be driven by variable speed drives with the peripheral speed of
           paddles ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 feet per second. External, non-submerged motors are
           preferred.

      d. Other designs - Baffling may be used to provide for flocculation in small plants only after
         consultation with the reviewing authority. The design should be such that the velocities and
         flows noted above will be maintained.

      e. Superstructure - A superstructure over the flocculation basins may be required.

      f.   Piping - Flocculation and sedimentation basins shall be as close together as possible. The
           velocity of flocculated water through pipes or conduits to settling basins shall be no less than
           0.5 nor greater than 1.5 feet per second. Allowances must be made to minimize turbulence at
           bends and changes in direction.

      g.   If flow is split, it is recommended that a means of measuring and modifying the flow to each
           train or unit be provided.

      h. Consideration should be given to the need for additional chemical feed in the future.

  4.2.4 Sedimentation

      Sedimentation refers to a process that allows particles to settle by gravity and typically precedes
      filtration. The detention time for effective clarification is dependent upon a number of factors
      related to basin design and the nature of the raw water. The following criteria apply to
      conventional gravity sedimentation units:

      a. A minimum of four hours of settling time shall be provided. This may be reduced to two hours
         for lime-soda softening facilities treating only groundwater. Reduced detention time may also
         be approved when equivalent effective settling is demonstrated or when the overflow rate is
         not more than 0.5 gpm per square foot (1.2 m/hr).

      b. Inlet devices - Inlets shall be designed to distribute the water equally and at uniform velocities.
         Open ports, submerged ports, and similar entrance arrangements are required. A baffle
         should be constructed across the basin close to the inlet end and should project several feet
         below the water surface to dissipate inlet velocities and provide uniform flows across the
         basin.

                                                   -35-

    c.   If flow is split, a means of measuring the flow to each train or unit shall be provided.

    d. Velocity - The velocity through a sedimentation basin should not exceed 0.5 feet per minute.
       The basins must be designed to minimize short-circuiting. Fixed or adjustable baffles must be
       provided as necessary to achieve the maximum potential for clarification.

    e. If flow is split, it is recommended that a means of modifying the flow to each train or unit be
       provided.

    f.   Outlet devices - Outlet weirs or submerged orifices shall maintain velocities suitable for settling
         in the basin and minimize short-circuiting. The use of submerged orifices is recommended in
         order to provide a volume above the orifices for storage when there are fluctuations in flow.
         Outlet weirs and submerged orifices shall be designed as follows:

         1. The rate of flow over the outlet weirs or through the submerged orifices shall not exceed
                                                     3
            20,000 gallons per day per foot (250 m /day/m) of the outlet launder or orifice
            circumference.

         2. Submerged orifices should not be located lower than three (3) feet below the flow line.

         3. The entrance velocity through the submerged orifices shall not exceed 0.5 feet per
            second.

    g. Overflow - An overflow weir or pipe designed to establish the maximum water level desired on
       top of the filters should be provided. The overflow shall discharge by gravity with a free fall at
       a location where the discharge can be observed.

    h. Superstructure - A superstructure over the sedimentation basins may be required. If there is
       no mechanical equipment in the basins and if provisions are included for adequate monitoring
       under all expected weather conditions, a cover may be provided in lieu of a superstructure.

    i.   Drainage – Sedimentation basins must be provided with a means for dewatering. Basin
         bottoms should slope toward the drain not less than one foot in twelve feet where mechanical
         sludge collection equipment is not required.

    j.   Flushing lines - Flushing lines or hydrants shall be provided and must be equipped with
         backflow prevention devices acceptable to the reviewing authority.

    k.   Safety - Permanent ladders or handholds should be provided on the inside walls of basins
         above the water level. Guard rails should be included. Compliance with other applicable
         safety requirements, such as OSHA, shall be required.

    l.   Sludge collection system – shall be designed to ensure the collection of sludge from
         throughout the basin.

    m. Sludge removal - Sludge removal design shall provide that:

         1. sludge pipes shall be not less than three inches in diameter and arranged to facilitate
            cleaning;

         2. entrance to sludge withdrawal piping shall prevent clogging;

         3. valves shall be located outside the tank for accessibility;

                                                  -36-
TREATMENT                                                                                         PART 4


         4. the operator can observe and sample sludge being withdrawn from the unit.

    n.   Sludge disposal - Facilities are required by the reviewing authority for disposal of sludge. (See
         Part 9).

    4.2.5 Solids contact unit

    Units are generally acceptable for combined softening and clarification where water characteristics,
    especially temperature, do not fluctuate rapidly, flow rates are uniform and operation is continuous.
    Before such units are considered as clarifiers without softening, specific approval of the reviewing
    authority shall be obtained. Each clarifier should be designed for the maximum day demand and
    should be adjustable to changes in flow which are less than the design rate and for changes in
    water characteristics. Plants designed to treat surface water or groundwater under the direct
    influence of a surface water using solids contact shall have a minimum of two units. In addition, it is
    recommended that plants designed for the removal of a non-acute primary drinking water
    contaminant or for aesthetic purposes also have a minimum of two units.

         4.2.5.1 Installation of equipment

             Supervision by a representative of the manufacturer shall be provided with regard to all

         properly protected against backflow or back siphonage.

       f. Drainage -- Drain piping from the settler units must be sized to facilitate a quick flush of
          the settler units and to prevent flooding other portions of the plant.

      g. Placement

           Modules should be placed:

           1.   in zones of stable hydraulic conditions;

           2.   in areas nearest effluent launders for basins not completely covered by the modules.

                                   3        2
           filter area (0.9 - 1.5 m /min/m ) when the air is introduced in the underdrain; a lower air
           rate must be used when the air scour distribution system is placed above the underdrains.

        b. A method for avoiding excessive loss of the filter media during backwashing must be
           provided.

        c.   Air scouring must be followed by a fluidization wash sufficient to restratify the media.

        e. Air scour distribution systems should be placed below the media and supporting bed
           interface; if placed at the interface the air scour nozzles shall be designed to prevent
           media from clogging the nozzles or entering the air distribution system.

        f.   Piping for the air distribution system shall not be flexible hose which will collapse when not
             under air pressure and shall not be a relatively soft material which may erode at the orifice
             opening with the passage of air at high velocity.

        g. Air delivery piping shall not pass down through the filter media nor shall there be any
           arrangement in the filter design which would allow short circuiting between the applied
           unfiltered water and the filtered water.

        h. Consideration should be given to maintenance and replacement of air delivery piping.

        i.   The backwash water delivery system must be capable of 15 gallons per minute per square
             foot of filter surface area (37 m/hr); however, when air scour is provided the backwash
             water rate must be variable and should not exceed 8 gallons per minute per square foot
             (20 m/hr) unless operating experience shows that a higher rate is necessary to remove
             scoured particles from filter media surfaces.

        j.   The filter underdrains shall be designed to accommodate air scour piping when the piping
             is installed in the underdrain.

        may be 45 to 150 gallons per day per square foot of sand area (1.8 - 6.1 m/day), with
        somewhat higher rates acceptable when demonstrated to the satisfaction of the approving
        authority.

    4.3.4.5 Underdrains

        Each filter unit shall be equipped with a main drain and an adequate number of lateral

           e. The sand shall be rebedded when scraping has reduced the bed depth to no less than 19
              inches. Where sand is to be reused in order to provide biological seeding and shortening
              of the ripening process, rebedding shall utilize a “throw over” technique whereby new sand
              is placed on the support gravel and existing sand is replaced on top of the new sand.

      4.3.4.7 Filter gravel

           The supporting gravel should be similar to the size and depth distribution provided for rapid

           b. an indicating loss of head gauge or other means to measure head loss;

           c.   an indicating rate-of-flow meter. A modified rate controller that limits the rate of filtration to
                a maximum rate may be used. However, equipment that simply maintains a constant
                water level on the filters is not acceptable, unless the rate of flow onto the filter is properly
                controlled. A pump or a flow meter in each filter effluent line may be used as the limiting
                device for the rate of filtration only after consultation with the reviewing authority;

           d. provisions for filtering to waste with appropriate measures for cross connection control;

           e. an orifice, Venturi meter, or other suitable means of discharge measurement installed on
              each filter to control the rate of filtration;

           f.   an effluent pipe designed to maintain the water level above the top of the filter sand.

      4.3.4.10 Ripening

           Slow sand filters shall be operated to waste after scraping or rebedding during a ripening
           period until the filter effluent turbidity falls to consistently below the regulated drinking water
           standard established for the system.

  4.3.5 Direct filtration

      Direct filtration, as used herein, refers to the filtration of a surface water following chemical
      coagulation and possibly flocculation but without prior settling. The nature of the treatment
      process will depend upon the raw water quality. A full scale direct filtration plant shall not be
      constructed without prior pilot studies which are acceptable to the reviewing authority. In-plant
      demonstration studies may be appropriate where conventional treatment plants are converted to
      direct filtration. Where direct filtration is proposed, an engineering report shall be submitted prior
      to conducting pilot plant or in-plant demonstration studies.

        Prior to the initiation of design plans and specifications, a final report including the engineer's
        design recommendations shall be submitted to the reviewing authority.

        The pilot plant filter must be of a similar type and operated in the same manner as proposed
        for full scale operation.

        The pilot study must determine the contact time necessary for optimum filtration for each
        coagulant proposed.

    4.3.5.3 Pretreatment - Coagulation and flocculation

        The final coagulation and flocculation basin design should be based on the pilot plant or
        in-plant demonstration studies augmented with applicable portions of Section 4.2.2,
        "Coagulation" and Section 4.2.3, "Flocculation."

    4.3.5.4 Filtration

        Filters shall be rapid rate gravity filters with dual or mixed media. The final filter design shall
        be based on the pilot plant or in-plant demonstration studies and all portions of Section 4.3.1,
        "Rapid Rate Gravity Filters." Pressure filters or single media sand filters shall not be used.

        a. The following shall be provided for every filter:

             1. influent and effluent sampling taps;

             2. an indicating loss of head gauge;

             3. a meter indicating instantaneous rate of flow;

             4. where used for surface water, provisions for filtering to waste with appropriate
                measures for cross connection control;

             5. for systems with three or more filters, on-line turbidimeters shall be installed on the
                effluent line from each filter. All turbidimeters shall consistently determine and
                indicate the turbidity of the water in NTUs. Each turbidimeter shall report to a recorder
                that is designed and operated to allow the operator to accurately determine the
                turbidity at least once every 15 minutes. Turbidimeters on individual filters should be
                designed to accurately measure low-range turbidities and have an alarm that will
                sound when the effluent level exceeds 0.3 NTU. It is recommended that turbidimeters
                be placed in a location that also allows measurement of turbidity during filter to waste;

             6.   a flow rate controller capable of providing gradual rate increases when placing the
                  filters back into operation.

        b. It is recommended the following be provided for every filter:
                                                 -55-
TREATMENT                                                                                           PART 4


                 1. wall sleeves providing access to the filter interior at several locations for sampling or
                    pressure sensing;

                 2. a 1 to 1.5 inch pressure hose and storage rack at the operating floor for washing filter
                    walls;

                 3. particle monitoring equipment as a means to enhance overall treatment operations
                    where used for surface water.

      4.3.5.6 Siting requirements

           The plant design and land ownership surrounding the plant shall allow for modifications of the
           plant.

  4.3.6 Deep bed rapid rate gravity filters

       Deep bed rapid rate gravity filters, as used herein, generally refers to rapid rate gravity filters with
       filter material depths equal to or greater than 48 inches. Filter media sizes are typically larger
       than those listed in Section 4.3.1.6.d.

       Deep bed rapid rate filters may be considered based on pilot studies pre-approved by the
       reviewing authority.

       The final filter design shall be based on the pilot plant studies and shall comply with all applicable
       portions of Section 4.3.1. Careful attention shall be paid to the design of the backwash system
       which usually includes simultaneous air scour and water backwash at subfluidization velocities.

  4.3.7 Biologically active filters

       Biologically active filtration, as used herein, refers to the filtration of surface water (or a ground
       water with iron, manganese, ammonia or significant natural organic material) which includes the
       establishment and maintenance of biological activity within the filter media.

       Objectives of biologically active filtration may include control of disinfection byproduct precursors,
       increased disinfectant stability, reduction of substrates for microbial regrowth, breakdown of small
       quantities of synthetic organic chemicals, reduction of ammonia-nitrogen, and oxidation of iron
       and manganese. Biological activity can have an adverse impact on turbidity, particle and
       microbial pathogen removal, disinfection practices; head loss development; filter run times and
       distribution system corrosion. Design and operation should ensure that aerobic conditions are
       maintained at all times. Biologically active filtration often includes the use of ozone as a pre-
       oxidant/disinfectant which breaks down natural organic materials into biodegradable organic
       matter and granular activated carbon filter media which may promote denser biofilms.

       Biologically active filters may be considered based on pilot studies pre-approved by the reviewing
       authority. The study objectives must be clearly defined and must ensure the microbial quality of
       the filtered water under all anticipated conditions of operation.

       The pilot study shall be of sufficient duration to ensure establishment of full biological activity;
       often greater than three months is required. Also, the pilot study shall establish empty bed
       contact time, biomass loading, and/or other parameters necessary for successful operation as
       required by the reviewing authority.

       The final filter design shall be based on the pilot plant studies and shall comply with all applicable
       portions of Section 4.3.1.

4.4 DISINFECTION

  Chlorine is historically the preferred disinfecting agent. Disinfection may be accomplished with gas
  and liquid chlorine, calcium or sodium hypochlorites, chlorine dioxide, ozone, or ultraviolet light. Other
  disinfecting agents will be considered, providing reliable application equipment is available and testing
  procedures for a residual are recognized in "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
  Wastewater," latest edition or an equivalent means of measuring effectiveness exists. Disinfection is
  required for all surface water supplies, groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, and for
  any groundwater supply of questionable sanitary quality or where other treatment is provided.
  Disinfection with chloramines is not recommended for primary disinfection. The required amount of
  primary disinfection needed shall be specified by the reviewing authority. Continuous disinfection is
  recommended for all water supplies. Consideration must be given to the formation of disinfection
  byproducts (DBP) when selecting the disinfectant.

  4.4.1 Chlorination equipment

      4.4.1.1 Type

          Solution-feed gas chlorinators or hypochlorite feeders of the positive displacement type must
          be provided. (See Part 5).

      4.4.1.2 Capacity

          The chlorinator capacity shall be such that a free chlorine residual of at least 2 mg/L can be
          maintained in the water once all demands are met after an effective contact time of at least 30
          minutes when maximum flow rate coincides with anticipated maximum chlorine demand. The
          equipment shall be of such design that it will operate accurately over the desired feeding
          range.

      4.4.1.3 Standby equipment

          Where chlorination is required for protection of the supply, standby equipment of sufficient
          capacity shall be available to replace the largest unit. Spare parts shall be made available to
          replace parts subject to wear and breakage. If there is a large difference in feed rates
          between routine and emergency dosages, a gas metering tube should be provided for each
          dose range to ensure accurate control of the chlorine feed.

      4.4.1.4 Automatic switch-over

          Automatic switch-over of chlorine cylinders should be provided, where necessary, to assure
          continuous disinfection.

      4.4.1.5 Automatic proportioning

          Automatic proportioning chlorinators will be required where the rate of flow or chlorine demand
          is not reasonably constant.

      4.4.1.6 Eductor

          Each eductor must be selected for the point of application with particular attention given to the
          quantity of chlorine to be added, the maximum injector waterflow, the total discharge back
                                                   -57-
TREATMENT                                                                                        PART 4

           pressure, the injector operating pressure, and the size of the chlorine solution line. Gauges for
           measuring water pressure and vacuum at the inlet and outlet of each eductor should be
           provided.

      4.4.1.7 Injector/diffuser

           The chlorine solution injector/diffuser must be compatible with the point of application to
           provide a rapid and thorough mix with all the water being treated. The center of a pipeline is
           the preferred application point.

  4.4.2 Contact time and point of application

      a. Due consideration shall be given to the contact time of the disinfectant in water with relation to
         pH, ammonia, taste-producing substances, temperature, bacterial quality, disinfection
         byproduct formation potential and other pertinent factors. The disinfectant should be applied
         at a point which will provide adequate contact time. All basins used for disinfection must be
         designed to minimize short circuiting. Additional baffling can be added to new or existing
         basins to minimize short circuiting and increase contact time.

      b. At plants treating surface water, provisions shall be made for applying the disinfectant to the
         raw water, settled water, filtered water, and water entering the distribution system.

      c.   As a minimum, at plants treating groundwater, provisions shall be made for applying the
           disinfectant to the detention basin inlet and water entering the distribution system.

      d. The amount of contact time provided will depend on the type of disinfectant used along with
         the parameters mentioned in 4.4.2.a. As a minimum, for surface waters and groundwaters
         under the direct influence of surface water, the system must be designed to meet the CT
         standards set by the reviewing authority. If primary disinfection is accomplished using ozone
         or some other chemical that does not provide a residual disinfectant, then chlorine must be
         added to provide a residual disinfectant as mentioned in 4.4.3. Disinfection for groundwaters
         shall be as determined by the reviewing authority.

  4.4.3 Residual chlorine

      a. Minimum free chlorine residual in a water distribution system should be 0.2 mg/L. Minimum
         chloramine residuals, where chloramination is practiced, should be 1.0 mg/L at distant points
         in the distribution system.

      b. Higher residuals may be required depending on pH, temperature and other characteristics of
         the water.

  4.4.4 Testing equipment

      a. Chlorine residual test equipment recognized in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
         Examination of Water and Wastewater shall be provided and should be capable of measuring
         residuals to the nearest 0.01 mg/L in the range below 1.0 mg/L, to the nearest 0.1 mg/L
         between 1.0 mg/L and 2.5 mg/L and to the nearest 0.2 mg/L above 2.5 mg/L. It is
         recommended that all systems, as a minimum, use an instrument with a digital readout.

      b. Automatic chlorine residual recorders should be provided where the chlorine demand varies
         appreciably over a short period of time.

TREATMENT                                                                                         PART 4

      c.   All treatment plants having a capacity of 0.5 million gallons per day or greater should be
           equipped with recording chlorine analyzers monitoring water entering the distribution system.
           (see Section 2.9).

      d. All surface water treatment plants that serve a population greater that 3300 must have
         equipment to measure chlorine residuals continuously entering the distribution system.

      e. Systems that rely on chlorination for inactivation of bacteria or other microorganisms present
         in the source water shall have continuous chlorine residual analyzers and other equipment
         that automatically shut down the facility when chlorine residuals are not met unless otherwise
         approved by the reviewing authority.

      f. All continuously recording chlorine residual analyzers must be compatible with the
         requirements of EPA Method 334.0 or ChloroSense (Palintest).

  4.4.5 Chlorinator piping

      4.4.5.1 Cross-connection protection

           The chlorinator water supply piping shall be designed to prevent contamination of the treated
           water supply by sources of questionable quality. At all facilities treating surface water, pre-
           and post-chlorination systems must be independent to prevent possible siphoning of partially
           treated water into the clear well. The water supply to each eductor shall have a separate
           shut-off valve. No master shut-off valve will be allowed.

      4.4.5.2 Pipe material

           The pipes carrying elemental liquid or dry gaseous chlorine under pressure must be Schedule
           80 seamless steel tubing or other materials recommended by the Chlorine Institute (never use
           PVC). Rubber, PVC, polyethylene, or other materials recommended by the Chlorine Institute
           must be used for chlorine solution piping and fittings. Nylon products are not acceptable for
           any part of the chlorine solution piping system.

  4.4.6    Housing

      Adequate housing must be provided for the chlorination equipment and for storing the chlorine.
      (see Part 5).

  4.4.7    Ozone

      4.4.7.1 Design considerations

           Ozonation systems are generally used for the purpose of disinfection, oxidation and
           microflocculation. When applied, all of these reactions may occur but typically only one is the
           primary purpose for its use. The other reactions would become secondary benefits of the
           installation.

           Effective disinfection occurs as demonstrated by the fact that the "CT" values for ozone, for
           inactivation of viruses and Giardia cysts, are considerably lower than the "CT" values for other
           disinfectants. In addition, recent research indicates that ozone can be an effective disinfectant
           for the inactivation of cryptosporidium. Microflocculation and enhanced filterability has been
           demonstrated for many water supplies but has not occurred in all waters. Oxidation of organic
           compounds such as color, taste and odor, and detergents and inorganic compounds such as

                                                   -59-
TREATMENT                                                                                      PART 4

       iron, manganese, heavy metals and hydrogen sulfide has been documented. The
       effectiveness of oxidation has been varied, depending on pH and alkalinity of the water.

       These parameters affect the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, or, conversely the
       scavenging of this oxidant. High levels of hydroxyl radicals cause lower levels of residual
       ozone. Depending on the desired oxidation reaction, it may be necessary to maximize ozone
       residual or maximize hydroxyl radical formation. For disinfection, residual ozone is necessary
       for development of "CT".

       As a minimum, bench scale studies shall be conducted to determine minimum and maximum
       ozone dosages for disinfection "CT" compliance and oxidation reactions. More involved pilot
       studies shall be conducted when necessary to document benefits and DBP precursor removal
       effectiveness. Consideration shall be given to multiple points of ozone addition. Pilot studies
       shall be conducted for all surface waters. Extreme care must be taken during bench and pilot
       scale studies to ensure accurate results. Particularly sensitive measurements include gas flow
       rate, water flow rate, and ozone concentration.

       Following the use of ozone, the application of a disinfectant which maintains a measurable
       residual will be required in order to ensure bacteriologically safe water is carried throughout
       the distribution system.

       Furthermore, because of the more sophisticated nature of the ozone process a higher degree
       of operator maintenance skills and training is required. The ability to obtain qualified operators
       must be evaluated in selection of the treatment process. The necessary operator training shall
       be provided prior to plant startup.

       The production of ozone is an energy intensive process: substantial economies in electrical
       usage, reduction in equipment size, and waste heat removal requirements can be obtained by
       using oxygen enriched air or 100% oxygen as feed, and by operating at increased electrical
       frequency.

       Use of ozone may result in increases in biologically available organics content of the treated
       water. Consideration of biologically active filtration may be required to stabilize some treated
       waters. Ozone use may also lead to increased chlorinated byproduct levels if the water is not
       stabilized and free chlorine is used for distribution protection.

    4.4.7.2 Feed Gas Preparation

       a. General

       Feed gas can be air, oxygen enriched air, or high purity oxygen. Sources of high purity
       oxygen include purchased liquid oxygen; on site generation using cryogenic air separation; or
       temperature, pressure or vacuum swing (adsorptive separation) technology. For high purity
       oxygen-feed systems, dryers typically are not required.

       Air handling equipment on conventional low pressure air feed systems shall consist of an air
       compressor, water/air separator, refrigerant dryer, heat reactivated desiccant dryer, and
       particulate filters. Some "package" ozonation systems for small plants may work effectively
       operating at high pressure without the refrigerant dryer and with a "heat-less" desiccant dryer.
                                                                                         o      o
       In all cases the design engineer must ensure that the maximum dew point of -76 F (-60 C) will
       not be exceeded at any time.

TREATMENT                                                                                    PART 4

      b. Air Compression

           1. Air compressors shall be of the liquid-ring or rotary lobe, oil-less, positive
              displacement type for smaller systems or dry rotary screw compressors for larger
              systems.

           2. The air compressors shall have the capacity to simultaneously provide for maximum
              ozone demand, provide the air flow required for purging the desiccant dryers (where
              required) and allow for standby capacity.

           3. Air feed for the compressor shall be drawn from a point protected from rain,
              condensation, mist, fog and contaminated air sources to minimize moisture and
              hydrocarbon content of the air supply.

           4. A compressed air after-cooler and/or entrainment separator with automatic drain shall
              be provided prior to the dryers to reduce the water vapor.

           5. A back-up air compressor must be provided so that ozone generation is not
              interrupted in the event of a break-down.

      c.   Air Drying

           1. Dry, dust-free and oil-free feed gas must be provided to the ozone generator. Dry gas
              is essential to prevent formation of nitric acid, to increase the efficiency of ozone
              generation and to prevent damage to the generator dielectrics. Sufficient drying to a
                                          o      o
              maximum dew point of -76 F (-60 C) must be provided at the end of the drying cycle.

           2. Drying for high pressure systems may be accomplished using heatless desiccant
              dryers only. For low pressure systems, a refrigeration air dryer in series with
              heat-reactivated desiccant dryers shall be used.

                                                                                   o    o
           3. A refrigeration dryer capable of reducing inlet air temperature to 40 F (4 C). shall be
              provided for low pressure air preparation systems. The dryer can be of the

               particulates greater than 0.1 microns in diameter, or smaller if specified by the
               generator manufacturer.

       e. Preparation Piping

            Piping in the air preparation system can be common grade steel, seamless copper,
            stainless steel or galvanized steel. The piping must be designed to withstand the
            maximum pressures in the air preparation system.

    4.4.7.3 Ozone Generator

       a. Capacity

            1. The production rating of the ozone generators shall be stated in pounds per day and
               kWhr per pound at a maximum cooling water temperature and maximum ozone
               concentration.

            2. The design shall ensure that the minimum concentration of ozone in the generator exit
               gas will not be less than 1 percent (by weight).

            3. Generators shall be sized to have sufficient reserve capacity so that the system does
               not operate at peak capacity for extended periods of time. This can result in
               premature breakdown of the dielectrics.

            4. The production rate of ozone generators will decrease as the temperature of the
               coolant increases. If there is to be a variation in the supply temperature of the coolant
               throughout the year, then pertinent data shall be used to determine production
               changes due to the temperature change of the supplied coolant. The design shall
               ensure that the generators can produce the required ozone at maximum coolant
               temperature.

            5. Appropriate ozone generator backup equipment must be provided.

       b. Electrical

            The generators can be low, medium or high frequency type. Specifications shall require
            that the transformers, electronic circuitry and other electrical hardware be proven, high
            quality components designed for ozone service.

       c.   Cooling

            Adequate cooling shall be provided. The required water flow to an ozone generator varies
            with the ozone production. Normally unit design provides a maximum cooling water
                                 o      o
            temperature rise of 5 F (2.8 C). The cooling water must be properly treated to minimize
            corrosion, scaling and microbiological fouling of the water side of the tubes. A closed loop
            cooling water system is often used to insure proper water conditions are maintained.
            Where cooling water is treated, cross connection control shall be provided to prevent
            contamination of the potable water supply in accordance with Section 8.10.2.

           7. Where necessary a system shall be provided between the contactor and the off-gas
              destruct unit to remove froth from the air and return the other to the contactor or other
              location acceptable to the reviewing authority. If foaming is expected to be excessive,
              then a potable water spray system shall be placed in the contactor head space.

           8. All openings into the contactor for pipe connections, hatchways, etc. shall be properly
              sealed using welds or ozone resistant gaskets such as Teflon or Hypalon.

TREATMENT                                                                                       PART 4

             12. The depth of water in bubble diffuser contactors should be a minimum of 18 feet. The
                 contactor should also have a minimum of 3 feet of freeboard to allow for foaming.

             13. All contactors shall have provisions for cleaning, maintenance and drainage of the
                 contactor. Each contactor compartment shall also be equipped with an access
                 hatchway.

             14. Aeration diffusers shall be fully serviceable by either cleaning or replacement.

        b. Other contactors

             Other contactors, such as the venturi or aspirating turbine mixer contactor, may be
             approved by the reviewing authority provided adequate ozone transfer is achieved and the
             required contact times and residuals can be met and verified.

    4.4.7.5 Ozone Destruction Unit

        a. A system for treating the final off-gas from each contactor must be provided in order to
           meet safety and air quality standards. Acceptable systems include thermal destruction
           and thermal/catalytic destruction units.

        b. In order to reduce the risk of fires, the use of units that operate at lower temperatures is
           encouraged, especially where high purity oxygen is the feed gas.

        c.   The maximum allowable ozone concentration in the discharge is 0.1 ppm (by volume).

        d. At least two units shall be provided which are each capable of handling the entire gas flow.

        e. Exhaust blowers shall be provided in order to draw off-gas from the contactor into the
           destruct unit.

        f.   Catalysts must be protected from froth, moisture and other impurities which may harm the
             catalyst.

        g. The catalyst and heating elements shall be located where they can easily be reached for
           maintenance.

    4.4.7.6 Piping Materials

        Only low carbon 304L and 316L stainless steels shall be used for ozone service with 316L the
        preferred.

    4.4.7.7 Joints and Connections

        a. Connections on piping used for ozone service are to be welded where possible.

        b. Connections with meters, valves or other equipment are to be made with flanged joints
           with ozone resistant gaskets, such as Teflon of Hypalon. Screwed fittings shall not be
           used because of their tendency to leak.

        c.   A positive closing plug or butterfly valve plus a leak-proof check valve shall be provided in
             the piping between the generator and the contactor to prevent moisture reaching the
             generator.

          ozone generators. Each generator shall have a trip which shuts down the generator when
          the wattage exceeds a certain preset level.

       c.   Dew point monitors shall be provided for measuring the moisture of the feed gas from the
            desiccant dryers. Because it is critical to maintain the specified dew point, it is
            recommended that continuous recording charts be used for dew point monitoring which
            will allow for proper adjustment of the dryer cycle. Where there is potential for moisture
            entering the ozone generator from downstream of the unit or where moisture accumulation
            can occur in the generator during shutdown, post-generator dew point monitors shall be
            used.

       d. Air flow meters shall be provided for measuring air flow from the desiccant dryers to each
          of other ozone generators, air flow to each contactor and purge air flow to the desiccant
          dryers.

          off-gas from the contactor and in the off-gas from the destruct unit. For disinfection
          systems, monitors shall also be provided for monitoring ozone residuals in the water. The
          number and location of ozone residual monitors shall be such that the amount of time that
          the water is in contact with the ozone residual can be determined.

       h. A minimum of one ambient ozone monitor shall be installed in the vicinity of the contactor
          and a minimum of one shall be installed in the vicinity of the generator. Ozone monitors
          shall also be installed in any areas where ozone gas may accumulate.

        d. ozone generator cooling water temperature shutdown/alarm - This system should
           shutdown the generator if either the inlet or outlet cooling water exceeds a certain preset
           temperature;

        e. ozone power supply cooling water temperature shutdown/alarm - This system should
           shutdown the power supply if either the inlet or outlet cooling water exceeds a certain
           preset temperature;

        f.   ozone generator inlet feed-gas temperature shutdown/alarm - This system should
             shutdown the generator if the feed-gas temperature is above a preset value;

        g. ambient ozone concentration shutdown/alarm - The alarm should sound when the ozone
           level in the ambient air exceeds 0.1 ppm or a lower value chosen by the water supplier.

       Chlorine dioxide may be considered as a primary and residual disinfectant, a pre-oxidant to control
       tastes and odors, to oxidize iron and manganese, and to control hydrogen sulfide and phenolic
       compounds. It has been shown to be a strong disinfectant which does not form THMs or HAAs.

       When choosing chlorine dioxide, consideration must be given to formation of the regulated
       byproducts, chlorite and chlorate.

       4.4.8.1 Chlorine dioxide generators

            Chlorine dioxide generation equipment shall be factory assembled pre-engineered units with a

         accurate means of measuring and splitting the flow must be provided.

     4.5.1.2 Aeration

         Determinations should be made for the carbon dioxide content of the raw water. When
         concentrations exceed 10 mg/L, the economics of removal by aeration as opposed to removal
         with lime should be considered if it has been determined that dissolved oxygen in the finished
         water will not cause corrosion problems in the distribution system. (see Section 4.7).

     4.5.1.3 Chemical feed point

         Lime should be fed directly into the rapid mix basin.

     4.5.1.4 Rapid mix

         Rapid mix detention times should be instantaneous, but not longer than 30 seconds with
         adequate velocity gradients to keep the lime particles dispersed.

         Iron, manganese, or a combination of the two, should not exceed 0.3 mg/L in the water as
         applied to the ion exchange resin. Pre-treatment is required when the content of iron,
         manganese, or a combination of the two, is one milligram per liter or more (see Section 4.8).
         Waters having 5 units or more turbidity should not be applied directly to the cation exchange
         softener.

     4.5.2.2 Design

         The units may be of pressure or gravity type, of either an upflow or downflow design.
         Automatic regeneration based on volume of water softened should be used unless manual
         regeneration is justified and is approved by the reviewing authority. A manual override shall
         be provided on all automatic controls.

4.7 AERATION

   Aeration processes generally are used in two types of treatment applications. One is the transfer of a
   gas to water (i.e…adding oxygen to assist in iron and/or manganese removal) and is called gas
   absorption, or aeration. The second is the removal of gas from water (reduce or remove objectionable
   amounts of carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, etc. or reduce the concentration of taste and odor-
   causing substances or removal of volatile organic compounds) and is classified as desorption or air
   stripping. The materials used in the construction of the aerator (s) shall meet ANSI/NSF 61 or be
   approved by the reviewing authority.

     devices for release of air. Pressure aeration devices shall be designed to:

     a. give thorough mixing of compressed air with water being treated;

     b. provide screened and filtered air, free of obnoxious fumes, dust, dirt and other contaminants.

  4.7.5 Packed tower aeration

     Packed tower aeration (PTA) which is also known as air stripping involves passing water down
     through a column of packing material while pumping air counter-currently up through the packing.
     PTA is used for the removal of volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, carbon dioxide, and
     radon. Generally, PTA is feasible for compounds with a Henry's Constant greater than 100 atm
                    0
     mol/mol at 12 C, but not normally feasible for removing compounds with a Henry’s Constant less
     than 10. For values between 10 and 100, PTA may be feasible but should be evaluated using
     pilot studies. Values for Henry's Constant should be discussed with the reviewing agency prior to
     final design.

     4.7.5.1 Process design

         a. Process design methods for PTA involve the determination of Henry's Constant for the
            contaminant, the mass transfer coefficient, air pressure drop and stripping factor. The
            applicant shall provide justification for the design parameters selected (i.e. height and
            diameter of unit, air to water ratio, packing depth, surface loading rate, etc.). Pilot plant
            testing may be required.

                                                                          2             2
              Water loading rates should be in the range from 15 gpm/ft to 30 gpm/ft , however the
              pilot test shall evaluate a variety of loading rates and air to water ratios at the peak
              contaminant concentration. Special consideration should be given to removal efficiencies
              when multiple contaminations occur. Where there is considerable past performance data
              on the contaminant to be treated and there is a concentration level similar to previous
              projects, the reviewing authority may approve the process design based on use of
              appropriate calculations without pilot testing. Proposals of this type must be discussed
              with the reviewing authority prior to submission of any permit applications.

         b. The tower shall be designed to reduce contaminants to below the maximum contaminant
            level (MCL) and to the lowest practical level.

         c.   The ratio of the packing height to column diameter should be at least 7:1 for the pilot unit
              and at least 10:1 for the full scale tower. The type and size of the packing used in the full
              scale unit shall be the same as that used in the pilot work.

         d.   The minimum volumetric air to water ratio at peak water flow should be 25:1 and the
              maximum should be 80:1. Air to water ratios outside these ranges should not be used
              without prior approval from the reviewing authority.

        e.   The design should consider potential fouling problems from calcium carbonate and iron
             precipitation and from bacterial growth. It may be necessary to provide pretreatment.
             Disinfection capability shall be provided prior to and after PTA.

        f.   The effects of temperature should be considered since a drop in water temperature can
             result in a drop in contaminant removal efficiency.

    4.7.5.2 Materials of construction

        a. The tower can be constructed of stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, fiberglass or plastic.
           Uncoated carbon steel is not recommended because of corrosion. Towers constructed of

        b. A mist eliminator shall be provided above the water distributor system.

        c.   A side wiper redistribution ring shall be provided at least every 10 feet in order to prevent
             water channeling along the tower wall and short circuiting.

             water/chemicals used to clean the tower.

        g. The design shall prevent freezing of the influent riser and effluent piping when the unit is
           not operating. If piping is buried, it shall be maintained under positive pressure.

        h. The water flow to each tower shall be metered.

        i.   An overflow line shall be provided which discharges 12 to 14 inches above a splash pad or

      4.8.1.3 Filtration

           Filters shall be provided and shall conform to Section 4.3.

  4.8.2 Removal by the lime-soda softening process

      See Section 4.5.1.

  4.8.3 Removal by manganese coated media filtration

      This process consists of a continuous or batch feed of potassium permanganate to the influent of
      a manganese coated media filter.

      a. Provisions should be made to apply the permanganate as far ahead of the filter as practical
         and to a point immediately before the filter.

      b. Other oxidizing agents or processes such as chlorination or aeration may be used prior to the

           4. should be provided at points between the anthracite media and the manganese coated
              media.

  4.8.4 Removal by ion exchange

      This process of iron and manganese removal should not be used for water containing more than
      0.3 milligrams per liter of iron, manganese or combination thereof. This process is not acceptable
      where either the raw water or wash water contains dissolved oxygen or other oxidants.

  4.8.5 Biological removal

      Biofiltration to remove manganese and/or iron requires on-site piloting to establish effectiveness.
      The final filter design shall be based on the on-site pilot plant studies and shall comply with all
      applicable portions of section 4.3.7. Continuous disinfection shall be provided for the finished
      water.

  4.8.6 Sequestration by polyphosphates

      This process is not recommended when iron, manganese or combination thereof exceeds 0.5
      mg/L and shall not be used when it exceeds 1.0 mg/L. The total phosphate applied shall not
      exceed 10 mg/L as PO4. Where phosphate treatment is used, satisfactory chlorine residuals shall
      be maintained in the distribution system. Possible adverse affects on corrosion must be
      addressed when phosphate addition is proposed for iron sequestering. Polyphosphate treatment
      may be less effective for sequestering manganese than for iron.

      a. Feeding equipment shall conform to the requirements of Part 5.

      b. Stock phosphate solution must be kept covered and disinfected by carrying approximately 10
         mg/L free chlorine residual unless the phosphate is not able to support bacterial growth and
         the phosphate is being fed from the covered shipping container. Phosphate solutions having a
         pH of 2.0 or less may also be exempted from this requirement by the reviewing authority.

      c.   Polyphosphates shall not be applied ahead of iron and manganese removal treatment. The
           point of application shall be prior to any aeration, oxidation or disinfection if no iron or
           manganese removal treatment is provided.

      d. The phosphate feed point shall be located as far ahead of the oxidant feed point as possible.

  4.8.7 Sequestration by sodium silicates

      Sodium silicate sequestration of iron and manganese is appropriate only for groundwater supplies
      prior to air contact. On-site pilot tests are required to determine the suitability of sodium silicate for
      the particular water and the minimum feed needed. Rapid oxidation of the metal ions such as by

                                                    -80-
TREATMENT                                                                                          PART 4

       chlorine or chlorine dioxide must accompany or closely precede the sodium silicate addition.
       Injection of sodium silicate more than 15 seconds after oxidation may cause detectable loss of
       chemical efficiency. Dilution of feed solutions much below five per cent silica as SiO 2 should also
       be avoided for the same reason. Sodium silicate treatment may be less effective for sequestering
       manganese than for iron.

       a. Sodium silicate addition is applicable to waters containing up to 2 mg/L of iron, manganese or
          combination thereof.

       b. Chlorine residuals shall be maintained throughout the distribution system to prevent biological
          breakdown of the sequestered iron.

       c.   The amount of silicate added shall be limited to 20 mg/L as SiO2, but the amount of added and
            naturally occurring silicate shall not exceed 60 mg/L as SiO2.

       d. Feeding equipment shall conform to the requirements of Part 5.

       e. Sodium silicate shall not be applied ahead of iron or manganese removal treatment.

   4.8.8 Sampling taps

       Smooth-nosed sampling taps shall be provided for control purposes. Taps shall be located on
       each raw water source, each treatment unit influent and each treatment unit effluent.

   4.8.9 Testing equipment shall be provided for all plants.

       a. Testing equipment shall have the capacity to accurately measure the iron content to a
          minimum of 0.1 mg/L and the manganese content to a minimum of 0.05 mg/L (also see
          Section 2.8.1.e).

       b. Where polyphosphate sequestration is practiced, appropriate phosphate testing equipment
          shall be provided that meets the requirements of Section 2.8.1.h.

4.9 STABILIZATION

   Water that is unstable due either to natural causes or to subsequent treatment shall be stabilized. For
   instance, in drinking water treatment processes, chemicals such as coagulants are added to raw water
   to coagulate dissolved or colloidal matters for removal in the subsequent treatment steps. Addition of
   certain chemicals or coagulants would change the water characteristics, such as lowering pH,
   alkalinity, etc., that may create aggressiveness of the water in the distribution system. Therefore,
   treated water should be routinely evaluated to ensure that water quality parameters and characteristics
   are optimized to obtain the desired water stability throughout the distribution system of a water supply.

   The primary approaches to internal corrosion control in drinking water systems are to modify the
   water chemistry to make it less corrosive and to encourage formation of passivating films on the
   contacting surface. This is typically accomplished through pH and/or alkalinity adjustment or through
   the addition of a corrosion inhibitor. Most corrosion control treatment techniques will also be beneficial
   for reducing corrosion of lead, copper, iron, steel and galvanized pipe.

   Increases in pH, alkalinity and carbonate buffer content are the most consistent methods for reducing
   the rate of corrosion. Increasing the carbonate buffer level is particularly recommended for systems
   treating soft water.

   Where adjustments to water quality parameters such as chlorine residual, pH, alkalinity and carbonate
                                                    -81-
TREATMENT                                                                                          PART 4

  buffer strength prove insufficient to control corrosion rates, the use of corrosion inhibitors should be
  considered. Orthophosphate is particularly effective for this purpose in most of the situations.

  It should be noted that addition of phosphate containing substances in drinking water will add to the
  phosphorus load entering sewage treatment facilities and may encourage biofilm growth in distribution
  systems.

  4.9.1 Carbon dioxide addition

      a. Recarbonation basin design should provide:

           1. a total detention time of twenty minutes;

           2. two compartments, with a depth that will provide a diffuser submergence of not less than
              7.5 feet nor greater submergence than recommended by the manufacturer as follows:

               a. a mixing compartment having a detention time of at least three minutes, and;

               b. a reaction compartment.

      b. The practice of on-site generation of carbon dioxide is discouraged.

      c.   Where liquid carbon dioxide is used, adequate precautions must be taken to prevent carbon
           dioxide from entering the plant from the recarbonation process. In addition, consideration
           should be given to the installation of a carbon dioxide alarm system with light and audio
           warning, especially in low areas.

      d. Recarbonation tanks shall be located outside or be sealed and vented to the outside with
         adequate seals and adequate purge flow of air to ensure workers safety.

      e. Provisions shall be made for draining the recarbonation basin and removing sludge.

  4.9.2 Acid addition

      a. Feed equipment shall conform to Part 5.

      b. Adequate precautions shall be taken for operator safety, such as not adding water to the
         concentrated acid. (See Sections 5.3 and 5.4).

  4.9.3 Phosphates

      The feeding of phosphates may be applicable for sequestering calcium, for corrosion control, and
      in conjunction with alkali feed following ion exchange softening.

      a. Feed equipment shall conform to Part 5.

      b. Stock phosphate solution must be kept covered and disinfected by carrying approximately 10
         mg/L free chlorine residual unless the phosphate is not able to support bacterial growth and
         the phosphate is being fed from the covered shipping container. Phosphate solutions having a
         pH of 2.0 or less may also be exempted from this requirement by the reviewing authority.

      c.   Satisfactory chlorine residuals shall be maintained in the distribution system when phosphates
           are used.

  4.9.4 "Split treatment"

      Under some conditions, a lime-softening water treatment plant can be designed using "split
      treatment" in which raw water is blended with lime-softened water to partially stabilize the water
      prior to secondary clarification and filtration. Treatment plants designed to utilize "split treatment"
      should also contain facilities for further stabilization by other methods.

  4.9.5 Alkali feed

      Water with low alkalinity or pH should be treated with an alkali chemical.

  4.9.6 Carbon dioxide reduction by aeration

      The carbon dioxide content of aggressive water may be reduced by aeration. Aeration devices
      shall conform to Section 4.7.

   4.9.7 Other treatment

      Other treatment for controlling corrosive waters by the use of calcium hydroxide, sodium silicate
      and sodium bicarbonate may be used where necessary. Any proprietary compound must receive
      the specific approval of the reviewing authority before use. Chemical feeders shall be as required
      in Part 5.

  4.9.8 Water unstable due to biochemical action in distribution system

      Unstable water resulting from the bacterial decomposition of organic matter in water (especially in
      dead end mains), the biochemical action within tubercles, and the reduction of sulfates to sulfides
      should be prevented by the maintenance of a free and/or combined chlorine residual throughout
      the distribution system.

  4.9.9 Control

      Laboratory equipment shall be provided for determining the effectiveness of stabilization
      treatment.

4.10 TASTE AND ODOR CONTROL

  Provisions shall be made for the control of taste and odor at all surface water treatment plants where
  needed. Chemicals shall be added to assure adequate contact time for effective and economical use
  of the chemicals. Where severe taste and odor problems are encountered, in-plant and/or pilot plant
  studies should be considered.

  4.10.1 Flexibility

      Plants treating water that is known to have taste and odor problems should be provided with
      equipment that makes several of the control processes available so that the operator will have
      flexibility in operation.

  4.10.2 Chlorination

      Chlorination can be used for the removal of some objectionable odors. Excessive potential
      disinfection byproduct formation shall be investigated by bench-scale testing prior to design.

  4.10.3 Chlorine dioxide

      Chlorine dioxide has been generally recognized as a treatment for tastes caused by industrial
      wastes, such as phenols. However, chlorine dioxide can be used in the treatment of any taste and
      odor that is treatable by an oxidizing compound. Provisions shall be made for proper storing and
      handling of the sodium chlorite, so as to eliminate any danger of explosion (see Section 5.4.3).

  4.10.4 Powdered activated carbon

      a. Powdered activated carbon should be added as early as possible in the treatment process to
         provide maximum contact time. Flexibility to allow the addition of carbon at several points is
         preferred. Activated carbon should not be applied near the point of chlorine or other oxidant
         application.

      b. The carbon can be added as a pre-mixed slurry or by means of a dry-feed machine as long as
         the carbon is properly wetted.

      c.   Continuous agitation or resuspension equipment shall be provided to keep the carbon from
           depositing in the slurry storage tank.

      d. Provision shall be made for adequate dust control.

      e. The required rate of feed of carbon in a water treatment plant depends upon the tastes and/or
         odors involved, but provision should be made for adding from 0.1 milligrams per liter to at least
         40 milligrams per liter.

      f. Powdered activated carbon shall be handled as a potentially combustible material. It should
         be stored in a building or compartment as nearly fireproof as possible. Other chemicals
         should not be stored in the same compartment. A separate room should be provided for
         carbon feed installations. Carbon feeder rooms should be equipped with explosion-proof
         electrical outlets, lights and motors.

  4.10.5 Granular activated carbon

      Replacement of anthracite with GAC may be considered as a control measure for geosmin and
      methyl isoborneol (MIB) taste and odors from algae blooms. Demonstration studies may be
      required by the reviewing authority.

      See Section 4.3.1.6 for application within filters.

  4.10.6 Copper sulfate and other copper compounds

      Continuous or periodic treatment of water with copper compounds to kill algae or other growths
      shall be controlled to prevent copper in excess of 1.0 milligrams per liter as copper in the plant
      effluent or distribution system. Care shall be taken to assure an even distribution of the chemical
      within the treatment area. Necessary approval and/or permits shall be obtained prior to
      application, if required. Consult the responsible regulatory agencies (e.g., Fish and Wildlife or
      Water agencies or the Department of Natural Resources) before making applications to public
      waters.

  4.10.8 Potassium permanganate

     Application of potassium permanganate may be considered, providing the treatment shall be
     designed so that the products of the reaction are not visible in the finished water. (See Section
     5.4.6)

  4.10.9 Ozone

     Ozonation can be used as a means of taste and odor control. Adequate contact time must be
     provided to complete the chemical reactions involved. Ozone is generally more desirable for
     treating water with high threshold odors. (See Section 4.4.7)

  4.10.10 Other methods

     The decision to use any other methods of taste and odor control should be made only after careful
     laboratory and/or pilot plant tests and on consultation with the reviewing authority.

FINISHED WATER STORAGE                                                                            PART 7

7.0 GENERAL

   The materials and designs used for finished water storage structures shall provide stability and
   durability as well as protect the quality of the stored water. Steel structures shall follow the current
   AWWA standards concerning steel tanks, standpipes, reservoirs, and elevated tanks wherever they
   are applicable. Other materials of construction are acceptable when properly designed to meet the
   requirements of Part 7.

   7.0.1 Sizing

       Storage facilities should have sufficient capacity, as determined from engineering studies, to meet
       domestic demands, and where fire protection is provided, fire flow demands.

       a. The minimum storage capacity (or equivalent capacity) for systems not providing fire
          protection shall be equal to the average daily consumption. This requirement may be reduced
          when the source and treatment facilities have sufficient capacity with standby power to
          supplement peak demands of the system.

       b. Excessive storage capacity should be avoided to prevent potential water quality deterioration
          problems.

       c   Fire flow requirements established by the appropriate state Insurance Services Office should
           be satisfied where fire protection is provided.

   7.0.2 Location of reservoirs

       a. The lowest elevation of the floor and sump floor of ground level reservoirs shall be placed
          above the 100 year flood elevation or the highest flood of record, whichever is higher, and at
          least two feet above the groundwater table. Sewers, drains, standing water, and similar
          sources of possible contamination must be kept at least 50 feet from the reservoir. Gravity
          sewers constructed of water main quality pipe, pressure tested in place without leakage, may
          be used at distances greater than 20 feet but less than 50 feet.

       b. The bottom of ground level reservoirs and standpipes should be placed at the normal ground
          surface. If the bottom of a storage reservoir must be below the normal ground surface, at
          least 50 percent of the water depth must be above grade. The top of a partially buried storage
          structure shall not be less than two feet above normal ground surface. Clearwells constructed
          under filters may be exempted from this requirement when the design provides adequate
          protection from contamination.

   7.0.3 Protection from contamination

       All finished water storage structures shall have suitable watertight roofs which exclude birds,
       animals, insects, and excessive dust. The installation of appurtenances, such as antenna, shall be
       done in a manner that ensures no damage to the tank, coatings or water quality, or corrects any
       damage that occurred.

   7.0.4 Protection from trespassers

       Fencing, locks on access manholes, and other necessary precautions shall be provided to prevent
       trespassing, vandalism, and sabotage. Consideration should be given to the installation of high
       strength, cut resistant locks or lock covers to prevent direct cutting of a lock.



                                                   -107-
FINISHED WATER STORAGE                                                                           PART 7

  7.0.5 Drains

      No drain on a water storage structure may have a direct connection to a sewer or storm drain.
      The design shall allow draining the storage facility for cleaning or maintenance without causing
      loss of pressure in the distribution system.

  7.0.6 Stored Water Age

      Finished water storage designed to facilitate fire flow requirements and meet average daily
      consumption should be designed to facilitate turnover of water in the finished water storage to
      minimize stagnation and/or stored water age. Consideration should be given to separate inlet and
      outlet pipes mixing, or other acceptable means to avoid stagnation and freezing. Poor water
      circulation and long detention times can lead to loss of disinfectant residual, microbial growth,
      formation of disinfectant byproducts, taste and odor problems, and other water quality problems.

  7.0.7 Overflow

      All water storage structures shall be provided with an overflow which is brought down to an
      elevation between 12 and 24 inches above the ground surface, and discharges over a drainage
      inlet structure or a splash plate. No overflow may be connected directly to a sewer or a storm
      drain. All overflow pipes shall be located so that any discharge is visible.

      a. When an internal overflow pipe is used on elevated tanks, it should be located in the access
         tube. For vertical drops on other types of storage facilities, the overflow pipe should be
         located on the outside of the structure.

      b. The overflow for a ground-level storage reservoir shall open downward and be screened with
         twenty-four mesh non-corrodible screen. The screen shall be installed within the overflow pipe
         at a location least susceptible to damage by vandalism.

      c.   The overflow for an elevated tank shall open downward and be screened with a four mesh,
           non-corrodible screen or mechanical device, such as a flap valve or duckbill valve , to keep
           animals or insects . The screen shall be installed within the overflow pipe at a location least
           susceptible to damage by vandalism.

      d. The overflow pipe shall be of sufficient diameter to permit waste of water in excess of the filling
         rate.

      e. When a flapper or duckbill valve is used, a screen shall be provided inside the valve.
         In cold climates, use of a flapper or duckbill should be considered to minimize air movement
         and hence ice formation in the tank. In cold climates, provisions must be included to prevent
         the flapper or duckbill from freezing shut.

  7.0.8 Access

      Finished water storage structures shall be designed with reasonably convenient access to the
      interior for cleaning and maintenance. At least two (2) manholes shall be provided above the
      waterline at each water compartment where space permits.

      7.0.8.1 Elevated Storage or Dome Roof Structures

           a. At least one of the access manholes shall be framed at least four inches above the
              surface of the roof at the opening. They shall be fitted with a solid water tight cover which

                                                  -108-

                overlaps the framed opening and extends down around the frame at least two inches,
                shall be hinged on one side, and shall have a locking device.

          b. All other manholes or access ways shall be bolted and gasketed according to the
             requirements of the reviewing authority, or shall meet the requirements of (a).

     7.0.8.2 Ground Level or Flat Roof Structures

          a. Each manhole shall be elevated at least 24 inches above the top of the tank or covering
             sod, whichever is higher.

          b. Each manhole shall be fitted with a solid water tight cover which overlaps a framed
             opening and extends down around the frame at least two inches. The frame shall be at
             least four inches high. Each cover shall be hinged on one side, and shall have a locking
             device.

  7.0.9 Vents

     Finished water storage structures shall be vented. The overflow pipe shall not be considered a
     vent. Open construction between the sidewall and roof is not permissible. Vents:

     a. shall prevent the entrance of surface water and rainwater;

     b. shall exclude birds and animals;

     c.   should exclude insects and dust, as much as this function can be made compatible with
          effective venting;

     d. shall, on ground-level structures, open downward with the opening at least 24 inches above
        the roof or sod and covered with twenty-four mesh non-corrodible screen. The screen shall be
        installed within the pipe at a location least susceptible to vandalism;

     e. shall, on elevated tanks and standpipes, open downward, and be fitted with either four mesh
        non-corrodible screen, or with finer mesh non-corrodible screen in combination with an
        automatically resetting pressure-vacuum relief mechanism, as required by the reviewing
        authority.

  7.0.10 Roof and sidewall

          The roof and sidewalls of all water storage structures must be watertight with no openings
          except properly constructed vents, manholes, overflows, risers, drains, pump mountings,
          control ports, or piping for inflow and outflow. Particular attention shall be given to the sealing
          of roof structures which are not integral to the tank body.

          a. Any pipes running through the roof or sidewall of a metal storage structure must be
             welded, or properly gasketed. In concrete tanks, these pipes shall be connected to
             standard wall castings which were poured in place during the forming of the concrete.
             These wall castings should have seepage rings imbedded in the concrete.

          b. Openings in the roof of a storage structure designed to accommodate control apparatus or
             pump columns, shall be curbed and sleeved with proper additional shielding to prevent
             contamination from surface or floor drainage.

          c.   Valves and controls should be located outside the storage structure so that the valve
               stems and similar projections will not pass through the roof or top of the reservoir.

          d. The roof of the storage structure shall be well drained. Downspout pipes shall not enter or
             pass through the reservoir. Parapets, or similar construction which would tend to hold
             water and snow on the roof, will not be approved unless adequate waterproofing and
             drainage are provided.

          e. The roof of concrete reservoirs with earthen cover shall be sloped to facilitate drainage.
             Consideration should be given to installation of an impermeable membrane roof covering.

          f.   Reservoirs with pre-cast concrete roof structures must be made watertight with the use of
               a waterproof membrane or similar product.

  7.0.11 Construction Materials

          The material used in construction of reservoirs shall be acceptable to the reviewing authority.
          Porous material, including wood and concrete block, are not suitable for potable water contact
          applications.

  7.0.12 Safety

          Safety must be considered in the design of the storage structure. The design shall conform to
          pertinent laws and regulations of the area where the water storage structure is constructed.

          a. Ladders, ladder guards, balcony railings, and safely located entrance hatches shall be
             provided where applicable.

          b. Elevated tanks with riser pipes over eight inches in diameter shall have protective bars
             over the riser openings inside the tank.

          c.   Railings or handholds shall be provided on elevated tanks where persons must transfer
               from the access tube to the water compartment.

          d. Confined space entry requirements shall be considered.

  7.0.13 Freezing

          Finished water storage structures and their appurtenances, especially the riser pipes,
          overflows, and vents, shall be designed to prevent freezing which will interfere with proper
          functioning. Equipment used for freeze protection that will come into contact with the potable
          water shall meet ANSI/NSF Standard 61 or be approved by the reviewing authority. If a water
          circulation system is used, it is recommended that the circulation pipe be located separately
          from the riser pipe.

  7.0.14 Internal catwalk

          Every catwalk over finished water in a storage structure shall have a solid floor with sealed
          raised edges, designed to prevent contamination from shoe scrapings and dirt.

  7.0.15 Silt stop

          The discharge pipes from water storage structures shall be located in a manner that will
          prevent the flow of sediment into the distribution system. Removable silt stops should be
          provided.

  7.0.16 Grading

          The area surrounding a ground-level structure shall be graded in a manner that will prevent
          surface water from standing within 50 feet of it.

  7.0.17 Painting and/or cathodic protection

          Proper protection shall be given to metal surfaces by paints or other protective coatings, by
          cathodic protective devices, or by both.

          a. Paint systems shall meet ANSI/NSF standard 61 and be acceptable to the reviewing
             authority. Interior paint must be applied, cured, and used in a manner consistent with the
             ANSI/NSF approval. After curing, the coating shall not transfer any substance to the water
             which will be toxic or cause taste or odor problems. Prior to placing in service, an analysis
             for volatile organic compounds is advisable to establish that the coating is properly cured.
             Consideration should be given to 100 % solids coatings.

          b. Wax coatings for the tank interior shall not be used on new tanks. Recoating with a wax
             system is strongly discouraged. Old wax coating must be completely removed before
             using another tank coating.

          c.   Cathodic protection should be designed and installed by competent technical personnel,

  7.0.18 Disinfection

          a. Finished water storage structures shall be disinfected in accordance with AWWA Standard
             C652. Two or more successive sets of samples, taken at 24-hour intervals, shall indicate
             microbiologically satisfactory water before the facility is placed into operation.

          b. Disposal of heavily chlorinated water from the tank disinfection process shall be in
             accordance with the requirements of the state regulatory agency.

          c.   The disinfection procedure specified in AWWA Standard C652 chlorination method 3,
               section 4.3 which allows use of the highly chlorinated water held in the storage tank for
               disinfection purposes, is not recommended. The chlorinated water may contain various
               disinfection by-products which should be kept out of the distribution system.

               If this procedure is used, it is recommended that the initial heavily chlorinated water be
               properly disposed.

  7.0.19 Provisions for sampling

          Smooth-nosed sampling tap(s) shall be provided to facilitate collection of water samples for
          both bacteriological and chemical analyses. The sample tap(s) shall be easily accessible.

       b. The gross volume of the hydropneumatic tank, in gallons, should be at least ten times the
          capacity of the largest pump, rated in gallons per minute. For example, a 250 gpm pump
          should have a 2,500 gallon pressure tank, unless other measures (e.g., variable speed drives
          in conjunction with the pump motors) are provided to meet the maximum demand.

       c.   Sizing of hydropneumatic storage tanks must consider the need for disinfectant contact time.

   7.2.3 Piping

       The hydropneumatic tank(s) shall have bypass piping to permit operation of the system while the
       tank is being repaired or painted.

   7.2.4 Appurtenances

       Each tank shall have an access manhole, a drain, and control equipment consisting of a pressure
       gauge, water sight glass, automatic or manual air blow-off, means for adding air, and pressure
       operated start-stop controls for the pumps. A pressure relief valve shall be installed and be
       capable of handling the full pumpage rate of flow at the pressure vessel design limit. Where
       practical the access manhole should be 24 inches in diameter.

7.3 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM STORAGE

   The applicable design standards of Section 7.0 shall be followed for distribution system storage.

   7.3.1 Pressures

       The maximum variation between high and low levels in storage structures providing pressure to a
       distribution system should not exceed 30 feet. The minimum working pressure in the distribution
       system should be 35 psi (240 kPa) and the normal working pressure should be approximately 60
       to 80 psi (410 - 550 kPa). When static pressures exceed 100 psi (690 kPa), pressure reducing
       devices shall be provided on mains or as part of the meter setting on individual service lines in the
       distribution system.

   7.3.2 Drainage

       Finished water storage structures which provide pressure directly to the distribution system shall
       be designed so they can be isolated from the distribution system and drained for cleaning or
       maintenance without causing a loss of pressure in the distribution system. The storage structure
       drain shall discharge to the ground surface with no direct connection to a sewer or storm drain.

   7.3.3 Level controls

       Adequate controls shall be provided to maintain levels in distribution system storage structures.
       Level indicating devices should be provided at a central location.

8.2 SYSTEM DESIGN

   8.2.1 Pressure

       All water mains, including those not designed to provide fire protection, shall be sized after a
       hydraulic analysis based on flow demands and pressure requirements. The system shall be
       designed to maintain a minimum pressure of 20 psi (140 kPa) at ground level at all points in the
       distribution system under all conditions of flow. The normal working pressure in the distribution
       system shall be at least 35 psi (240 kPa) and should be approximately 60 to 80 psi (410 - 550 kPa)
       and not less than 35 psi (240 kPa).

   8.2.2 Diameter

       The minimum size of water main which provides for fire protection and serving fire hydrants shall
       be six-inch diameter. Larger size mains will be required if necessary to allow the withdrawal of the
       required fire flow while maintaining the minimum residual pressure specified in Section 8.2.1.

       The minimum size of water main in the distribution system where fire protection is not to be
       provided should be a minimum of three (3) inch diameter. Any departure from minimum
       requirements shall be justified by hydraulic analysis and future water use, and can be considered
       only in special circumstances.

   8.2.3 Fire protection

       When fire protection is to be provided, system design should be such that fire flows and facilities
       are in accordance with the requirements of the State Insurance Services Office.

   8.2.4 Dead ends

       a. Dead ends shall be minimized by making appropriate tie-ins whenever practical, in order to
          provide increased reliability of service and reduce head loss.

       b   Dead end mains shall be equipped with a means to provide adequate flushing. Flushing
           devices should be sized to provide flows which will give a velocity of at least 2.5 feet per
           second in the water main being flushed. They may be provided with a fire hydrant if flow and
           pressure are sufficient. No flushing device shall be directly connected to any sewer.

8.3 VALVES

   A sufficient number of valves shall be provided on water mains to minimize inconvenience and sanitary
   hazards during repairs. Valves should be located at not more than 500 foot intervals in commercial
   districts and at not more than one block or 800 foot intervals in other districts. Where systems serve
   widely scattered customers and where future development is not expected, the valve spacing should
   not exceed one mile.

8.4 HYDRANTS

   8.4.1 Location and spacing

       a. Fire hydrants should be provided at each street intersection and at intermediate points
          between intersections as recommended by the State Insurance Services Office. Generally,
          fire hydrant spacing ranges from 350 to 600 feet depending on the area being served.

       b. Water mains not designed to carry fire-flows shall not have fire hydrants connected to them. It
          is recommended that flushing hydrants be provided on these systems. Flushing devices
          should be sized to provide flows which will give a velocity of at least 2.5 feet per second in the
          water main being flushed. No flushing device shall be directly connected to any sewer.

   8.4.2 Valves and nozzles

       Fire hydrants should have a bottom valve size of at least five inches, one 4-1/2 inch pumper
       nozzle and two 2-1/2 inch nozzles.

   8.4.3 Hydrant leads

       The hydrant lead shall be a minimum of six inches in diameter. Auxiliary valves shall be installed
       on all hydrant leads.

   8.4.4 Hydrant drainage

       a. Hydrant drains should be plugged. When the drains are plugged the barrels must be pumped
          dry after use during freezing weather.

       b. Where hydrant drains are not plugged, a gravel pocket or dry well shall be provided unless the
          natural soils will provide adequate drainage.

       c.   Hydrant drains shall not be connected to or located within 10 feet of sanitary sewers, storm
            sewers, or storm drains.

       d. Hydrant drains, where allowed, must be above the seasonal groundwater table.

8.5 AIR RELIEF VALVES

   8.5.1 Air relief valves

       At high points in water mains where air can accumulate provisions shall be made to remove the air
       by means of air relief valves. Automatic air relief valves shall not be used in situations where
       flooding of the manhole or chamber may occur.

   8.5.2 Air relief valve piping

       a. Use of manual air relief valves is recommended wherever possible.

       b. The open end of an air relief pipe from a manually operated valve should be extended to the
          top of the pit and provided with a screened, downward-facing elbow if drainage is provided for
          the manhole.

       c.   The open end of an air relief pipe from automatic valves shall be extended to at least one foot
            above grade and provided with a screened, downward-facing elbow.

       d. Discharge piping from air relief valves shall not connect directly to any storm drain, storm
          sewer, or sanitary sewer.

8.6 VALVE, METER AND BLOW-OFF CHAMBERS

       Wherever possible, chambers, pits or manholes containing valves, blow-offs, meters, or other such
       appurtenances to a distribution system, shall not be located in areas subject to flooding or in areas
       of high groundwater. Such chambers or pits should drain to the ground surface, or to absorption
       pits underground. The chambers, pits and manholes shall not connect directly to any storm drain
       or sanitary sewer. Blow-offs shall not connect directly to any storm drain or sanitary sewer.

8.7 INSTALLATION OF WATER MAINS

   8.7.1 Standards

       Specifications shall incorporate the provisions of the AWWA standards and/or manufacturer's
       recommended installation procedures.

   8.7.2 Bedding

       A continuous and uniform bedding shall be provided in the trench for all buried pipe. Backfill
       material shall be tamped in layers around the pipe and to a sufficient height above the pipe to
       adequately support and protect the pipe. Stones found in the trench shall be removed for a depth
       of at least six inches below the bottom of the pipe.

   8.7.3 Cover

       Water mains shall be covered with sufficient earth or other insulation to prevent freezing.

   8.7.4 Blocking

       All tees, bends, plugs and hydrants shall be provided with reaction blocking, tie rods or joints
       designed to prevent movement.

   8.7.5 Anchoring of fusible pipe

       Additional restraint may be necessary on fusible pipe at the connection to appurtenances or
       transitions to different pipe materials to prevent separation of joints. The restraint may be provided
       in the form of an anchor ring encased in concrete or other methods as approved by the reviewing
       authority.

   8.7.6 Pressure and leakage testing

       Installed pipe shall be pressure tested and leakage tested in accordance with the appropriate
       AWWA Standards.

   8.7.7 Disinfection

       New, cleaned and repaired water mains shall be disinfected in accordance with AWWA
       Standard C651. The specifications shall include detailed procedures for the adequate flushing,
       disinfection, and microbiological testing of all water mains. In an emergency or unusual situation,
       the disinfection procedure shall be discussed with the reviewing authority.




                                                   -118-
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PIPING AND APPURTENANCES                                                      PART 8

  8.7.8 External corrosion

      If soils are found to be aggressive, take necessary action to protect the water main, such as by
      encasement of the water main in polyethylene, provision of cathodic protection (in very severe
      instances), or using corrosion resistant water main materials.

  8.7.9 Separation from other utilities

      Water mains should be installed to ensure adequate separation from other utilities such as
      electrical, telecommunications, and natural gas lines for the ease of rehabilitation, maintenance,
      and repair of water main.

8.8 SEPARATION DISTANCES FROM CONTAMINATION SOURCES

  8.8.1 General

      The following factors should be considered in providing adequate separation:

      a. materials and type of joints for water and sewer pipes,

      b. soil conditions,

      c.   service and branch connections into the water main and sewer line,

      d. compensating variations in the horizontal and vertical separations,

      e. space for repair and alterations of water and sewer pipes,

      f.   off-setting of pipes around manholes.

  8.8.2 Parallel installation

      a. Water mains shall be laid at least 10 feet horizontally from any existing or proposed gravity
         sanitary or storm sewer, septic tank, or subsoil treatment system. The distance shall be
         measured edge to edge.

      b.   In cases where it is not practical to maintain a 10 foot separation, the reviewing authority may
           allow deviation on a case-by-case basis, if supported by data from the design engineer.

  8.8.3 Crossings

      a. Water mains crossing sewers shall be laid to provide a minimum vertical distance of 18 inches
         between the outside of the water main and the outside of the sewer. This shall be the case
         where the water main is either above or below the sewer with preference to the water main
         located above the sewer.

      b. At crossings, one full length of water pipe shall be located so both joints will be as far from the
         sewer as possible. Special structural support for the water and sewer pipes may be required.




                                                   -119-
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM PIPING AND APPURTENANCES                                                     PART 8

  8.8.4 Exception

     When it is impossible to obtain the minimum specified separation distances, the reviewing
     authority must specifically approve any variance from the requirements of Sections 8.8.2 and
     8.8.3. Where sewers are being installed and Section 8.8.2 and 8.8.3 cannot be met, the following
     methods of installation may be used:

     a. Such deviation may allow installation of the water main closer to a sewer, provided that the
        water main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located on one side of
        the sewer at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least 18 inches above
        the top of the gravity sewer.

     b. the sewer materials shall be water works grade 150 psi (1.0 Mpa) pressure rated pipe meeting
        AWWA standards or pipe approved by the reviewing authority and shall be pressure tested to
        ensure water tightness.

  8.8.5 Force mains

     There shall be at least a 10 foot horizontal separation between water mains and sanitary sewer
     force mains. There shall be an 18 inch vertical separation at crossings as required in
     Section 8.8.3.

  8.8.6 Sewer manholes

     No water pipe shall pass through or come in contact with any part of a sewer manhole. Water
     main should be located at least 10 feet from sewer manholes.

  8.8.7 Separation of water mains from other sources of contamination

     Design engineers should exercise caution when locating water mains at or near certain sites such
     as sewage treatment plants or industrial complexes. On site waste disposal facility including
     absorption field must be located and avoided. The engineer must contact the reviewing authority
     to establish specific design requirements for locating water mains near any source of
     contamination.

8.9 SURFACE WATER CROSSINGS

  Surface water crossings, whether over or under water, present special problems. The reviewing
  authority should be consulted before final plans are prepared.

  8.9.1 Above-water crossings

     The pipe shall be adequately supported and anchored, protected from vandalism, damage and
     freezing, and accessible for repair or replacement.

  8.9.2 Underwater crossings

     A minimum cover of five feet shall be provided over the pipe unless otherwise approved by the
     reviewing authority. When crossing water courses which are greater than 15 feet in width, the
     following shall be provided:

     a. the pipe shall be of special construction, having flexible, restrained or welded watertight joints,

                                                 -120-

       b. valves shall be provided at both ends of water crossings so that the section can be isolated for
          testing or repair; the valves shall be easily accessible, and not subject to flooding,
       c. permanent taps or other provisions to allow insertion of a small meter to determine leakage
          and obtain water samples on each side of the valve closest to the supply source.

8.10 CROSS-CONNECTIONS AND INTERCONNECTIONS

   8.10.1 Cross-connections

       There shall be no connection between the distribution system and any pipes, pumps, hydrants, or
       tanks whereby unsafe water or other contaminating materials may be discharged or drawn into the
       system. Each water utility shall have a program conforming to state requirements to detect and
       eliminate cross connections.

   8.10.2 Cooling water

       Neither steam condensate, cooling water from engine jackets, nor water used in conjunction with
       heat exchange devices shall be returned to the potable water supply.

   8.10.3 Interconnections

       The approval of the reviewing authority shall be obtained for interconnections between potable
       water supplies. Consideration should be given to differences in water quality.

8.11 WATER SERVICES AND PLUMBING

   8.11.1 Plumbing

       Water services and plumbing shall conform to the applicable local and/or state plumbing codes.
       Solders and flux containing more than 0.2% lead and pipe and pipe fittings containing more than
       8% lead shall not be used.

   8.11.2 Booster pumps

       Individual booster pumps shall not be allowed for any individual residential service from the public
       water supply mains. Where permitted for other types of services, booster pumps shall be
       designed in accordance with Section 6.4.

8.12 SERVICE METERS

   Each service connection should be individually metered.

8.13 WATER LOADING STATIONS

   Water loading stations present special problems since the fill line may be used for filling both potable
   water vessels and other tanks or contaminated vessels. To prevent contamination of both the public
   supply and potable water vessels being filled, the following principles shall be met in the design of
   water loading stations:

   a. there shall be no backflow to the public water supply,


                                                   -121-

  b. the piping arrangement shall prevent contaminant being transferred from a hauling vessel to
     others subsequently using the station,
  c. hoses shall not be contaminated by contact with the ground.

9.0 GENERAL

   All waste discharges shall be in accordance with all federal, state and/or local laws and ordinances.
   The requirements outlined herein must, therefore, be considered minimum requirements as federal,
   state, and/or local water pollution control authorities may have more stringent requirements.

   Provisions must be made for proper disposal of water treatment plant wastes such as sanitary and
   laboratory wastes, clarification sludge, softening sludge, iron sludge, filter backwash water, backwash
   sludge, and brines (including softener and ion exchange regeneration wastes and membrane wastes).
   Some regulatory agencies consider discharge from overflow pipes/outlets as discharge wastes. In
   locating sewer lines and waste disposal facilities, consideration shall be given to preventing potential
   contamination of the water supply.

   Alternative methods of water treatment and chemical use should be considered as a means of
   reducing waste volumes and the associated handling and disposal problems.

   Appropriate backflow prevention measures must be provided on waste discharge piping as needed to
   protect the public water supply.

9.1 SANITARY WASTE

   The sanitary waste from water treatment plants, pumping stations, and other waterworks installations
   must receive treatment. Waste from these facilities shall be discharged directly to a sanitary sewer
   system, when available and feasible, or to an adequate on-site waste treatment facility approved by
   the appropriate reviewing authority. The appropriate federal, state, and local officials should be
   notified when designing treatment facilities to ensure that the local sanitary sewer system can accept
   the anticipated wastes.

9.2 BRINE WASTES

   Waste from ion exchange, demineralization, and membrane plants, or other plants which produce a
   brine, may be disposed of by controlled discharge to a stream if adequate dilution is available. Surface
   water quality requirements of the regulatory agency will control the rate of discharge. Except when
   discharging to large waterways, a surge tank of sufficient size should be provided to allow the brine to
   be discharged over a twenty-four hour period. Where discharging to a sanitary sewer, a holding tank
   may be required to prevent the overloading of the sewer and/or interference with the waste treatment
   processes. The effect of brine discharge to sewage lagoons may depend on the rate of evaporation
   from the lagoons.

9.3 PRECIPITATIVE SOFTENING SLUDGE

   Sludge from plants using precipitative softening varies in quantity and in chemical characteristics
   depending on the softening process and the chemical characteristics of the water being softened.
   Recent studies show that the quantity of sludge produced is much larger than indicated by
   stoichiometric calculations. Methods of treatment and disposal are as follows:

   a. Lagoons

       1. Short term storage lagoons should be designed on the basis of 0.7 acres per million gallons
          per day per 100 mg/L of hardness removed based on a usable lagoon depth of five feet. This
          should provide about 2 ½ years storage. At least two but preferably more lagoons must be


                                                  -124-
WASTE RESIDUALS                                                                         PART 9
          provided in order to give flexibility in operation. An acceptable means of final sludge disposal
          must be provided. Provisions must be made for convenient cleaning.

      2. Long term lagoons should have a volume of at least four times that for short term storage
         lagoons.

      3. The design of both short term and long term lagoons should provide for:

          a. location free from flooding;

          b. when necessary, dikes, deflecting gutters or other means of diverting surface water so that
             it does not flow into the lagoons;

          c.   a minimum usable depth of five feet;

          d. adequate freeboard of at least two feet;

          e. adjustable decanting device;

          f.   effluent sampling point;

          g. adequate safety provisions,

          h. parallel operation, and;

          i.   subsurface infiltration may be acceptable if approved by the reviewing authority.

  b. The application of liquid lime or dewatered sludge to farm land should be considered as a method
     of ultimate disposal. Prior to land application, a chemical analysis of the sludge including calcium
     and heavy metals shall be conducted. Approval from the appropriate reviewing authority shall be
     obtained. When this method is selected, the following provisions shall be made:

      1. Transport of sludge by vehicle or pipeline shall incorporate a plan or design which prevents
         spillage or leakage during transport.

      2. Interim storage areas at the application site shall be kept to a minimum and facilities shall be
         provided to prevent washoff of sludge or flooding.

      3. Sludge shall not be applied at times when washoff of sludge from the land could be expected.

      4. Sludge shall not be applied to sloping land where washoff could be expected unless provisions
         are made, for suitable land, to immediately incorporate the sludge into the soil.

      5. Trace metals loading shall be limited to prevent significant increases in trace metals in the
         food chain, phytotoxicity or water pollution.

      6. Each area of land to receive lime sludge shall be considered individually and a determination
         made as to the amount of sludge needed to raise soil pH to the optimum for the crop to be
         grown.

   c.   Discharge of lime sludge to sanitary sewers should be avoided since it may cause both liquid
        volume and sludge volume problems at the sewage treatment plant. This method should be used
        only when the sewerage system has the capability to adequately handle the lime sludge.

   d. Mixing of lime sludge with activated sludge waste may be considered as a means of co-disposal.

   e. Disposal at a landfill can be done as either a solid or liquid if the landfill can accept such waste,
      depending on individual state requirements.

   f.   Mechanical dewatering of sludge may be considered. Pilot studies on a particular plant waste are
        required. Mechanical dewatering shall be preceded by sludge concentration and chemical pre-
        treatment.

   g. Calcination of sludge may be considered. Pilot studies on a particular plant waste are required.

   h. Lime sludge drying beds are not recommended.

9.4 ALUM SLUDGE

   Lagooning may be used as a method of handling alum sludge. Lagoon size can be calculated using
   total chemicals used plus a factor for turbidity. Mechanical concentration may be considered. A pilot
   plant study is required before the design of a mechanical dewatering installation. Freezing changes
   the nature of alum sludge so that it can be used for fill. Acid treatment of sludge for alum recovery
   may be a possible alternative. Alum sludge can be discharged to a sanitary sewer. However, initiation
   of this practice will depend on obtaining approval from the owner of the sewerage system as well as
   from the regulatory agency before final designs are made.

   9.4.1 Lagoons

        Lagoons should be designed to produce an effluent satisfactory to the regulatory agency and
        should provide for:

        a. location free from flooding;

        b. where necessary, dikes, deflecting gutters or other means of diverting surface water so that it
           does not flow into the lagoon;

        c.   a minimum usable depth of five feet;

        d. adequate freeboard of at least two feet;

        e. adjustable decanting device;

        f.   effluent sampling point;

        g. adequate safety provisions, and;

        h. a minimum of two cells, each with appropriate inlet/outlet structures to facilitate independent
           filling/dewatering operations.

   9.4.2 Mechanical dewatering

       a. The successful use of mechanical dewatering depends on the characteristics of the alum
          sludge produced, as determined by site specific studies.

       b. Mechanical dewatering shall be preceded by sludge concentration and chemical pre-
          treatment.

   9.4.3 Land application

       Alum sludge may be disposed of by land application either alone, or in combination with other
       wastes where an agronomic value has been determined, and disposal has been approved by the
       reviewing authority.

9.5 “RED WATER” WASTE

   Waste filter wash water from iron and manganese removal plants can be disposed of as follows:

   9.5.1 Sand filters

       Sand filters should have the following features:

       a. Total filter area shall be sufficient to adequately dewater applied solids. Unless the filter is
          small enough to be cleaned and returned to service in one day, two or more cells are required.

       b. The "red water" filter shall have sufficient capacity to contain, above the level of the sand, the
          entire volume of wash water produced by washing all of the production filters in the plant,
          unless the production filters are washed on a rotating schedule and the flow through the
          production filters is regulated by true rate of flow controllers. Then sufficient volume shall be
          provided to properly dispose of the wash water involved.

       c.   Sufficient filter surface area should be provided so that, during any one filtration cycle, no
            more than two feet of backwash water will accumulate over the sand surface.

       d. The filter shall not be subject to flooding by surface runoff or flood waters. Finished grade
          elevation shall be established to facilitate maintenance, cleaning and removal of surface sand
          as required. Flash boards or other non-watertight devices shall not be used in the
          construction of filter side walls.

       e. The filter media should consist of a minimum of twelve inches of sand, three to four inches of
          supporting small gravel or torpedo sand, and nine inches of gravel in graded layers. All sand
          and gravel should be washed to remove fines.

       f.   Filter sand should have an effective size of 0.3 to 0.5 mm and a uniformity coefficient not to
            exceed 3.5. The use of larger sized sands shall be justified by the designing engineer to the
            satisfaction of the reviewing authority.

       g. The filter should be provided with an adequate under-drainage collection system to permit
          satisfactory discharge of filtrate.

       h. Provision shall be made for the sampling of the filter effluent.

      i.   Overflow devices from "red water" filters shall not be permitted.

      j.   Where freezing is a problem, provisions should be made for freeze protection for the filters
           during the winter months.

      k.   "Red water" filters shall comply with the common wall provisions contained in Sections 7.1.3
           and 8.10.1, which pertain to the possibility of contaminating treated water with unsafe water.

      The reviewing authority must be contacted for approval of any arrangement where a separate
      structure is not provided.

  9.5.2 Lagoons

      Lagoons shall have the following features:

      a. be designed with a volume 10 times the total quantity of wash water discharged during any
         24-hour period;

      b. a minimum usable depth of three feet;

      c.   length four times width, and the width at least three times the depth, as measured at the
           operating water level;

      d. outlet to be at the end opposite the inlet;

      e. a weir overflow device at the outlet end with weir length equal to or greater than depth;

      f.   velocity to be dissipated at the inlet end;

      g. subsurface infiltration lagoons may be acceptable if approved by the reviewing authority.

  9.5.3 Discharge to community sanitary sewer

      Red water can be discharged to a community sewer. However, approval of this method will
      depend on obtaining approval from the owner of the sewerage system as well as from the
      regulatory agency before final designs are made. A surge tank is recommended to prevent
      overloading the sewers. Design shall prevent cross connections and there shall be no common
      walls between potable and non-potable water compartments.

  9.5.4 Discharge to surface water

      Plant must have an NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit or other
      applicable discharge permit to dispose of backwash water into surface water.

  9.5.5 Recycling "red water" wastes

      Recycling of supernatant or filtrate from "red water" waste treatment facilities to the head end of an
      iron removal plant shall not be allowed except as approved by the reviewing authority.

9.6 WASTE FILTER WASH WATER

   Disposal of backwash water from surface water treatment and lime softening plants should have
   suspended solids reduced to a level acceptable to the regulatory agency before being discharged to a
   backwash reclaim tank and recycled to the head of the plant.

       1. The holding tank must be constructed in the following manner:

           a. shall contain the anticipated volume of waste water produced by the plant when operating
              at design capacity;

           b. a plant that has two filters should have a holding tank that will contain the total waste wash
              water from both filters calculated by using a 15 minute wash at 20 gallons per minute per
              square foot;

           c.   in plants with more than two filters, the size of the holding tank will depend on the
                anticipated hours of operation.

       2. Spent filter backwash water, thickner supernatant and liquids processes may be allowed by
          the regulatory agency to recycled into the head of the plant, provided that:

           a. the recycled water should be returned at a rate of less 10 percent of the instantaneous raw
              water flow rate entering the plant;

           b. the recycled water should not be recycled when the raw water contains excessive algae,
              when finished water taste and odor problems are encountered, or when disinfection
              byproduct levels in the distribution system may exceed allowable levels. Particular
              attention must be given to the presence of protozoans such as Giardia and
              Cryptosporidium concentrating in the waste water stream;

           c.   water utilities may need to treat filter waste water prior to recycling to reduce pathogen
                population and improve coagulation or avoid reclaiming filter wash water given the
                increased risk to treated water quality.

9.7 RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS

   Radioactive materials include, but are not limited to, granulated activated carbon (GAC) used for radon
   removal, radium adsorptive filter media; ion-exchange regeneration waste from radium removal; and
   manganese greensand backwash solids from manganese removal systems, precipitative softening
   sludges, and reverse osmosis concentrates where radiological constituents are present. The buildup
   of radioactive decay products of radon shall be considered and adequate shielding, ventilation, and
   other safeguards shall be provided for operators and visitors. These materials may require disposal as
   radioactive waste in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations. Approval shall be
   obtained from the local administrative regulatory authority prior to disposal of all wastes.

9.8 ARSENIC WASTE RESIDUALS

   Arsenic-bearing wastes, including but not limited to, filter backwash water and sludge, and adsorptive
   filter media from arsenic treatment facilities may be considered hazardous. Under the Resource
   Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) residual wastes from an arsenic water treatment facility may
   be defined as being hazardous waste if it exhibits a Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure
