Chapter 854: Standards for Hazardous Waste Facilities

SUMMARY: This rule specifies the standards applicable to the
establishment, construction, alteration and operation of waste facilities for
hazardous waste in Maine.

1. Legal Authority. This rule is promulgated under 38 M.R.S.A. Section
1301, et seq., which prohibits the establishment, construction, alteration or
operation of a waste facility for hazardous waste without a license and
authorizes the Board of Environmental Protection to adopt rules
establishing standards for the licensing of these facilities.

2. Preamble. It is the purpose of the Department of Environmental
Protection, consistent with legislative policy, to provide necessary controls
over hazardous waste facilities so as to ensure the protection of public
health, safety, welfare and the environment.

The Board of Environmental Protection will administer this rule in a
conservative fashion because it recognizes that many unknowns remain
about the short-term and long-term impacts of hazardous waste to public
health and natural ecosystems. The intent of this rule is to protect the public
health, safety, and general welfare and the environment; the burden of proof
shall rest with each applicant seeking a license for a waste facility for
hazardous waste to affirmatively demonstrate that the intent of this rule will
be met at all times.

3. Definitions. For purposes of this rule, terms not defined in this section
shall have the meaning given them in 38 M.R.S.A., Sections 361-A and 1303-
C. The following terms as used in this rule shall have the following meaning
unless the context indicates otherwise.

A. Aboveground tank. "Aboveground tank" means a device meeting the
definition of "tank" which is situated in such a way that the entire surface
area of the tank is completely above the plane of the adjacent surrounding

accelerated schedule or may require immediate full payment, with
adjustment for estimated inflation.

(vi) When computing the annual inflation adjustment for closure or
post-closure trust funds, the owner or operator must use the Implicit Price
Deflator for Gross National Product as published by the Department of
Commerce in "Survey of Current Business."

NOTE: Sample Computation:

1980 Implicit Price Deflator 177.36= 1.09*

1979 Implicit Price Deflator 162.77

* Adjustment Factor

Assuming that the initial closure cost estimate, prepared in 1979, was
$25,000, then $25,000 x 1.09= $27,250 (new adjusted closure cost
requirement). The licensee would then be required to adjust the monetary
value of the funding instrument to reflect the new adjusted monetary
amount, or portion thereof.

(i) The owner or operator must submit with his application and must submit
annually thereafter proof of liability insurance for the facility for sudden and
accidental occurrences. Coverage must be provided during active life and
closure and, where wastes will remain on the facility property after closure,
during the post-closure period. The level of coverage must be at least one
million dollars per occurrence and two million dollars annual aggregate,
unless because of a greater risk a higher minimum is required by the Board
for a particular facility.

(j) The owner or operator of a facility that utilizes a landfill, land treatment,
surface impoundment or underground storage in tanks to handle hazardous
waste or of a facility where hazardous waste will or is likely to remain on the
facility property after closure must submit with his application and must
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


submit annually thereafter proof of liability insurance for the facility for
non-sudden and accidental occurrences. Coverage must be provided during
active life and for so long as any waste remains on the facility property but
for no longer than the post-closure period. The level of coverage must be at
least three million dollars per occurrence and six million dollars annual
aggregate, unless because of a greater risk a higher minimum is required by
the Board for a particular facility.

(k) Wording of liability insurance endorsements must be identical to the
wording contained in 40 CFR 264.151(i) except that subparagraph 2(b) shall
read: "The Insurer is liable for the payment of amounts within any
deductible applicable to the policy, with a right of reimbursement by the
insured for any such payment made by the Insurer."

(l) All liability insurance coverage amounts must be exclusive of legal
defense costs.

(m) A financial test may not be utilized in lieu of liability insurance nor may
an owner or operator self-insure. If liability insurance is unavailable, a
$2,000,000 letter of credit drawn on a reputable bank, the terms of which
the Board must approve, may be utilized in lieu of liability insurance for
sudden and accidental occurrences.

(n) If a liability insurance policy is written as a "claims made" policy, an
endorsement must provide for a discovery period of at least twelve (12)
months beyond the date of expiration or cancellation of the policy. The
endorsement must also provide that the underwriter will notify the public
according to the requirements below:

(i) At least sixty (60) days prior to the date upon which the policy will expire
or be canceled, give written notification to all owners of property abutting
the facility and to the chief elected official in the municipality in which the
facility is located and in each of the municipalities immediately abutting the
municipality in which the facility is located, that insurance for the facility
will expire or be canceled, giving date of expiration or cancellation, and that
claims against the insured must be filed within twelve (12) months from the
date of expiration or cancellation, specifying where and how claims can be
filed;

(ii) During the first, third, sixth and ninth month subsequent to the date of
expiration or cancellation, place in each of the State's major newspapers
(Portland Press Herald, Bangor Daily News, Lewiston Sun, Kennebec
Journal, and Waterville Sentinel) and in all local newspapers published or
widely distributed in the municipality where the facility is located an

         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


advertisement designed to attract notice and containing the information
specified in i. above.

(17) Chapter 851, Section 8 A & B, Pre-Transport Requirements.

(18) 40 CFR 264.101, Corrective Action for Solid Waste Management Units,
which is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference.

D. No person shall own or operate a waste facility for hazardous waste
without having obtained a hazardous waste facility identification number
specific to the site.

(1) The identification number shall be comprised of the identification
number assigned to the facility by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and/or any identifying number or letter as may be assigned by the
Department.

NOTE: An owner or operator must apply to EPA for an identification
number in accordance with the EPA notification procedures described in 45
Federal Register 12746.

E. An applicant must demonstrate in his application sufficient financial
capacity, including projections of utilization of the facility by hazardous
waste generators, to construct, operate and maintain all aspects of the
facility in accordance with requirements of statute and rules. A licensee
must maintain sufficient financial capacity for the term of the license,
including any renewal license, and at the time of renewal must demonstrate
sufficient current financial capacity including current projections of
utilization of the facility during the renewal term.

F. For a facility at which hazardous waste will be disposed, the applicant
must demonstrate that the volume of waste and the risks related to its
handling will have been reduced to the maximum practical extent. For an
on-site facility, the applicant shall comply with this requirement first by
toxics use reduction, as described in 38 MRSA section 2302, subsection 1,
then by waste reduction, as defined in 38 MRSA section 2302, subsection 3,
then by treatment and volume reduction prior to disposal.

NOTE: Pursuant to 38 M.R.S.A. 2304, Subsection 3(B)(1)(d), hazardous
waste generated as a result of remedial/corrective actions or facility closures
required by law or undertaken to protect employee health and safety, public
health and safety, or the environment, is exempt from this requirement.

A licensee must operate the facility to meet this requirement during the term
of the license, including renewal thereof, and at time of renewal must
provide a current demonstration that the requirement is met.

G. An application for a mobile treatment facility may consist of two phases:

(1) The first consisting of general operational, structural features, and
generic siting criteria.

(2) The second consisting of site specific operating and siting features.

7. Facility Location in Certain Areas

A. Prohibition. No person shall establish, construct, alter, or operate a
waste facility for hazardous waste, except as noted, where the facility is or
would be located:

(1) On land defined as a wetland under statutes or regulations administered
by the Department, Department of Conservation, Department of Inland
Fisheries & Wildlife, Department of Marine Resources, or the State Planning
Office; or

(2) Within any 100 year flood plain so designated by the Federal Insurance
Agency or within the level of any documented flood of a greater magnitude.
This prohibition shall not apply to a facility where hazardous waste is not
handled in a landfill, land treatment unit, miscellaneous unit, surface
impoundment or waste pile or to any interimly-licensed (under Chapter
855) storage or treatment facility in use on the effective date of this rule; or

(3) So that it overlies any portion of a surface or subsurface sand and gravel
aquifer or a high yield bedrock aquifer. This prohibition shall apply to a
facility where hazardous waste is handled in a surface impoundment,
landfill, underground tank, or waste pile or a facility where hazardous waste
is treated utilizing land treatment techniques; or

NOTE: Maps prepared by the Department of Conservation (Maine
Geological Survey) may provide guidance as to the location of sand and
gravel and bedrock aquifers within the State of Maine.

(4) Within the boundaries of a state or federal park or designated wilderness
area. This prohibition shall not apply to a storage facility (Section 12 of this
rule);

B. Rebuttable Presumption. A waste facility for hazardous waste located
as set forth below is presumed to pose serious threats to public health or
welfare or to the environment such that a license for a facility cannot be
issued. The presumption applies if:

(1) The facility property is located on land defined as a wetland under
statutes or regulations administered by the Department, Department of
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Conservation, Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, Department of
Marine Resources, or the State Planning Office; or

(2) The facility or facility property is located within 300 feet of any 100 year
flood plain so designated by the Federal Insurance Agency or within 300 feet
of the level of any documented flood of a greater magnitude. Evidence that
the facility will be constructed or operated in compliance with the special
requirements for facilities located in a flood plain is not an adequate basis
for rebutting the presumption against such siting. However, the
presumption may not be rebutted unless the applicant demonstrates along
with its other offer of evidence rebutting the presumption that the facility
will meet all applicable standards; or

(3) The facility or facility property overlies any portion of a surface or
subsurface sand and gravel aquifer or its primary recharge zone or a high
yield bedrock aquifer; or

(4) The facility or facility property is located within one mile upgradient of
any underground source of public drinking water, or within the watershed of
a surface water source of public drinking water, or within 1,000 feet of any
source of potable water for humans or livestock; or

(5) The facility or facility property is located such that it may pose a threat to
fisheries or wildlife or other natural resources in an area including a
sanctuary, refuge, or preserve designated as such under statutes or
regulations administered by the Departments of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife
or Marine Resources; a state or federal park, sanctuary, or designated
wilderness area, or a critical area identified as such under statutes or
regulations administered by the State Planning Office, or to fish in a fish
hatchery; or

(6) The facility property is located within the boundaries of a state or federal
park or designated wilderness area.

An applicant seeking a license to establish, construct, alter, or operate a
facility in such a location must overcome this presumption by persuasive
evidence that the facility is unique in some way that allows for compliance
with the intent of this rule.

8. Additional Standards Applicable to Hazardous Waste Landfills

A. Performance Standards

(1) Landfills are regarded by the Board as the least preferable method of
hazardous waste handling. While it is expected that the expense of
landfilling will discourage its use, the Board, prior to approval of any
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


application for a hazardous waste landfill, will consider whether alternative
preferred method(s) exist for handling a waste proposed to be landfilled.

(2) A hazardous waste landfill must be designed, constructed, and installed
to prevent any migration of wastes out of the landfill to adjacent subsurface
soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the life, including
the post-closure period, of the landfill.

(3) A hazardous waste landfill must be established, constructed, altered and
operated to meet the following performance standards:

(a) No landfilled hazardous waste or constituent or derivative thereof shall
appear in ground or surface waters at a concentration above background
level, or above current public health drinking water standards for Maine,
including the Maximum Exposure Guidelines, or standards for aquatic
toxicity, whichever is most stringent. Background levels shall be those
established by the pre-construction analysis required by Chapter 856,
Section 10C(11)(g) or of the upgradient monitoring well required by Section
8D(1) below, whichever is lower.

NOTE: Drinking water and aquatic toxicity standards are obtained from
current manuals including but not limited to: State of Maine Rules of the
Department of Human Services relating to Drinking Water; "Drinking Water
and Health" published by the National Academy of Sciences; "Suggested
No-Adverse Response Levels" as determined by the Environmental
Protection Agency; "Ambient Water Quality Criteria" manuals, published by
the Environmental Protection Agency.

(b) No landfilled hazardous waste or constituent or derivative thereof, shall
appear in the atmosphere in concentrations significantly above the
background level nor exceed current ambient air quality standards for
Maine at any time. Background levels shall be established by monitoring or
demonstrated to have been previously established by monitoring.

B. Design. The provisions of 40 CFR 264.301(a), (c), and (f)-(j) are hereby
adopted and incorporated by reference, provided however, that:

(1) All new, replacement, or expanded portions of a landfill established in
the State of Maine must be at least double-lined. The two liners are referred
to below as

(a) the bottom liner, which lies adjacent to subsoil deposits; and

(b) the top liner, which is in contact with the landfilled waste.

(2) A landfill must have two impervious liners of or equivalent to:
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(a) a synthetic topliner, and a bottom liner of recompacted clay of a
minimum of five (5) feet thick, with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 x10-7
cm/sec. or less, and, in addition, have a minimum of ten (10) feet of similar
deposits beneath the bottom liner.

If a suitably low permeability clay liner cannot be produced by
recompaction, its permeability must be decreased by addition of bentonite
or other approved sealing compounds; or,

(b) a synthetic top and bottom liner and, in addition, have a minimum of ten
(10) feet of similar clay deposits as specified in (a) above, beneath it.

NOTE: Proper siting on low permeability deposits is the single most
important design criterion. Siting in a favorable hydrologic setting is also an
important design criterion, ground water discharge zones being considered
the most favorable.

(3) Where the landfill is located in a ground water discharge zone, the
applicant must evaluate the potential for upward rupture of the liner or
basal layer and design the landfill so as to prevent such a rupture.

(4) Any synthetic liner approved by the Board and installed after December
31, 1993 must be a minimum thickness of 80 mil's, and be able to meet the
following criteria:

(a) Meet National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) Standard #54 specifications, if
one exists for the proposed material; and

(b) Meet required performance specifications for the proposed project
application.

(5) At a minimum, synthetic liners must be used in lieu of clay liners if the
clay cannot be made sufficiently impermeable or if organic solvents are to be
handled in the landfill.

(6) Any synthetic liner proposed for use shall meet all of the following
criteria. A synthetic liner must:

(a) Be of adequate strength and durability to ensure mechanical integrity
during emplacement, freeze-thaw cycles in the underlying soils and
operation of the facility; and

(b) Be of uniform thickness and free from thin spots, cracks, tears, blisters
and foreign particles; and
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(c) Be resistant to attack from soil bacteria, fungus, burrowing animals and
birds; and

(d) Be resistant to ozone cracking, sun weathering and stiffening in frosty
conditions; and

(e) Be able to withstand extreme heat either by itself or in combination with
a protective layer of earthen material; and

(f) Be compatible with and unaffected by hazardous waste(s) which may be
landfilled at the facility and any constituents or derivatives thereof; and

(g) Be impermeably sealed in the field, without defects in the seams between
sections or in the parent material itself; and

(h) Be properly installed on a base which is both smooth and structurally
capable of supporting the entire landfill; and

(i) Be covered by a sufficient layer of well-graded fine soil material (not less
than six inches in depth) so as to prevent damage to the liner due to facility
operation, such as the movement of heavy equipment used at the site.

(j) Be installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with a
waste or leachate; and

(k) Be able to generate sufficient friction force between itself and the
surrounding materials in order to maintain a short term factor of safety of
1.25 and a long term factor of safety of 1.50; and

(l) Be able to meet the manufacturer's minimum specifications for the
material being proposed for use.

Manufacturers' specifications on the standard leak rate of the liner must be
specified in the application.

(7) The applicant must develop a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) in order to
ensure that design specifications and performance requirements for all
hazardous waste facility components are met during construction. The QAP
shall clearly describe the Construction Quality Control (CQC) and
Construction Quality Assurance (CQA) measures to be implemented during
construction. The QAP shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) A description of the responsibility and authority of organizations and
personnel involved in permitting, designing, and constructing the facility;

(b) The qualifications of the CQC/CQA personnel;
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(c) The observations and tests to be used to ensure that the construction or
installation meets or exceeds all design criteria, plans, and specifications for
each hazardous waste facility component;

(d) The sampling activities, sample size, methods for determining sample
locations, frequency of sampling, acceptance and rejection criteria, and
methods for ensuring that corrective measures are implemented;

(e) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements for CQC/CQA activities;

(f) An assessment of construction equipment and manpower skills necessary
to achieve design specifications and performance requirements; and

(g) A list and description of required manufacturers' product certification,
installation certifications, and warranties.

(8) A leachate detection, collection, and removal system must be installed
immediately above the top liner to assure that leachate is collected and
removed. In addition, a leachate detection, collection and removal system
must be installed between the top and bottom liners.

(9) The leachate collection system must be constructed such that:

(a) the system immediately above the top liner must be designed,
constructed, maintained, and operated to collect and remove leachate from
the landfill during the active life and post closure care period. The design of
the collection and removal system shall be such that no more than 30 cm (1
foot) of leachate shall accumulate on the top liner at any one time.

(b) the leachate collection system between the liners must be designed,
constructed, maintained, and operated to detect, collect, and remove liquids
that may leak through the topliner during the active life and post closure
care period.

(c) the leachate collection systems must be constructed of materials that are
chemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the leachate
expected to be generated and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent
collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover
materials, and by any equipment used at the landfill; and designed and
operated to function without clogging during the active life and post-closure
care period.

(10) The applicant must evaluate the potential for generation of gas within
buried wastes. If a potential for build up or explosion of gases exists, a gas
discharge system capable of collecting gases must be designed into the
landfill cover system.
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(11) The applicant must evaluate the compaction and consolidation of
materials placed within the landfill. If compaction could result in ponding of
drainage on the final cover system, an impermeable plastic cap or cover liner
must be used to prevent infiltration. Otherwise, the final cover may be a
layer of re-compacted clay at least 2 feet thick with a hydraulic conductivity
of less than 1 x 10-7 cm/sec.

NOTE: Design of the closure cap/final cover system is integral to the design
of a landfill.

(12) A sand and gravel drain layer must be placed over the final cover
system.

(13) Final cover must be protected from disruption. Disruption due to frost
heaving and penetration by burrowing rodents must be prevented by
grading the site with soil material and at least six inches of topsoil.
Disruption by plant roots must be prevented by the planting of
shallow-rooted vegetation and its maintenance in perpetuity. The final grade
of the landfill surface must be between two and ten percent grade.

(14) The applicant must evaluate the earthquake risk. The applicant must
show that the facility is designed so that any disruption due to earthquake
will not cause any performance standard to be violated.

(15) A buffer zone of at least 200 feet must be designed and maintained
between the boundaries of the facility property and the boundaries of the
landfill and of any other area of the property where hazardous waste will be
handled.

(16) Fugitive emissions, including volatile organic compounds, from the
facility must be controlled in accordance with a plan approved by the Board.

C. Operation. The provisions of 40 CFR 264.303, 264.312, 254.313,
264.316 and 264.317 are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference,
provided however, that:

(1) Run-on must be diverted away from the facility.

(2) Run-off from the facility must be collected, analyzed and managed
according to a design and plan approved by the Board.

(3) Cover material, sufficient to control odors, dispersion by wind and
excessive water infiltration into a hazardous landfill cell, must be placed
daily or after the landfill has received new wastes, whichever is the longer
period.
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(4) Access to active portions of the facility must be restricted to facility
personnel needed for operation or management and to authorized federal,
state and local officials while in performance of their official duties.

(5) No liquid waste shall be placed in a landfill except in accordance with the
following:

(a) Bulk or non-containerized liquid hazardous or nonhazardous waste, or
hazardous or nonhazardous waste containing free liquids, must not be
placed in a landfill unless, before disposal, the liquid waste or waste
containing free liquids is treated or stabilized, chemically or physically, so
that free liquids are no longer present and that the wastes are altered in such
a way so that the materials that have absorbed the liquids will not
biodegrade or release liquids when compressed.

NOTE: The paint filter method specified in Chapter 850, Appendix XI will
generally be used to determine liquid content for the purposes of this
section.

(b) Containers holding free liquids must not be placed in a landfill unless:

(i) all free liquid has been removed by decanting or other methods, or
solidified so that no free liquid is present, or otherwise eliminated in such a
way that the materials that have absorbed the liquids will not biodegrade or
release liquids when compressed; or

(ii) the container is a lab pack as defined in 40 CFR 264.316 and is disposed
of in accordance with 40 CFR 264.316.

(c) To demonstrate the absence or presence of free liquids in either a
containerized or a bulk waste, the test method referenced in 850, Appendix
XI of the Department's rules shall apply.

(6) Incompatible wastes must be separated horizontally by such barriers as
will prevent any mixing of them in accordance with a plan approved by the
Department. Vertical landfilling of incompatible wastes is prohibited.

(7) Containers placed in landfills must be:

(a) at least 90 percent full; or

(b) crushed, shredded, or similarly reduced in volume to the maximum
practical extent before burial.

Department, are required to monitor ground water quality. At least one
monitoring well shall be located hydraulically upgradient from the landfill
and three downgradient. The downgradient wells shall be located as close to
the landfill as possible without disturbing the design or operational systems.

(b) Monitor wells must, at a minimum, be packed and cased through
surficial deposits and screened where appropriate flow zones exist. The top
of the well casing must be sealed to prevent contamination of ground water
by run-off. Materials used in construction must not affect water quality.

(c) Water level measurements must be taken and sampling and analysis
must be performed by the operator according to a schedule specified or
approved by the Department. Additional sampling may be required if the
performance standards are not being met. Water levels and results of

NOTE: If the collected leachate is a hazardous waste under Chapter 850, it
must be managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with all applicable
requirements of these rules.

9. Additional Standards for Hazardous Waste Surface
Impoundments

A. Performance Standards. A hazardous waste surface impoundment
which is existing, new or laterally expanded must be established,
constructed, altered and operated to meet the following performance
standards:

(1) A surface impoundment must be designed, constructed, and installed to
prevent any migration of wastes out of the impoundment to the adjacent
subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the life,
including the post-closure period, of the impoundment.

(2) No impounded hazardous waste or constituent or derivative thereof shall
appear in ground water or surface water at a concentration above
background level, or above current public health drinking water standards
for Maine, including the Maximum Exposure Guidelines, or standards for
aquatic toxicity, whichever is most stringent. Background levels shall be
those established by the preconstruction analysis required by Chapter 856,
Section 10C(11)(g) or of the upgradient monitoring well required by Section
8D(1) of this rule, whichever is lower.

NOTE: Drinking water and aquatic toxicity standards are obtained from
current manuals including but not limited to: State of Maine Rules of the
Department of Human Services relating to Drinking Water; "Drinking Water
and Health" published by the National Academy of Sciences; "Suggested
No-Adverse Response Levels" as determined by the Environmental Agency;
"Ambient Water Quality Criteria" manuals, published by the Environmental
Protection Agency.

(3) No impounded hazardous waste or constituent or derivative thereof shall
appear in the atmosphere in concentrations significantly above the
background level nor exceed current ambient air quality standards for
Maine at any time. Background levels shall be established by monitoring or
demonstrated to have been previously established by monitoring.

(4) An applicant seeking a license to treat hazardous waste in a surface
impoundment must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that:

(a) the waste is capable of being treated in a surface impoundment using the
process proposed, based upon a trial test (a bench or small-scale pilot test)
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


that determines the treatment technique, its effectiveness, and any limiting
factors;

(b) the design measures and operating procedures will maximize the success
of the treatment;

(c) the facility design and components are compatible with the hazardous
waste and the treatment process; and

(d) the treatment process can and will be controlled at all times so as to
prevent uncontrolled releases of hazardous waste or its constituents or
derivatives and to protect the public health and safety and the environment.

B. Design

(1) The provisions of 40 CFR 264-221(c), and (f)-(h) are hereby adopted and
incorporated by reference provided however, that all new, replacement or
expanded portions of a surface impoundment established in the State of
Maine must be at least double-lined. The two liners are referred to below as
a) the bottom liner, which lies adjacent to subsoil deposits, and b) the top
liner, which is in contact with the impounded waste.

(2) A surface impoundment must have an impervious bottom liner of, or
equivalent to, a recompacted clay layer of a minimum of 5 feet thick, with a
hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-7 cm/sec or less and, in addition, have a
minimum of 10 feet of similar deposits beneath it. If a suitably low
permeability clay bottom liner cannot be produced by recompaction, its
permeability must be decreased by addition of bentonite or other approved
sealing compounds.

NOTE: Proper siting on low permeability deposits is the single most
important design criterion for hazardous waste surface impoundments.
Siting in a favorable hydrologic setting is also an important design criterion,
ground water discharge zones being considered most favorable.

(3) Where the surface impoundment is located in a ground water discharge
zone, an applicant must evaluate the possibility of upward rupture of the
liners and design the impoundment so as to prevent such a rupture.

(4) At a minimum, a synthetic liner must be used in lieu of a clay liner if the
clay cannot be made sufficiently impermeable or if organic solvents are to be
handled in the surface impoundment. Any synthetic liner used as part of a
surface impoundment must conform to the requirements of Section 8B(4),
(6) and (7) of this rule.
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(5) A leachate detection, collection and removal system must be installed,
constructed, maintained, and operated immediately above a clay or
synthetic bottom liner to assure that leachate is detected, collected and
removed. The system must be designed so that the leachate can flow out
freely, without a pressure head of leachate developing within the system.

In addition, a leachate detection system must be installed immediately
beneath the clay or synthetic bottom liner.

The leachate collection system must be:

(a) constructed of materials that are chemically resistant to the waste
managed in the surface impoundment and the leachate expected to be
generated and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under
the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any
equipment used at the surface impoundment; and

(b) designed and operated to function without clogging during the active life
and post-closure care period.

(6) The liner system in contact with the impounded waste must be:

(a) compatible with the waste;

(b) sufficiently impermeable to the waste under maximum operating
conditions of hydraulic head so that the leachate system would not be filled
in a period of less than one year;

(c) of sufficient strength to outlast the design lifetime of the impoundment;
and

(d) constructed on a foundation capable of supporting the liner and the
pressure head of the impoundment when full.

(7) Dikes must be designed with sufficient structural integrity to prevent
failure when saturated, without dependence on any liner system for support.

(8) Earthen dikes must have a protective cover such as grass, shale or rock to
minimize wind and water erosion and to preserve their structural integrity.

(9) Run-on must be diverted away from the surface impoundment.

(10) At least two feet of freeboard must be assured at all times.

(11) An automatic shutoff or automatic diversion system must be installed in
the waste feed so that flow of waste into the impoundment will stop when
there is less than 2 feet of freeboard or any failure of the base or liners.
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(12) An automatic alarm system to alert the operator to abnormal operations
and to malfunctions must be installed.

(13) A backup containment system must be provided to contain 20% of the
volume of the impoundment or 4 hours maximum flow from the influent
pipe(s), whichever is the larger amount.

(14) The applicant must evaluate the earthquake risk and must demonstrate
that the facility is designed so that any disruption due to earthquake will not
cause any performance standard to be violated.

(15) The applicant must evaluate the compaction and settlement beneath the
liners and must demonstrate that the liners will not crack or rupture under
full potential load.

(16) A ground water monitoring system which meets the requirements of
Section 8D of this rule must be operational before any waste is placed in the
impoundment.

(17) Fugitive emissions, including volatile organic compounds, from the
surface impoundment, must be controlled in accordance with a plan
approved by the Board.

(18) Requirements other or less stringent than those established by Section
9B(1)-(13) above may be imposed on a surface impoundment which is
interimly licensed and being used for handling hazardous waste on the
effective date of this rule, if the applicant demonstrates to the Board's
satisfaction that the surface impoundment has not in the past violated the
performance standards established herein and that the risk that it will
violate the performance standards is no greater than that risk for a surface
impoundment which meets the above requirements.

C. Operation

(1) A surface impoundment must have at all times sufficient freeboard to
prevent overtopping by overfilling, wave action or a storm. At no time shall
there be less than 2 feet of such freeboard.

(2) Leachate must be removed from the leachate collection system either
continuously or with sufficient regularity that no hydraulic head builds up
within it.

(3) Earthen dikes must be kept free of perennial woody plants and
burrowing animals and maintained so as to prevent any erosion of the dikes.

13. Additional Standards Applicable to Hazardous Waste
Incinerators

A. Principal hazardous constituents (PHCs) and hazardous combustion by-
products must be treated to the extent required by the performance
standards specified in Section 13B below. For each waste feed to be burned,
one or more PHCs and hazardous combustion by-products will be specified
from among those constituents listed in Appendix VIII of Chapter 850. This
specification will be based on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the
hazardous constituents of the waste feed and its combustion by-products,
their concentration or mass, considering the results of waste analyses and
trial burns or alternative data submitted with the facility's license
application. Hazardous constituents or by-products which represent the
greatest degree of difficulty of incineration will be those most likely to be
designated as PHCs or hazardous combustion by-products. Constituents are
more likely to be designated as PHCs or hazardous combustion by-products
if they are present in large quantities or concentrations. Trial PHCs will be
designated for performance of trial burns in accordance with the procedure
specified in 40 CFR 270.62 (or Chapter 856 of those rules) for obtaining trial
burn permits. Trial hazardous combustion by-products will be designated
under the same procedure.

B. Performance Standards. A hazardous waste incinerator must be
established, constructed, altered, operated and maintained to meet the
following performance standards:

(1) No hazardous waste or constituent or derivative thereof shall appear in
the atmosphere in concentrations significantly above the background level
nor exceed ambient air quality standards for Maine at any time. Background
levels shall be established by monitoring or demonstrated to have been
previously established by monitoring.

(2) An incinerator burning hazardous waste must achieve a Destruction
Removal Efficiency (DRE) of 99.99 percent or greater (except as noted in (3)
below) for each Principal Hazardous Constituent (PHC) designated in its
license for each waste stream to be burned. The following equation is used to
determine the DRE for each PHC:

DRE= W in - W out x 100

W in

Where: W in= Mass feed rate of one PHC in the waste stream feeding the
incinerator; and
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


W out= Mass emission rate of the same PHC present in exhaust emissions
prior to release to the atmosphere.

(3) An incinerator burning hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023,
F026, or F027 must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of
99.9999% for each principal hazardous constituent (PHC) designated in its
license. This performance must be demonstrated on PHCs that are more
difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins
and dibenzofurans. In addition, the owner or operator of the incinerator
must notify the Board of his intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020,
F021, F022, F023, F026 or F027.

(4) An incinerator burning hazardous waste containing more than 0.5%
halogens must remove at least 99% of the hydrogen halides from the exhaust
gas. The stack emissions of hydrogen chlorides from any hazardous waste
incinerator shall not exceed 50 parts per million (ppm) by volume, adjusted
to 7% oxygen by volume.

(5) An incinerator burning hazardous waste must not emit particulate
matter exceeding 180 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (0.08 grams
per dry cubic foot) when corrected for 7% oxygen. Tests may be required, if
applicable, using the procedures specified by 40 CFR 60.50, Subpart E
(Clean Air Act Regulations, "Standards for Performance of Incinerators").

(6) No heavy metals shall appear in the atmosphere in concentrations
significantly above the background level nor exceed ambient air quality
standards for Maine at any time. Background levels shall be established by
monitoring or demonstrated to have been previously established by
monitoring.

(7) An incinerator must destroy hazardous combustion by-products
designated in its license such that the total mass emission rate of these by-
products emitted from the stack is 0.01l% or less of the total mass feed rate
of PHCs fed into the incinerator.

(8) All combustion residues, such as fly ash, must be handled in accordance
with all Federal and State statutory and regulatory requirements for their
handling.

C. Operation

(1) An incinerator must be operated in accordance with operating
requirements specified in the license. These will be specified on a case-by-
case basis as those demonstrated (in a trial burn or in alternative data) to be
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


sufficient to maintain compliance with the performance standards of Section
13B above.

(2) Each set of operating requirements will specify the composition of the
waste feed (including acceptable variations in the physical or chemical
properties of the waste feed which will not affect compliance with the
performance standards to which the operating requirements apply.) For
each such waste feed, the license will specify acceptable operating limits
including the following conditions:

(a) Carbon monoxide (CO) level in the stack exhaust gas;

(b) Waste feed rate;

(c) Combustion temperature;

(d) An appropriate indicator of combustion gas velocity;

(e) Air feed rate;

(f) Such other operating requirements as are necessary to ensure that the
performance standards are met.

(3) During start-up and shut-down of an incinerator, hazardous waste must
not be fed into the incinerator unless the incinerator is operating within the
conditions of operation (temperature, air feed rate, etc.) specified in the
license.

(4) Fugitive emissions from the combustion zone must be controlled by:

(a) Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or

(b) Maintaining a combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric
pressure; or

(c) An alternate means of control demonstrated (as part of the permit
application) to provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance
of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.

(5) An incinerator must be operated with a functioning system designed to
automatically cut off waste feed to the incinerator when operating
conditions deviate from limits established under this section.

(6) An incinerator must cease operation when changes in waste feed,
incinerator design or operating conditions exceed limits designated in its
license.
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(7) All hazardous waste incinerators in which halogenated wastes are burned
must maintain, at a minimum, a combustion temperature of 1,000º C for a 2
second dwell time with 3% excess oxygen in the stack gas or 1,200º C for a
l.5 second dwell time with 2% excess oxygen in stack gas or an equivalent
standard. More stringent operating requirements may be required by the
Board, depending upon the waste involved, if it is determined by the Board
to be necessary to protect the public health and safety or the environment.

(8) Hazardous waste incinerators which burn only non-halogenated wastes
must maintain a combustion temperature of not less than 885º C. Specific
combustion temperatures will be established in the license and will depend
on the type of non-halogenated waste, its physical condition and the rate at
which it is added to the normal fuel feedstock.

D. Monitoring, Inspections, and Recordkeeping

(1) The owner or operator must conduct waste analyses sufficient to verify
that all waste feed to the incinerator is within the limits specified in his
license.

(2) The owner or operator must monitor stack emissions to verify that the
operating requirements established in the license achieve the performance
standards.

(3) The owner or operator must monitor on a continuous basis:

(a) Combustion temperature, waste feed rate, combustion gas velocity and
air feed rate;

(b) CO, at a point in the incinerator downstream of the combustion zone and
prior to release to the atmosphere;

(c) Such other parameters, such as CO, CO2, O2, total hydrocarbons, and
opacity, that the Board determines to be necessary to be monitored at the
stack or at other locations in order to demonstrate compliance with the
standards and requirements of this rule at all times.

(4) The incinerator and associated equipment (pumps, valves, conveyors,
pipes, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection, at least daily,
for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions and signs of tampering.

(5) The emergency waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be
inspected daily and tested at least weekly to verify operability.

(6) The owner or operator of an incinerator must maintain and keep current
for as long as the facility is operated a record of the types and quantities of
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


hazardous waste incinerated, dates of incineration, repairs, accidents or
uncontrolled releases and any abatement measures taken.

(7) The monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and all records
must be placed in the operating log required by Section 6C(9) of this rule.
The Department may require that a current copy of those records be kept on
file with the Department. Upon closure, the operating log must be delivered
to the Department.

E. Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all hazardous
waste and residues (including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and
scrubbers sludges) from the incinerator site.

to prevent ponding for periods that will cause the area to be anaerobic;

(c) The distance from any natural soils barrier to the seasonal high water
table at the site must be at least 5 feet;
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(d) Food chain crops must not be grown within 300 feet of the unit unless
the owner or operator demonstrates to the Board that hazardous waste:

(i) Will not be transferred to the food portion of the crop by plant uptake or
direct contact and will not otherwise be ingested by food chain animals, or

(ii) Will not occur in greater concentrations in the crops grown within 300
feet of the unit than in the same crops grown on untreated soils under
similar conditions elsewhere in the same region;

(e) All hazardous waste must be analyzed immediately prior to burning or
detonation to ensure that:

(i) The waste contains no components or contaminants which might
interfere with or have an adverse impact on the burning or detonation
process,

(ii) The waste contains no components or contaminants which, when burned
or detonated, may cause an uncontrolled release of waste or toxic gases or
fumes, and

(iii) The waste contains no components or contaminants which, when
burned or detonated, would form substances or residues that the facility
could not handle properly in accordance with State and Federal
requirements;

(f) Ground water monitoring of the unit shall be conducted in accordance
with Section 8(D) of this Chapter;

(g) Soil monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with a program
developed or approved by the Department, and if the presence of hazardous
waste or constituents is detected at the edge of the unit in excess of
background levels, corrective action shall be conducted in accordance with a
program developed or approved by the Department;

(h) Detailed records of burning or detonation activities in the unit, and
corrective action activities conducted at the site, shall be maintained as
specified or approved by the Department; and

(i) At closure, the owner or operator shall remove or decontaminate all
waste residues, contaminated containment system components,
contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with
waste and leachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless Section
3(A)(3)(d) of Chapter 850 applies or, if after removing or decontaminating
all residues and making all reasonable efforts to effect removal or
decontamination of contaminated components, subsoils, structures and
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 854 Standards for Hazardous Waste
         Facilities (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


equipment, the owner or operator finds that not all contaminated subsoils
can be practicably removed or decontaminated, he must close the facility in
accordance with the closure and post-closure requirements that apply to
landfills.

16. Additional Standards Applicable to Waste Facilities Located in
a Flood Plain. Any facility located or to be located within 300 feet of a 100
year flood plain may be constructed, operated or maintained only if the
applicant:

A. Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Board by persuasive evidence that
the rebuttable presumption against constructing, operating, or maintaining
a facility in such an area has been overcome; and

B. Constructs, operates, and maintains such facility:

(1) To prevent wash-out of any hazardous waste by a 100 year flood; or

(2) Has procedures that will be in effect which will cause the waste to be
removed to a location where the waste will not be vulnerable to flood waters
and to a location which is authorized to manage hazardous waste safely
before flood water can reach the facility; and

(3) Complies with all other applicable facility standards in this Chapter.

17. Additional Standards Applicable to Commercial Facilities. For
commercial facilities, the exposure information requirements of Chapter
856, Section 10(C)(13) shall apply.

18. Variance Requests. Consistent with Federal requirements for
authorization to operate the State hazardous waste management program,
the Board may, on its own motion or on request, modify or waive one or
more of the requirements of Sections 8B, 9B, 11B, 12B, and 14B of this rule
relating to design of a specified type of facility except that no performance
standard may be made less stringent. Such modification or variance must be
justified on the basis that greater protection to health, safety, welfare or the
environment than that provided by the performance standards is required
and will thereby be provided or on the basis that no less protection than that
provided by the performance standards will thereby be provided in that the
design is an alternate but equivalent one.

19. Severability. Should any provision of this rule be declared invalid or
ineffective by court decision, the decision shall not invalidate any other
provision of this rule.
