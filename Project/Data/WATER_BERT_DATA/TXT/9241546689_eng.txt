Structure of this book




This book is a tool for developing strategies to protect groundwater for health by
managing the quality of drinking-water sources. For this purpose it provides different
points of entry. As illustrated in the Figure below, the book consists of five sections.




                     Structure of Protecting Groundwater for Health
xii                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Section I covers the scientific background needed to understand which pathogens and
chemicals are relevant to human health, how they are transported in the underground and
how they may be reduced, removed or retarded (Chapters 3 and 4). The criteria for
inclusion of agents in this overview are their relevance to human health and their
relevance in groundwater. Further the concept of groundwater recharge areas is
introduced in Chapter 2, and basic hydrological and hydrogeological background
information is provided. The section is concluded by Chapter 5 which introduces socio-
economic and institutional considerations relevant to developing the protection of
groundwater resources.
    Section II provides background information for characterizing and understanding the
drinking-water catchment. The chapters in this section explain how conditions and
human activities in the catchment may lead to the occurrence of pathogens or hazardous
substances in groundwater. The section begins with general guidance on collecting
information (Chapter 6). Chapter 7 discusses assessing the socio-economic and
institutional setting as a necessary basis for choosing and implementing feasible
management actions. Chapter 8 outlines the background and information required for
understanding the hydrogeological conditions determining the likelihood of pollutants to
reach aquifers. Chapters 9-13 address the range of human activities potentially releasing
pollutants to the underground, i.e. agriculture, sanitation practices, industry, mining,
military sites, waste disposal and traffic. These chapters end with checklists highlighting
the type of information needed about the setting and the human activities in it for
assessing health hazards potentially affecting groundwater.
    Section III provides conceptual guidance on prioritizing both hazards and
management responses. Chapter 14 describes how information on the hydrogeological
conditions, particularly on aquifer vulnerability, can be related to human activities in the
drinking-water catchment area in order to assess the potential for pollutants emitted from
these activities to reach the aquifer. Chapter 15 discusses how to prioritize pollutants
according to their public health burden as well as to their likelihood of long-term
accumulation in the aquifer. It also addresses the need to consider the socio-economic
context in choosing feasible options from the range of technically appropriate
management responses for protection, control or remediation.
    Section IV provides an overview of the potential management actions that may be
taken to protect drinking-water sources. These begin with their integration into a
comprehensive Water Safety Plan that covers all supply steps from catchment to
consumer (Chapter 16). Two chapters specifically cover protection of the drinking-water
source: Chapter 17 at the scale of designating and managing groundwater protection
zones in the catchment and Chapter 18 at the scale of protecting wellheads. Lastly,
Chapter 19 addresses the management of groundwater abstraction in order to avoid
impacts upon quality and quantity and thus on human health.
    Section V provides an overview of control measures to prevent pollution from
human activities in the catchment, beginning with the overarching issues of
policy, land-use planning and implementation of management options for
protecting groundwater (Chapter 20). Chapters 21-25 follow with overviews of the
specific management approaches that help avoid groundwater pollution from the
range of human activities in the catchment, i.e. agriculture, sanitation practices,
industry, mining, military sites, waste disposal and traffic.

Water-related disease remains one of the major health concerns in the world. Diarrhoeal
diseases, which are largely derived from poor water and sanitation, accounted for 1.8
million deaths in 2002 and contributed around 62 million Disability Adjusted Life Years
per annum (WHO, 2004a). On a global scale, this places diarrhoeal disease as the sixth
highest cause of mortality and third in the list of morbidity and it is estimated that 3.7 per
cent of the global disease burden is derived from poor water, sanitation and hygiene
(Prüss-Üstün et al., 2004). This health burden is primarily borne by the populations in
developing countries and by children.
   At 2002 estimates, roughly one-sixth of humanity (1.1 billion people) lack access to
any form of improved water supply within 1 kilometre of their home, and approximately
40 per cent of humanity (2.6 billion people) lack access to some form of improved
excreta disposal (WHO and UNICEF, 2004). These figures relate to the clear definitions
provided in the updated Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment Report and are
shown in Table 1.1 below.
   If the quality of water or sanitation were taken into account, these numbers of people
without access to water supplies and sanitation would increase even further.
   Endemic and epidemic disease derived from poor water supply affects all nations.
Outbreaks of waterborne disease continue to occur in both developed and developing

improvements in excreta disposal and personal hygiene can be expected to deliver
substantial health gains in the population.

    This monograph provides information on strategies for the protection of groundwater
sources used for drinking-water as a component of an integrated approach to drinking-
water safety management (WHO, 2004b). The importance of source protection as the
first stage of managing water quality has been an important component in both national
and international efforts. In their Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, WHO (2004b
and previous editions) emphasize the need for effective source protection.
    The focus of this monograph is the public health aspects of groundwater protection. It
does not address environmental concerns, such as ecological protection. The control of
some pollutants, whilst of little importance for health, may be very important to
environmental protection. For guidance on these areas, readers should consult
appropriate texts such as Chapman (1996).


1.1         GROUNDWATER AS A SOURCE OF DRINKING-
            WATER
Groundwater is the water contained beneath the surface in rocks and soil, and is the water
that accumulates underground in aquifers. Groundwater constitutes 97 per cent of global
freshwater and is an important source of drinking-water in many regions of the world. In
many parts of the world groundwater sources are the single most important supply for
the production of drinking-water, particularly in areas with limited or polluted surface
water sources. For many communities it may be the only economically viable option.
This is in part because groundwater is typically of more stable quality and better
microbial quality than surface waters. Groundwaters often require little or no treatment to
be suitable for drinking whereas surface waters generally need to be treated, often
extensively. There are many examples of groundwater being distributed without
                              Groundwater and public health                                   5

treatment. It is vital therefore that the quality of groundwater is protected if public health
is not to be compromised.
    National statistics for the use of groundwater as a source of drinking-water are sparse,
but the importance of this resource is highlighted by figures published in Europe and the
USA. The proportion of groundwater in drinking-water supplies in some European
countries is illustrated in Table 1.2 and for the USA in Table 1.3. The data show that
reliance upon groundwater varies considerably between countries; for example, Norway
takes only 13 per cent of its drinking-water from groundwater sources, whereas Austria
and Denmark use groundwater resources almost exclusively for drinking-water supply.
A global estimate of one-third of the world’s population depending on groundwater
supply is given by Falkenmark (2005).
Table 1.2. Proportion of groundwater in drinking-water supplies in selected European countries
(EEA, 1999; UNECE, 1999)

   The data from the USA demonstrates the importance of groundwater particularly for
smaller supplies, reflecting the generally limited treatment requirements. However, this
has implications for control of public health risks as the management and maintenance of
smaller supplies is often weaker than for larger, utility operated supplies (Bartram, 1999).

   Within countries the usage of groundwater may also vary substantially, depending on
the terrain and access to alternative water sources. For instance, in the USA it ranges
from 25 per cent or less in Colorado and Kentucky to more than 95 per cent in Hawaii
6                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

and Idaho. In rural areas of the USA, 96 per cent of domestic water comes from
groundwater. In the United Kingdom, although the national average for groundwater
usage is 28 per cent, the southern counties of England depend more heavily on
groundwater than the northern counties, Wales and Scotland.
    In Latin America, many of the continent’s largest cities – Mexico City, Mexico,
Lima, Peru, Buenos Aires, Argentina and Santiago de Chile, Chile – obtain a significant
proportion of their municipal water supply from groundwater. In India, China,
Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia and Viet Nam more than 50 per cent of potable supplies
are provided from groundwater. In Africa and Asia, most of the largest cities use surface
water, but many millions of people in rural areas and low-income peri-urban
communities are dependent on groundwater. These populations are most vulnerable to
waterborne disease. Pedley and Howard (1997) estimate that as much as 80 per cent of
the drinking-water used by these communities is abstracted from groundwater sources.
    Where it is available, groundwater frequently has important advantages over surface
water. It may be conveniently available close to where it is required, can be developed at
comparatively low cost and in stages to keep pace with rising demand. Although small,
simple surface water supplies can be achieved relatively cheaply and pumping
groundwater from deep aquifers may create significant operating costs, overall the capital
costs associated with groundwater development are usually lower than with large-scale
surface water supplies. For the latter, large, short-term capital investments in storage
reservoirs often produce large, step-wise increments in water availability and temporary
excess capacity that is gradually overtaken by the continuing rising demand for water.
An additional disadvantage in some circumstances is that surface water reservoirs may
have multiple, sometimes conflicting functions – water supply, flood control, irrigation,
hydroelectric power and recreation – and cannot always be operated for the optimum
benefit of water supply.
    Furthermore, aquifers are often well protected by layers of soil and sediment, which
effectively filter rainwater as it percolates though them, thus removing particles,
pathogenic microorganisms and many chemical constituents. Therefore it is generally
assumed to be a relatively safe drinking-water source.
    However, groundwater has been termed the ‘hidden sea’ – sea because of the large
amount of it, and hidden because it is not visible, thus pollution pathways and processes
are not readily perceived (Chapelle, 1997). This highlights a key issue in the use of
aquifers as drinking-water source, showing that particular attention is needed to ascertain
whether the general assumption of groundwater being safe to drink is valid in individual
settings. As discussed below, understanding the source-pathway-receptor relationship in
any particular setting is critical to determine whether pollution will occur.
    Whilst there is a large volume of groundwater in this ‘hidden sea’, its replenishment
occurs slowly – at rates varying between locations. Over-exploitation therefore readily
occurs, bringing with it additional quality concerns.
                             Groundwater and public health                                  7

1.2        THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIOECONOMIC
           CONTEXT OF GROUNDWATER PROTECTION
The use of groundwater as a source of drinking-water is often preferred because of its
generally good microbial quality in its natural state. Nevertheless, it is readily
contaminated and outbreaks of disease from contaminated groundwater sources are
reported from countries at all levels of economic development. Some groundwaters
naturally contain constituents of health concern: fluoride and arsenic in particular.
However, understanding the impact of groundwater on public health is often difficult and
the interpretation of health data complex. This is made more difficult as many water
supplies that use groundwater are small and outbreaks or background levels of disease
are unlikely to be detected, especially in countries with limited health surveillance.
Furthermore, in outbreaks of infectious disease, it is often not possible to identify the
cause of the outbreak and many risk factors are typically involved.
    Throughout the world, there is evidence of contaminated groundwater leading to
outbreaks of disease and contributing to background endemic disease in situations where
groundwater sources used for drinking have become contaminated. However, diarrhoeal
disease transmission is also commonly due to poor excreta disposal practices and the
improvement of sanitation is a key intervention to reduce disease transmission (Esrey et
al., 1991; Curtis et al., 2000). Furthermore, water that is of good quality at its source may
be re-contaminated during withdrawal, transport and household storage. This may then
require subsequent treatment and safe storage of water in the home (Sobsey, 2002).
    Ensuring that water sources are microbially safe is important to reduce health
burdens. However, a balance in investment must be maintained to ensure that other
interventions, also important in reducing disease, are implemented. Diverting resources
away from excreta disposal, improved hygiene practices in order to achieve very good
quality water in sources may be counter-productive (Esrey, 1996). Balancing investment
decisions for public health gain from water supply and sanitation investment is complex
and does not simply reflect current knowledge (or lack of) regarding health benefits, but
also the demands and priorities of the population (Briscoe, 1996).
    Groundwater is generally of good microbial quality, but may become rapidly
contaminated if protective measures at the point of abstraction are not implemented and
well maintained. Further problems are caused by the creation of pathways that short-
circuit the protective measures and natural layers offering greatest attenuation, for
instance abandoned wells and leaking sewers. Pollution may also occur in areas of
recharge, with persistent and mobile pollutants representing the principal risks.
    The control of the microbial quality of drinking-water should be the first priority in all
countries, given the immediate and potentially devastating consequences of waterborne
infectious disease (WHO, 2004b). However, in some settings the control of chemical
quality of groundwater may also be a priority, particularly in response to locally
important natural constituents such as fluoride and arsenic. Furthermore, hazardous
industrial chemicals and pesticides which can accumulate over time may potentially
render a source unusable. The scale, impact and the often lack of feasible clean-up
technologies for some chemical contamination in groundwater means that they should
receive require priority for preventative and remedial strategies.
8                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Groundwater also has a socioeconomic value. It is often a lower cost option than
surface water as the treatment requirements are typically much lower. In many countries,
groundwater is also more widely available for use in drinking-water supply. This may
provide significant advantages to communities in obtaining affordable water supplies,
which may have benefits in terms of promoting greater volumes of water used for
hygiene and other purposes. The natural quality of groundwater also makes its use
valued in industry, and it may provide environmental benefits through recharge of
streams and rivers or for the growth of vegetation. These other benefits reinforce the need
for its protection.
    The actions taken to protect and conserve groundwater will also create costs to
society, through lost opportunity costs for productive uses of land and increased
production costs caused by pollution containment and treatment requirements. When
developing protection plans and strategies, the cost of implementing such measures
should be taken into consideration, as well as the cost of not protecting groundwater, in
order for balanced decisions to be made.


1.3       GROUNDWATER QUANTITY
The interrelated issues of groundwater quality and quantity can best be addressed by
management approaches encompassing entire groundwater recharge areas or
groundwater catchments. These units are appropriate both for assessing pollution
potential and for developing management approaches for protection and remediation.
Excessive groundwater abstraction in relation to recharge will lead to depletion of the
resource and competition between uses, e.g. between irrigation and drinking-water
supply. Strong hydraulic gradients ensuing from abstraction can induce the formation of
preferential flow paths, reducing the efficacy of attenuation processes, and thus lead to
elevated concentrations of contaminants in groundwater. Furthermore, changes in
groundwater levels induced by abstraction may change conditions in the subsurface
environment substantially, e.g. redox conditions, and thus induce mobilization of natural
or anthropogenic contaminants.
    Groundwater quantity issues may have substantial impacts on human health. Lack of
a safe water supply affects disease incidence for instance by restricting options for
personal and household hygiene. Competing demands for groundwater, often for
irrigation and sometimes for industry, may lead to shortage of groundwater for domestic
use. In such situations it is important to ensure allocation of sufficient groundwater
reserves for potable and domestic use and health authorities often play an important role
in this. This monograph largely focuses on water quality issues, as these are of direct
relevance to the provision of safe drinking-water. Quantity issues are therefore addressed
in the context of their impact on groundwater quality.
    This text is concerned with groundwater as a source of drinking-water supply.
However, in many locations other uses, for example irrigation, account for the largest
fraction of groundwater abstraction, and inter-sectoral collaboration may be needed to
develop effective groundwater allocation schemes.

1.4        DISEASE DERIVED FROM GROUNDWATER USE
Groundwater contributes to local and global disease burdens through the transmission of
infectious disease and from chemical hazards.

1.4.1      Infectious disease transmission through groundwater
The global incidence of waterborne disease is significant, though it can only be estimated
since reliable data are not sufficiently available for direct assessment of disease cases
(Prüss-Üstün et al., 2004). The contribution of groundwater to the global incidence of
waterborne disease cannot be assessed easily, as there are many competing transmission
routes; confounding from socioeconomic and behavioural factors is typically high;
definitions of outcome vary; and, exposure-risk relationships are often unclear (Esrey et
al., 1991; Payment and Hunter, 2001; Prüss and Havelaar, 2001). Many waterborne
disease outbreaks could have been prevented by good understanding and management of
groundwaters for health. Pathogen contamination has often been associated with simple
deficiencies in sanitation but also with inadequate understanding of the processes of
attenuation of disease agents in the subsurface.
    The most comprehensive reports of waterborne disease outbreaks come from two
countries, the USA and the United Kingdom, and some indications of the role of
groundwater in the infectious diarrhoeal disease burden can be estimated in these
countries (Craun, 1992; Hunter, 1997; Payment and Hunter, 2001; Craun et al., 2003;
2004).
    Lee et al. (2002) identified that of 39 outbreaks of waterborne disease in the USA
between 1999 and 2000, 17 were due to consumption of untreated groundwater,
although approximately half of these outbreaks were reported from individual water
supplies, which are not operated by a utility and served less than 15 connections or less
than 25 persons. A further eight were reported in non-community supplies, which serve
facilities such as schools, factories and restaurants.
    A detailed analysis of the incidence of waterborne disease in the USA was published
in the mid-1980s by Craun (1985), which is still relevant. In his summary of data from
the period between 1971 and 1982, Craun reports that untreated or inadequately treated
groundwater was responsible for 51 per cent of all waterborne disease outbreaks and 40
per cent of all waterborne illness. A recent analysis of public health data in the USA
showed little change to the epidemiology of disease outbreaks (Craun et al., 1997).
Between 1971 and 1994, 58 per cent of all waterborne outbreaks were caused by
contaminated groundwater systems, although this is in part is due to the higher number
of water supplies using groundwater than those using surface water.
    Craun et al. (2003) report that for the period 1991-1998, 68 per cent of the outbreaks
in public systems were associated with groundwater, an increase from previous reports
(Craun, 1985; Craun et al., 1997). However, this apparent increase is likely to be due in
part to the introduction of the USA Surface Water Treatment Rule in 1991, which
requires ‘conventional filtration’ of most surface water supplies. In general it appears that
waterborne outbreaks in the USA decreased after 1991, with the introduction of more
stringent monitoring and treatment requirements.
10                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Craun et al. (2004) provide a detailed discussion of waterborne outbreaks in relation
to zoonotic organisms (organisms with an animal as well as human reservoir) between
1971 and 2000 in the USA. They note that 751 outbreaks were reported linked to
drinking-water supplies during this period, the majority (648) being linked to community
(year-round public service) water supplies. The aetiology was either known or suspected
in 89 per cent of the outbreaks and zoonotic agents caused 118 outbreaks in community
systems representing 38 per cent of outbreaks associated with these systems and 56 per
cent of those where aetiology was identified. The data show that the majority of illnesses
and deaths were caused by zoonotic agents in the reported waterborne outbreaks.
    The zoonotic agents of greatest importance were Giardia, Campylobacter,
Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and E. coli in outbreaks caused by contaminated drinking-
water. The majority of outbreaks caused by zoonotic bacteria (71 per cent) and
Cryptosporidium (53 per cent) were reported in groundwater supplies. The use of
contaminated, untreated or poorly treated groundwater was responsible for 49 per cent of
outbreaks caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli, and Yersinia. Groundwater that
was contaminated, untreated or poorly treated contributed 18 per cent of all outbreaks
caused by Giardia and Cryptosporidium.
    Kukkula et al. (1997) describe an outbreak of waterborne viral gastroenteritis in the
Finnish municipality of Noormarkku that affected some 1500-3000 people, i.e. between
25 and 50 per cent of the exposed population. Laboratory investigations confirmed that
adenovirus, Norwalk-like virus and group A and C rotaviruses were the principal
causative agents. The source of the outbreak was thought to be a groundwater well
situated on the embankment of a river polluted by sewage discharges. In 1974 an
outbreak of acute gastrointestinal illness at Richmond Heights in Florida, USA was
traced to a supply well that was continuously contaminated with sewage from a nearby
septic tank (Weissman et al., 1976). The main aetiological agent was thought to be
Shigella sonnei. During the outbreak approximately 1200 cases were recorded from a
population of 6500.
    Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have also been linked to groundwater sources, despite
being usually regarded as a surface water problem. A large outbreak of cryptosporidiosis
occurred in 1998 in Brush Creek, Texas, USA from the use of untreated groundwater
drawn from the Edwards Plateau karst aquifer (Bergmire-Sweat et al., 1999). There were
89 stool-confirmed cases and the estimated number of cases was between 1300 and
1500. This outbreak was associated with the consumption of water drawn from deep
wells of over 30 m located more than 400 m from Brush Creek.
    In 1997, epidemiological investigations traced an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the
United Kingdom to water abstracted from a deep chalk borehole. Three hundred and
forty five confirmed cases were recorded by the investigation team, who claimed this to
be the largest outbreak linked to groundwater to have been reported (Willcocks et al.,
1998). This incident has particular significance because the water used in the supply was
drawn from a deep borehole and was filtered before distribution.
    In the outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter in Walkerton, Ontario in
Canada in 2000, the original source of pathogens appears to have derived from
contaminated surface water entering into a surface water body directly linked to an
abstraction borehole (Health Canada, 2000). Although the series of events leading to the
                            Groundwater and public health                              11

outbreak indicate a failure in subsequent treatment and management of water quality,
better protection of groundwater would have reduced the potential for such an outbreak.
An outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 occurred among attendees at the Washington Country
Fair, New York, USA and was shown to be caused by consuming water from a
contaminated shallow well that had no chlorination (CDC, 1999). A total of 951 people
reported having diarrhoea after attending the fair and stool cultures from 116 people
yielded E .coli O157:H7. This outbreak resulted in hospitalization of 65 people, 11
children developed haemolytic syndrome and two people died.
    In developing countries evidence of the role of groundwater in causing disease
outbreaks is more limited, although there have been numerous studies into the impact of
drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene on diarrhoeal disease. In part the limited data on
groundwater related outbreaks reflects the often limited capacity of local health
surveillance systems to identify causal factors and because it is common that several
factors may be implicated in the spread of disease. However, the limited data on
outbreaks specifically linked to groundwater may also reflect that improved groundwater
sources are generally of relatively good quality. Diarrhoeal disease related directly to
drinking-water is most likely to result from consumption of poorly protected or
unimproved groundwater sources, untreated or poorly treated surface water,
contamination of distribution systems and recontamination of water during transport.
    Pokhrel and Viraraghavan (2004) in a review of diarrhoeal disease in Nepal in
relation to water and sanitation, cite examples from South Asia where contamination of
groundwater supplies has led to outbreaks of disease.
    A study of local populations in Kanpur, India recorded an overall incidence rate of
waterborne disease of 80.1 per 1000 population (Trivedi et al., 1971). The communities
in the study areas took water from shallow groundwater sources, analysis of which
revealed that over 70 per cent of the wells were contaminated. Of the cases of waterborne
disease investigated, the greatest proportion was of gastroenteritis, followed by
dysentery.
    In addition to outbreaks, there is some evidence of contaminated groundwater
contributing to background levels of endemic diarrhoeal disease. For example,
Nasinyama et al. (2000) showed that the use of protected springs in Kampala, Uganda
which were in generally in poor condition was associated with higher rates of diarrhoea
than the use of piped water supplies. Much of this disease burden is thought to occur in
developing countries where the use of untreated water from shallow groundwater sources
is common in both rural and peri-urban settlements (Pedley and Howard, 1997).

1.4.2     Chemical hazards
The risk to health from chemicals is typically lower than that from pathogens. The health
effects of most, but not all, chemical hazards arise after prolonged exposure, and tend to
be limited to specific geographical areas or particular water source types. Much remains
to be understood about the epidemiology of diseases related to chemical hazards in water
and the scale of disease burden remains uncertain. However, some data do exist. Craun et
al. (2004) report that 11 per cent of waterborne outbreaks in the USA between 1971 and
2000 were associated with acute effects following ingestion of a chemical.
12                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Ensuring that chemicals of health concern do not occur at significant concentrations in
groundwaters implies understanding sources of pollution, aquifer vulnerability and
specific attenuation processes as well as recognizing the importance of naturally-
occurring chemicals of health concern. In groundwater, however, there are two
contaminants in particular that represent particular hazards of concern: fluoride and
arsenic.
    Fluoride affects bone development and in excess leads to dental or, in extreme form,
skeletal fluorosis. The latter is a painful debilitating disease that causes physical
impairment. However, too little fluoride has also been associated with dental caries and
other dental ill-health (WHO, 2004b). Drinking-water is the principal route of exposure
to fluoride in most settings, although burning of high fluoride coal is a significant route of
exposure in parts of China (Gu et al., 1990).
    Arsenic causes concern given the widespread occurrence in shallow groundwaters
in Bangladesh, West Bengal, India and in groundwater in several other countries. The
scale of arsenic contamination is most severe in the shallow groundwater of
Bangladesh. At present, the total population exposed to elevated arsenic concentrations
in drinking-water in Bangladesh remains uncertain, but is thought to be somewhere
between 35 and 77 million and has been described as the largest recorded poisoning in
history (Smith et al., 2000; BGS and DPHE, 2001). Problems are also noted in
countries as diverse as Mexico, Canada, Hungary and Ghana, although the source of
arsenic and control strategies available vary. The true scale of the public health impact
of arsenic in groundwater remains uncertain and the epidemiology is not fully
understood.
    In the case of Bangladesh, the lack of country-wide case-controlled studies makes
estimating prevalence of arsenicosis difficult. In a recent evaluation of data collected by
the DPHE-Unicef arsenic mitigation programmes, Rosenboom et al. (2004) found a
prevalence rate of arsenicosis (keratosis, melanosis and de-pigmentation) of 0.78 per
1000 population exposed to elevated arsenic (above 50 µg/l) in 15 heavily affected
Upazilas (an administrative unit in Bangladesh). These authors note, however, that the
data were difficult to interpret and that exposure had been relatively short and therefore
these numbers could increase. The lack of a national cancer prevalence study makes
estimations outside small cross-section studies problematic.
    Increasing numbers of countries in Asia are now identifying arsenic contamination of
groundwater (including Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Viet
Nam). In India, increasing numbers of areas are being identified as arsenic affected
beyond West Bengal (School of Environmental Studies, Javadpur University, 2004).
This demonstrates that arsenic is an important contaminant for public health and concern
is growing.
    Other chemical contaminants of concern in groundwater may also lead to health
problems. These include nitrate, uranium and selenium. Of these, nitrate is of concern as
it is associated with an acute health effect (methaemoglobinaemia or infantile cyanosis).
The scale of the health burden derived from nitrate remains uncertain although it has
been suggested to cause significant health problems in some low-income countries where
levels in groundwater reach extremely high values (Melian et al., 1999). Nitrate is also of
concern given that it is stable once in groundwater with reasonably high oxygen content,
                             Groundwater and public health                                 13

where it will not degrade. Thus it may accumulate to a long-term water resource problem
that is expensive and difficult to remediate and whose effect may not be noticed until
concentrations become critical.


1.5         GROUNDWATER IN THE CONTEXT OF
            INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE
            WATER-RELATED DISEASE
The International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD; 1980-1990)
provided a sustained focus on the need for concerted efforts to accelerate activities to
increase global access to safe water supply and to sanitation. The Rio Earth Summit
(1992) placed water both as resource and as water supply on the priority agenda and the
World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 also placed safe drinking-water as a
key component of sustainable development. In September 2000, 189 UN Member States
adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Target 10 of the MDGs is to
halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking-water
and basic sanitation; the baseline for this target has been set as 1990. Other important
initiatives have included a Protocol on Water and Health to the 1992 Convention on Use
of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Box 1.1).

         Box 1.1. The WHO-UNECE Protocol on Water and Health (UNECE and
                                WHO, 1999)
      The WHO-UNECE Protocol on Water and Health to the 1992 Convention on
      the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes
      is an international legal instrument on the prevention, control and reduction of
      water-related diseases in Europe.
      A major product of the Third European Ministerial Conference on Environment
      and Health (1999), the Protocol was signed at the Conference by 35 countries
      and represents the first major international legal approach for controlling water-
      related disease. It has become legally binding for the 16 countries that have
      ratified it in 2005. By adopting the Protocol, the signatories agreed to take all
      appropriate measures towards achieving:
      - adequate supplies of wholesome drinking-water;
      - adequate sanitation of a standard which sufficiently protects human health
        and the environment;
      - effective protection of water resources used as sources of drinking-water and
        their related water ecosystems from pollution from other causes;
      - adequate safeguards for human health against water-related diseases;
      - effective systems for monitoring and responding to outbreaks or incidents of
         water-related diseases.
14                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

   The Global Environmental Monitoring System Water programme, launched in 1977
by UNEP in collaboration with UNESCO, WHO and WMO, has the overall objective of
observing and assessing global water quality issues in rivers, lakes and groundwater by
collecting together and interpreting data from national monitoring networks. A first
assessment of freshwater quality published in 1989 (Meybeck et al., 1989) included
discussion of links between water quality and health. The programme was reviewed and
evaluated in 2001 with a view to enhancing its ability to contribute to inter-agency global
programmes, including the Global International Waters Assessment and the UN-wide
World Water Assessment Programme.
   Recently, the World Bank has established a groundwater management advisory team
(GW·MATE) to develop capacity and capability in groundwater resource management
and quality protection through World Bank programmes and projects and through the
activities of the Global Water Partnerships regional networks.
   WHO's activities in support of safe drinking-water span across the range of its
functions as a specialized agency of the UN system (Box 1.2).

1.6        GROUNDWATER IN THE WHO GUIDELINES FOR
           DRINKING-WATER QUALITY
Since 1958 WHO has published at about ten year intervals several editions of International
Standards for Drinking-water and subsequently Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality.
The third edition of the Guidelines, published in 2004, includes a substantial update of the
approach towards the control of microbial hazards in particular based on a preventive
management approach. In preparing the third edition of the Guidelines a series of state-of-
the-art reviews was prepared on aspects of water quality management and human health
(Box 1.3) of which Protecting Groundwater for Health is one.
   In the overall context of the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ), this
monograph serves two purposes: it provides the background information on potential
groundwater contamination as well as approaches to protection and remediation that
were taken into account in developing the third edition of the GDWQ. Further,
Protecting Groundwater for Health supplements it by providing comprehensive
information on: assessing the potential for contamination of groundwater resources,
prioritizing hazards and selecting management approaches appropriate to the specific
socioeconomic and institutional conditions.

   A central approach of the third edition of the GDWQ is the development of a reliable
preventive safety management approach: a Framework for Safe Drinking-water, the
three key requirements of which are described in Box 1.4. This includes the introduction
of Water Safety Plans (WSPs) as a management tool for avoidance and control of
groundwater contamination. These are described in Chapter 16 of this book.

          Box 1.4. The three key requirements of WHO’s Framework for Safe
                            Drinking-water (WHO, 2004b)
     1. Health-based targets based on an evaluation of health concerns.
     2. Development of a Water Safety Plan (WSP) that includes:
          •   System assessment to determine whether the water supply (from source
              through treatment to the point of consumption) as a whole can deliver
              water of a quality that meets the health based targets.
          • Operational monitoring of the control measures in the drinking-water
              supply that are of particular importance in securing drinking-water safety.
          • Management plans documenting the system assessment and monitoring
              plans and describing actions to be taken in normal operating and incident
              conditions, including upgrading, documentation and communication.
      3. A system of independent surveillance that verifies that the above are
         operating properly.

   This approach meets the need for developing an understanding of the key steps in the
supply chain at which pollution may be introduced or prevented, increased or reduced.
Effective management implies identifying these, ideally through a quantitative system
assessment. The framework also includes identification of the appropriate measures to
ensure that processes are operating within the bounds necessary to ensure safety. For
drinking-water supply from groundwaters these controls may extend into the recharge
area but may also relate to more immediate source protection measures, such as well-
head protection. Some of the measures to verify safe operation of processes relevant to
groundwater safety may be amenable to sophisticated approaches such as on-line
monitoring of levels (e.g. of landfill effluents). Others (such as the ongoing integrity of a
well plinth) are best approached through periodic inspection regimes.

Groundwater occurrence and
hydrogeological environments
J. Chilton and K.-P. Seiler




Many people are surprised to discover that groundwater is widely and heavily used
throughout the world. During severe droughts in arid regions of the world, newspapers
and television carry dramatic pictures of dry wells in rural communities and people
walking long distances for small amounts of household water. However, groundwater
usage is important in both humid and arid regions, and it can be a revelation that many
cities are dependent on groundwater and use such large volumes of groundwater in their
public water supplies.
    One reason for this general lack of awareness is that groundwater is usually a hidden
resource, out of sight and therefore out of mind. It is, nevertheless, as valuable an asset in
water supply terms as rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and deserves to be equally protected.
As a consequence of this lack of awareness, the main features of groundwater systems
are poorly known or even misunderstood. To provide the necessary basic knowledge of
hydrogeology for the reader to fully appreciate the rest of the monograph, this chapter
aims to rectify the situation by placing place groundwater in its appropriate context
within the wider water cycle. It then summarizes the ways in which groundwater occurs
and moves, and how it is replenished. The characteristics of the main types of geological
settings are described so that the reader is able to see how different hydrogeological
environments vary in their response to the pressures of water abstraction and pollution.

This knowledge will be used to help guide the information requirements outlined in
Chapter 8. In relation to the overall source-pathway-receptor approach to the assessment
of pollution this chapter is mainly focussed on the pathway through groundwater systems
to the receptor, and should be read in this context.
    Providing an adequate technical basis would be difficult without defining at least
some of the most important terms related to groundwater and pollution. The most
important definitions are highlighted through the chapter and key concepts illustrated by
figures. A short list of suitable standard texts which can provide further details for the
interested reader is given at the end of the chapter, along with the references actually
quoted.


2.1        GROUNDWATER IN THE HYDROLOGICAL
           SYSTEM
2.1.1      The hydrological cycle
The continuous movement of water between oceans, atmosphere and land is known as
the hydrological cycle (Figure 2.1). Considering the freshwater component of the system,
which is the part of greatest significance for this monograph, inflow is from precipitation
in the form of rainfall and from melting snow and ice. Outflow occurs primarily as
stream flow or runoff and as evapotranspiration, a combination of evaporation from
water surfaces and the soil and transpiration from soil moisture by plants. Precipitation
reaches streams and rivers both on the land surface as overland flow to tributary
channels, and also by subsurface routes as interflow and baseflow following infiltration
to the soil. Part of the precipitation that infiltrates deeply into the ground may accumulate
above an impermeable bed and saturate the available pore spaces to form an
underground body of water, called an aquifer. The water contained in aquifers
contributes to the groundwater component of the cycle (Figure 2.1), from which natural
discharge reaches streams and rivers, wetlands and the oceans.
    Figure 2.1 simplifies the hydrological cycle, illustrating only its natural components.
There are few areas of the world in which the cycle has not been interfered with and
modified by human settlement and associated activities. Large urban areas alter the
processes of infiltration and drainage (e.g. Lerner et al., 1990; Lerner, 1997), as do big
irrigation schemes. Negative and costly impacts of waterlogging and salinity are widely
experienced where excess infiltration from irrigation with diverted surface water raises
groundwater levels beneath the irrigated land. This is seen most dramatically in the lower
Indus Valley in Pakistan. Estimates of the area affected vary, but of 16.1 million ha
irrigated, some 4.6 million ha are affected to some extent by waterlogging and salinity, of
which perhaps 2 million ha have suffered serious deterioration (Ghassemi et al., 1995).
Engineering works for flood control, irrigation, hydropower and navigation can all
change the surface water component of the cycle locally but sometimes dramatically, and
groundwater abstraction can intercept discharge to rivers, wetlands and the oceans. An
example of modification of the hydrological cycle that clearly has the potential to cause
negative health impacts is the uncontrolled discharge of untreated urban wastewater or
industrial effluents to surface water or groundwater. Modifying the hydrological cycle by
             Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                      23

human intervention also implies changing pollutant pathways and transport mechanisms,
and these changes must be understood in developing strategies for protecting the health
of water users.




Figure 2.1. The natural hydrological cycle (modified from Morris et al., 2003).



    DEF X              Aquifers are layers of rock or sediments which are sufficiently
                       porous to store water and permeable enough to allow water to flow
                       through them in economically viable quantities.


   The river basin or catchment is the geographical expression of the hydrological cycle,
and the spatial unit within which water resource balances can be estimated and through
which pollutants are transported within the cycle. Figure 2.1 demonstrates that both
surface water and subsurface processes occur. This means that the river basin or sub-
basin, and all of the activities within it, should be the unit or basis for the management of
water resources, rather than political or administrative subdivisions. River Basin
Management Plans are, therefore, an essential feature of the European Union (EU) Water
Framework Directive (EC, 2000), which is intended to establish the overall approach to
long-term management of water resources by EU Member States. It also follows that
catchments can contain land from more than one or indeed several countries and
transboundary or multi-national authorities, such as for the Rhine, Danube, Zambezi and
others, have been established to oversee their management. Thus a key principle is that:
24                          Protecting Groundwater for Health


     NOTE X            The catchment boundaries of a river basin or sub-basin should
                       define the management unit for water resources, rather than
                       administrative or political boundaries.



2.1.2      Groundwater in the hydrological cycle
While the definition of groundwater as the water contained beneath the surface in rocks
and soil is conceptually simple and convenient, in practice the picture is a little more
complex, and confusion can arise. The water beneath the ground surface includes that
contained in the soil, that in the intermediate unsaturated zone below the soil, that
comprising the capillary fringe and that below the water table (Figure 2.2). The soil is
commonly understood to comprise the broken down and weathered rock and decaying
plant debris at the ground surface. The region between the soil and the water table is
commonly referred to as the unsaturated zone or sometimes the vadose zone.




Figure 2.2. Classification of subsurface water (modified from Driscoll, 1986)
            Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                        25


   DEF X             The unsaturated zone contains both air and water, while in the
                     saturated zone all of the voids are full of water. The water table
                     marks the boundary between the two, and is the surface at which
                     fluid pressure is exactly equal to atmospheric pressure.


    Strictly speaking, therefore, groundwater refers only to water in the saturated zone
beneath the water table, and the total water column beneath the earth’s surface is usually
called subsurface water (Figure 2.2). In practice, of course, the saturated and unsaturated
zones are connected, and the position of the water table fluctuates seasonally, from year
to year and with the effects of groundwater abstraction.
    Appreciating this distinction is especially important in relation to protecting
groundwater from pollutants originating from activities at the surface. Such pollutants
can either be retained in the soil or they may be carried downwards by infiltrating water,
depending on the physicochemical properties of both the soil material and of the
pollutants. The soil, and the unsaturated zone beneath it, can be considered to serve as a
reactive filter, delaying or even removing pollutants by the range of processes described
in Chapters 3 and 4. The properties of the materials comprising the soil and the
unsaturated zone are, therefore, critical factors in defining the vulnerability of
groundwater to pollution, as described in Chapter 8.
    In volume terms, groundwater is the most important component of the active
terrestrial hydrological cycle, as shown in Table 2.1. Excluding the 97.5 per cent of water
of high salinity contained in the oceans and seas, groundwater accounts for about one
third of the freshwater resources of the world (UNESCO, 1999). If the water
permanently contained in the polar ice caps and glaciers is also excluded, then
groundwater accounts for nearly all of the useable freshwater. Even if consideration is
further limited to the most active and accessible groundwater bodies, which were
estimated by Lvovitch (1972) at 4 x 106 km3, then they still constitute 95 per cent of the
total freshwater. Lakes, swamps, reservoirs and rivers account for 3.5 per cent and soil
moisture for 1.5 per cent (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). The dominant role of groundwater
resources is clear, their use is fundamental to human life and economic activity, and their
proper management and protection are correspondingly vital.

    The last column of Table 2.1 provides an indication of the range of residence times of
water in the various compartments of the hydrological cycle. The great variation in
residence times in freshwater bodies is also illustrated in Figure 2.3, which emphasizes
the generally slow movement and long residence time of most groundwaters compared
to surface waters.

2.2        GROUNDWATER OCCURRENCE AND
           MOVEMENT
2.2.1      Groundwater occurrence and storage
Some groundwater occurs in most geological formations because nearly all rocks in the
uppermost part of the earth’s crust, of whatever type, origin or age, possess openings
called pores or voids. Geologists traditionally subdivide rock formations into three
classes according to their origins and methods of formation:
   Sedimentary rocks are formed by deposition of material, usually under water from
lakes, rivers and the sea, and more rarely from the wind. In unconsolidated, granular
materials such as sands and gravels, the voids are the spaces between the grains
(Figure 2.4A). These may become consolidated physically by compaction and
chemically by cementation (Figure 2.4D) to form typical sedimentary rocks such as
sandstone, limestone and shale, with much reduced voids between the grains.
             Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                       27

    Igneous rocks have been formed from molten geological material rising from great
depth and cooling to form crystalline rocks either below the ground or at the land surface.
The former include rocks such as granites and many volcanic lavas such as basalts. The
latter are associated with various types of volcanic eruptions and include lavas and hot
ashes. Most igneous rocks are strongly consolidated and, being crystalline, usually have
few voids between the grains.




Figure 2.4. Rock texture and porosity of typical aquifer materials (based on Todd, 1980)

    Metamorphic rocks have been formed by deep burial, compaction, melting and
alteration or re-crystallization of other rocks during periods of intense geological activity.
28                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

Metamorphic rocks include gneisses and slates and are also normally consolidated, with
few void spaces in the matrix between the grains.
   In the more consolidated rocks, such as lavas, gneisses and granites, the only void
spaces may be fractures resulting from cooling or stresses due to movement of the earth’s
crust in the form of folding and faulting. These fractures may be completely closed or
have very small and not very extensive or interconnected openings of relatively narrow
aperture (Figure 2.4F). Weathering and decomposition of igneous and metamorphic
rocks may significantly increase the void spaces in both matrix and fractures. Fractures
may be enlarged into open fissures as a result of solution by the flowing groundwater
(Figure 2.4E). Limestone, largely made up of calcium carbonate, and evaporates
composed of gypsum and other salts, are particularly susceptible to active solution,
which can produce the caverns, swallow holes and other characteristic features of karstic
aquifers. It is worthwhile becoming aware of the main geological terms, as geological
maps are likely to be one of the main sources of information required to characterize a
catchment or area of investigation (Chapter 8), but also noting the following important
distinction:


     NOTE X          A geologist’s principal subdivision of rock types is according to
                     origin, whereas hydrogeologists first classify aquifers as unconsoli-
                     dated or consolidated and hence whether water is stored and moves
                     mainly between the grains of the rock matrix or through fractures.


   The volume of water that can be contained in the rock depends on the proportion of
these openings or pores in a given volume of rock, and this is termed porosity of the rock.


     DEF X           The porosity of a geological material is the ratio of the volume of the
                     voids to the total volume, expressed as a decimal fraction or
                     percentage.


    Increasing pore space results in higher porosity and greater potential to store water.
Typical porosity ranges are shown in Table 2.2 for common geological materials,
emphasizing the division between unconsolidated and consolidated referred to above.
    Not all of the water contained in fully saturated pore spaces can be abstracted by wells
and boreholes and used. Under the influence of gravity when, for example, the water
level falls, some of the water drains from the pores but some remains, held by surface
tension and molecular effects. The ratio of the water that drains by gravity from an
initially saturated rock mass to its own total volume is defined as the specific yield of the
material, and typical values are also shown in Table 2.2.

   Another important way of distinguishing aquifers and the way in which groundwater
occurs, when considering both its development and protection, is shown in Figure 2.5. In
the figure an unconfined aquifer is one in which the upper limit of the zone in which all
the pore spaces are fully saturated, i.e. the water table, is at atmospheric pressure. At any
depth below the water table the water pressure is greater than atmospheric, and at any
point above, the water pressure is less than atmospheric. In contrast, at greater depths, the
effective thickness of an aquifer often extends between two impermeable layers
(Figure 2.5).


    DEF X             Materials through which water can pass easily are said to be
                      permeable and those that scarcely allow water to pass or only with
                      difficulty are described as impermeable.


     If the overlying layer has low permeability and restricts the movement of water, then
it is known as an aquitard and causes the aquifer beneath to be partially or semi confined.
If the overlying layer has such low permeability that it prevents water movement through
it, then the aquifer is fully confined. In these situations, at any point in the confined
aquifer, the water pressure is greater than atmospheric, because of the elevation of the
outcrop receiving recharge. If a borehole is drilled through the confining layer into the
aquifer, water rises up the borehole to a level that balances the pressure in the aquifer. An
imaginary surface joining the water level in boreholes in a confined aquifer is called the
potentiometric surface, which can be above or below the groundwater surface in the
30                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

overlying unconfined aquifer (Figure 2.5). If the pressure in a confined aquifer is such
that the potentiometric surface is above ground level, then a drilled borehole will
overflow (Figure 2.5). For a phreatic aquifer, which is the first unconfined aquifer to be
formed below the surface, the potentiometric surface and groundwater surface
correspond, and this is called the water table.
   From the groundwater development point of view, unconfined aquifers are often
favoured because their storage properties make them more efficient for exploitation than
confined aquifers, and they are likely to be shallower and therefore cheaper to drill into
and pump from. On the other hand:


     NOTE X            A confined aquifer which has even a modest overlying sequence of
                       less permeable clay strata is likely to be much less vulnerable to
                       pollution than an unconfined aquifer.

2.2.2      Groundwater movement
Groundwater is not usually static but moves slowly through aquifers. However, it needs a
source of energy to do so, which is provided by the hydraulic head represented by the
height of the water level in an observation well or borehole in the aquifer. The total
hydraulic head is made up of two components, the elevation head being the height of the
             Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                        31

midpoint of the section of the borehole or well that is open to the aquifer, and the
pressure head, which is the height of the column of water above this midpoint. The first
component thus reflects location and topographic position and the second reflects
conditions in the aquifer, including seasonal and longer-term changes in water levels.
Hydraulic heads are normally measured with respect to an arbitrary datum, which is
often sea level. To obtain a more comprehensive description of these rather difficult
concepts, the reader should refer to standard hydrogeological text books such as Freeze
and Cherry (1979), Price (1996) or Domenico and Schwartz (1998). For an
understanding of groundwater movement for the present purposes, however, it is
sufficient to know that groundwater moves from regions of high head to regions of low
head.
    The flow of groundwater through an aquifer is governed by Darcy’s Law, which
states that the rate of flow is directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient:
                Q/A = q = - K (h1 – h2)/l = - K ∆h/∆l                               (Eqn. 2.1)
where Q is the rate of flow through area A under a hydraulic gradient ∆h/∆l which is the
difference in hydraulic heads (h1 - h2) between two measuring points, and q is the
volumetric flow per unit surface area. The direction of groundwater flow in an aquifer is
at right angles to lines of equal head. A simple experimental apparatus used to
demonstrate Darcy’s Law is shown in Figure 2.6, indicating also the elevation and
pressure components of hydraulic head referred to above. The equation for Darcy’s Law
is conventionally written with a minus sign because flow is in the direction of decreasing
hydraulic heads.




Figure 2.6. Experimental apparatus to demonstrate Darcy’s Law (modified from Price, 1996)
32                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

   The constant of proportionality in the equation, K, has dimensions of length/time
because the hydraulic gradient is dimensionless. This parameter is known as hydraulic
conductivity, and is a measure of the ease with which water flows through the sand
contained in the cylinder in the laboratory experiment or through the various materials
that form aquifers and aquicludes. The similarity between Darcy’s Law and other
important laws of physics governing the flow of both electricity and heat should be
noted. The ease with which water can flow through a rock mass depends on a
combination of the size of the pores and the degree to which they are interconnected.
These features determine the overall permeability of the rock. For clean, granular
materials, hydraulic conductivity increases with grain size. Typical ranges of hydraulic
conductivity for the main types of geological materials are shown in Figure 2.7.




Figure 2.7. Range of hydraulic conductivity (K) values for geological materials (based on Driscoll,
1986 and Todd, 1980)
            Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                      33

   Darcy’s Law can be written in several forms. By substituting q in the equation, it is
possible to determine the specific discharge per unit area, if the volumetric flux Q is
divided by the full cross-sectional area (A in Figure 2.6). However, this area includes
both solids and voids, although clearly flow can only take place through the voids or pore
spaces. A more realistic linear pore velocity, v, the volumetric flow rate per area of
connected pore space can be calculated if the porosity is known. Thus we can define:
               v = - q/n = - Ki/n                                                (Eqn. 2.2)
Where i is conventionally used to represent the hydraulic gradient ∆h/∆l. To make this
calculation, it is necessary to know the effective or dynamic porosity ne, which represents
the proportion of the total porosity that is involved in groundwater movement. This is
difficult to measure, but for unconfined aquifers is probably close to the specific yield
values given in Table 2.2.


   DEF X             The effective porosity is defined as the proportion of the total volume
                     that consists of interconnected pores able to transmit fluids.


   Thus most materials in which intergranular flow predominates have effective
porosities of 0.15 to 0.25, so in these types of aquifers the actual groundwater flow
velocity is four to six times the specific discharge. The linear velocity will always be
greater than the specific discharge, and increases with decreasing effective porosity. This
average velocity in the direction of groundwater flow does not represent the true velocity
of water particles through the pore spaces. These microscopic velocities are generally
greater because the intergranular flow pathways are irregular and tortuous and longer
than the average linear macroscopic pathway. The average linear velocity, v, is a key
parameter in groundwater protection, as it defines the travel times for water and solutes
within aquifers. For unconsolidated granular aquifers, typical natural groundwater flow
velocities range from a few mm/d for silts and fine sands to 5-10 m/d for the clean and
coarse gravels.
   Darcy’s Law provides a valid description of the flow of groundwater in most
naturally occurring hydrogeological conditions i.e. for fractured rocks as well as granular
materials. Fractured rocks are characterized by low porosity and localized high hydraulic
conductivity, and very high flow velocities of up to several kilometres per day may result
(Orth et al., 1997; US EPA, 1997), especially where a small number of fractures are
enlarged by solution (Figure 2.4E). Extensive development of solution in limestone areas
can result in karst terrain, which is typified by channels, sinkholes, depressions and
caves, into which all traces of surface flow may disappear. Such conditions can be very
favourable for groundwater supplies from springs and boreholes, but aquifers of this type
are often highly vulnerable to all types of pollution (Malard et al., 1994).
   Groundwater flow may occur through the spaces between the grains or through
fractures (Figure 2.4) or a combination of the two in, for example, a jointed sandstone or
limestone. Hydrogeologists commonly refer to these as dual-porosity aquifers, because
they have primary porosity and permeability from the intergranular pores and additional
secondary porosity and permeability provided by the fracture systems. The presence of
34                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

highly fractured rocks should immediately warn of the risk of rapid transport over large
distances. The occurrence of potential contaminant sources close to water supplies in
such environments should be considered to provide a very high risk of pollution.
    The characteristic properties of an aquifer to store and transmit groundwater are
normally deduced from the interpretation of pumping tests performed on wells or
boreholes (Price, 1996) or by introducing inert tracers into groundwater flow systems
and observing their transport (Becker et al., 1998; Käss, 1998). Determinations of aquifer
parameters are often difficult and expensive, and information is usually available for at
most a few specific locations in an aquifer. However, most geological materials are far
from uniform laterally or with depth. As an example, sediments such as river alluvium,
deltas and glacial deposits may contain alternating fine and coarse layers, clay lenses,
sand channels and many other features and structures which reflect the complex history
of deposition. These geological variations mean that aquifers are rarely homogeneous, in
which the properties are the same irrespective of position in the aquifer, but more often
heterogeneous, with varying properties. Obtaining or selecting aquifer parameters that
can apply to and be representative of a whole aquifer or catchment is often, therefore, a
difficult task for a hydrogeologist. Describing and quantifying groundwater flow is not as
straightforward as a summary text such as this might suggest to the reader, especially in
aquifers with complex patterns of fracture flow. However, distinguishing whether
intergranular or fracture flow predominates for any aquifer of interest is fundamental to
understanding the hydrogeology, which is in turn the basis for developing, managing and
protecting groundwater.


     NOTE X          Whatever the source of pollution and type of pollutant,
                     understanding the way groundwater occurs and moves is crucial to:
                     (1) setting up groundwater protection policies;
                     (2) establishing water quality monitoring systems;
                     (3) designing pollution control or aquifer remediation measures.




2.3       GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE AND RECHARGE
It is important to distinguish between infiltration of precipitation and groundwater
recharge. Thus looking back at the hydrological cycle in Figure 2.1, when rain falls,
some infiltrates into the soil. Much of this moisture is taken up by the roots of plants and
is subject to evapotranspiration from the soil zone, and some becomes interflow drainage
to streams and rivers. Only a part of the infiltration becomes recharge and moves deeper
into the subsurface under gravity, and in arid and semi-arid areas this may be a very
small proportion indeed. This distinction becomes very important when considering the
estimation of recharge in Chapter 8. Thus conceptually and for estimation purposes:
            Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                      35


   DEF X             groundwater recharge should be defined as the downward flow of
                     water reaching the water table and replenishing groundwater
                     resources


and should be distinguished from infiltration. The latter includes all of the water entering
the ground from rainfall or other sources but by no means does all of this become
groundwater recharge.
    In the subsoil and rock closest to the ground surface, the pore spaces are partly filled
with air and partly with water. This was defined as the unsaturated or vadose zone in
Figure 2.2, and can vary in depth from nothing to tens of metres. In the unsaturated zone,
soil, air and water are in contact and may react with each other, which can be important
in the evolution of the hydrochemistry of the water. In the uppermost part of the
unsaturated zone, some upward movement occurs in response to seasonal
evapotranspiration requirements. Below this, in humid areas, movement in the
unsaturated zone is dominantly vertically downwards. The most recent water arriving
from the soil displaces downwards the whole column of water already in the unsaturated
zone, rather like the movement of a piston, so that the water at the base of the column
reaches the water table. For parts of the year, particularly when the weather is dry and no
new percolating water passes below the soil, the ‘piston’ moves very slowly or not at all.
In times of heavy rainfall and substantial infiltration, downward movement may be more
strongly established.
    By sampling the unsaturated zone water to obtain vertical profiles and repeat profiles
of tracers such as bromide, nitrate and tritium, average rates of movement of less than 5
m/yr and often less than 1 m/yr have been measured in temperate regions (Wellings,
1984; Geake and Foster, 1989; Barraclough et al., 1994). This means that it could take
20 years or more for infiltrating water to reach a water table 20 m below the ground
surface. It is common for the water table to be in the range 10 to 50 m below ground, and
the unsaturated zone component of the pollutant pathway can therefore be substantial. In
semi-arid regions, recharge can be much less and downward displacement
correspondingly very slow (Edmunds and Gaye, 1994). In the most arid areas, the
unsaturated zone may only act as a temporary storage reservoir in which water that
percolates downwards after occasional heavy rain does not reach the water table but is
instead drawn upwards and returns to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration from plants.
Residence times in the unsaturated zone thus depend on the thickness and the rate of
recharge, and can vary from almost nothing to tens or hundreds of years.
    The above applies to aquifers in which downward movement of recharging water
takes place only through the intergranular matrix. In fractured and dual porosity aquifer
materials, much more rapid, preferential flow to the water table may occur, especially
after heavy rainfall. This component of flow can carry pollutants from the ground surface
much more quickly, allowing little or no time for attenuation, and such aquifers can be
highly vulnerable to pollution.
    All subsurface freshwater must have a source of recharge, even if it was long ago.
This comes either by direct infiltration of rainfall or snowmelt, or from rivers and lakes.
Now that the hydrological cycle has been interfered with as a result of human activities,
36                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

recharge can also be derived from canals, reservoirs, irrigated land, water mains and
sewerage systems in urban areas, mining waste, sewage lagoons, in fact any artificial
water body that is in connection with the subsurface. Artificial recharge, which is
becoming an increasingly important resource management option, can also introduce
water of different origin and quality into aquifers. This of course means that groundwater
recharge is not always of the same good quality as infiltrating rainfall, which itself may
be contaminated by acid rain or atmospheric acid deposition.


2.4        GROUNDWATER FLOW SYSTEMS
In many aquifers, the hydraulic head reflects the topographic surface of the ground, and
groundwater therefore moves from elevated regions where recharge occurs to discharge
zones at lower elevations. Thus within the context of the overall cycle shown in
Figure 2.1 and the source-pathway-receptor concept, the groundwater flow system
(Figure 2.8) is a useful way of describing the physical occurrence, movement and
hydrochemical evolution of groundwater.


     DEF X           A groundwater flow system is a discrete, closed three-dimensional
                     system containing flow paths from the point at which recharging
                     water enters an aquifer to the topographically lower point at which
                     it leaves the aquifer.


    Infiltration of rainfall on high ground occurs in a recharge area in which the hydraulic
head decreases with depth, and net saturated flow is downwards away from the water
table and laterally towards areas of lower hydraulic head (A in Figure 2.8). After moving
slowly through the aquifer down the hydraulic gradient (B in Figure 2.8), groundwater
leaves the aquifer by springs, wetlands, baseflow to rivers (C in Figure 2.8) or discharge
to lakes or the oceans. These are known as groundwater discharge areas, and at C (in
Figure 2.8) the hydraulic head increases with depth and the net saturated zone flow is
upwards towards the water table. In a recharge area, the water table can be at depth, with
a considerable thickness of unsaturated zone above it. In a discharge area, the water table
is usually at, or very near to, the ground surface. Rivers, canals, lakes and reservoirs may
either discharge to or receive recharge from groundwater, and the relationship may
change seasonally or over a longer time span or along the course of a single river.
    While in many cases groundwater and surface water catchments have more or less the
same boundaries, this is not always the case. Seasonally due to recharge, and in response
to heavy abstraction, groundwater catchment boundaries may deviate significantly from
surface water catchments. In deep aquifers, or sequences of more than one layered
aquifer, groundwater recharge may come from great distances and deep groundwater
flow may have little relationship to the overlying surface water system. In most cases,
however, if there is no information it is a reasonable first estimate to assume surface
water and groundwater catchments are similar and that groundwater flow patterns are
likely to be a subdued reflection of the surface topography.
             Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                    37

    In large, deep aquifers, groundwater is likely to move slowly, at rates of a few metres
per year, from recharge to discharge area over tens or hundreds of kilometres. This may
take hundreds or thousands of years, and typical order-of-magnitude values from time of
recharge to point of discharge are indicated in Figure 2.8. Hydrogeologists can confirm
these by isotopic dating techniques (Kendal and McDonnel, 1998; Edmunds and
Smedley, 2000). In small, shallow aquifers, recharge and discharge areas may be much
closer or even adjacent to each other, and residence times can be restricted to a few
months or years. In arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater discharge areas are often
characterized by poor quality groundwater, particularly with high salinity. Groundwater
discharge may be from seepages or salt marshes with distinctive vegetation, known as
salinas or playas, in which evapotranspiration at high rates for long periods of time has
led to a build-up in salinity.
    While the flow system in Figure 2.8 is a useful general illustration, in many cases
groundwater does not flow uniformly through the entire thickness of an aquifer, but
instead flows predominantly at shallow depths close to the water table (Seiler and
Lindner, 1995). In unconsolidated aquifers, both hydraulic conductivity and porosity
usually decrease with depth due to consolidation and compaction. In fractured aquifers
too, the hydraulic conductivity and porosity provided by the fracture system would be
expected to decline with depth as the fractures become less open. This general but
variable and not easily predicted decline in groundwater flow properties with depth often
restricts the flow and pollutant pathway to the most permeable, near-surface parts of the
aquifer. Further, the zone of seasonal water table fluctuation is often where the most
active solution of fractures occurs and this helps to enhance the flow dominance of the
uppermost part of the saturated aquifer.

38                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Given the high porosity values in the upper part of Table 2.2, it can be seen that most
types of aquifer, provided they are at least a few metres thick, can contain large volumes
of water. Many aquifers are, of course, much thicker, ranging up to several hundred
metres. Even in humid areas, recharge comprises only a proportion of the total rainfall
and a simple calculation will show that, for typical annual recharge volumes equivalent
to tens to a few hundreds of millimetres, the total volume of groundwater in storage in
the aquifer is many times larger than the annual recharge. Aquifers are generally,
therefore, high storage, low recharge systems with substantial capacity for dilution of
incoming pollutants, except in the situations of restricted shallow flow referred to
immediately above. In these cases, incoming recharge may be distributed far from evenly
through the aquifer, and the resulting groundwater volume available for dilution may be
much less than the total storage of the aquifer.


2.5        GEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTS AND AQUIFER
           TYPES
As described above, the natural subsurface geological environment provides the
dominant control over the occurrence and movement of groundwater and hence defines
which rock types form good aquifers. However, geodiversity and the consequent
hydrogeological variability are poorly appreciated by many of those working in water
protection and management. The variability both between and within hydrogeological
environments can have a profound impact on how aquifers respond to the pressures
imposed upon them. Further, if an aquifer is to be protected and managed, it is important
to understand the groundwater flow system to be able to assess the susceptibility of the
aquifer to these external changes and the types and timescales of the likely responses.
    While almost all geological materials contain some water and many different rocks
can form useful aquifers, nevertheless it is possible to develop a summary of the most
common aquifer types and hydrogeological environments (Table 2.3). This classification
is a useful overall basis for helping to identify the major potential concerns for protection
and management of groundwater. The general subdivision in Table 2.3 takes into
account both the rock type and the geological environment in which the rocks were
formed. While such a broad classification is useful, it inevitably involves some
simplifications of the true breadth of subsurface geological variation and complexity. The
classification shown in Table 2.3, or slight variations of it, proved useful as a basis for
discussion of groundwater quality monitoring (Chilton, 1996) and provided the
hydrogeological framework within which the management of groundwater in urban
areas (Foster et al., 1998) and the development and management of groundwater in rural
areas (Foster et al., 2000) can be set. Each of the seven subdivisions is briefly described
below.

Major alluvial and coastal plain sediments
The first subdivision (Table 2.3), covers a broad range of materials and lateral and
vertical scales. At one end of the scale are extensive sequences of coastal, river and
deltaic alluvium, sometimes hundreds of metres thick. These unconsolidated sedimentary
deposits form some of the most important aquifers in the world, in which very large
            Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                     39

volumes of groundwater are stored and from which large quantities of water are pumped
for water supply and irrigation. Examples include the Lower Indus and Ganges-
Brahmaputra valleys, the Mekong, the Tigris-Euphrates, the north European plain and
the Nile valley. Many of the world’s largest cities such as Bangkok, Beijing, Cairo,
Calcutta, Dhaka, Hanoi, Lima, Madras and Shanghai are located on such deposits and
are supplied by groundwater drawn from unconsolidated strata.
   These aquifers can cover large areas and contain enormous volumes of water. As an
example, aquifers within the unconsolidated sediments underlying the Huang-Hai-Hai
Plain of eastern China, which covers an area of 350 000 km2, provide the potable water
requirements for nearly 160 million people and also enough to irrigate some 20 million
ha of land. The sediments are of Quaternary age and are typically 200-400 m thick.
Groundwater in these sediments can be subdivided into three types: an upper unconfined
freshwater zone, a middle saline water zone and a lower confined aquifer. The total
volume of groundwater stored exceeds 2 000 000 million m3, whilst usable groundwater
resources have been estimated at more than 49 000 million m3/a. Other unconsolidated
sedimentary aquifers may be much less extensive but can still store sufficient volumes of
groundwater to be important sources of water supply. The coastal plain around Jakarta
and the Nile valley at Cairo are examples. Smaller but still locally-important aquifers are
provided by river valley and coastal plain sediments of more limited lateral extent and
depth, and aquifers of much more restricted size and extent may occur in upland river
valleys as river terraces.
   Aquifers in unconsolidated strata are rarely simple homogeneous systems but
typically consist of alternating permeable layers of productive sands and gravels
separated by less permeable aquitard layers of clay and silt, reflecting the complex
history of deposition. In such sequences, the shallowest aquifer may be the easiest and
cheapest to exploit, but is likely to be the most vulnerable to pollution. The presence of
aquitards may produce complex groundwater flow patterns, but the permeable horizons
may still have a degree of hydraulic continuity, such that pumping from one layer will
affect the others, producing significant vertical head gradients and consequent leakage.
   The high porosity of unconsolidated sediments, typically in the range 0.25 to 0.35,
and the generally low horizontal hydraulic gradients in the major alluvial plains means
that groundwater velocities are very low, usually in the range 0.003-0.1 m d-1. These low
velocities combined with the significant distances travelled (tens to hundreds of
kilometres) indicate that much of the deeper groundwater in thick alluvial sequences is
derived from recharge several hundred to several thousand years ago, and the term 'fossil'
has sometimes been used to describe deep, old groundwater.

Intermontane alluvial and volcanic systems
Aquifers of this type include some volcanic lavas and pyroclastic rocks, together with
alluvial-volcanic and alluvial fan deposits. They are typically associated with rapidly
infilled and faulted troughs or basins within mountain regions (Table 2.3). Hydraulic
conductivities and porosities are generally high but variable. When combined with the
above average rainfall that is often found in the mountainous climatic regimes where
many of these environments are found, valuable aquifers occur and are capable of
supporting substantial borehole yields. Additional recharge to groundwater often occurs
40                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

where surface water flowing from the surrounding mountain slopes infiltrates into the
highly permeable valley-fill deposits, especially through the alluvial fans and colluvial
deposits found on valley margins. Examples of this environment include Mexico City,
Guatemala City, San Salvador, Managua and San José in Central America, the
Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, Bandung and Yogyakarta in Indonesia, Davao in the
Philippines and Sana’a in Yemen. In these mountainous areas, flat land is limited and
highly valuable, and is often densely populated. Restrictions on available land for
settlement will often result in groundwater abstraction for potable supplies in the basin
occurring within densely populated areas, with significant implications for water quality.
Furthermore, the concentration of population and the consequent high water demand can
result in groundwater abstraction exceeding the safe yield of the aquifer. Long-term
decline in groundwater levels and/or contamination of groundwater can result, as for
example in Mexico City (NRC, 1995), the Kathmandu Valley (Khadka, 1991) and the
Sana’a Valley (Alderwish and Dottridge, 1999).

Consolidated sedimentary aquifers
Important aquifers occur within consolidated sedimentary strata, principally sandstone
and limestone (Table 2.3). These can be broadly subdivided into younger, Tertiary
formations and older Mesozoic or Palaeozoic formations. Globally, although their
distribution is irregular, they are widespread and common being found both in mountain
belts such as the Alpine-Himalayan, Andean, Urals and North American cordilleras and
in lowlands and plateau areas such as northern Europe and central China.
    Sandstones have been formed when sandy marine or continental sediments were
buried and compacted to form consolidated rocks. The degree of consolidation generally
increases with depth and age of the rocks. Thus the younger, Tertiary sandstones usually
retain some degree of primary porosity between the sand grains and are typically of low
to moderate permeability. In the older, Mesozoic or Palaeozoic formations with more
strongly developed cementing of the grains, the primary porosity may have become
largely eliminated. Pre-Tertiary sandstones can range from friable to highly indurated
depending on the degree of cementation, and in the latter cases it is the secondary
porosity resulting from the development of fractures which can provide adequate
permeability and storage for such rocks to form productive aquifers.
    Limestones exhibiting solution enhancement of such fractures (called karst) are
widespread and can be prolific aquifers, although well yields are highly variable in time
and space. For instance, in northern China, karst limestones occupy an area of
800 000 km2, are typically 300-600 m thick and their groundwater resources have been
estimated at 12 800 million m3 yr-1. In southern China, karst limestones are even more
extensive where they cover an area of 1 400 000 km2, with groundwater resources
estimated at 190 000 million m3 yr-1. Similar, highly permeable limestones occur
throughout southern Europe, including along the coast of the Adriatic Sea region from
which the karst name derives, in the Middle East and in the USA.

Recent coastal calcareous formations
These formations form important local aquifers. Examples, which include Florida,
Jamaica, Cuba, Hispaniola and numerous other islands in the Caribbean, the Yucatan

peninsula of Mexico, the Cebu limestone of the Philippines, and the Jaffna limestone in
Sri Lanka, provide important sources of potable water for the people living there and for
irrigation. Their high to very high permeability derives not only from initially high
primary porosities (due to the sedimentary environment of deposition), but also from
fractures that have been enhanced by solution. This can produce rapid groundwater
movement with velocities frequently in excess of 100 m d-1. The high infiltration
capacity of these strata often precludes surface drainage systems and very often
groundwater is the only available source of water supply in these environments.
    These characteristics have important implications for protecting groundwater quality.
Soils can be very thin and water movement from the soil to the water table via fissures is
often so rapid that these formations are highly vulnerable to pollution. In addition, being
coastal, the aquifers are usually underlain by seawater, often at shallow depths. Excessive
abstraction of groundwater, with a consequent lowering of the water table, may induce
saline intrusion by lateral movement of the freshwater/seawater interface inland or local
upconing and contamination of the fresh groundwater body from below.

Glacial formations
Deposits of glacial and fluvioglacial origin comprise small but locally important aquifers
not only in temperate zones of the world but also at altitude in the mountain ranges of the
Andes and Himalayas. Ice-transported sediments are commonly unsorted mixtures of all
grain sizes from clay to boulders, typically have low permeabilities and act as aquitards
or aquicludes. Their geographical distribution is often limited, as they tend to occur in
regions of active erosion. In contrast, water-sorted sediments, laid down from glacial
melt-waters, include the sands and gravels of kames and eskers, which can form
restricted but highly productive aquifer systems. These can sometimes be more
extensive, as in the coalescing gravel outwash plains of North America, the eastern
Andes and the Himalayas/Pamir/Tienshan cordilleras, or quite narrow and sinuous, as in
the glacial channels of the North German Plain and the Great Lakes.
    The environment of deposition, from melt-water streams and the upper reaches of
braided rivers makes for highly variable lithology. As a result, multiple aquifers are
typical, comprising complex systems in which lenses of highly permeable sands and
gravels are partly separated vertically and laterally from each other by lower-
permeability fine sands, silts and clays. The resultant ‘patchy’ aquifer can be very
productive, but hydraulic continuity between different lenses means that mobile
persistent contaminants are able to penetrate to significant depths.
    In many glacial areas, the underlying bedrock consists of ancient, hard and
unweathered granites and gneisses, which are very unpromising as aquifers. In these
terrains, even the small sedimentary aquifers referred to above can provide vital but
potentially quite vulnerable water supplies to the small and scattered communities in
such regions. Sometimes these aquifers are used for urban supply, either directly by
means of boreholes, or as prefilters for high volume riverbank intakes via infiltration
galleries or collector wells. Examples include Cincinnati and Lincoln (USA), Berlin and
Düsseldorf (Germany), and Vilnius (Lithuania).

Loessic plateau deposits
Fine windblown deposits, called loess, form an important aquifer in China. Although
loess is found elsewhere, such as in Argentina and north of the Black Sea, thick deposits
are almost entirely restricted to north central China where they cover an area in excess of
600 000 km2. Of this, some 440 000 km2 is continuously covered with a thickness of
between 100 and 300 m. The loess covers a vast plateau at elevations of between 400
and 2 400 m above sea level. The loess plateau supports a population of 64 million and
7.3 million ha of cultivated land and is dependent on groundwater for domestic water and
irrigation in this semi-arid region. The distinctive geomorphological features and
geological characteristics produce a complex groundwater system. The loessic plateau
aquifers are frequently cut through by gullies and ravines, so that the plateaux form a
series of independent water circulation systems. The deposits are generally of low
permeability and the presence of palaeo-soils produces a layered aquifer; the deeper
zones being partly confined. The water table is often quite deep (30-50 m below surface).

Extensive volcanic terrains
One of the largest and most important areas of volcanic lava flows occurs in the central
and western parts of India, where the Deccan basalts cover more than 500 000 km2.
Other extensive volcanic terrains occur in North and Central America, Central and East
Africa, and many islands are entirely or predominantly of volcanic origin, such as
Hawaii, Iceland, the Canary Islands (Spain) and some of the Caribbean islands. Older
lavas such as the Deccan basalts can often be largely impermeable in the rock mass, but
younger basalts can provide very large springs. Individual lava flows can be up to 100 m
thick, and although the more massive flows are often impermeable, extensive jointing
allows water to infiltrate and move through them. The junctions between flows can form
highly productive aquifers, because of the cooling cracks and joints, and development of
rubble zones caused when the rough surface of the lava is covered by the chilled base of
the next flow, weathering and soil in the period of time between successive flows.
Extensive lava tubes may be formed where lava drains from beneath a cooled and
congealed surface. It is the combination of these features that make the Deccan basalts
and other such volcanic rocks important and locally productive aquifers. Other materials
are thrown out as volcanic clouds, which sometimes settle as ash deposits or become
welded tuffs. The mineralogy and chemistry of the volcanic rocks and their viscosity and
gas content determine the precise nature of the volcanic eruptions and resulting rocks.
Alternating sequences of ashes and lavas, in which the lavas act as conduits for
groundwater flow and the intervening ashes provide the storage, characterize the
important aquifer systems of Costa Rica, Nicaragua and El Salvador.

Weathered basement complex
These aquifers are found in ancient crystalline rocks of Precambrian or Lower Palaeozoic
age. In sub-Saharan Africa, such rocks cover 40 per cent of the total land area and some
220 million people live on them. Groundwater flow and storage occurs in restricted
fractures in the fresh bedrock, but usually more extensively in the superficial weathered
layers. The processes of weathering and disaggregation can enhance both porosity and
permeability (Chilton and Foster, 1995). Because these ancient rocks occupy stable,
            Groundwater occurrence and hydrogeological environments                  43

continental shield areas, there has been plenty of opportunity for prolonged periods of
weathering, and the zone of weathering tends to be better developed and thicker in
tropical regions where such processes are more active. As a result, the weathered zone
can be as much as 60 m thick, but more commonly in the range of 20 to 30 m.
Groundwater velocities in weathered and fractured bedrock aquifers can be very variable.
   Even with the beneficial effects of weathering, the volumes of water stored within
these aquifers are generally limited, hydraulic conductivities are low, borehole yields
modest and groundwater is used mostly for providing potable water supplies for rural
communities and small towns, and for small-scale supplementary irrigation. Larger cities
located on such formations, such as Kampala in Uganda, may find it difficult to abstract
the large quantities of water needed for urban supply and also to dispose of wastewater
on-site to the subsurface in a sanitary manner.

Pathogens: Health relevance,
transport and attenuation
S. Pedley, M. Yates, J.F. Schijven, J. West,

This chapter will summarize current knowledge about the distribution of pathogens in
groundwater and the factors that control their transport and attenuation. The aim is to
provide a level of information and interpretation that will allow public health specialists
and water resource managers to estimate risks to the groundwater from microbial
contaminants derived from sources described in Section II of this monograph, for
example, agricultural and urban sources.
   Many factors, some environmental and others linked to the properties of the
organism, control the survival and transport of microorganisms in the subsurface.
However, it is important to consider that often the factors perceived to be of importance
have been studied in isolation using controlled laboratory experiments and the
conclusions then extrapolated to predict the fate of pathogens in the environment. This
process is known as upscaling and is itself the subject of current research. In contrast,
very few studies have attempted to examine the effect of multiple factors interacting in
the natural environment. Current knowledge therefore offers a number of guiding
principles about the transport and attenuation of pathogens in groundwater, but the

complex interaction of factors controlling the fate of pathogens is poorly understood and
difficult to predict in some environments.


     DEF X          Microorganisms are microscopic organisms within the categories
                    algae, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses and subviral agents
                    (Singleton and Sainsbury, 1999).

                    Pathogens are any microorganisms which by direct interaction with
                    (infection of) another organism cause disease in that organism
                    (Singleton and Sainsbury, 1999). The strict definition of a pathogen
                    excludes those microorganisms that cause disease indirectly by the
                    synthesis of a toxin that may subsequently be ingested by the victim.
                    Several microorganisms implicated in food poisoning cause disease
                    in this way: Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus are
                    examples of this group. Nevertheless, these microorganisms can be
                    pathogens in the strict sense under different conditions.




3.1       MICROBIAL PATHOGENS AND MICROBIAL
          INDICATOR ORGANISMS
The ability of a pathogen to inflict damage upon the host is controlled by a combination
of factors, in particular the nature of the organism (for example its virulence) and the
susceptibility of the host. Several factors combine to determine the susceptibility of the
host, including age, nutritional status and immunity. Immunocompromised individuals,
for example, are highly susceptible to infection by pathogens, whereas well-nourished
young adults are typically less susceptible to infections.


     DEF X          Virulence is the capacity of a pathogen to cause disease, defined
                    broadly in terms of the severity of the symptoms. Infectivity is the
                    ability of a pathogen to become established on or within the tissue of
                    a host.


   Water can be the vehicle for the transmission of many different types of pathogenic
microorganism: some being natural aquatic organisms and some being introduced into
the water from an infected host. Overall, the pathogens in water that are the main concern
to public health originate in the faeces of humans and animals, and establish an infection
when contaminated water is consumed by a susceptible host (Boxes 3.1 and 3.2). These
are the classical waterborne pathogens (Table 3.1) that are transmitted by the faecal-oral
route of infection (Figure 3.1). Waterborne pathogens can be classified into four broad

order of increasing functional complexity the groups are viruses, bacteria, protozoa and
helminths. In general, the transmission of helminths in groundwater is unlikely, although
not impossible, due to the size of the organisms and their eggs. For this reason, and
because public health concerns surrounding waterborne disease transmitted through
groundwater have concentrated upon the other groups of microorganisms, helminths will
not be discussed in this chapter. Within the other groups a large number of microbial
pathogens are able to contaminate groundwater (Table 3.1).

      Box 3.1. Health impacts of contaminated groundwater in Walkerton, Canada
                               (based on Howard, 2001)
    In May 2000, 6 people died and over 2000 others became ill in the small town
    of Walkerton, Canada, as a result of consuming groundwater contaminated by
    E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter. Walkerton was almost entirely dependent
    upon groundwater for domestic supply obtained from production wells varying
    from 15 to >70 m deep. These wells intercept limestones and dolomites. There
    was a history of detection of E. coli in a number of the wells, but this problem
    was regarded as being something that could be controlled by routine
    chlorination of the source water.
    The first public health problems (diarrhoea, vomiting) were noted in the days
    following a particularly violent storm during which 100 mm of rain fell. Initially
    the problem was suspected as food poisoning and it was not until over a week
    later that well water was identified as the source and a boil-water alert was
    issued. E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter spp. were subsequently identified
    as the cause of the deaths. The source of the organisms was traced to a cattle
    farm close to one of the shallower production wells. It was initially suggested
    that storm water runoff conveyed the contaminants to the production wells.
    However, subsequent evidence indicates that the well contamination causing the
    outbreak had occurred before the storm event. The precise travel paths enabling
    the contaminants to enter the production wells (even the deepest of which was
    contaminated) remain a matter of speculation, although fissure flow in the
    limestone aquifer is an obvious candidate. It may be significant that there were
    abandoned production wells in the area that had not been properly sealed.
    Improperly abandoned boreholes may facilitate the rapid vertical mixing of
    contaminants entering at or near the surface.
    It is clear that the public health impact was a result of the combination of
    inadequate protection and monitoring of the groundwater resource with a failure
    in treatment. This is not uncommon, Bramham in the United Kingdom being a
    further example (Lerner and Barrett, 1996). Clearly reliance on treatment (as a
    ‘single barrier’ approach) without other measures such as adequate groundwater
    protection is a higher risk approach than that of the ‘multi barrier’.

   The types and numbers of the various pathogens will vary temporally and spatially
depending upon the incidence of disease in the community, the known seasonality of
human infections, and the characteristics of the aquifer systems. Furthermore, the
microbial illnesses and the severity of the disease vary markedly with the organism.

     NOTE X          Although some enteric pathogens may circulate within a population
                     all year round, many have a clearly defined seasonal distribution.
                     For example, in temperate zones, the transmission of rotavirus takes
                     place almost exclusively during cold weather.



          Box 3.2. Virus borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Wyoming, USA
     In February 2001, episodes of acute gastroenteritis were reported to the
     Wyoming Department of Health among snowmobilers (Anderson et al., 2003).
     The outbreak was believed to have been caused by noroviruses that could be
     identified from 8 of 13 stool samples as well as from groundwater samples of
     one well. A second outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred in Wyoming
     during October 2001 among persons who dined at a tourist saloon (Parshionikar
     et al., 2003). A norovirus strain (genogroup I, subtype 3) was found in stool
     samples from three ill persons as well as in the water from the saloon's only
     well.

   Although land use planning, water resource management, water treatment and
disinfection are used to control the transmission of waterborne pathogens, the safety of a
water source is frequently verified by testing for the presence of microbial parameters. A
variety of pathogens may be present, and the different methods that are required to isolate
each pathogen prohibit the direct examination of water samples for pathogens on a
routine basis. Moreover, pathogens may not be detected due to low levels, or the lack of
an appropriate detection method, but they may still be present at a density that represents
an unacceptable level of risk. Furthermore, currently unknown and therefore
undetectable pathogens may be present. To overcome this difficulty, a separate group of
microorganisms is used as an indicator for the potential presence of pathogens. The
common descriptive term for this group of organisms is faecal indicator organisms.
Gleeson and Gray (1997) have published a thorough review of the application of faecal
indicator organisms in water quality monitoring that may be consulted for further
information. This group comprises the following:
    • total coliform bacteria
    • thermotolerant coliform bacteria
    • E. coli
    • faecal streptococci
    • bacteriophage

   NOTE X               The coliform group of bacteria consists of several genera belonging
                        to the family Enterobacteriaceae (Gleeson and Gray, 1997). The
                        relatively limited number of biochemical and physiological
                        attributes used to define the group (including growth at 37°C)
                        means that its members include a heterogeneous mix of bacteria.
                        Although the total coliform group will include bacteria of faecal
                        origin it also includes species that are found in unpolluted
                        environments. Thermotolerant coliforms are those bacteria from
                        within the total coliform group that grow at 44°C. E. coli is a
                        thermotolerant coliform.

Figure 3.1. Principal elements of the faecal-oral route of disease transmission (Howard et al., 2002)

    An ideal microbial indicator of faecal pollution is easily detected, always present in
faecal waste, and is more durable in the environment than most enteric pathogens. It
should comprise a large percentage of the organisms in faecal waste, exceed the numbers
of most enteric pathogens and be roughly proportional to the degree of pollution. Lastly,
because indicator organisms should be absent unless faecal contamination is present,
they should ideally not be present in drinking-water that is microbially safe for
consumption. For many applications, 100 ml of water is used as the standard volume for
analysis.
    The durability of faecal indicator organisms in the subsurface is an important issue
that has a direct bearing on the interpretation of water quality data. Ideally the faecal
indicator organism should be removed from the environment at a slower rate than the
most durable pathogen so that its potential for dispersal is greater. In practice, this
situation will seldom arise. For the purpose of acting as surrogates for pathogens in
groundwater tracer studies, other advantageous properties are the ease of preparing high
numbers of the indicator and the ease of enumerating the indicator. These properties
allow indicators to be used as a tool to identify and quantify removal processes in
laboratory and field studies. The most important removal processes are inactivation or
die-off, adsorption to the surface of the grains of the porous medium and physical
filtration or straining when pore throats are too small to let a microorganism pass. Thus
               Pathogens: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                     55

robust indicators are inactivated, adsorbed and strained not more than the pathogens they
represent. The removal processes are described in more detail later in this chapter.
    It is acknowledged that faecal indicator bacteria do not give absolute resolution to the
presence/absence of pathogenic protozoa, bacteria and viruses. These diverse groups of
microorganisms have highly variable transport and attenuation characteristics that cannot
be wholly represented by the small group of indicator bacteria. However, the density of
faecal indicator bacteria does provide a measure of probability of the presence of
pathogens.
    Faecal indicator bacteria are of limited use for predicting the presence or absence of
viruses as viruses often survive significantly longer in groundwater systems. It is not
practical to sample and analyse for all pathogenic viruses. As a result bacteriophage –
viruses that infect bacteria – from faecal sources are often used to indicate the likely
presence or absence of viruses in groundwater. Several groups of bacteriophage have
been evaluated as indicator organisms although the focus of attention has been upon the
coliphage group of viruses because they can be detected and quantified using relatively
simple analytical methods.
    Negatively charged bacteriophages, like MS2 and PRD1, have been found to be
useful model viruses and have been used in many field and laboratory studies on
subsurface transport of viruses (Schijven and Hassanizadeh, 2000). They attach poorly to
most soils, and at low temperatures they inactivate at a low rate. PRD1 is relatively
insensitive to higher temperatures or extreme pH. These bacteriophages have the same
size and shape as many waterborne pathogenic viruses. They are easy to prepare in high
numbers and are easy to detect. MS2 is an F-specific RNA bacteriophage. This group of
bacteriophages may be naturally present in faecal contaminated water in numbers 102 to
104 times higher than enteroviruses (Havelaar et al., 1993). However, F-specific
bacteriophages are less stable (more temperature sensitive) than somatic coliphages. The
latter are usually found in higher number in faecally contaminated water and are
therefore also useful indicators.


3.2        DISTRIBUTION OF PATHOGENS AND FAECAL
           INDICATORS IN GROUNDWATER
Sources of faecal contamination in groundwater are discussed in Section II and
potentially include leakage from on-site sanitation systems or sewers (Box 3.3), animal
manures (Box 3.1), wastewater or sewage sludge applied in agriculture. The sources can
be classified according to their origin. A point source has an identifiable source, such as a
leaking septic tank, which may result in a well-defined plume. More difficult to control,
and posing a greater risk to groundwater quality, are non-point sources. Non-point
sources are larger in scale and produce relatively diffuse pollution originating from either
widespread application of contaminated material or many smaller sources. The aggregate
of point sources in a leaking sewerage system may, overall, represent a non-point source
of contamination to groundwater (usually described as multi-point source of pollution).
    Traditionally, hydrogeologists, and many public health scientists, have regarded
groundwater as a relatively microbially safe source of drinking-water. Unlike surface
waters, which are vulnerable to direct contamination from many sources, groundwater is
56                            Protecting Groundwater for Health

often shielded from the immediate influence of contamination by the overlying soil and
unsaturated zones as described in Chapter 2. In these zones, pathogenic microorganisms
have been assumed to be attenuated by the prevailing physical, chemical and biological
conditions in the environment. The risk of pathogens being transported into groundwater
and producing a threat to public health was, therefore, considered to be low.
Consequently, many groundwater sources are used for public supply with a minimum
level of treatment, normally chlorination, or with no treatment at all.
   The underlying rationale for restricted dispersion in the subsurface has some merit,
but it is now known that microbial contamination of groundwater is more widespread
than previously believed. Indeed, as was found with chemical contaminant studies,
particularly in the 1980s, the more that it is looked for, the more it can be found. Tables
3.2 and 3.3 list some examples of studies that have demonstrated the occurrence of faecal
indicators and enteroviruses in groundwater. Although there may be a bias in some of the
studies, created by the deliberate selection of vulnerable sites, the data show that a
significant percentage, up to 70 per cent in some regions, of groundwater sources contain
one or more of the microbial indicators of faecal contamination.

   Table 3.3 shows the occurrence of pathogenic enteroviruses found in public water
supply wells in the USA as defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act (US Government,
1996). Hydrogeological data from these studies were available on aquifer type as part of
the study designs and were reviewed for accuracy by hydrogeologists. Limestone (karst),
fractured bedrock (igneous and metamorphic rocks) and gravel (formed in high energy
depositional environments with little or no sand or other fine grained materials) aquifers
are defined as sensitive aquifers under the proposed Ground Water Rule (US EPA,
                    Pathogens: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                       57

2000). If a public water supply well draws water from a sensitive aquifer, then the State
must find the well sensitive to faecal contamination unless a hydrogeological barrier
protects it. A hydrogeological barrier is defined as the physical, biological and chemical
factors, singly or in combination, that protect a well from pathogenic organisms. In this
proposal, a confining layer is one example of a hydrogeological barrier. If a
hydrogeological barrier is present, then the State can nullify the determination that a
system is located in a sensitive aquifer. If no suitable hydrogeological barrier exists, then
the proposed Ground Water Rule requires the system to conduct faecal indicator source
water monitoring.

d = positive by Rototest assay of RD cell lysate.

    Lindsey et al. (2002) found enteric viruses in three sensitive aquifers and two that
were not sensitive. In Tables 3.2 and 3.3, the data of Lieberman et al. (2002) are most
meaningful because 12 samples were taken at monthly intervals from each well from 30
sites in the continental USA, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. In addition, the sample
volumes used in these studies were significantly larger than routine volumes: average
58                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

6000 litres, and maximum even up to 15 000 litres. This significantly increases the
probability of detecting virus contamination of a well. Lieberman et al. (2002) found
enteric viruses primarily in sensitive aquifers (i.e. karst, fractured bedrock and coarse
gravel) but only once in a very shallow sand well (5 m deep; see also Dahling, 2002).
One reason that as many as 7 of the 30 wells (24 per cent) were contaminated with
enterovirus is because almost all wells were selected for enterovirus sampling only if
they had a history of total coliform and somatic coliphage occurrence (see Table 3.2).
Echovirus 11 was possibly coming from upgradient septic tanks. Viruses found in the
karst wells must have travelled a long distance because no potential sources of
contamination were near. One of the wells was located in a populated gravel flood plain
with a nearby trailer park with septic tanks about 30 m away. In this well water,
coxsackieviruses A7, B1 and B4, echoviruses 15, 18, 21 and 24 and reovirus were
detected. Coxsackievirus B4 was also found in the water from a well in fractured basalt
with septic tanks nearby.
    Borchardt et al. (2003) studied the incidence of viruses in Wisconsin, USA private
household wells located near seepage land application sites or in rural subdivisions
served by septic systems. Fifty wells in seven hydrogeological areas were sampled four
times over a year, once each season. Of the 50 wells, 4 (8 per cent) were found to be
positive for viruses using analytical methods that detect the presence of the viral nucleic
acid (reverse transcription PCR). Of these, three wells were positive for hepatitis A virus
and the fourth well was positive for rotavirus and norovirus in one sample and for
enterovirus in another sample. Culturable enteroviruses were not detected in any of the
wells. Virus occurrence could not be associated statistically with faecal indicators (i.e.
total coliforms, E. coli, faecal enterococci, F-specific RNA bacteriophages).
    Clearly, the common perception that groundwater is per se a microbially safe source
of drinking-water is inaccurate. Whilst usually the microbial contamination of
groundwater is likely to be orders of magnitude lower than that of surface waters, it is
now apparent that a significant percentage of groundwater sources are contaminated by
microorganisms derived from faeces. As shown above, the known presence of infectious
pathogenic viruses in some wells, for example, represents an unequivocal message that
viruses are mobile in the subsurface, long-lived and capable of causing waterborne
illness.
    In the same way that surface waters may show rapid changes in the concentration of
pathogens, distribution and concentration of pathogens and faecal indicator bacteria in
groundwater sources is not static but also demonstrates fluctuation. Temporal and spatial
variations are frequently observed that may be linked to seasonal changes in land use and
changing weather patterns. For example, fluctuations in the levels of thermotolerant
coliforms have been observed in proximity to wastewater irrigation sites in Mexico and
in the United Kingdom. The distribution of enteric bacteria and viruses in urban
groundwater has been observed to vary both horizontally and vertically (Box 3.3).

    Box 3.3. Depth and extent of microbial contamination of groundwater in British
        urban sandstone aquifers (based on Powell et al., 2000; 2001a; 2001b)
    There are few published data on the microbial, and particularly viral, quality of
    United Kingdom groundwaters. This should not be taken as an indication of a
    general absence of contamination, rather as a lack of detailed monitoring
    studies. A number of workers have identified sewage contamination of the
    Triassic Sandstone aquifers in urban areas of the United Kingdom, derived from
    leaking sewers.
    Powell and co-workers set out to determine the extent and penetration of
    microbial contaminants in the Triassic Sandstone aquifer underlying
    Birmingham and Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Five multilevel
    groundwater monitoring devices were installed into the aquifer, providing a total
    of some 50 depth-specific sampling points. Viral monitoring was undertaken
    using a glass wool trap for the concentration of enteric viruses from large
    volume groundwater samples.
    The field data lead to four key findings:
    - Sewer leakage-derived microbial contaminants are able to penetrate
      sandstone aquifers to significant depths (>90 m).
    - Human enteric viruses, including pathogenic species are widespread in the
      aquifer.
    - The species of sewage-derived human enteric viruses in groundwater are
      found to vary temporally, and in parallel with their predicted prevalence in
      the population. The dominant types found in March and June 2001 were
      Noroviruses and Coxsackievirus B4 respectively.
    - Particular horizons at depth within the sandstone aquifer were found to be
      rapidly susceptible to microbial contamination (i.e. contaminant distribution
      is vertically and temporally heterogeneous).
    - The Triassic Sandstone aquifer (and, by implication, other similar sandstone
        aquifers around the world), the second most important in the United
        Kingdom, is far more vulnerable to microbal contamination than previously
        assumed. This has public health implications where groundwater is
        consumed without adequate treatment.

   Frequently, the microbial quality of shallow groundwater sources, including springs,
will deteriorate after heavy rainfall as surface contamination is washed into the source
directly and organisms in the unsaturated zone are mobilized by water percolating
through the soil matrix (Box 3.1). Similarly, the relative proportions of indicator bacteria
and pathogens, and of bacteria and viruses, will fluctuate such that the dominant species
isolated at one time may be absent on subsequent sampling occasions (Box 3.4).

       Box 3.4. Temporal fluctuations in microbial contamination of groundwater in
                    Kampala, Uganda (based on Barrett et al., 2000)
      Sampling of 15 protected springs was undertaken in areas of high-density and
      low-density population (peri-urban) in Kampala, Uganda on three successive
      days (28-30 September 1999). The wet season was in progress, and rainfall
      occurred on every day of sampling. On the night of 28-29 September, a
      significantly heavier rainfall event took place. Analysis of the samples for faecal
      indicators, including thermotolerant coliforms and faecal streptococci, was
      undertaken. As shown by Figure 3.2, there was a clear pulse reaction of
      contamination in spring water within 12 hours of the major rainfall event.
      A variety of metasedimentary rocks (e.g. quartzites and phyllites) underlie
      Kampala. Differential weathering has resulted in a pronounced topography with
      thin weathered mantles of limited extent containing shallow (2-20 m)
      groundwater flow systems that discharge to valley springs. These are fed by a
      combination of baseflow and seasonally derived interflow. Many of these
      springs are used, untreated, by lower income communities with limited access to
      higher service levels of piped water supply. Clearly the monitoring of protected
      springs for microbial contaminants in these localized groundwater flow systems
      must be interpreted in the context of rainfall events.

                                                  MICROORGANISMS IN THE UNDERGROUND
Some, perhaps many, instances of groundwater receptor contamination will occur by
rapid transport pathways accidentally introduced by human intervention and connecting
the contamination source to the groundwater abstraction point. Such pathways could
               Pathogens: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   61

include inadequate sanitary completion of springs, wells and boreholes, the presence of a
forgotten conduit connecting the source of contamination to the groundwater abstraction
point, or voids and fractures in soils that allow direct ingress of contaminated materials.
The implementation of management actions to reduce faecal contamination close to the
abstraction point or the rehabilitation or improvement of the well or spring is usually
sufficient to control access of pathogens to the water source (Section IV).
   Rapid transport pathways cannot, however, explain all groundwater source
contamination events and it is now widely accepted that the transport of microbial
pathogens within groundwater systems is a significant mechanism for waterborne
disease transmission. The remainder of this chapter deals with the factors that control the
transport and attenuation of pathogens into and through groundwater.

3.3.1     Transport and attenuation of pathogens in the unsaturated
          zone
Hydrogeological processes in the unsaturated zone are complex and the behaviour of
microorganisms is often difficult to predict. Nevertheless, the unsaturated zone can play
an important role in retarding (and in some cases eliminating) pathogens and so must be
considered when assessing aquifer vulnerability, as described in Chapter 8. Attenuation
of pathogens is generally most effective in the uppermost soil layers where biological
activity is greatest. The presence of protozoa and other predatory organisms, the rapid
changes in soil moisture and temperature, competition from the established microbial
community, and the effect of sunlight at the surface combine to reduce the level of
pathogens within this zone. The effect of individual environmental factors will be
discussed in a later section of this chapter.
    The transport of pathogens from the surface into the subsurface requires the presence
of moisture. Even during relatively dry periods, soil particles retain sufficient moisture
over their surface for pathogens to migrate downwards into the subsurface. Under these
conditions the main driving forces will be sedimentation, diffusion and bacterial motility.
Within the thin film of moisture the organisms are brought into close contact with the
surface of the particle, thus increasing the opportunity for adsorption to the particle
surface and further retarding movement. If soil moisture decreases, the strength of the
association between the organism and the particle surface will increase to a point where
the organism is bound irreversibly to the surface. Passive binding to particle surfaces has
been observed with some strains of virus, and it is believed that the strength of the bond
can immobilize the virus and contain it at the point of interaction. It is possible that
similar interactions occur with other groups of pathogens, but the processes are less well
defined. Bacteria, for instance, synthesize extracellular substances that can enhance their
attachment to surfaces and promote binding, suggesting that the process involves both
passive and active processes. Whether alone, or in combination with the apparently
protective effect of adsorption onto surfaces, soil moisture influences the persistence of
microorganisms, in particular viruses. In laboratory experiments a soil moisture content
of between 10 and 15 per cent was shown to be optimal for the survival of several strains
of enteric virus (e.g. Bagdasaryan, 1964; Hurst et al., 1980a; 1980b).
62                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    By contrast, an increase in the moisture content of the unsaturated zone may increase
the vulnerability of the aquifer to pathogen contamination in two ways: by providing
rapid transport pathways and by mobilizing adsorbed organisms. During periods of high
recharge, for example during prolonged heavy rain, the intergranular spaces in the
unsaturated zone become waterlogged and provide a hydraulic pathway for the rapid
transport of pathogens. Where these intergranular spaces expand into fissures the
downward migration of pathogens can be extremely rapid. For example, particles
ranging in diameter from 0.1-6.0 µm have been found to move through 20 m of
unsaturated chalk in less than 3 days by passage through horizontal and vertical fissures
(Lawrence et al., 1996). Moreover, the rapid movement of pathogens through fissures
limits the potential for attenuation by adsorption to surfaces in the soil matrix.
    In the interval between recharge events, the chemistry of the water in the unsaturated
zone will change as it equilibrates with the soil matrix. In some soil types, these changes
may favour the adsorption of microorganisms to surfaces in the soil matrix. A lowering
in the ionic strength or salt content of the surrounding medium, which can occur during a
rainfall event, may be sufficient to cause desorption of the organism allowing further
migration into the soil. This phenomenon has been observed in laboratory experiments
and there is evidence to suggest that it can occur in the field. Furthermore, some workers
have noted that the virus particles that have desorbed from the soil surface have a
reduced capacity to resorb when the environmental conditions become favourable. The
implication of this observation is that virus particles that have been mobilized in the
subsurface are unaffected by one of the principal methods of attenuation and are likely,
therefore, to be dispersed over a much wider area than would be anticipated.
    The size variability of microorganisms (Table 3.4) can, to an extent, control their
mobility in the subsurface. Soil and rock pore sizes are also variable and the two ranges
are known to overlap (Figure 3.3). Thus in soils that are composed of fine grain particles,
typically clayey-silts, the pore space is sufficiently small (<4 µm) to physically prevent
the passage of bacterial and protozoal pathogens into the subsurface. This removal
process is called physical filtration or straining. Straining has been identified as the
principal mechanism for controlling the migration of Giardia and Cryptosporidium
species (Cryptosporidium oocysts: 4-6 µm; Giardia cysts: 7-14 µm) through these soil
types; indeed, experience has shown that up to 99 per cent of Cryptosporidium oocysts
are retained in the upper layers of the soil. However, the isolation of Cryptosporidium
and Giardia from a small but significant number of groundwater sources in the USA
(Hancock et al., 1998) and the United Kingdom indicates that the protective effect of the
soil layer is frequently evaded, probably by migration through preferential pathways or
bypassing; for example, from sewers that are often located below the soil zone.
    Several studies demonstrate a considerable degree of variability between the
inactivation or die-off rates of different groups of pathogens, and between inactivation
rates of the same organism in different environments. However, as a general rule, enteric
viruses persist longer in soils than bacteria. Among the enteric viruses, hepatitis A virus
appears to be the most resistant to inactivation in soil (Sobsey et al., 1986) and, in
laboratory experiments, shows a lower capacity for adsorption to particle surfaces. The
oocysts of Cryptosporidium are highly resistant to environmental stress and it has been
estimated that they could be detected after 12 months in soil.

    Some of the factors that contribute to reduced inactivation rates in the unsaturated
zone are known (lower temperatures, increased moisture, pH, reduced exposure to
sunlight, organic matter and the nature of the pathogen) but the relative contribution of
each factor at any field site is difficult to predict, and may be site specific. In these
circumstances, the tendency of hydrogeologists and public health microbiologists is to
construct general risk assessment models based upon laboratory and field experience. At
their most sophisticated, the models comprise computer simulations of pathogen
transport (for example Yates and Yates, 1988), but also used are simple tables and
diagrams linking risk to the main observable features of the environment. One such
model has been constructed by Romero (1972); a second has been developed to
accompany guidelines for assessing the risk to groundwater from on-site sanitation
(ARGOSS, 2001). However, the problem with such an approach is that only a qualitative
indication for risk levels is given without any definition of what is meant by a high or
low risk level. The actual useful information from this approach is a rough indication of a
64                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

relative probability for pathogenic microorganisms to reach groundwater. Table 3.5
shows the different classes of lithology that were defined in decreasing order of ability to
limit transport of microorganisms.
Table 3.5. Limitation of the transport of microorganisms by the lithology of the unsaturated zone in
decreasing order (top to bottom) (based on ARGOSS, 2001)

Lithology of the unsaturated zone

Fine sand, silt and clay
Weathered basement (soft not consolidated)
Medium clean sand
Coarse sand and gravels
Consolidated rock

   Shallow groundwater (<5 m) is assumed to be at the highest probability of
contamination irrespective of the lithology of the unsaturated zone. As the depth to the
water table increases so the capacity of the unsaturated zone to attenuate microorganisms
will also increase, although this will depend upon the composition and structure of the
unsaturated zone. For example, fine silts and clays will strongly adsorb bacteria and
viruses and also effectively filter out the larger pathogenic microorganisms. Thus the
probability of reaching groundwater at greater than five m depth is very low. By contrast,
fracture flow through consolidated rock creates a relatively high probability of reaching
groundwater even at depths of over 10 m.
   In summary, maximizing the residence times in the unsaturated zone has been
proposed as the key mechanism for eliminating bacteria and viruses (Lewis et al., 1982)
and, in general, this principle is robust. However, there are exceptions, for example:
    • The variability in the nature and thickness of the unsaturated zone overlying
         aquifers means that the residence times may not always be adequate to attenuate
         all pathogens. In particular, during periods of high recharge, an aquifer may be
         vulnerable to contamination by pathogens that are transported rapidly through
         the waterlogged intergranular spaces in the unsaturated zone.
    • Where the flow is intergranular within the unsaturated zone there is greater
         potential for contact with the soil/rock particles and hence greater potential for
         retention, both sorptive and filtering. However, if excessive loading takes place
         the filtering effect may lead to a blocking of the pores. The resulting reduction in
         hydraulic conductivity may reduce the effectiveness of the unsaturated zone to
         retard contaminants if the clogging forces recharge water into vertical fissures
         where rapid downward movement can occur.
    • The structure of the unsaturated zone is seldom uniform and fissures may exist
         permanently or develop in any environment when the unsaturated zone dries
         out. The presence of fissures will always increase the vulnerability of the
         groundwater to contamination from the surface, and it should be considered that
         although the soil conditions may facilitate the adsorption and attenuation of
         pathogens, the existence of bypass channels may offset the protective effect of
         the soil.

3.3.2      Transport and attenuation of pathogens in the saturated
           zone
On reaching the saturated zone, microbial contaminants are subject to the same processes
of attenuation that are described in Section 3.3.1 but under conditions of natural or
artificially induced flow. Thus die-off, adsorption, filtration, predation and dilution all
contribute to the attenuation of pathogens in the saturated zone. Due to the heterogeneous
nature of aquifer material there may be large variations in hydraulic conductivity and this
can significantly influence the movement of microorganisms in the aquifer.
Microorganisms are transported in groundwater by advection, dispersion and diffusion,
which are defined in Chapter 4. The result is a migration and spreading of the
contaminant concentration in space and time. This may result in contamination of
increasingly large aquifer volumes as the pollutant moves downgradient. Although the
transport of pathogens in some aquifer types can be both rapid and extensive, there are
several factors that may attenuate pathogens in groundwater (Table 3.6).

    From the perspective of groundwater management and the estimation of pathogens at
the point of abstraction (receptor), highly fractured and karstic aquifers represent a
particular problem. As discussed in Chapter 2, groundwater flow through fractured
systems may be very rapid, and the potential for microorganisms to be attenuated by
interaction with the aquifer matrix is much reduced, although not entirely absent.
Consequently, the inactivation rate of the pathogen and the groundwater flow rate will
primarily control dispersal in these aquifer systems. Three referenced studies will help to
illustrate the potential for rapid pathogen transport in highly fractured aquifers:
     • The migration of bacteriophage in a chalk aquifer in the south of England was
          investigated by Skilton and Wheeler (1988, 1989). They injected three strains of
          bacteriophage into piezometers that intersected the water table and then
          collected samples at different sites downgradient to determine the extent of
          movement. Very high velocities were observed at one site due to the fact that the
          majority of the water flow is through fissures, fractures, solution openings and
          cavities. All three phage types were detected 355 m from the injection site
          approximately 5 hours after introduction. It is noteworthy that viable phage were
66                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

          still being recovered more than 150 days after they were injected into the
          aquifer.
     • Mahler et al. (2000) cite the work of Batsch and colleagues who reported the
          detection of injected bacteria 14 km from the injection site, having been
          transported at a velocity of about 250 m/h. Mahler’s own studies (Mahler et al.,
          2000) in a karstic aquifer located in the South of France have confirmed the very
          rapid transport of faecal indicator bacteria in these systems.
     • Lee (1993) investigated the contamination of a water supply well by Giardia
          spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. in a karstic environment. The karstic nature of
          the study area provided the potential for rapid infiltration of surface waters to the
          water table and subsequent transport of the organisms to the well through
          fractures and fissures. This connection was confirmed by the study. An analysis
          of particle size revealed that the full range of particle sizes found in the surface
          waters was not present in the well; there was a cut-off at both high and low
          ranges. The author concluded that there had been adsorption of smaller particles
          and straining of larger ones. The size range of the particles that were transported
          through the system included Giardia and Cryptosporidium.
    These observations have significant implications for the public health risk associated
with water abstracted from highly fractured and karstic aquifers. Not only can viral,
bacterial and protozoan pathogens be transported rapidly over great distances, but also
the groundwater flow pattern between the source and receptor can be very difficult to
predict due to the many interconnected fractures in the aquifer. It is possible that well
designed tracer studies and groundwater flow models can help to define the potential
limits of pathogen dispersion in a highly fractured aquifer; however, with the current
uncertainties surrounding pathogen attenuation in groundwater it is prudent to assume
that where these aquifer types are exposed to sources of pathogens they are at high risk of
contamination over a wide area.
    In other aquifer types, the radius of migration from the source of contamination is
normally restricted to several tens of meters, or a few hundred meters, depending upon
the type of aquifer system and the properties of the organism (Table 3.6). Where the
groundwater flow rate is low through unconsolidated sediments the dispersal of
pathogens will naturally be limited and, in addition, this type of system offers greater
opportunity for the pathogen to interact with the aquifer matrix. Adsorption and physical
filtration may then be the major factors controlling pathogen transport.
    Despite acting to limit the dispersal of pathogens in the aquifer, interaction with the
aquifer matrix may also enhance the survival of the pathogens in the environment. In
several cases, adsorption to surfaces in the aquifer (sediment particles and colloids, as
well as the aquifer matrix) has been shown to reduce the inactivation rate of both viruses
and bacteria. Consequently, although the risk of contamination is contained close to the
source, the persistence of pathogens within the zone of contamination may be increased
beyond what is predicted from measurements of inactivation in the groundwater.
    Schijven and Hassanizadeh (2000) showed that removal of virus in the subsurface
often appears to be higher near the source than further away from the source, e.g. within
the first 8 m of aquifer passage spores of Clostridium bifermentans R5 and bacteriophage
MS2 were reduced by 5 log10 and 6 log10 respectively, while in the following 30 m MS2
concentrations were reduced only by 2 log10 and reduction of spore concentrations was

negligible. This may be explained by favourable attachment sites that are present in the
first meters of transport but rapidly decrease with travel distance or travel time in an
exponential fashion, like sites formed by ferric oxyhydroxides. Obviously, predictions of
virus removal over larger travel times or distances can be severely overestimated if they
are based on removal data from column or field experiments where transport was studied
over short times and distances.
    Inactivation rates of bacteria and viruses in groundwater vary considerably, not only
between the bacteria and virus groups, but also between different strains within each
group and between the results of different investigations. Table 3.7 lists inactivation rate
coefficients of pathogenic viruses, bacteriophages and bacteria in groundwater. These
data are ordered according to microorganism and then according to temperature. Usually
inactivation proceeds faster at higher temperatures, although this is highly dependent on
the type of microorganism.
    Often, inactivation of microorganisms can be described well as a first order rate
process, especially under relatively mild conditions like temperatures from 5-20 °C and
pH values from 6-8. Under more extreme conditions, the rate of inactivation of, for
example viruses is often found to proceed initially at a higher rate followed by a lower
rate as if two or more sub-populations exist that differ in stability (see e.g. Hurst et al.,
1992). The data given in Table 3.7 are based on the observation, or in some cases
assumption, that inactivation or die-off proceeded as a first order process:

                       C                         C         µ
C t = C 0 e − µt or ln t      = − µt or log10  t  = −     t               (Eqn. 3.1)
                        C0                        C0      2.3

where Ct is the remaining concentration of microorganisms after time t, C0 is the initial
concentration at t=0 and µ is the inactivation rate coefficient (T-1). As a means of
interpretation, µ is often divided by a factor of 2.3 (equal to the natural logarithm of 10).
The inactivation rate coefficient then reflects the number of log10 units per time unit; e.g.
a virus decreases in number by 2 log10 (equal to a factor of 100) every 10 days.
    From Table 3.7 it can be seen that at common groundwater temperatures of 10-12 °C
inactivation rate coefficients for coxsackieviruses B, echoviruses 7, poliovirus 1, hepatitis
A virus, but also of bacteriophages φX174, MS2 and PRD1 are in the range from 0.01 to
0.04 day-1. This corresponds to a decline in number or concentration of 1 log10 (equal to a
factor of 10) every 57 to 230 days. Some studies report an inactivation rate coefficient of
zero (e.g. Nasser et al., 1993). This is to be interpreted as no significant inactivation
within the time-scale and accuracy of the experiment and is therefore not included in
Table 3.7. Given the variation in inactivation rate between microorganisms, inactivation
rate coefficients of the more stable microorganisms need to be considered for estimating
adequate protection of groundwater wells or removal efficiency of passing
microorganisms through soil as a means of treatment.
    The data in Table 3.7 make clear that bacterial die-off is both highly dependent on the
type of microorganism as well as on temperature. In many cases bacterial inactivation
proceeds faster than that of viruses, implying therefore that viruses are more critical for
groundwater protection than bacteria.

70                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    The low inactivation rate of Klebsiella spp. in groundwater provides an interesting
contrast to the other genera of enteric bacteria. Klebsiella is an important member of the
Enterobacteriaceae, which are commonly, though inaccurately, referred to as ‘coliform
bacteria’. Some species of Klebsiella are able to grow at 44 ºC, which further defines
them as thermotolerant (formerly faecal) coliforms, the group that contains E. coli.
Although Klebsiella are found in the bowel and respiratory tract of humans and animals,
they can be isolated also from environmental samples. The persistence of Klebsiella in
the survival experiments may therefore reflect the ability of these organisms to exist in
two very distinct environments.
    One problem associated with the detection of pathogenic bacteria is that they may
become dormant in the environment (Schijven et al., 2002a). In this state, they are viable
but non-culturable, which means that the organisms show metabolizing activity even
though they cannot be grown on traditional media (Olson, 1993). As an important
example, in water the pathogen E. coli O157:H7 appears to be able to enter a viable but
non-culturable state (Wang and Doyle, 1998). The dormant state prolongs the pathogen
survival, and if its pathogenicity is unaltered, this increases the likelihood of a host
infection and illness
    Some bacteria like Clostridium and Bacillus species can survive for extended periods
of time by producing spores. Clostridium spores are especially robust in that their
inactivation rate may be considered to be negligible. This property makes it difficult to
interpret their removal, e.g. in sand filters or river bank filtration. In column studies by
Schijven et al. (2003) it was shown that most of the spores of Cl. perfringens attach to
the grains of sand, however followed by slow detachment, i.e. adsorption was apparently
reversible for a large fraction of spores. It was shown that the removal is dependant on
the number of spores that accumulate in the porous medium.
    At the time of writing, no data are available on inactivation of oocysts of
Cryptosporidium in groundwater. Cryptosporidium oocyst in vitro viability has been
measured repeatedly using a surface water matrix and in vitro excystation and/or dye
exclusion assay. For example, Heisz et al. (1997) report 0.12 day-1 (30 °C), and Medema
et al. (1997) found inactivation rates of 0.023-0.056 day-1 (5-15 °C) in river water and no
differences in inactivation rates between 5 °C and 15 °C. From the data of Robertson et
al. (1992) and Chauret et al. (1995), inactivation rates of 0.0051 to 0.0062 day-1 can be
calculated. Chauret et al. (1995) further found that inactivation rate was independent of
water temperature up to 20 °C.
    Based on their small size and longevity in the environment viruses have the highest
potential to be transported to, and within, groundwater, and thus they have been the focus
of the majority of studies. As a consequence, the discussion in the following chapter has
a greater emphasis toward the factors that influence the transport and survival of viruses
in the subsurface. From the data that is available, the same factors appear to affect the
survival of bacteria; however, some bacteria are able to utilize specific physiological
responses to resist environmental stress that are not available to viruses. These responses
will be discussed separately at the end of the chapter.

3.3.3      Summary of major factors influencing pathogen transport
           and attenuation mechanisms in the underground
The mechanisms by which microbial contaminants may undergo transport and
attenuation in the saturated and unsaturated zones have been described in Sections 3.3.1
and 3.3.2. There now follows a description of the factors that control the degree of the
impact of these mechanisms. The potential for pathogens in manures, faeces and
wastewater to contaminate the underlying groundwater is dependent on a number of
factors including the physical characteristics of the site (e.g. soil texture), the hydraulic
conditions (e.g. wastewater or manure application rates, wetting/drying cycles), the
environmental conditions (e.g. rainfall, temperature) at the site and the characteristics of
the specific pathogens present in the water. The factors that influence the transport and
attenuation of pathogens in the subsurface have been the subject of a number of reviews
summarized in Table 3.8 (Vaughn et al., 1983; Yates et al., 1985; Yates and Yates, 1988;
Bitton and Harvey, 1992; Robertson and Edberg, 1997; Schijven and Hassanizadeh,
2000). Some of the major factors influencing pathogen transport and attenuation are
described in more detail below.

Temperature
Temperature is probably the most important factor influencing the inactivation of
bacteria and viruses in the environment. Laboratory studies have demonstrated a
negative correlation between water temperature and the survival of coliform bacteria and
enteric viruses, although the magnitude of the effect varies between different strains.
Roughly, the inactivation rate of viruses may be one order in magnitude higher at 25 °C
than at 5 °C (Table 3.7). Similarly this may be the case for enteric bacteria, such as E.
coli. The influence of temperature on the migration of bacteria and viruses is currently
unknown.

Microbial activity
There are several conflicting reports regarding the influence of indigenous populations of
microorganisms on the survival of enteric bacteria and viruses, ranging from increasing
the rate of inactivation through to having no effect to decreasing the rate of inactivation.
Overall, however, the main finding of laboratory studies is that microbial activity in the
soil and groundwater increases the inactivation rate of enteric bacteria and viruses.
Evaluating the role of microbial activity normally involves a comparison of inactivation
rates in sterile and non-sterile environments. Depending on the environmental conditions
and the experimental design, virus inactivation is either unaffected, or accelerated in the
presence of indigenous bacteria. Hurst et al. (1980a) showed that the inactivation rate of
two strains of enterovirus was more rapid in non-sterile, aerobic environments than in
sterile environments. By contrast, Matthess et al. (1988) found no significant difference
between the inactivation rates of several viruses in sterile and non-sterile groundwater.
Studies with thermotolerant coliforms as a whole, and E. coli in particular, have shown
that the concentration of the test organism can increase rapidly in sterile environments,
but remains static, or is reduced in non-sterile environments (Gerba and McLeod, 1976).

Soil moisture content
Although some investigators have observed no difference between the inactivation rates
of viruses in dried and saturated soils (Lefler and Kott, 1974) the majority of reports have
shown that soil moisture content influences the survival of viruses in the subsurface. For
example, Hurst et al. (1980a) found that moisture content affected the survival of
poliovirus in loamy sand. The inactivation rate of poliovirus decreased as the moisture
content increased from 5 to 15 per cent. However, further increases in soil moisture
content increased the inactivation rate of the virus. It was noted that the inactivation rate
peaked near the saturation moisture content of the soil (15-25 per cent), and was slowest
at the lowest moisture contents (5-15 per cent). Soil moisture has been reported to
influence the fate of bacterial contaminants (Robertson and Edberg, 1997), but the
magnitude of the effect, and the value of any correlation has not been described.

pH
The effect of pH on the survival of pathogens in the environment has not been studied
extensively and the impact can only be inferred from laboratory investigations of the
physiological characteristics of the bacteria and the effect on the structural integrity of
viruses. In general, every species of bacteria has a narrow pH range that is optimum for
growth. Depending on the normal environment of the organism, the pH requirements can
range from highly acidic to highly alkaline: for many human pathogenic bacteria the
optimum pH is close to neutral. Despite having a preference for a narrow pH range, most
species of bacteria can tolerate a short exposure to a much broader range of pH. Outside
these limits, the organisms are rapidly killed. It is likely that pH affects the survival of
viruses by altering the structure of the capsid proteins and viral nucleic acid.
   Some authors have suggested that pH indirectly influences pathogen survival by
controlling adsorption to soil particles and the aquifer matrix. It is the adsorption to
surfaces that ultimately reduces the inactivation rate of the pathogens. Generally, bacteria
74                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

and viruses have negative surface charges generated by the level of ionization of the
carboxyl and amine groups that are a major component of surface proteins. As the pH of
the medium changes, the ionization of the two groups will change, causing a shift in the
net strength and polarity of the surface charge. At a specific pH, which is determined by
the molecular structure of the protein, the net charge will be zero; this is termed the
isoelectric point of the molecule. The isoelectric point has been determined for many
different proteins and for a number of virus strains. At pH values below the isoelectric
point a virus will have a net positive charge, whereas the charge will be negative at pH
values above the isoelectric point.
    Within the pH range of most unpolluted groundwater both the matrix surfaces and the
surfaces of the microorganisms carry a net negative charge. Under these conditions the
microorganisms will be repelled by most mineral grain surfaces. At low pH values the
surface charge on the microorganisms will shift to being net positive, which will favour
their adsorption to soils and the aquifer matrix by electrostatic attraction. This hypothesis
has been confirmed by several groups of workers for both bacteria and viruses (Sobsey,
1983; Gerba and Bitton, 1984; Bales et al., 1991, 1993; Bitton and Harvey, 1992; Grant
et al., 1993; Loveland et al., 1996; Penrod et al., 1996; Redman et al., 1997; Ryan et al.,
1999).
    There are many complicating factors that can interfere with the mechanism discussed
above. One is that a given virus may have more than one isoelectric point and the factors
responsible for passage from one form to another are unknown at this time. Other factors,
such as cations and humic and fulvic acids, may also influence the net surface charge of
the organism.
    Whilst changes in pH may affect the mobility of microorganisms in the subsurface,
the significance of this factor in any particular aquifer is uncertain. Robertson and Edberg
(1997) have noted that the pH of most unpolluted groundwater is generally very stable,
and in their experience falls within the near-neutral range of 6.5 to 8.5. There are
exceptions, and in those African countries underlain by acidic basement gneisses and
granites the pH is likely to be much lower, frequently in the range 5.5 to 6.5. In addition,
geological materials comprising most aquifers have a significant buffering capacity that
helps to maintain a relatively constant pH. Robertson and Edberg conclude that it is
unlikely that significant changes in microbe mobility will occur due to these minor pH
changes. This assumption may be valid for many stable groundwater systems but in
groundwater that is exposed to contamination from a variety of sources, which may be of
unknown and variable quality, for example sewage, pH may emerge as a dominant factor
in the mobility of pathogens.

Salt species
The adsorption of microorganisms onto surfaces in the groundwater system has been
shown to have two counteracting effects: It reduces the dispersal of the organism in the
subsurface, but reduces the inactivation rate of the organism in the affected area. If the
prevailing geochemical conditions in the groundwater system create opposing charges on
the surface of the organism and the aquifer matrix, adsorption will occur by electrostatic
attraction. Frequently, however, these conditions do not exist and the organism and the
aquifer matrix each have a negative charge.

    The types and concentrations of salts in the environment can have a profound
influence on the extent of pathogen transport in the subsurface. Cations (positively
charged inorganic species), in particular multivalent cations such as Magnesium (Mg2+)
and Calcium (Ca2+), can form a bridge between the solid surface and the organism and
significantly enhance adsorption. Clearly, the concentration of the salt is also important,
as this will influence the number of sites that are available for binding as well as the
number of bridges that can be formed between the two surfaces. Thus the capacity for
binding and the strength of the bonds will be affected by the salt concentration. Several
studies of virus and bacterial transport through simulated groundwater systems have
confirmed this hypothesis (Taylor et al., 1981; Sobsey, 1983; Bitton and Harvey, 1992;
Simoni et al., 2000).
    A decrease in the salt concentration or ionic strength of the soil water, such as would
occur during a rainfall event, can cause desorption of viruses and bacteria from soil
particles (Gerba and Bitton, 1984). This phenomenon has been observed in both
laboratory and field experiments (Landry et al., 1980; Wellings et al., 1980).
Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that only small changes in the salt
concentration can dramatically affect the mobilization of some organisms in groundwater
systems (Redman et al., 1999). The implication of this discussion is that salt
concentration in the groundwater system may be of greater significance to pathogen
transport than pH, although it is important to consider that neither factor will act in
isolation.

Organic matter
There are conflicting reports about the influence of organic matter on the survival and
transport of microorganisms in the subsurface, with different responses being noted for
bacteria and viruses, and for different species and strains within each group. The
influence of organic matter on virus survival has not been firmly defined. In some studies
it has been found that proteinaceous material present in wastewater may have a
protective effect on viruses; however, in other studies no effect has been observed.
Whilst similar observations have been made of bacterial survival in the presence of
organic matter, there remains an additional concern that enteric bacteria, in particular the
major pathogens and faecal indicator organisms, may be able to undergo a certain level
of growth in the environment if the conditions are suitable. There is some support for this
hypothesis, a few reports have been published demonstrating regrowth of faecal indicator
bacteria in organically rich tropical surface waters, but the evidence is still insufficient to
confirm that regrowth is a significant issue for most enteric bacteria in groundwater.
    Dissolved organic matter has generally been found to decrease virus adsorption by
competing for binding sites on soil particles and the aquifer matrix. The consequence of
this observation is that organic matter will increase the mobility of viruses in the
subsurface (Powelson et al., 1991). However, at relatively low concentrations of organic
matter the effect may be reversed, causing increased virus adsorption and significantly
reduced mobility in the subsurface (Robertson and Edberg, 1997).
    Overall, bacteria may respond differently. Binding to surfaces is a characteristic of the
growth cycle of most, if not all species of bacteria. Unlike the passive processes that
characterize the attachment of viruses to surfaces, bacterial attachment involves active
76                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

processes, including the synthesis of extracellular appendages specifically required to
stabilize the bacteria-surface interaction. The initiation of this binding is favoured by the
formation of a conditioning film of organic molecules deposited on the solid surface
(Bitton and Harvey, 1992; Wimpenny, 1996). Thus the presence of organic matter may
restrict the dispersal of bacteria in the subsurface but reduce the inactivation rate at the
site of attachment.

The presence of substances in groundwater may be affected by naturally occurring
processes as well as by actions directly associated with human activities. Naturally
occurring processes such as decomposition of organic material in soils or leaching of
mineral deposits can result in increased concentrations of several substances. Those of
health concern include fluoride, arsenic, nitrate, selenium, uranium, metals, and
radionuclides such as radon. Problems of aesthetic quality and acceptance may be caused
by iron, manganese, sulphate, chloride and organic matter.
   Sources of groundwater contamination associated with human activities are
widespread and include diffuse as well as point source pollution like land application of
animal wastes and agrochemicals in agriculture; disposal practices of human excreta and
wastes such as leaking sewers or sanitation systems, leakage of waste disposal sites,
landfills, underground storage tanks and pipelines; and pollution due to both poor
practices and accidental spills in mining, industry, traffic, health care facilities and
military sites.

    The exploitation of petroleum products and the development of industrial chemistry
has given rise to a large number of organic chemicals, many of which can be found in the
environment. Many organic chemicals are known to have potential human health
impacts, and some of these may occur in drinking-water in health-relevant
concentrations. In consequence, the list of those for which guideline values and national
quality standards have been developed has been continually added to and revised as data
on the occurrence of chemicals in water and new toxicological data emerge. Organic
chemicals commonly used by industry with known or suspected human health impacts
that are often encountered in groundwaters include, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons
such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) as well as volatile
chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE). A
diverse range of pesticides is also found in groundwaters. These are primarily, but not
exclusively, ascribed to agricultural activities. Typically pesticide concentrations
encountered are low. In some cases they have exceeded regulatory limits for drinking-
water supplies, although often the regulatory levels exceeded were often much lower
than those based on public health considerations.
    This chapter concentrates on the groups of chemical substances that are toxic to
humans and have reasonable potential to contaminate drinking-water abstracted from
groundwater. It provides foundational knowledge of natural groundwater constituents
and anthropogenic groundwater contaminants and discusses their relevance to human
health, origin, and transport and attenuation in groundwater systems. The chapter is sub-
divided as follows: Section 4.1 provides introductory theory on the transport and
attenuation of chemicals in the subsurface; Sections 4.2 to 4.4 focus upon inorganic
chemicals – natural inorganic constituents, nitrogen species and metals respectively;
Sections 4.5 to 4.8 focus upon organic chemicals including an introductory section on
conceptual contaminant models and transport and attenuation theory specific to organic
contaminants followed by sections on some organic chemical groups of key concern –
aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons and pesticides respectively; finally, the
chapter closes with a brief consideration of currently emerging issues (Section 4.9).
Further information on the individual chemicals discussed in this chapter is available in
the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, Volume 1 (WHO, 2004a), as well as
in detailed background documents on WHO’s Water, Sanitation and Health website
(http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/en/index.html).


4.1       SUBSURFACE TRANSPORT AND ATTENUATION
          OF CHEMICALS
Understanding of the transport and attenuation of chemicals in the subsurface is
fundamental to effective management of risks posed by chemicals and their possible
impact on groundwater resources. A risk assessment approach to groundwater protection
incorporates the three-stage combination of source, pathway and receptor. All three must
be considered and understood to arrive at a balanced view of the risks to health of
groundwater users. Informed consideration of the pathway, which in the context of this
monograph means transport through the groundwater system, is vital. This not only
includes consideration of the general and local hydrogeologic characteristics covered in
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   83

Chapters 2 and 8, but also the transport and attenuation of chemicals within that pathway.
The latter depend upon the properties of the chemical itself, particularly those properties
that control interactions of the chemical with the subsurface regime, a regime that
includes not only the host rock and groundwater, but other natural and anthropogenic
chemical constituents present as well as microbial life.
    Within the overall transport process, attenuation processes may cause movement of
the chemical to differ from that of the bulk flowing groundwater, for example dispersion,
sorption and chemical or biological degradation of the chemical. Such attenuation
processes potentially act to mitigate the impact of chemicals and are a function of both
the specific chemical and geologic domain. Indeed, attenuation may vary significantly
between individual chemicals and within different geological settings. In recent years
natural attenuation of organic contaminants has been increasingly recognized to play an
important role in many aquifer systems leading to monitored natural attenuation
becoming a recognized remedial strategy to manage risks to groundwater at some
contaminated sites (EA, 2000).
    This section provides an overview of the key processes that control the transport and
attenuation of chemicals in groundwater. Elaboration of some of the more specific
attenuation processes is also included in later sections. Further details may be found in
the following texts and references therein: Freeze and Cherry (1979), Appelo and Postma
(1993), Stumm and Morgan (1996), Domenico and Schwartz (1998), Bedient et al.
(1999), Fetter (1999) and Schwartz and Zhang (2003).

4.1.1 Natural hydrochemical conditions
It is important to understand at the outset the natural hydrochemical conditions that exist
in a given aquifer system, as these provide the baseline from which quality changes
caused by human impacts can be determined. The natural hydrochemical conditions may
also affect the behaviour of some pollutants. Because groundwater movement is typically
slow and residence times long, there is potential for interaction between the water and the
rock material through which it passes. The properties of both the water and the material
are therefore important, and natural groundwater quality will vary from one rock type to
another and within aquifers along groundwater flow paths. Water is essentially a highly
polar liquid solvent that will readily dissolve ionic chemical species. Rock material is
predominantly inorganic in nature and contact of flowing groundwater with the rock may
dissolve inorganic ions into that water, i.e. dissolution of the rock occurs. ‘Major ions’
present are the anions nitrate, sulphate, chloride and bicarbonate and the cations sodium,
potassium, magnesium and calcium. Ions typically present at lower concentration,
‘minor ions’, include anions such as fluoride and bromide and a wide variety of metal
ions that are predominantly cations. Combined, the total inorganic concentration within
the water is referred to as the total dissolved solids (TDS).
    Natural groundwater quality changes start in the soil, where infiltrating rainfall
dissolves carbon dioxide from biological activity in the soil to produce weak carbonic
acid that may assist removal of soluble minerals from the underlying rocks, e.g. calcite
cements. At the same time, soil organisms consume some of the oxygen that was
dissolved in the rainfall. In temperate and humid climates with significant recharge,
84                                   Protecting Groundwater for Health

groundwater moves relatively quickly through the aquifer. Contact time with the rock
matrix is short and only readily soluble minerals will be involved in reactions.
Groundwater in the outcrop areas of aquifers is likely to be low in overall chemical
content, i.e. have low major ion contents and low TDS, with igneous rocks usually
having less dissolved constituents than sedimentary rocks (Hem, 1989). In coastal
regions, sodium and chloride may exceed calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate and the
presence of soluble cement between the grains may allow major ion concentrations to be
increased. Groundwaters in carbonate rocks have pH above 7, and mineral contents
usually dominated by bicarbonate and calcium.
    In many small and shallow aquifers the hydrochemistry does not evolve further.
However, the baseline natural quality of groundwater may vary spatially within the same
aquifer if the mineral assemblages vary, and also evolves with time as the water moves
along groundwater flow lines. If an aquifer dips below a confining layer (Figure 2.5), a
sequence of hydrochemical processes occurs with progressive distance downgradient
away from the outcrop, including precipitation of some solids when relevant ion
concentrations reach saturation levels for a solid mineral phase. These processes have
been clearly observed in the United Kingdom, where the geological history is such that
all three of the major aquifers exhibit the sequence shown in Figure 4.1, which has been
characterized by sampling transects of abstraction boreholes across the aquifers
(Edmunds et al., 1987).

Figure 4.1. Schematic representation of downgradient hydrochemical changes

   In the recharge area, oxidizing conditions occur and dissolution of calcium and
bicarbonate dominates. As the water continues to move downgradient, further
modifications are at first limited. By observing the redox potential (Eh) of abstracted
groundwater, a sharp redox barrier is detected beyond the edge of the confining layer,
corresponding to the complete exhaustion of dissolved oxygen. Bicarbonate increases
and the pH rises until buffering occurs at about 8.3. Sulphate concentrations remain
stable in the oxidizing water, but decrease suddenly just beyond the redox boundary due
to sulphate reduction. Groundwater becomes steadily more reducing as it flows
downgradient, as demonstrated by the presence of sulphide, increase in the solubility of
iron and manganese and denitrification of nitrate. After some further kilometres, sodium
begins to increase by ion exchange at the expense of calcium, producing a natural
softening of the water. Eventually, the available calcium in the water is exhausted, but
sodium continues to increase to a level greater than could be achieved purely by cation
exchange. As chloride also begins to increase, this marks the point at which recharging
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                     85

water moving slowly down through the aquifer mixes with much older saline water
present in the sediments (Figure 4.1). The observed hydrochemical changes can thus be
interpreted in terms of oxidation/reduction, ion exchange and mixing processes.
    In arid and semi-arid regions, evapotranspiration rates are much higher, recharge is
less, flow paths longer and residence times much greater and hence much higher levels
of natural mineralization, often dominated by sodium and chloride, can be encountered.
Thus the major ion contents and TDS are often high. In some desert regions, even if
groundwater can be found it may be so salty (extremely high TDS) as to be undrinkable,
and the difficulty of meeting even the most basic domestic requirements can have serious
impacts on health and livelihood.
    Natural variations in pH and oxygen status are also important and are not restricted to
deep environments. Many groundwaters in tropical regions in weathered basement
aquifers and alluvial sequences have low pH, and the reducing conditions which prevail
can promote the mobilization of metals and other parameters of health significance such
as arsenic. Thus prevailing hydrochemical conditions of the groundwater that are
naturally present and develop need to be taken into account when: (i) developing
schemes for groundwater abstraction for various uses and in protecting groundwater; and
(ii) considering the transport and attenuation of additional chemicals entering
groundwaters due to human activity.

4.1.2 Conceptual models and attenuation processes
Effective prediction of transport of chemical pollutants through a subsurface
groundwater system and associated assessments of risk requires a valid conceptual
model of the contaminant migration scenario. The classical contaminant conceptual
model is one of a near-surface leachable source zone where chemical contaminant is
leached, i.e. dissolved/solubilized, into water infiltrating through the source (Figure 4.2).
A dissolved-phase chemical solute plume subsequently emerges in water draining from
the base of the contaminant source zone and moves vertically downward through any
unsaturated zone present. The dissolved solute plume ultimately penetrates below the
water table to subsequently migrate laterally in the flowing groundwater. Many sources,
e.g. a landfill, chemical waste lagoon, contaminated industrial site soils, pesticide
residues in field soils, may have sufficient chemical mass to enable them to act as long-
term generators of dissolved-phase contaminant plumes; potentially such sources can last
decades. This will lead to continuous dissolved-phase plumes extending from these
sources through the groundwater pathway that grow with time and may ultimately reach
distant receptors unless attenuation processes operate. This near-surface leachable source
– dissolved-plume conceptual model is the model most frequently invoked and the one to
which groundwater vulnerability and protection concepts and groundwater risk-
assessment models are most easily applied. It is important to note, however, that the
above conceptualization may be too simplified and alternative conceptual models need to
be invoked in some cases, most notably for non aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) as
discussed in Section 4.5.
86                         Protecting Groundwater for Health




Figure 4.2. Classical contaminant conceptual model

Attenuation processes operative in the groundwater pathway, both for unsaturated and
saturated zones, are summarized below and briefly described in the text that follows.
Further details may be found in the texts referenced in other sections of this chapter.


     DEF X            Advection and dispersion
                      Advection is the transport of dissolved solute mass present in
                      groundwater due to the bulk flow (movement) of that groundwater.
                      Advection alone (with no dispersion or reactive processes occuring)
                      would cause a non-reactive solute to advect (move) at the mean
                      groundwater pore velocity. All solutes undergo advection, however,
                      reactive solutes are subject to influences by other processes detailed
                      below.
                      Molecular diffusion is the movement of solute ions in the direction
                      of the concentration gradient from high towards low concentrations.
                      It affects all solutes.
                      Mechanical dispersion causes spreading of solute and hence
                      dilution of concentrations, it arises from the tortuosity of the pore
                      channels in a granular aquifer and of the fractures in a consolidated
                      aquifer and the different speeds of groundwater within flow
                      channels of varying width. It affects all solutes.

                    Retardation
                    Sorption is a process by which chemicals or organisms become
                    attached to soils and/or the geologic rock material (aquifer solids)
                    and removed from the water. Often the sorption process is
                    reversible and solutes desorb and hence dissolved-solute plumes are
                    retarded, rather than solutes being permanently retained by the
                    solids.
                    Cation exchange is the interchange between cations in solution and
                    cations on the surfaces of clay particles or organic colloids.
                    Filtration is a process that affects particulate contaminants (e.g.
                    organic/inorganic colloids or microbes) rather than dissolved
                    solutes. Particles larger than pore throat diameters or fracture
                    apertures are prevented from moving by advection and are
                    therefore attenuated within the soil or rock.

                    Reactions and transformations of chemicals
                    Chemical reactions (abiotic reactions) are classical chemical
                    reactions that are not mediated by bacteria. They may include
                    reaction processes such as precipitation, hydrolysis, complexation,
                    elimination, substitution, etc., that transform chemicals into other
                    chemicals and potentially alter their phase/state (solid, liquid, gas,
                    dissolved).
                    Precipitation is the removal of ions from solution by the formation of
                    insoluble compounds, i.e. a solid-phase precipitate.
                    Hydrolysis is a process of chemical reaction by the addition of
                    water.
                    Complexation is the reaction process by which compounds are
                    formed in which molecules or ions form coordinate bonds to a metal
                    atom or ion.
                    Biodegradation (biotic reactions) is a reaction process that is
                    facilitated by microbial activity, e.g. by bacteria present in the
                    subsurface. Typically molecules are degraded (broken down) to
                    molecules of a simpler structure that often have lower toxicity.

As described in Chapter 2, groundwater moves due to the presence of a hydraulic
gradient and may be characterized by the Darcy velocity q (alternatively named the
specific discharge). The Darcy velocity may be calculated via Darcy’s law and is the
product of the geologic media hydraulic conductivity K and the groundwater hydraulic
gradient i. The actual mean groundwater pore (linear) velocity of groundwater,
henceforth referred to as the ‘groundwater velocity’ v differs from the Darcy velocity as
flow can only occur through the effective porosity ne of the formation. The groundwater
velocity may be quantified by modifying the Darcy equation:
               v = -Ki / ne                                                     (Eqn. 4.1)
88                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Advection is the transport of dissolved solutes in groundwater due to the bulk
movement of groundwater. The mean advective velocity of non-reactive solutes is equal
to the groundwater velocity, v (Eqn. 4.1) and is normally estimated by knowledge of the
Equation 4.1 hydrogeological parameters. Occasionally v may be estimated from the
mean position of a solute plume, typically within a groundwater tracer test (Mackay et
al., 1986). Reactive solutes also advect with the flowing groundwater, however, their
velocities are modified due to co-occurrence of attenuation processes.

Dispersion
All reactive and non-reactive solutes will undergo spreading due to dispersion, causing
dissolved-phase plumes to broaden both along and perpendicular to the groundwater
flow direction (Figure 4.3). Dispersion is most easily observed for ‘conservative’ non-
reactive solutes, such as chloride, as these only undergo advection and dispersion.
Dispersion causes mixing of the dissolved-solute plume with uncontaminated water and
hence concentration dilution as well as plume spreading. Longitudinal dispersion,
spreading in the direction of predominant groundwater flow, is greatest causing solutes to
move at greater or less than the mean advective velocity v. Solute spreading is due to
mechanical dispersion that can arise at the pore-scale due to (Fetter, 1999): (i) fluids
moving faster at pore centres due to less friction; (ii) larger pores allowing faster fluid
movement; (iii) routes of varying tortuosity around grains. At a larger scale, macro-
dispersion is controlled by the distribution of hydraulic conductivities in the geologic
domain; greater geological heterogeneity resulting in greater plume spreading. The above
processes cause increasing dispersion with plume travel distance, i.e. dispersion is scale
dependent (Gelhar, 1986; Fetter, 1999).

Figure 4.3. Dispersion of a pulse release of dissolved-solute plume

   Plume dispersion in other directions is much reduced. Transverse horizontal
spreading may arise from flowpath tortuosity and molecular diffusion due to plume
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                    89

chemical-concentration gradients. Transverse vertical spreading occurs for similar
reasons, but is generally more restricted due to predominantly near-horizontal layering of
geologic strata. Overall, a hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient D is defined for each
direction (longitudinal, transverse horizontal, transverse vertical):
               D = α v + D*                                                      (Eqn. 4.2)
which is seen to depend upon D*, the solute’s effective diffusion coefficient and α the
geologic media dispersivity. Dispersion parameters are most reliably obtained from
tracer tests or, less reliably, at the larger (>250 m) scale, by model fitting to existing
plumes. Collated values have yielded simple empirical relationships to estimate
dispersion, e.g. the longitudinal dispersivity is often approximated to be 0.1 (10 per cent)
of the mean plume travel distance (Gelhar, 1986). However, such relationships are very
approximate.

Retardation
The processes that cause retardation (slowing down) of dissolved-solute plume migration
include filtration, sorption and cation exchange. Filtration is a process that affects
particulate contaminants (e.g. organic/inorganic colloids or microbes) rather than
dissolved solutes, the key focus here. Sorption is a process by which chemicals or
organisms become attached to soils and/or the geologic rock material (aquifer solids) and
are removed from the water. Often the sorption process is reversible and solutes desorb
back into the water phase and hence dissolved-solute plumes are retarded, rather than
solutes being permanently retained by the solids. Preferred sorption sites depend upon
the chemical solute properties, in general clay strata or organic matter within the geologic
solid media are key sorption sites. Such sites may, however, be limited and sorption to
other mineral phases, e.g. iron oxyhydroxides, may become important in some cases.
Sorption processes normally lead to a Retardation Factor, Ri, being defined that is the
ratio of the mean advective velocity (conservative solute velocity) (v) to the mean
velocity of the retarded sorbing solute plume (vi):
               Ri = v / vi                                                       (Eqn. 4.3)
Typically Ri is not estimated from Equation 4.3, rather various methods may be used to
estimate Ri relating to the specific chemical nature of the sorption interaction and a
relevant sorption coefficient (e.g. see Section 4.5.2). Sorption-related processes can be
sensitive to the environmental conditions. For example, relatively small pH changes may
cause significant changes to the mobilization of metals or perhaps organic contaminants
that are themselves acids or bases, e.g. phenols or amines.

Reactions and transformations of chemicals
Many chemicals undergo reaction or transformation in the subsurface environment. In
contrast to retardation, contaminants may be removed rather than simply slowed down.
Reactions of harmful chemicals to yield benign products prior to arrival at a receptor are
the ideal, e.g. many toxic hydrocarbons have potential to biodegrade to simple organic
acids (of low health concern and themselves potentially degradable), carbon dioxide
(bicarbonate) and water. Transformation often causes a deactivation (lowering) of
90                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

toxicity. Reactions and/or transformations incorporate processes such as chemical
precipitation, complexation, hydrolysis, biodegradation (biotic reactions) and chemical
reactions (abiotic reactions).
   Chemical precipitation and complexation are primarily important for the inorganic
species. The formation of coordination complexes is typical behaviour of transition
metals, which provide the cation or central atom. Ligands include common inorganic
anions such as Cl-, F-, Br-, SO42-, PO43- and CO32- as well as organic molecules such as
amino acids. Such complexation may facilitate the transport of metals.
   Biodegradation is a reaction process mediated by microbial activity (a biotic
reaction). Naturally present bacteria may transform the organic molecule to a simpler
product, e.g. another organic molecule or even CO2. Biodegradation has wide
applicability to many organic chemicals in a diverse range of subsurface environments.
Rates of biodegradation vary widely, some compounds may only degrade very slowly,
e.g. high molecular weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are relatively
recalcitrant (unreactive). Rates are also very dependent upon environmental conditions,
including redox, microbial populations present and their activity towards contaminants
present.
   Abiotic reactions, classic chemical reactions not mediated by bacteria, have been
found to be of fairly limited importance in groundwater relative to biodegradation. For
example, a few organics, e.g. 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and some pesticides,
may readily undergo reaction with water (hydrolysis), others such as the aromatic
hydrocarbon benzene are essentially unreactive to water and a range of other potential
chemical reactions.

Potential for attenuation
Potential for attenuation processes to occur varies within the various subsurface zones,
i.e. soil, unsaturated and saturated zone. Attenuation processes can be more effective in
the soil rather than aquifers due to higher clay contents, organic carbon, microbial
populations and replenishable oxygen. This makes the soil a very important first line of
defence against groundwater pollution, often termed ‘protective layer’. Consideration of
the soil and its attenuation properties is a key factor in assessing the vulnerability of
groundwater to pollution (Chapter 8). This also means that where the soil is thin or
absent the risk of groundwater pollution may be greatly increased. Many human
activities that give rise to pollution by-pass the soil completely and introduce pollutants
directly into the unsaturated or even saturated zones of aquifers. Examples include
landfills, leaking sewers, pit latrines, transportation routes in excavated areas and
highway drainage.


4.2       NATURAL INORGANIC CONSTITUENTS
The occurrence of natural constituents in groundwater varies greatly depending on the
nature of the aquifer. In general, aquifers in magmatites and metamorphic rocks show
lower dissolved contents than in carbonate or sedimentary rocks. The mobility and thus
the concentration of nearly all natural groundwater constituents can be significantly
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                      91

influenced by changes of physical and chemical conditions in groundwater through
human activities.
    Fluoride and arsenic are now recognized as the most serious inorganic contaminants
in drinking-water on a worldwide basis. Further natural constituents that can cause a
public health risk addressed in this chapter (in alphabetical order) are selenium, radon
and uranium. Although nitrate has occasionally been found naturally in health-relevant
concentrations, in most cases these are caused anthropogenically, and therefore nitrate is
addressed in Section 4.3.


   NOTE X            Arsenic, fluoride, selenium, radon and uranium are examples of
                     health-relevant naturally occurring groundwater constituents. Their
                     concentrations in groundwater are strongly dependant on
                     hydrogeological conditions. In some settings, nitrate may naturally
                     occur in health-relevant concentrations.




4.2.1 Arsenic
Health aspects
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified arsenic (As) as a
Group 1 human carcinogen (IARC, 2001). The health effects of arsenic in drinking-
water include skin cancer, internal cancers (lung, bladder, kidney) and peripheral
vascular disease (blackfoot disease). Evidence of chronic arsenic poisoning includes
melanosis (abnormal black-brown pigmentation of the skin), hyperkeratosis (thickening
of the soles of the feet), gangrene and skin and bladder cancer (WHO, 2003a). Arsenic
toxicity may not be apparent for some time but the time to appearance of symptoms and
the severity of effects will depend on the concentration in the drinking-water, other
sources of exposure, dietary habits that may increase arsenic concentrations in staple
dishes and a variety of other possible nutritional factors.
    While earlier maximum allowable concentrations recommended by WHO for arsenic
in drinking-water were higher, in 1993 the provisional WHO guideline value for arsenic
in drinking-water was reduced to 10 µg/l based on concerns regarding its carcinogenicity
in humans (WHO, 2004a). Regulations in some countries, e.g. the European Union
(EU), Japan and the USA follow this guideline value and Australia has established a
drinking-water standard for arsenic of 7 µg/l. A number of countries operate at present at
a 50 µg/l standard, which corresponds to the provisional WHO guideline value before
1993. Some national authorities are currently seeking to reduce their own limits in line
with the WHO guideline value. It is important to realize that the WHO Guidelines
emphasize the need for adaptation of national standards to local health priorities, social,
cultural, environmental and economic conditions and also advocate progressive
improvement that may include interim standards. Furthermore, the WHO Guidelines
emphasises the scientific uncertainty of the dose-response curves at low intakes and thus
in deriving the guideline value of 10 µg/l. For improving public health benefits, other
issues may therefore take priority over upgrading the sensitivity of analytical facilities for
92                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

detecting lower concentrations or investing in upgrading drinking-water supplies to
reduce arsenic concentrations to levels below 50 µg/l.
   In recent years both the WHO guideline value and current national standards for
arsenic have been found to be frequently exceeded in drinking-water sources. The scale
of the arsenic problem in terms of population exposed to high arsenic concentrations is
greatest in Bangladesh with between 35 and 77 million people at risk (Smith et al.,
2000). However, many other countries are also faced with elevated arsenic
concentrations in groundwater, such as Hungary, Chile, Mexico, northeast Canada, the
western USA and many countries in South Asia. More detailed information on
occurrence and health significance of arsenic can be found in ‘Arsenic in Drinking-
water’ (WHO, In Press).

Occurrence
Arsenic is an ubiquitous element found in soils and rocks, natural waters and organisms.
It occurs naturally in a number of geological environments, but is particularly common in
regions of active volcanism where it is present in geothermal fluids and also occurs in
sulphide minerals (principally arsenopyrite) precipitated from hydrothermal fluids in
metamorphic environments (Hem, 1989). Arsenic may also accumulate in sedimentary
environments by being co-precipitated with hydrous iron oxides or as sulphide minerals
in anaerobic environments. It is mobilized in the environment through a combination of
natural processes such as weathering reactions, biological activity and igneous activity as
well as through a range of anthropogenic activities. Of the various routes of exposure to
arsenic in the environment, drinking-water probably poses the greatest threat to human
health.
    Background concentrations of arsenic in groundwater in most countries are less than
10 µg/l. However, surveys performed in arsenic-rich areas showed a very large range,
from <0.5 to 5000 µg/l (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2001). Cases of large scale naturally
occurring arsenic in groundwater are mainly restricted to hydrogeological environments
characterized by young sediment deposits (often alluvium), and low-lying flat conditions
with slow-moving groundwater such as the deltaic areas forming much of Bangladesh.
Investigations by WHO in Bangladesh indicate that 20 per cent of 25 000 boreholes
tested in that country have arsenic concentrations that exceed 50 µg/l. High
concentrations of arsenic in groundwater also occur in regions where oxidation of
sulphide minerals (such as arsenopyrite) has occurred (Alaerts et al., 2001).
    Arsenic concentration in German groundwater downstream of abandoned waste
disposal sites was found to have a mean concentration of 61 µg/l (n = 253 sites) due to
arsenic leaching from domestic coal ashes deposited with household wastes. In contrast,
the mean arsenic concentration in uncontaminated aquifers is 0.5 µg/l (n = 472 sites)
(Kerndorff et al., 1992).
Transport and attenuation
The concentration of arsenic in natural waters is normally controlled by solid-solution
interactions, particularly in groundwater where the solid/solution ratio is large. In most
soils and aquifers, mineral arsenic interactions are likely to dominate over organic
matter-arsenic interactions, although organic matter may interact to some extent through
its reactions with the surfaces of minerals (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2001). One of the
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                    93

best correlations between the concentration of arsenic in sediments and other elements is
with iron. These interactions have also been the basis for the use of iron, aluminium and
manganese salts in water treatment for arsenic removal.
    Arsenic shows a high sensitivity to mobilization at the pH values typically found in
groundwater (pH 6.5-8.5) and under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can
occur in the environment in several oxidation states (-3, 0, +3 and +5) but in natural
waters is mostly found in inorganic oxyanion forms as trivalent arsenite (As(III)) or
pentavalent arsenate (As(V)). Redox potential (Eh) and pH are the most important factors
controlling arsenic speciation. Relative to the other oxyanion-forming elements, arsenic
is among the most problematic in the environment because of its mobility over a wide
range of redox conditions (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2001). Under oxidizing conditions,
H2AsO4- is dominant at low pH (less than ~pH 6.9), while at higher pH, HAsO42-
becomes dominant (H3AsO4 and AsO43- may be present in extremely acidic and alkaline
conditions, respectively). Under reducing conditions at less than ~pH 9.2, the uncharged
arsenate(III)-species (H3AsO3) will predominate.
    Transport is largely controlled by the aquifer conditions, particularly by adsorption on
ferric oxohydroxides, humic substances and clays. Arsenic adsorption is most likely to be
non-linear, with the rate of adsorption disproportionally decreasing with increasing
concentrations in groundwater. This leads to reduced retardation at high concentrations.
Since different arsenic species exhibit different retardation behaviour, arsenate (V) and
arsenate (III) should travel through an aquifer with different amounts of interactions
resulting in different velocities and increased separation along a flow path. This was
demonstrated by Gulens et al. (in Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2001) using controlled soil-
column experiments and various groundwaters. They showed that: (i) As(III) moved five
to six times faster than As(V) under oxidizing conditions (at pH 5.7); (ii) with a ‘neutral’
groundwater (pH 6.9) under oxidizing conditions, As(V) moved much faster than under
(i) but was still slower than As(III); (iii) under reducing conditions (at pH 8.3), both
As(III) and As(V) moved rapidly through the column; (iv) when the amount of arsenic
injected was substantially reduced, the mobility of the As(III) and As(V) was greatly
reduced.
    There is no process in the subsurface that alters arsenic species beside precipitation
and adsorption. If groundwater with elevated arsenic levels is used for drinking-water
supply, then treatment should be applied. There has been increasing research into this
area and a number of low-cost household treatment technologies are available. Data from
studies in Bangladesh suggest that low-cost technologies can remove arsenic to below
0.05 mg/l and sometimes lower (Ahmed et al., 2001). Technologies are also available for
system treatment including activated alumina, chemical precipitation and reverse
osmosis (for arsenate). However, in some situations, source substitution or mixing is
preferable to arsenic removal (Alaerts et al., 2001).

4.2.2      Fluoride
Health aspects
Because fluoride is widely dispersed in the environment, all living organisms are widely
exposed to it and tolerate modest amounts. In humans, fluoride has an affinity for
94                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

accumulating in mineralizing tissues in the body, in young people in bone and teeth, in
older people in bone, and incorporation of fluoride into the matrix of teeth during their
formation is protective against dental caries.
    Health problems associated with the condition known as fluorosis may occur when
fluoride concentrations in groundwater exceed 1.5 mg/l: staining of the tooth enamel
may become apparent (dental fluorosis) and, with continued exposure, teeth may become
extremely brittle. The incidence and severity of dental fluorosis, and the much more
serious skeletal fluorosis, depend on a range of factors including the quantity of water
drunk and exposure to fluoride from other sources, such as from high fluoride coal in
China. Nutritional status may also be important. Estimates based on studies from China
and India indicate that for a total intake of 14 mg/day there is a clear excess risk of
skeletal adverse effects, and there is suggestive evidence of an increased risk of effects on
the skeleton at total fluoride intakes above about 6 mg/day (WHO, 2004b). In its most
severe form, this disease is characterized by irregular bone deposits that may cause
arthritis and crippling when occurring at joints.
    The WHO guideline value for fluoride is 1.5 mg/l since 1984 (WHO, 2004a). The EU
maximum admissible concentration for fluoride in drinking-water is 1.5 mg/l. The US
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) set an enforceable primary maximum
contaminant level of 4 mg/l in water systems to prevent crippling skeletal fluorosis. A
secondary contaminant level of 2 mg/l was recommended by US EPA to protect against
objectionable dental fluorosis. In setting national standards for fluoride, it is particularly
important to consider volumes of water intake (which are affected by climatic
conditions) and intake of fluoride from other sources (e.g. food, air). Where higher
fluoride concentrations occur in groundwater used as drinking-water source, treatment
and/or change or mixing with other waste sources containing lower fluoride levels is
necessary in order to meet drinking-water standards. In areas with high natural fluoride
levels, the public health benefits of investments in the treatment necessary to meet the
WHO guideline value may need to be balanced against other priorities for optimising
public health benefits.
    More detailed information on occurrence and health significance of fluoride can be
found in ‘Fluorides in Drinking Water’ (Bailey et al., In Press).

Occurrence
Fluoride (F-) naturally occurs in rocks in many geological environments (Hem, 1989) but
fluoride concentrations in groundwater are particularly high in groundwater associated
with acid volcanic rocks, e.g. in Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (Bailey
et al., In Press). High concentrations of fluoride also occur in some metamorphic and
sedimentary rocks that contain significant amounts of fluoride-bearing minerals such as
fluorite and apatite. Fluoride in water supply based on groundwater is a problem in a
number of countries and over 70 million people worldwide are believed to be at risk of
adverse health effects from consumption of water containing high levels of fluoride.
India and China have particular problems and estimates suggest up to 60 million are
affected in these two countries alone.
   Exposure to fluoride from drinking-water depends greatly on natural circumstances.
Levels in raw water are normally below 1.5 mg/l, but groundwater has been found to
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   95

contain >50 mg/l in some areas rich in fluoride-containing minerals. For example, in
Kenya, 61 per cent of groundwater samples collected nationally from drinking-water
wells exceeded 1 mg/l (Bailey et al., In Press). In general high fluoride concentrations in
groundwater show a strong positive correlation with dissolved solids, sodium, and
alkalinity, and a strong negative correlation with hardness.
Transport and attenuation
The concentration of fluoride ions in groundwater is driven by the presence of calcium
ions and the solubility product of fluorite (CaF2). In equilibrium, a calcium concentration
of 40 mg/l equates to a concentration of 3.2 mg/l fluoride. In groundwater with a high
concentration of calcium ions, fluoride concentrations rarely exceed 1 mg/l. Substantially
higher fluoride concentrations in groundwater are usually caused by a lack of calcium.
During high percolation rates, Flühler et al. (1985) observed increased fluoride
concentration in the leachate of fluoride-enriched soils due to a limited additional
delivery of calcium.
   In groundwater with a high pH (>8) and dominated by sodium ions and carbonate
species, fluoride concentrations commonly exceed 1 mg/l, and concentrations in excess
of 50 mg/l have been recorded in groundwater in South Africa, and in Arizona in the
USA (Hem, 1989). Moreover, the fluoride-ion (F-) can interact with mineral surfaces, but
is substituted by hydroxyl-ions at high pH values. Hem (1989) observed a fluoride
concentration of 22 mg/l in a caustic thermal groundwater (pH 9.2, 50 ºC) in Owyhee
County, Idaho. Fluoride ions form strong complexes especially with aluminium,
beryllium and iron (III).

4.2.3     Selenium
Health aspects
Selenium is an essential trace element with a physiologically required intake of about
1 µg per kg body weight and day for adults. Deficiencies of selenium in diets may cause
a number of health effects, although few reports of clinical signs of deficiency are
available. However, the range of concentrations of this element in food and water that
provide health benefits appears to be very narrow. When ingested in excess of nutritional
requirements in food and drinking-water, selenium can cause a number of acute and
chronic health effects including damage to or loss of hair and fingernails, finger
deformities, skin lesions, tooth decay and neurological disorders (WHO, 2003b).
   Although drinking-water generally accounts for less than 1 per cent of the typical
dietary intake of selenium, in some circumstances naturally-occurring concentrations of
selenium in groundwater may be sufficiently high to cause health problems. The WHO
guideline value for selenium in drinking-water is 0.01 mg/l (WHO, 2004a).

Occurrence
Selenium has similar chemical properties and behaviour to sulphur (Hem, 1989), and is
commonly associated with metal sulphide minerals in mineral deposits in a wide range
of igneous rocks and with sulphur-rich coal. Sedimentary rocks and overlying soil in
some regions may have high background concentrations of selenium. In the western part
of the USA, these are associated with uranium and vanadium mineralization in shales
96                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

and sandstones. In some semi-arid areas in China and India, selenium reaches high
concentrations in soil and accumulates in plant tissue. Runoff from irrigated agriculture
on seleniferous soil may contain dissolved selenium concentrations of up to 1 mg/l
(Hem, 1989), and groundwater in these areas also typically contains high concentrations
of leached selenium (Barceloux, 1999). Groundwater concentrations of selenium rarely
exceed 1 µg/l (Hem, 1989), but up to 6000 µg/l have been reported (WHO, 2003b), and
high concentrations (tens to hundreds of micrograms per litre) may occur in surface
water and groundwater near metal-sulphide mine sites.
    Selenium concentrations are often particularly high in surface waters and
groundwater in coal mining areas where solid wastes and wastewater from coal power
stations are disposed to the environment (Barceloux, 1999; US EPA, 2000).

Transport and attenuation
Selenium can exist in nature in four oxidation states: 0 (elemental selenium), -2
(selenide), +4 (selenite) and +6 (selenate). Under oxidizing conditions, the selenium
occurs predominantly as selenite (SeO32-) and selenate (SeO42-) ions in natural waters.
These ions have a very high solubility, and can reach very high concentrations in
conditions when water is being subjected to high rates of evapotranspiration such as in
regions with semi-arid or arid climates. Selenate and selenite minerals can accumulate
with sulphates in soils in regions with semi-arid or arid climates.
    High concentrations of selenium may also occur in groundwater beneath areas where
intense irrigated agriculture flushes selenium compounds through the soil profile, and if
groundwater pumping rates are high, the concentration of selenium may be progressively
increased by the recycling of salts by the process of pumping, evaporation and recharge
of pumped effluent. Consequently, selenium concentrations in shallow groundwater and
in drainage from irrigated agriculture on seleniferous soils are often highly toxic to
wildlife that ingests the water, as in the widely studied case of the Kesterson National
Wildlife Refuge in the San Joaquin Valley of California (NRC, 1989). This water is also
potentially toxic to humans who might use shallow groundwater as a drinking-water
source, although water contaminated with high selenium concentrations is often too
saline for potable use.
    Under reducing conditions in groundwater or in marshes, selenium can also be
removed from water through co-precipitation with sulphide minerals such as pyrite
(FeS2) or the precipitation of ferroselite (FeSe2); through volatilization as dimethyl
selenide or hydrogen selenide, or through the uptake of organo-selenium compounds by
plants. Consequently, anaerobic bioreactors or artificial wetlands are being used for
selenium removal from water, predominantly to protect receiving environments from the
discharge of wastewater contaminated by selenium.
    Selenium can be removed from water by adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxide minerals
(especially ferrihydrite) and this is one of the preferred water treatment methods.
Selenium can also be removed from drinking-water by reverse osmosis and through the
use of anion-exchange resins.

4.2.4      Radon
Health aspects
Radon is a radioactive gas emitted from radium, a daughter product of uranium that
occurs naturally in rocks and soil. The main health effect of radon is to cause lung
cancer. Radon, together with its decay products, emits alpha particles that can damage
lung tissue. Although most radon is exhaled before it can do significant damage, its
decay products can remain trapped in the respiratory system attached to dust, smoke and
other fine particles from the air.
    The global average human exposure to radiation from natural sources is 2.4 mSv per
year with an average dose from inhalation of radon of 1.2 mSv per year. There are large
local variations in this exposure depending on a number of factors, such as height above
sea level, the amount and type of radionuclides in the soil, and the amount taken into the
body in air, food, and water (WHO, 2004a). Unlike most other naturally occurring
groundwater contaminants, most of the health effects of radon in groundwater are
considered to be due to its contribution to indoor air quality rather than due to effects
caused by direct ingestion of water. UNSCEAR has calculated the average doses from
radon in drinking-water as low as 0.025 mSv/year via inhalation and 0.002 mSv/year
from ingestion as compared to the inhalation dose from radon in the air of 1.1 mSv/year
(UNSCEAR, 2000). The WHO has recommended a reference level of committed
effective dose of 0.1 mSv from 1 year’s consumption of drinking-water (WHO, 2004a).
    Stirring and transferring water from one container to another will liberate dissolved
radon. Water that has been left to stand will have reduced radon activity, and boiling will
remove radon completely. As a result, it is important that the form of water consumed is
taken into account in assessing the dose from ingestion. Moreover, the use of water
supplies for other domestic purposes will increase the levels of radon in the air, thus
increasing the dose from inhalation. This dose depends markedly on the form of
domestic usage and housing construction (NCRP, 1989). The form of water intake, the
domestic use of water and the construction of houses vary widely throughout the world.
It is therefore not possible to derive an activity concentration for radon in drinking-water
that is universally applicable.
    WHO recommends implementing controls if the radon concentration of drinking-
water exceeds 100 Bq/litre (WHO, 2004a), and the EU likewise recommends assessing
the need for protective measures at concentrations above this level (Euratom 2001/928;
CEC, 2001).

Occurrence
Radon (Rn) is a naturally occurring, colourless, odourless gaseous element that is soluble
in water. It occurs naturally only as a product of the radioactive decay of radium, itself a
radioactive decay product of uranium. As is the case for uranium, concentrations of
radon are directly related to the local geology, and are particularly high in granitic rocks
and pegmatites and sediments with phosphate nodules or heavy mineral sand deposits.
   Radon-222 is a frequently encountered radioactive constituent in natural waters and
typically exceeds the concentration of other radionuclides, including uranium, thorium
and radium, by orders of magnitude. High radon emanation, especially along fracture
surfaces, contributes significantly to radon concentrations in groundwater. Data from
98                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

sampling campaigns indicate that there is a great degree of variability in the radon-222
concentration of samples drawn from any given rock type. The United States Geological
Survery (USGS) conducted a study on occurrence of dissolved radon in groundwater in
Pennsylvania (Senior, 1998). Findings of this study indicated that rock types with the
highest median radon concentrations in groundwater include schist and phyllite (2400
pCi/l) as well as quartzite (2150 pCi/l). The geohydrologic groups with lowest median
radon concentrations in ground water include carbonate rocks (540 pCi/l) and other rocks
(360 pCi/l). Water from wells in gneiss had a median radon concentration of 1000 pCi/l,
and water from wells in Triassic-age sedimentary rocks had a median radon
concentration of 1300 pCi/l. Radon concentrations generally do not correlate with well
characteristics, the pH of water or concentrations of dissolved major ions and other
chemical constituents in the water samples.

Transport and attenuation
The rate of radon’s radioactive decay is defined by its half-life, which is the time required
for one half of the amount of radon present to break down to form other elements. The
half-life of radon is 3.8 days. Several factors probably control the concentration of radon-
222 in a water supply. The flux of radon-222 within the ground may be controlled by the
radium-226 concentration in the surrounding rocks, the emanation fraction for the radon-
222 from the rock matrix and the permeability of the rock to radon-222 movement. For a
given flux, the concentration of radon-222 in a water supply would then also be
controlled by the ratio of aquifer surface area to volume.

4.2.5      Uranium
Health aspects
Uranium is a heavy metal of toxicological rather than radiological relevance in drinking-
water. In particular, it is of concern because of its impact on kidney function following
long-term exposure. Because of uncertainties regarding the toxicity of uranium for
human beings the WHO has proposed a provisional drinking-water guideline value of
15 µg/l (WHO, 2004a; 2005a). The US EPA maximum contaminant level for uranium in
drinking-water is 30 µg/l.

Occurrence
Uranium (U) is widely distributed in the geological environment, but concentrations in
groundwater are particularly high in granitic rocks and pegmatites, and locally in some
sedimentary rocks like sandstones. Uranium often occurs in oxidizing and sulphate-rich
groundwater. There are three naturally occurring isotopes of uranium: 234U (<0.01 per
cent), 235U (0.72 per cent), and 238U (99.27 per cent). All three isotopes are equally toxic.
   Concentrations of uranium in natural waters usually range between 0.1 and 10 µg/l
(Hem, 1989), but are often up to 100 µg/l in groundwater in areas underlain by granitic
rocks, and may exceed 1 mg/l near uranium mineral deposits.

Transport and attenuation
The transport of uranium in groundwater varies widely according to the aquifer
conditions. In anoxic conditions, uranium is reduced to U(IV) which is relatively
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                      99

insoluble and precipitates. In oxidizing environments, uranium exists mainly as UO2X2-
(= uranyl)-compounds with U(VI) which is considerably more soluble. Even with the
higher solubility of U(VI), transport of U(VI) can be limited as it sorbs strongly to solid
surfaces at circum-neutral pH. Very low and very high pH conditions limit sorption as
does the presence of certain complexing ligands such as natural organic matter, organic
chelating agents and carbonate, all of which can significantly enhance the transport of
uranium.


4.3        NITROGEN SPECIES
Ammonia, nitrate and nitrogen containing organic compounds of humic type are the
dominating nitrogen compounds in groundwater. Though nitrite is highly toxic, it usually
occurs only in very low concentrations in groundwater and these are not relevant to
human health. However, nitrite can become relevant from conversion of ammonia or
nitrogen in the drinking-water supply system or human body.


   NOTE X            Though nitrogen may occur naturally in groundwater, the main
                     sources of groundwater pollution are human activities such as
                     agriculture and sanitation (see Chapters 9 and 10).


Health aspects
Ammonia in drinking-water is not of direct health relevance, and therefore WHO have
not set a health-based guideline value. However, ammonia can compromise disinfection
efficiency, can cause the failure of filters for the removal of manganese, and can cause
taste and odour problems. Also in distribution systems it can lead to nitrite formation
which is of health relevance.
    The toxicity of nitrate to humans is mainly attributable to its reduction to nitrite.
Nitrite, or nitrate converted to nitrite in the body, causes a chemical reaction that can lead
to the induction of methaemoglobinaemia, especially in bottle-fed infants.
Methaemoglobin (metHb), normally present at 1-3 per cent in the blood, is the oxidized
form of haemoglobin (Hb) and cannot act as an oxygen carrier in the blood. The reduced
oxygen transport becomes clinically manifest when the proportion of metHb
concentration reaches 5-10 per cent or more of normal Hb values (WHO, 1996a). Nitrate
is enzymatically reduced in saliva forming nitrite. Additionally, in infants under one year
of age the relatively low acidity in the stomach allows bacteria to form nitrite. Up to 100
per cent of nitrate is reduced to nitrite in infants, as compared to 10 per cent in adults and
children over one year of age. When the proportion of metHb reaches 5-10 per cent, the
symptoms can include lethargy, shortness of breath and a bluish skin colour (‘blue baby
syndrome’). Anoxia and death can occur at very high uptakes of nitrite and nitrate from
drinking-water.
    Methaemoglobinaemia is observed in populations where food for infant formula in
prepared with water containing nitrate in excess of around 50 mg/l, but other factors are
also involved in disease causation. The risk is enhanced by sewage contamination. This
100                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

contributes nitrate and renders chemical conditions in the water to be reducing, thus
supporting the presence of nitrate reducing bacteria. Moreover, ingestion of microbially
contaminated water causes gastroenteritis infection which would also predispose the
infant to a nitrate reducing conditions and thereby more nitrite exposure (WHO, 2004a).
A review of numerous case studies of water-related infant methaemoglobinaemia in the
1980s indicated high correlation with microbial contamination of the water (US EPA,
1990; WHO, 2005b).
    The weight of evidence is strongly against an association between nitrite and nitrate
exposure in humans and the risk of cancer (WHO, 2004a). Studies in laboratory animals
demonstrate increased tumour incidence only after exposure to extremely high levels of
nitrite in the order of 1000 mg/l in drinking-water and simultaneously high levels of
nitrosatable precursors (WHO, 1996b). At lower nitrite levels, tumour incidence
resembled those of control groups treated with the nitrosatable compound only. On the
basis of adequately performed and reported studies, it may be concluded that nitrite itself
is not carcinogenic to animals (WHO, 1996a).
    Based on methaemoglobinaemia in infants (an acute effect), the WHO has established
a guideline value for nitrate ion of 50 mg/l as NO3- and a provisional guideline value for
nitrite of 3 mg/l as NO2- (WHO, 2004a). Because of the possibility of simultaneous
occurrence of nitrite and nitrate in drinking-water, the sum of the ratios of the
concentrations (Cnitrate or Cnitrite) of each to its guideline value (GVnitrate or GVnitrite) should
not to exceed one.

Sources and occurrence
Nitrogen is present in human and animal waste in organic form, which may then
subsequently be mineralized to inorganic forms. Ammonia (ionized as NH4+, non-
ionized as NH3) as well as urea (NH2)2CO is a major component of the metabolism of
mammals. Ammonia in the environment mainly results from animal feed lots and the use
of manures in agriculture (Chapter 9), or from on-site sanitation or leaking sewers
(Chapter 10). Thus ammonia in water is often an indicator of sewage pollution. The
nitrite ion (NO-2) contains nitrogen in a relatively unstable oxidation state. Nitrite does
not typically occur in natural waters at significant levels, except temporarily under
reducing conditions. Chemical and biological processes can further reduce nitrite to
various compounds or oxidize it to nitrate. The nitrate ion (NO-3) is the stable form of
combined nitrogen for oxygenated systems. Nitrate is one of the major anions in natural
waters, but as for ammonia, concentrations can be greatly elevated due to agricultural
activities (Chapter 9), and sanitation practices (Chapter 10).
    Natural levels of ammonia in ground and surface waters are usually below 0.2 mg/l,
and nitrate concentrations in groundwater and surface water typically range between 0-
18 mg/l as NO3-. Although elevated concentrations of nitrate in groundwater are mostly
caused by agricultural activity or sanitation practices, natural nitrate concentrations can
also exceed 100 mg/l as NO3- as observed in some arid parts of the world such as the
Sahel and north Africa (Edmunds and Gaye, 1994) and the arid interior of Australia
(Box 4.1).
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   101

                  Box 4.1. Naturally-occurring high nitrate in Australia
    High groundwater nitrate concentrations have been observed in the arid interior
    of Australia, commonly exceeding 45 mg/l, and often exceeding 100 mg/l in
    groundwater which otherwise meets national and international drinking-water
    guidelines (Lawrence, 1983; Barnes et al., 1992). The nitrate in this region is
    partially derived from nitrogen fixing by native vegetation, and by
    cyanobacteria crusts on soils. Termite mounds appear to be a significant
    contributory source of the nitrate (Barnes et al., 1992), possibly due to the
    presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria in many termite species, and the nitrogen-
    rich secretions used to build the walls of the mounds. Nitrate is leached to the
    water table in arid Australia after periodic heavy rainfall events, particularly
    after bush fires that allow soluble nitrate salts to accumulate in soils.
    Denitrification in these soils appears to be inhibited by low carbon levels.

Transport and attenuation
Ammonium (NH4+) shows a high tendency for adsorption to clay minerals, which limits
its mobility in the subsurface (saturated and unsaturated zones). In contrast, interactions
between minerals and nitrate or nitrite are usually negligible and both ions are mobile in
the subsurface.
    Under aerobic conditions in the subsurface oxidation of ammonium through nitrite to
nitrate by microorganisms is the only process where nitrate is formed in natural systems.


   DEF X             Nitrification is the biological conversion of ammonium through
                     nitrite to nitrate. Denitrification is the biological process of
                     reducing nitrate to ammonia and nitrogen gas.


    Despite the natural high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater in much of inland
Australia, there have been no verified cases of MetHb in Aboriginal people (Hearn et al.,
1993), who are the main users of groundwater in this part of the country. Because
potable quality groundwater is scarce in the interior of Australia, and because the use of
water is vital for maintaining hygiene in the region, the National Health and Medical
Research Council revised the national water quality guidelines in 1990. The revised
guidelines allow the use of groundwater with concentrations of nitrate exceeding 100
mg/l for all non-potable needs, up to 100 mg/l for potable use except for infants under 3
months old, and up to 50 mg/l for infants under 3 months old. Although technologies
exist to remove nitrate from drinking-water using microbial denitrification, the
equipment is difficult to maintain in remote aboriginal settlements, and it was considered
in this case that changing guideline concentrations would produce better health
outcomes. These changes were incorporated into the Australian drinking-water
guidelines in 1996. The autotrophic conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate
(nitrification) requires oxygen. The discharge of ammonia nitrogen into groundwater and
its subsequent oxidation can thus seriously reduce the dissolved oxygen content in
102                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

shallow groundwater, especially where high ammonia loads are applied and re-aeration
of the soil is limited.
    In the absence of dissolved oxygen (such as in some deep or confined groundwaters),
denitrification can occur, driven by denitrifying bacteria. Under fully anaerobic
conditions, in an aquifer where predominantly sulphides serve as reduction agents, the
microbial oxidation of sulphides into sulphate and simultaneous reduction of nitrate to
nitrogen gas can occur which also reduces the nitrate content.
    As microbial processes, both nitrification and denitrification are affected by many
factors that are of importance to microbial activity. Nitrification and denitrification are
optimal at about 25°C and are inhibited at 10°C or less. Other regulating factors are pH
and all factors affecting the diffusion of oxygen such as soil density, grain structure,
porosity and soil moisture. Warm, moist and well aerated soils provide ideal conditions
for nitrification. Denitrification occurs only under anoxic or almost anoxic conditions.
Beside the presence of nitrate, the denitrifying bacteria require a carbon source. A soil
moisture of more than 80 per cent has been found to be essential for denitrification. Thus
in many settings natural attenuation can substantially reduce nitrate concentrations in
groundwater over time, but rates of attenuation strongly depend on conditions in the
aquifer.


4.4       METALS
The following focuses on those metals which are toxic to humans and which have
frequently been observed as groundwater contaminants in connection with human
activities and/or have physical and chemical properties which make them potential
groundwater contaminants, i.e. cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr),
and copper (Cu).

Health aspects
Cadmium has a high renal toxicity, which is not only due to its mode of action but also to
its irreversible accumulation in the kidney. The health based guideline value for
cadmium in drinking-water is 3 µg/l (WHO, 2004a).
    Lead is a strong neurotoxin in the unborn, newborn and young children. It crosses the
placenta easily and is toxic to both the central and the peripheral nervous system, thus
causing cognitive and behavioural effects (WHO, 2004a). The threshold of
neurotoxicological concern, defined as a group based mean blood lead level, has
decreased continually during the last 10 to 20 years, and epidemiological evidence
indicates lead levels above 30 µg of lead per litre of blood to be associated with
intelligence quotient deficits in children (WHO, 2004a). The use of lead in antiknock and
lubricating agents in petrol is being phased out in many countries, thus decreasing this
source of contamination. However, a major main source of exposure to lead through
water is household plumbing systems, i.e. pipes, fittings, solder and connections from the
mains to homes. Dissolution from such materials strongly depends on chemical
properties of the drinking-water, with soft, acidic water dissolving the largest amount.
The WHO guideline value for lead in drinking-water is 10 µg/l (WHO, 2003c; 2004a).
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                103

    The significance of Nickel from the health point of view is mainly due to its high
allergenic potential. The WHO drinking-water guideline value for the protection of
sensitive persons is 20 µg/l (WHO, 2004a).
    Chromium can be found in the environment in two valency states, Cr(III) and Cr(VI).
The former predominates in soils, whereas the latter occurs exclusively as chromate
(CrO42-) from anthropogenic sources. Cr(VI) is the form which is of toxicological
significance because of its easy uptake into cells together with SO42- and PO42-. Within
cells and during its reduction to Cr(III), the chromate ion represents a considerable
genotoxic and clastogenic potential (Costa, 2002). However, since even very high doses
of Cr(VI) are subjected to rapid chemical reduction in the upper gastrointestinal tract
(Kerger et al., 1997), only negligible amounts of Cr(VI) should reach the blood
compartment and other body fluids and organs. The health based guideline value for
chromium in drinking-water is 50 µg/l (WHO, 2004a), and while higher concentrations
have been reported from some drinking-water supplies, most studies indicate the
concentration of chromium in groundwater to be low (WHO, 2003d). Cr(III) in drinking-
water may eventually be oxidized to Cr(VI) during its ozonation.
    Copper is an essential trace element with an optimal daily oral intake of 1-2 mg per
person. Naturally occurring copper concentrations in groundwater are without any health
significance and scatter mostly around 20 µg/l. If drinking-water drawn from
groundwater contains elevated levels, in most situations corrosion of copper pipes is the
primary source. Mean concentrations of more than 2 mg/l could lead to liver cirrhosis in
babies if their formula is repeatedly prepared using such water (Zietz et al., 2003). The
prevalent endpoint of acute copper toxicity by time, concentration and dose is nausea
(Araya et al., 2003). The health based guideline value for copper in drinking-water is 2
mg/l (WHO, 2004a; 2004c).

Sources and occurrence
Metals from activities such as mining, manufacturing industries, metal finishing,
wastewater, waste disposal, agriculture and the burning of fossil fuels can reach
concentrations in groundwater which are hazardous to human health. Chapter 11 lists
industry types together with the metals they commonly emit (see Table 11.2.) Metals are
natural constituents in groundwaters, having their origin in weathering and solution of
numerous minerals. However, natural concentrations of metals in groundwaters are
generally low. Typical concentrations in natural groundwaters are <10 µg/l (copper,
nickel), <5 µg/l (lead) or <1 µg/l (cadmium, chromium). Even so, the concentrations can
locally increase naturally up to levels which are of toxicological relevance and can
exceed drinking-water guidelines, e.g. in aquifers containing high amounts of heavy
metal bearing minerals (ore). Metal concentrations in groundwater may be of particular
concern where it is directly affected by manufacturing and mining as well as downstream
of abandoned waste disposal sites. Another anthropogenic cause of elevated metal
concentrations in groundwaters is the acidification of rain and soils by air pollution and
the mobilization of metals at lower pH values. This problem predominantly appears in
forested areas, because the deposition rates of the acidifying anions sulphur and nitrate
from the atmosphere are evidently higher in forests due to the large surface of needles
104                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

and leafs, and because soils in forests are generally poor in nutrients and have a low
neutralization capacity against acids.

Transport and attenuation
Most of the metals of concern occur in groundwater mainly as cations (e.g. Pb2+, Cu2+,
Ni2+, Cd2+) which generally become more insoluble as pH increases. At a nearly neutral
pH typical for most groundwaters, the solubility of most metal cations is severely limited
by precipitation as an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or phosphate mineral, or more likely
by their strong adsorption to hydrous metal oxides, clay or organic matter in the aquifer
matrix. The adsorption decreases with decreasing pH. As a consequence, in naturally or
anthropogenically acidified groundwaters metals are mobile and can travel long
distances. Furthermore, as simple cations there is no microbial or other degradation.
   In a soil solution containing a variety of heavy metal cations that tend to adsorb to
particle surfaces, there is competition between metals for the available sites. Of several
factors that determine this selectivity, ionic potential, which is equal to the charge of an
ion over its ionic radius, has a significant effect. Cations with a lower ionic potential tend
to release their solvating water molecules more readily so that inner sphere surface
complexes can be formed. Selectivity sequences are arranged in order of decreasing ionic
radius, which results in increasing ionic potential and decreasing affinity or selectivity for
adsorption. As an example the following selectivity sequence of transition elements
belonging to group IIb has been determined (Sposito, 1989):
                Hg2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+
As a consequence, mercury is the most strongly adsorbed; this being the probable reason
for its generally very low concentration occurrence in groundwater.
   Metals within the transition group differ in that electron configuration becomes more
important than ionic radius in determining selectivity. The relative affinity of some
metals belonging to different transition groups is given by:
                Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Co2+ > Fe2+ > Mn2+
However, this sequence can be more or less changed in groundwater by naturally
occurring complexing agents like fulvic acids which is especially true for copper
(Schnitzer and Khan, 1972).
   In addition, most oxyanions tend to become less strongly sorbed as the pH increases
(Sposito, 1989). Therefore, the oxyanion-forming metals such as chromium are some of
the more common trace contaminants in groundwater. Chromium is mobile as stable
Cr(VI) oxyanion species under oxidizing conditions, but forms cationic Cr(III) species in
reducing environments and hence behaves relatively immobile under these conditions.
For example, in contaminated groundwater at industrial and waste disposal sites
Chromium occurs as Cr3+ and CrO42- species, with CrO42- being much more toxic but less
common than Cr3+. In most aquifers chromium is not very mobile because of
precipitation of hydrous chromium(III)oxide. In sulphur-rich, reducing environments,
many of the trace metals also form insoluble sulphides (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2001).

4.5       ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Organic compounds in groundwater commonly derive from breakdown and leaching of
naturally occurring organic material, e.g. from organic-rich soil horizons and organic
matter associated with other geologic strata, or human activity, e.g. domestic,
agricultural, commercial and industrial activities.
    Natural sources will always contribute some organic compounds to groundwater,
often at low levels. Natural organic matter comprises water-soluble compounds of a
rather complex nature having a broad range of chemical and physical properties.
Typically, natural organic matter in groundwater is composed of humic substances
(mostly fulvic acids) and non-humic materials, e.g. proteins, carbohydrates, and
hydrocarbons (Thurman, 1985; Stevenson, 1994). While natural organic matter is a
complex, heterogeneous mixture, it can be characterized according to size, structure,
functionality, and reactivity. Natural organic matter can originate from terrestrial sources
(allochthonous natural organic matter) and/or algal and bacterial sources within the water
(autochthonous natural organic matter). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is considered
to be a suitable parameter for quantifying organic matter present in groundwater;
however, DOC is a bulk organic quality parameter and does not provide specific
identification data and may also incorporate organic compounds arising from human
activity. Natural organic matter, although considered benign, may still indirectly
influence groundwater quality. For example, contaminants may bind to organic-matter
colloids allowing their facilitated transport within groundwater, a process proposed (but
not proven) to be of most significance for the more highly sorbing organic compounds.
Also, routine chlorination of water supplies containing natural organic matter may form
disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes. However, because of their low direct
health relevance, natural organic substances are not addressed further herein.
    Human activity has released a vast range of anthropogenic organic chemicals,
commonly termed ‘micro-pollutants’, to the environment, some of which may
detrimentally impact groundwater quality. This chapter focuses on commercially and
industrially derived chemicals which (i) have a high toxicity, (ii) have physical and
chemical properties facilitating their occurrence in groundwater and (iii) have been
observed to occur frequently as groundwater contaminants. Chapter 11 lists industry
types together with substances that may potentially be released to the subsurface from
their respective industrial activities. The occurrence of organic pollutants in groundwater
is controlled not only by their use intensity and release potential, but also by their
physical and chemical properties which influence subsurface transport and attenuation.
Discussion of this aspect specific to organic chemicals follows and extends the general
concepts covered in Section 4.1.

4.5.1     Conceptual transport models for non aqueous phase liquids
A correct conceptual model of contaminant behaviour is essential for assessing
subsurface organic contaminant migration. The classical near-surface leachable source
zone – dissolved plume model presented earlier (Section 4.1.2, Figure 4.2) is not
applicable for all organic substances. Of key importance is the recognition that organic
chemicals have very different affinities for water, ranging from organic compounds that
106                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

are hydrophilic (“love” water) to organics that are hydrophobic (“fear” water). Such
concepts are used below to develop appropriate contaminant conceptual models followed
by discussion of specific transport processes applicable within the models developed.
    Water is a highly polar solvent, so polar in fact that it develops a hydrogen-bonded
structure and will easily dissolve and solvate ionic species. The vast majority of organic
compounds are covalent molecules, rather than ionic species, and most have a limited
tendency to partition or dissolve into water. Further, many organic compounds found in
groundwater are used as liquids, e.g. hydrocarbon fuels or industry solvents. A focus
upon organic liquids is hence relevant. Organic compounds that most easily partition or
dissolve into water tend to be small molecules, have a polar structure and may hydrogen-
bond with water. Typically they have only a few carbon atoms and often contain oxygen.
Examples include methanol (CH3OH) and other short-chain alcohols, e.g. ethanol and
propanols that may be used as de-icers, and ketones such as methyl-ethyl-ketone and
ethers such as dioxane that are used as industrial solvents. Some compounds are so
hydrophilic that they form a single fluid phase with the water and are said to be miscible
with the water, e.g. methanol, acetone, dioxane.
    Most organic compounds are, however, relatively hydrophobic as they are
comparatively large molecules of limited polarity with low hydrogen-bonding potential.
Most organic liquids are so hydrophobic that they form a separate organic phase to the
water (aqueous) phase. They are immiscible with water and a phase boundary exists
between the organic phase and the aqueous phase, with the organic phase generally being
referred to as the non aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). When a separate organic NAPL
exists it is important to consider the density of the NAPL relative to water as this controls
whether the NAPL will be upper or lower phase relative to the water phase. Most
hydrocarbon-based organic liquids have a density <1 (g/ml), e.g. benzene is 0.88 and
pentane is 0.63 and when in contact with water will be the upper phase and “float” upon
the water phase of density 1. Such “light” organic compounds are generally referred to as
being LNAPLs .
    In contrast, other hydrophobic organics have a relatively high density due to
incorporation of dense chlorine (or other halogen) atoms in their structure and for
example chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane
(1,1,1-TCA) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixtures have densities in the 1.1 to
1.7 range. Due to their density such organic phases will be the lower phase and ‘sink’
below the water phase. Such “dense” organic compounds are generally referred to as
DNAPLs.
    Although hydrophobic, LNAPL and DNAPL organics still have potential for some of
their organic molecules to dissolve into the adjacent aqueous phase. The organics are
‘sparingly soluble’ and will have a finite solubility value in water leading to dissolved
concentrations in the water phase. Solubility values achieved by individual organic
compounds in water are highly variable between organics and controlled by their relative
hydrophobicity. For example, small and/or polar organics have the greatest solubility
with for example dichloromethane (DCM) (CH2Cl2) being one of the most soluble with a
solubility of ca. ~20,000 mg/l, which contrasts with e.g. DDT, a large pesticide molecule
that is not easily accommodated in the polar water structure and has a solubility of just
about 0.1 mg/l. Similarly benzene, as single aromatic ring hydrocarbon, has a solubility
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   107

ca. 1,800 mg/l that is much greater than benzo[a]pyrene, a PAH of solubility ca. 0.004
mg/l that is composed of five adjacent aromatic rings.
    The above provides fundamental understanding for conceptual models of organic
contaminant transport in the subsurface and why specific organic compounds have a
tendency to occur or not occur in groundwater. Hydrophilic miscible organics behave
similarly to the classical leachable source model (Figure 4.2). In essence, a spill of e.g. a
de-icer fluid at surface would migrate as a concentrated organic-aqueous fluid through
the unsaturated zone and then migrate laterally in the groundwater as a concentrated
dissolved-phase plume. Importantly, hydrophobic immiscible organics, i.e. NAPLs,
exhibit very different behaviour. Conceptual models for LNAPL releases and DNAPL
releases (Mackay and Cherry, 1989) are shown in Figures 4.4 and 4.5.
    NAPLs may migrate as a separate NAPL phase and displace air and water from the
pores they invade if they have sufficient head (pressure) to overcome the entry pressure
to the pores or fractures. This head is controlled by aspects such as the spill volume and
rate and the vertical column of continuous NAPL developed in the subsurface. NAPL
migration is also controlled by its density and viscosity. Petrol fuel and chlorinated
solvents have viscosities lower than water and more easily migrate in the subsurface; in
contrast, PCB oils or coal tar (PAH-based) hydrocarbons may be very viscous and
perhaps take years for the NAPL to come to a resting position in the subsurface.
Chlorinated solvents such as PCE have high densities and may penetrate to significant
depths through aquifer systems in very short time periods. Whereas dissolved pesticides
may take years to decades to migrate through a 30 m unsaturated zone, DNAPL may
migrate through such a zone in the order of hours to days (Pankow and Cherry, 1996).
DNAPLs may penetrate discrete sand horizons and hairline fractures in clays and com-
promise clay units that are normally an effective barrier to dissolved plume migration.
    At the water table, LNAPLs, being less dense than water, will form a floating layer of
LNAPL on the water table often slightly elongated in the direction of the water table
hydraulic gradient. DNAPL, in contrast may penetrate as a separate immiscible DNAPL
below the water table. Predominant movement will be vertically downward due to its
density, but some lateral spreading will occur as it encounters lower permeability strata.
If spilt in sufficient volume and with sufficient driving head, the DNAPL may penetrate
the full aquifer depth to the underlying aquitard/bedrock (Kueper et al., 1993). This
should not be assumed to occur in all cases. Migrating NAPL leaves a trail of immobile
residual NAPL droplets behind its migration pathway held by capillary forces causing
NAPL to spread across an aquifer thickness. DNAPL accumulating on low permeability
features, often referred to as pools, is potentially mobile. It may ultimately penetrate that
formation due to changes in pressure arising from continued DNAPL spillage, pumping
or remediation attempts or via drilling (for boreholes, piling etc) through that layer.

   Often NAPL will remain relatively local to a site, possible exceptions being the
migration of LNAPL to a local surface water and perhaps huge NAPL spills, e.g. at a
poorly operated oil refinery/distribution facility. Risks posed to groundwater resources
and supplies are most often concerned with the migration of the dissolved-phase plume
formed by the contact of flowing groundwater with the spilt NAPL. Although the
presence of NAPL may impede the flow of groundwater, e.g. in DNAPL pools and
central LNAPL body, areas where NAPL residual saturations are lower will still be
permeable to water and NAPL dissolution will occur. Often the mass of NAPL is so
large and the dissolution (solubilization) of NAPL into water so slow that the entire
NAPL body post spill should be regarded as a largely immobile source zone able to
continuously generate a dissolved-phase solute plume of organics downgradient for years
to decades, even centuries for low-solubility NAPLs. Thus historic spill sites may still
constitute major sources of NAPL in the deep subsurface and cause very large dissolved-
phase plumes, particularly where dissolved-phase plume attenuation is limited. In
general, DNAPLs tend to pose the greatest groundwater threat as they reside deep in
groundwater systems and many, being chlorinated, are less susceptible to attenuation. In
contrast, LNAPLs are restricted to shallower groundwater-table depths, and are more
susceptible to attenuation via biodegradation.
   The above provides a basic introduction to NAPLs in groundwater. Much research
and field experience has been gained since the pioneering NAPLs research of Schwille
(1988) and the reader is referred to Mercer and Cohen (1990) and Pankow and Cherry
(1996) and references therein for further details.

4.5.2      General aspects of transport and attenuation of organics
Some of the transport and attenuation processes introduced earlier require specific
discussion for organic contaminants. Several physiochemical properties/parameters exert
a key control over subsurface organic contaminant migration. A selection of parameters
is listed in Table 4.1 for a range of organic chemicals of groundwater-health concern.
Values for a specific parameter generally vary over orders of magnitude across the listed
chemicals and infer substantial variations in transport and attenuation between organic
contaminants. Table 4.1 is not exhaustive: there are many more organic chemicals;
values of individual chemical parameters may show significant variability across the
literature; and other parameters exist, most notably half-life, that due to their dependency
on site conditions display significant variability (see Section 4.5.4 for references to some
half-life literature). For more detailed databases and their supporting literature see e.g.
US EPA (1996; 1999) and Montgomery (1996).

Volatilization
Although other processes may be enhanced in the unsaturated zone relative to the
saturated zone, e.g. biodegradation through the ready availability of oxygen,
volatilization is a key process that only occurs in the unsaturated zone. Organic
compounds with high vapour pressures (P) (>0.008 atm., i.e. xylene in Table 4.1) are
termed (volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The vapour concentration adjacent to a
NAPL or organic solid is dictated by its vapour pressure. Although volatilization of
subsurface organic contaminants, e.g. NAPL sources, may occur and organic vapours
potentially lost to the above ground atmosphere, VOCs are nevertheless very widely
encountered in groundwaters; possible reasons include many VOCs are NAPLs of
relatively high solubility (S) and low sorbing potential (Koc). Vapours migrate due to
diffusion and advection within the air phase and may migrate due to pressure
(barometric) and temperature fluctuations, water infiltration and preferential conduit
routes (Mendoza et al., 1996). In relation to vapour-phase diffusion, it is emphasized
diffusion coefficients in the air phase are ~4 orders of magnitude greater that the water
phase. This allows much greater opportunity for lateral (radial) migration of vapour
plumes and, due to vapour contact, contamination of underlying groundwaters over a
wide area (Rivett, 1995).
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                  111

   Partitioning of dissolved organic solutes between a contaminated water phase and an
adjacent air-phase is controlled by the Henry’s Law partition coefficient:
               H=CA / CW                                                         (Eqn. 4.4)
where H is the Henry’s Law constant, CW is the concentration of an organic compound
in water and CA is its vapour concentration in the gaseous phase. It should be noted that
similar concentration units will yield a dimensionless (i.e. unitless) H value, however, the
air concentration is often expressed in terms of pressure and hence H values may be
quoted with units of the type atmos m3 mol-1, e.g. for benzene H (dimensionless) is 0.24
and with units H is 5.5x10-3 atmos m3 mol-1 (Table 4.1).

Solubilization
As indicated in Section 4.5.1, the differing hydrophobic nature of organic compounds
means their solubility in water varies over orders of magnitude (Table 4.1). Solubility
values represent maximum concentrations that may be achieved in a dissolved-phase
plume. VOC contaminants, e.g. benzene and TCE tend to be small molecules that are
moderately soluble, amenable to analysis and hence often detected in groundwater.
Although solubilities are relatively low compared to inorganic ions, they may
nevertheless achieve concentrations 4-5 orders of magnitude greater than drinking-water
standards or guideline values. Larger molecular weight organics will have lower
solubilities, hence concentrations e.g. of DDT in groundwater may only reach about 0.1
mg/l (its solubility).Thus DDT at solubility only exceeds the WHO guideline value of 1
µg/l by a factor of approx. 50, hence allowing for dilution and some attenuation, the
prospects of exceeding the DDT standard in groundwater are low except in close
proximity to a DDT source. DDT’s high hydrophobicity and hence high sorption (see
below) tends to cause DDT (and other organic chemicals of similar properties, e.g. high
molecular weight PCBs and PAHs) to perhaps be more of a soil rather than a
groundwater problem.

Sorption
Sorption exerts a key control over the transport of anthropogenic organic contaminants.
Organic sorption is a complex topic, a detailed review is provided by Allen-King et al.
(2002). Sorption is a function of the properties of both the organic solute and aquifer
solid. Hydrophobic non-ionic organic contaminants preferentially sorb to the low-
polarity components of geosolids, e.g. any organic material present. Sorption is inversely
related to organic compound solubility; the more hydrophobic and less soluble an
organic solute, the greater its intrinsic potential for sorption to any organic material
present in the aquifer solids. Hence hydrophilic organics have negligible sorption, and
mild to moderately hydrophobic organics such as the VOCs show limited sorption. In
contrast, hydrophobic, high molecular weight, large organics such as PAHs and PCBs of
low solubility exhibit high sorption (Table 4.1).
    An additional measure of organic compound hydrophobicity often used in sorption
research is the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) (Table 4.1), that is simply an
equilibrium partitioning of the organic solute between the organic octanol phase and
112                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

water phase. The higher the Kow value, the more hydrophobic, less soluble and more
sorptive the organic compound.
   The degree of sorption is also controlled by the sorption potential of the sorbate, i.e.
the aquifer material that dissolved concentrations in groundwater contact. Frequently
sorption is assumed to be at equilibrium and linear with organic solute concentrations,
the magnitude of sorption being expressed by the sorption partition coefficient Kd:
                Kd = CS / CW                                                       (Eqn. 4.5)
where CS is the sorbed concentration. The main sorbing phase for organic solutes is any
organic material present in the rock phase originating for example from organic detritus,
e.g. humic material, deposited at the time of rock deposition. This organic material is
referred to as the fraction of organic carbon (foc) within the geologic or soil matrix.
Although foc values may be on the order of one per cent or more in organic-rich soil
horizons, many aquifers comprise geologic strata with low foc values, e.g. an foc~0.02 per
cent is recorded for the Borden glaciolacustrine sands, Canada (Rivett and Allen-King,
2003). The foc, even at such low concentrations, may still be the dominant sorption phase
rather than poorly sorbing mineral surfaces. Simultaneous laboratory measurements of foc
and Kd have shown that they are approximately linearly related, with the constant of
proportionality being termed the organic-carbon partition coefficient (Koc) of the specific
organic solute (Table 4.1). Typically practitioners assessing sorption controls now obtain
Koc values from databases (e.g. US EPA, 1996), measure the aquifer foc (Heron et al.,
1997) and estimate the sorption Kd from the relationship:
                Kd = foc Koc                                                       (Eqn. 4.6)
where foc is in mass fraction dimensionless units, e.g. expressed as 0.0002 rather than as
0.02 per cent. Hence the greater the foc of the aquifer deposits (e.g. higher values are often
found in shallow soils or recent sub-river, i.e. hyporheic zone), and greater the Koc (Table
4.1), which will increase with solute hydrophobicity, the greater the Kd value, i.e.
sorption. Assuming ideal linear equilibrium sorption and calculation of Kd from the
above, the retardation factor Ri of organic solute i may be estimated from:

                Ri=1+(ρ/η)Kd                                                       (Eqn. 4.7)

where ρ and η are the bulk density and porosity of the porous media respectively.
   The above hydrophobic partitioning ideal sorption approach is an approximation of
reality; it provides a reasonable first estimate. It should be recognized, however, that non-
ideal sorption processes may be significant (Allen-King et al., 2002); these include slow
equilibration of sorbed and dissolved phases, dependence of the degree of sorption on
dissolved concentration magnitude and the presence of any competing, also sorbing,
solutes within multi-contaminant plumes. Further, the nature of the foc, i.e. ratio of the
carbon-hydrogen-oxygen contents, has an important control on the sorption that occurs.
   It is often useful to combine some of the above parameters visually to assess how
organic contaminants may comparatively behave. Figure 4.6 plots Kow, a measure of
compound hydrophobicity that will indicate solubility and sorptive retardation trends
against vapour pressure, a measure of volatilization tendency. The figure indicates PAHs
are unlikely to volatilize and will undergo high sorption, and this would infer that
                 Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation               113

soil/unsaturated zone solids concentrations of PAHs could often be high (frequently the
case) and perhaps there is relatively limited development of PAH plumes to groundwater
(often relatively small plumes are encountered). The chlorinated hydrocarbons, in
contrast, are volatile but of low sorption potential. It is likely they would vaporize (and
potentially be a vapour hazard to receptors at the soil surface) and also leach to ground-
water leaving low concentrations in soils and unsaturated samples (quite often the case).

Chemical reactions
Although there are a multitude of possible chemical reactions (abiotic reactions, i.e. not
mediated by bacteria), reactions of low-concentration organics in a water-based
environment tend to be fairly limited. Perhaps the most common reaction is that of
slightly positively charged organic compounds (Cδ+) with negatively charged
(nucleophilic) species, such as HS-, OH- or water. The latter is a hydrolysis reaction.
Reactive organic solutes tend to be organic halides, particularly brominated compounds
and to a lesser extent chlorinated compounds. An example of a chemical reaction is that
of the chlorinated solvent 1,1,1-TCA which was commonly used to degrease metals and
circuit boards (as a less toxic replacement to TCE, before concerns were raised about its
ozone-depletion potential). TCA in water will either undergo an elimination reaction to
yield 1,1-DCE, or alternatively a sequential hydrolysis reaction replacing all the chlorine
atoms as chloride to yield ethanoic acid. Interestingly it may also biodegrade to
predominantly form a different product, 1,1,-DCA (Klecka et al., 1990). Further
information on chemical reactions in water may be found in Schwarzenbach et al.
(1993).
114                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

Biodegradation
Bacteria degrade organic contaminants to simpler, often less toxic, products.
Biodegradation is perceived to be the primary attenuation process that may mitigate
dissolved-plume impacts to receptors by organic chemicals. monitored natural
attenuation (MNA) remedial strategies generally have their main focus upon
demonstration of occurrence of biodegradation (Wiedemeier et al., 1999). This not only
entails monitoring the disappearance of the organic contaminant, but also the appearance
of intermediate organic contaminants that may themselves persist or be further
biodegraded, ideally to benign inorganic products, e.g. water, carbon dioxide, chloride.
    Monitoring of the inorganic hydrochemistry is also a key requirement to assessing
biodegradation occurrence. Sites may be initially aerobic/oxic (containing oxygen), and
under these conditions biodegradation of many contaminants is often the most rapid.
Dissolved oxygen concentrations in groundwater are usually low, maximally ~10 mg/l.
Such levels can easily be depleted by even low to moderate levels of organic
contamination present and are not easily renewed as dispersive mixing in groundwaters
to allow oxygen re-entry is typically low. Other electron acceptors, for example sulphate,
nitrate, iron and manganese, are then used to allow biodegradation to continue under
anaerobic conditions. Finally site conditions may become so reducing that
biodegradation occurs under methanogenic conditions.
    Specific examples of biodegradation are included in the sections that follow. In
general, most hydrocarbon-based compounds and most oxygenated-organics are
relatively biodegradable under a wide range of conditions, and natural attenuation of
such plumes often significant. Chlorinated (halogenated) compounds are generally less
biodegradable but evidence has increasingly shown that they do biodegrade under
appropriate redox-bacterial conditions. A sequence of reactions under varying redox
conditions may be required to allow complete biodegradation to benign products. This
means that for some contaminants and sites full biodegradation to benign products is
difficult and there may be persistence of both the original contaminants and their
intermediate degradation products, both of which may have toxicity.

4.5.3     Organic chemicals of major concern in groundwater
Consideration of the above transport and attenuation processes, together with data on
organic chemical toxicity, use of chemicals and associated potential for release to the
subsurface, and actual chemical occurrence in groundwater data, enables identification of
groups of organic chemicals, as well as individual chemicals, thought to be of major
concern in groundwater. Two organic chemical groups of key concern include:
   • aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX);
   • chlorinated hydrocarbons (aliphatic and aromatic): dichloromethane (DCM),
        trichloromethane (TCM, also known as chloroform), tetrachloromethane (also
        known as carbon tetrachloride, CTC), trichloroethene (TCE), tetrachloroethene
        (PCE, also known as perchloroethylene), vinyl chloride (VC), 1,2-
        dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), 1,2-dichloroethene
        (cis and trans isomers, cDCE and tDCE respectively), 1,2 dichlorobenzene (1,2-
        DCB) and 1,4 dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB).
   Properties of the above compounds are included in Table 4.1.

   Figure 4.7 presents data based upon 250 sites in Germany and 500 sites in the USA
(Kerndorff et al., 1992) and indicates the prevalence of the above compounds in
groundwater. A third (predominantly) organic chemical group of key concern in
groundwater is pesticides.

Figure 4.7. The 25 most frequently detected organic groundwater contaminants at hazardous waste
sites in Germany (250 sites) and the USA (500 sites) (based on concentrations ≥ 1µg/l) (adapted
from Kerndorff et al., 1992)

   Of the many organic chemicals that may potentially contaminate groundwater, these
three groups have perhaps received the most attention from both the groundwater
practitioner and research communities during the 1980s and 1990s. The following
Sections 4.5.4, 4.5.5 and 4.6 are hence devoted to these three groups.
   The focus upon the above three groups does not preclude the potential importance of
other organic contaminants in groundwater. Although compounds may perhaps not
occur frequently due to restricted use within specialized industries, some compounds
may have low natural attenuation (NA) properties and potentially develop extensive
plumes. Other chemical groups may, in contrast, have received widespread industrial
use, but were perhaps thought (sometimes mistakenly) to pose a much lower risk to
groundwater due to high NA properties. Examples of the latter may include PAHs and
PCBs that are both briefly discussed below.
116                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

    PAHs are a component of creosotes and coal tars frequently associated with former
gasworks and coal carbonization (coking) works (Johansen et al., 1997). They are a
diverse class of compounds of natural and anthropogenic origin, some of which show
carcinogenic properties. WHO has derived a guideline value of 0.7 µg/l for
benzo(a)pyrene because it may be released from coal tar coatings of drinking-water
distribution pipes. Most PAHs have extremely low solubilities in water and have a high
tendency to adsorb to the organic matrix of soils and sediments, particularly the higher
molecular mass, higher-ring PAHs, e.g. the 5-ring benzo(a)pyrene. Thus, they are gene-
rally not found in water in notable concentrations, and human exposure is mostly through
food prepared at high temperatures and air (particularly from open fires) (WHO, 2004a).
Countering the processes that may serve to attenuate groundwater impacts, however, are:
(i) creosote and coal tars may occur as a DNAPL (density is composition dependent, but
may be around 1.05) and slowly migrate as a DNAPL deep into the subsurface
potentially penetrating the water table; and (ii) higher molecular mass, higher ring-
member PAHs are much more resistant to biodegradation and hence dissolved plumes,
although slow to develop, may persist and grow over decades (King and Barker, 1999).
    PCBs are a class of stable compounds, each containing a biphenyl nucleus (two
linked benzene rings) with two or more substituent chlorine atoms. PCBs are produced
industrially as complex mixtures that often contain between 40 and 60 different
chlorinated biphenyls. Similar to PAHs, most PCBs are of low solubility in water and
sorptive and hence dissolved-phase plumes in groundwater tend not to be large.
However, PCB oils, historically used in electrical transformer facilities, are DNAPLs and
may potentially penetrate deep into aquifer systems. Dissolved PCBs are generally slow
to biodegrade and hence PCBs, like PAHs, may serve as long-term sources of
groundwater contamination.
    An emergent groundwater issue in the 1990s relating to hydrocarbon fuels has been
the use of oxygenates, particularly methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and methanol or
ethanol within fuels (Squillace et al., 1996). Use of MTBE has been most significant in
the USA with MTBE first used in gasoline at greater than 10 per cent by volume in 1992.
MTBE has a strong taste and odour and is likely to impair drinking-water quality at
concentrations in the 0.01-0.1 mg/l range. However, because of its low relevance to
human health, MTBE is not further discussed in this chapter; see WHO (2005c) for
further information on MTBE.

4.5.4     Aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX)
Health aspects
Mononuclear (single-ring) aromatic hydrocarbons such as BTEX are amongst the most
common groundwater contaminants (Figure 4.7) and the main aromatic faction of many
hydrocarbon fuels. The key compound of health relevance within the BTEX group is
benzene, a proven carcinogen in humans. The mechanism or metabolic form by which it
exerts its action (haematological changes, including leukaemia) is not clear. WHO
(2004a) has established a guideline value for benzene in drinking-water of 10 µg/l,
corresponding to a lifespan risk of 10-5 to contract cancer by exposure to benzene via
drinking-water. Alkylated benzenes are much less toxic than benzene, and
correspondingly their WHO guideline values are 700 µg/l for toluene, 300 µg/L for
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                117

ethylbenzene and 500 µg/l for xylene (WHO, 2004a), whereas no health-based guideline
values are given for trimethylbenzenes and butylbenzene. However, some of them may
be perceived by odour and/or taste at only a few micrograms per litre.

Sources and occurrence
The aromatic hydrocarbons BTEX are the primary contaminants of concern associated
with point-sources of fuels and fuel-related contamination originating from petroleum
production, refining and wholesale and retail distribution (service stations) of petroleum
products (Newell et al., 1995). They are also used as solvents and raw materials in
chemical production. Spills and accidental releases of gasoline (petrol), kerosene and
diesel are common sources of their occurrence in the environment. The German-USA
groundwater survey data in Figure 4.7 indicate BTEX was relatively common, benzene
being the most prominent.

Transport and attenuation
Most petroleum products are LNAPLs and hence the Figure 4.4 conceptual model
applies. BTEX components typically comprise just a few per cent of the LNAPL fuel.
BTEX concentrations dissolving in groundwater near fuel sources are reduced from their
pure-phase solubility values (as individual component solubilized concentrations form
NAPL mixtures depend upon the mass (strictly mole) faction of that component in the
NAPL). BTEX-aromatics, being the most soluble hydrocarbons, are still the main risk
driver for groundwater at hydrocarbon-contaminated sites, as solubilized concentrations
and mobility of other alkane (branched and straight-chain) and PAH hydrocarbons are
much lower. Since the early 1990s, it has been recognized that natural attenuation (NA)
of BTEX is highly significant at most sites due to the high biodegradability of BTEX
under a range of conditions. Monitored natural attenuation, i.e. monitoring of the growth,
stability and eventual decline of dissolved-phase BTEX plumes, has indeed become a
viable and cost-effective remediation option at many sites rather than active remedial
measures such as pump-and-treat (McAllister and Chiang, 1994).
    Studies that have examined dissolved-phase hydrocarbon plume lengths from over
600 hydrocarbon-release sites in the USA are particularly instructive on the potential for
NA applicability (Newell and Connor, 1998; Wiedemeier et al., 1999 and references
therein). Of the 604 plumes evaluated, 86 per cent were less than 300 feet (~100 m) long
with only 2 per cent of plumes greater than 900 feet. One of the studies that examined
271 plumes indicated only 8 per cent of these plumes were still growing, 59 per cent of
plumes were approximately stable as mass being dissolved from the source was balanced
by mass being depleted by attenuation (biodegradation), and 33 per cent of plumes were
shrinking as source mass inputs declined or biodegradation of contaminants perhaps
became increasingly efficient with time. These studies hence provide a strong rationale
for occurrence of NA across a variety of site conditions. Under the vast majority of
circumstances the potential for impacts of hydrocarbon plumes is limited to distances of
a few hundred meters from source zones. Thus although hydrocarbon sources can be
numerous, hydrocarbon and BTEX impacts are likely to remain local to those sources
zones. However, although dissolved-phase plume may extend to relatively short
distances from source areas, LNAPL source zones (i.e. pancake-like of hydrocarbon)
118                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

themselves can on occasion be very extensive, for example Albu et al. (2002) depict
zones of LNAPL extending over 5 km around oil refinery sites near Ploiesti, Romania.
    Much insight into the importance of biodegradation and associated controlling factors
has been obtained in plume studies. A controlled injection of dissolved-phase benzene,
toluene and xylene at the Borden site, Canada (Barker et al., 1987) showed complete
benzene, toluene and xylene biodegradation by just over 400 days with only benzene
persisting beyond 270 days. This study, and many real spill sites indicate BTEX are
readily degraded when dissolved oxygen is present in groundwater. Under anaerobic
conditions, rates of biodegradation of remaining hydrocarbon was governed by both the
rate of oxygen re-entry across the contaminant plume fringe and rates of alternative
anaerobic biodegradation pathways using less efficient electron acceptors such as nitrate,
sulphate, and iron(III). Many other field sites have demonstrated the importance of
anaerobic processes, primarily through changes in the groundwater geochemistry. For
example, the Plattsburgh, Hill and Patrick Air Force Bases in the USA (Wiedemeier et
al., 1999) indicate development of depleted dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulphate
coincident with the BTEX plumes as these electron acceptors are consumed in the oxida-
tion of the BTEX. pH declines as well as production of Fe(II) and methane arising from
methanogenic activity were also evident where the most reducing conditions prevailed.
    A myriad of aerobic and anaerobic BTEX biodegradation rates are available from the
literature, e.g. data and references within Wiedemeier et al. (1999) and Noble and
Morgan (2002). Rates are typically expressed as a first order rate constant or an
equivalent half-life. Table 4.2 summarizes half-life data provided in the review by Noble
and Morgan (2002) for BTEX, naphthalene and some chlorinated hydrocarbons. These
chemicals represent the most studied groundwater contaminants in relation to
biodegradation. The table subdivides rate data between laboratory and field studies that
are in turn subdivided to aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Although the work of Noble
and Morgan is reasonably comprehensive and based upon many citations, it should be
noted that Table 4.2 aims to be illustrative rather than comprehensive of all literature
available on biodegradation rates for the chemicals listed; biodegradation is an active
area of study worldwide and half-life data continue to be published.
    Rates selected for risk assessment modelling at other sites (where field data are
insufficient to determine rates) need to be used with care as modelling results, and hence
plume attenuation predicted and any site risk-based remediation standards computed, are
very sensitive to degradation mass-loss parameters selected. Rates may vary significantly
for individual compounds that may be a reflection of rates being lab-based or field based
and the particular aerobic-anaerobic site conditions. This is apparent from examination of
Table 4.2. Also, field biodegradation rates may be derived from a localized point
measurement, or more often a rate predicted from whole plume behaviour that will
average varying rates and different biodegradation processes and aerobic/anaerobic
conditions occurring throughout the plume.
    The laboratory half-lives in Table 4.2 are generally shorter than the equivalent field-
based values, i.e. plumes are apparently more persistent in the field presumably as a
reflection of field conditions, e.g. supply of electron acceptors being less optimal than
can be achieved in a laboratory. In general, BTEX degradation rates will be lower under
anaerobic conditions and plume may be persistent and indeed attain significant lengths
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                  119

where groundwater is naturally anaerobic, e.g. confined aquifer conditions. This is
reasonably demonstrated by the Table 4.2 field data, but less so by the laboratory-based
data; the latter is in part from the limited studies undertaken (at least reported) for some
of the chemicals. A cautionary approach is warranted to the application to sites of the
half-life data provided in Table 4.2 (and elsewhere); clearly the range in half-life values
for a specific contaminant is large and for some contaminants and conditions insufficient
data exist to yield a reliable average and range. Some Table 4.2 entries are based on a
single study, in some cases no data are provided. The latter may be a reflection of a
genuine lack of data or else biodegradation not being effective under the specific
conditions (e.g. aerobic biodegradation of PCE).

4.5.5     Chlorinated hydrocarbons
Health aspects
A number of aliphatic and aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons are of health significance
because of their toxicity and occurrence in drinking-water, particularly as in
groundwater, their concentrations do not decrease rapidly through volatilisation,
anaerobic degradation is slow, and in consequence contaminants may persist for some
time.
WHO (2004) gives guideline values for dichloromethane (DCM), trihalomethanes
chloromethane (e.g. chloroform which may be generated as by-products of disinfection),
tetrachloromethane (also known as carbon tetrachloride, CTC), trichloroethene (TCE),
tetrachloroethene (PCE, also known as perchloroethylene), vinyl chloride (VC), 1,2-
dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), 1,2-dichloroethene (cis and
trans isomers, cDCE and tDCE respectively), 1,2 dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB) and 1,4
dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) (see Table 4.1 for selected physiochemical parameter
values). Generally, among the saturated chlorinated compounds, the 1,1- halogenated
ones (e.g. 1,1-dichloroethane) are of less health concern than the 1,2-halogenated ones
(e.g. 1,2-DCA), since they are metabolized differently. This is also true for higher
halogenated compounds (e.g. trichloroethanes).
    Dichloromethane (DCM, also known as methylene chloride) is of low acute toxicity,
and current evidence suggests that it is not a genotoxic carcinogen. The WHO drinking-
water guideline value for DCM is 20 µg/l, based on hepatotoxic effects observed in rats
(WHO, 2004a). Carbon tetrachloride (CTC) has a WHO guideline value of 4 µg/l based
on its liver toxicity, and from carcinogenic effects observed in laboratory animals it is
classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans. 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is
potentially genotoxic and a proven carcinogen in experimental animals with a WHO
guideline value of 30 µg/L (WHO, 2003d; 2004a).
    Trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE) may degrade to the more toxic
vinyl chloride. The provisional WHO guideline value for TCE is 70 µg/l based on liver
effects in mice (WHO, 2004a; 2005d). PCE causes nervous disorders at high dose,
whereas at lower doses kidney and liver damage have been reported. It is classified as
possible human carcinogen with overall evidence indicating that it is not genotoxic
(WHO, 2003e), and its WHO guideline value for drinking-water is 40 µg/l (WHO,
2004a). Vinyl chloride (VC) is genotoxic and carcinogenic in experimental animals as
well as in humans. Administered orally to experimental animals, it produced cancer at a
variety of sites (WHO, 2004d). Its WHO drinking-water guideline value is 0.3 µg/l
(WHO, 2004a).
    1,1-Dichloroethene (1.1-DCE) is a weak in vitro-mutagen and not classifiable as to its
carcinogenicity to humans. It is a central nervous system depressant and may cause liver
and kidney toxicity. The WHO guideline value is 30 µg/l (WHO, 2004a; 2005e). Among
the two isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene, the cis-form is detected more frequently and at
higher concentrations than the trans-form as a water contaminant, since the former is the
main anaerobic metabolite of TCE and PCE. As such it may indicate as well the
presence of vinyl chloride, the next anaerobic breakdown product, which is not only
much more toxic than all higher chlorinated ethenes but also a genotoxic human
carcinogen (see above). In contrast, both 1,2-DCEs do not seem to be genotoxic and
122                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

there is no information on their carcinogenic potential. The WHO drinking-water
guideline value for each of the 2 isomers is 50 µg/l (WHO, 2003f; 2004a).
   Dichlorobenzenes are the least toxic of this group of contaminants. Their health based
guideline values in drinking-water are 300 and 1000 µg/l for 1,2- and 1,4-DCB,
respectively. These exceed their odour threshold range of 0.3-30 µg/l by far (WHO,
2003g; 2004a).

Sources and occurrence
Chlorinated hydrocarbons are employed in a variety of industrial activities, including
almost any facility where degreasing, e.g. of metals, circuit boards, textiles (dry cleaning)
and animal/leather hides, metal stripping, chemical manufacturing, pesticide production
or other activities where chlorinated solvents, cleaners, dry cleaning fluids, paint
removers are used (Chapter 11).
   In many industrialized countries, chlorinated hydrocarbons are the most frequently
detected groundwater contaminants at hazardous waste sites (Kerndorff et al., 1992;
Plumb, 1992; NRC, 1994). This is highlighted by the German-USA survey data in
Figure 4.7. TCE and PCE together with their principal metabolites cDCE and VC have
been the most frequently detected chlorinated hydrocarbons at the investigated sites.
Point source release of chlorinated hydrocarbons to groundwater is anticipated to be the
main source of groundwater contamination. Complex mixtures of chlorinated
hydrocarbons may arise from leakages at hazardous waste disposal sites where many
solvent types may have been disposed. In contrast, spills at industrial
manufacturing/processing sites may well comprise liquid chlorinated hydrocarbon as a
DNAPL with a high proportion of a single chlorinated hydrocarbon component. A
multitude of point sources exist in many urban areas due to the diversity and frequency
of chlorinated hydrocarbon users.
   Examples of regional chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination within aquifers
underlying urban towns and cities emerged during the 1980s. Many groundwater
supplies or monitoring wells were contaminated in some instances, particularly by TCE
and to a lesser extent PCE. Examples include Milan, Italy (Cavallero et al., 1985); the
New Jersey coastal plain aquifer, USA (Fusillo, 1985) and Birmingham, United
Kingdom (Rivett et al., 1990); the latter example is described in Box 4.2.

Transport and attenuation
Many of the chlorinated hydrocarbons will have entered the subsurface in the DNAPL
form and may reside to significant depths within aquifers (Pankow and Cherry, 1996).
They typically have low to medium water solubility (in the range of 0.2-20 g/l;
Table 4.1). Dissolution of DNAPL sources is expected to be slow taking years to
decades, particularly from long lengths of residual DNAPL pools that have invaded or
diffused into low-permeability strata. Dissolved-phase plumes of chlorinated
hydrocarbons can be very extensive, for example Mackay and Cherry (1989) depict
several plumes in the km-scale and Jackson (1998) several plumes in the alluvial aquifers
of the southwestern USA that are around 10 km in length. Some plumes have lead to
high profile court cases and set legal precedents on apportioning liability for historic
contamination events, e.g. the near 2-km PCE plume that caused contamination of the

Sawston public water supply borehole in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom (Ashley,
1998).

         Box 4.2. Chlorinated-hydrocarbon contamination of groundwater in
    Birmingham, United Kingdom (based on Rivett et al., 1990; Rivett et al., 2005)
   Birmingham is the second largest city in the United Kingdom and has a long
   history of manufacturing, particularly in metal-related industries. Groundwater
   samples were taken during the late 1980s from 59 abstraction boreholes
   typically screened over 100 m in the Triassic Sandstone aquifer underlying the
   city. Chlorinated solvents were found to be widespread, particularly TCE
   detected in 78 per cent of abstraction boreholes with over 40 per cent of the
   sampled boreholes showing concentrations over 30 µg/l to a maximum of
   5500 µg/l. The majority of highly contaminated abstractions were located in
   solvent-user sites, predominantly metals-related industry. The predominance of
   TCE was ascribed to its main United Kingdom use within metal cleaning
   applications since the 1930s. PCE was less evident as it has generally only been
   used for dry cleaning in the United Kingdom since 1950s. Lower TCA
   occurrence was ascribed to its much later introduction in the United Kingdom
   starting about 1965 as a less toxic replacement to TCE. Greatest groundwater
   contamination occurred in the Tame valley area that was hydrogeologically
   vulnerable due to low depths to groundwater and limited aquifer protection by
   low permeability drift. Moderate contamination was present in other less
   vulnerable areas of the unconfined aquifer with least contamination evident in
   the Mercia Mudstone confined aquifer.
   The aquifer was re-visited a decade later during the late 1990s. Declines in
   industrial use of groundwater meant only 36 abstractions were active and
   available for sampling, of these 26 were from the 1980s survey. Overall
   contamination detected was less and attributed to most of the new boreholes
   being located in industry areas where solvent use appeared limited. Also, many
   of the former highly contaminated abstractions had ceased operation due to
   industry closure. The latter was of some concern as contamination previously
   inadvertently captured by such abstractions was now able to more freely migrate
   into the wider aquifer. Comparison of the 26 abstractions common to both
   surveys indicated contamination at individual boreholes was at similar or greater
   concentrations in the more recent survey compared to the decade-earlier survey.
   These levels are unlikely to be due to major ongoing contamination, rather, it is
   reasonably assumed that incidences of new contamination will have declined
   over the decade as industry has become much more environmentally aware. The
   sustained level of contamination was hence ascribed to persistent sources of
   chlorinated solvents, likely DNAPL sources at depth. These will have remained
   unaffected by remedial works implemented at many sites to date because under
   a land redevelopment focused agenda these predominantly focused upon
   shallow soil and groundwater problems.
124                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Under aerobic conditions, biodegradation of solvents such as TCE and PCE can be
limited to non-existent and may account for the extensive plume examples noted above.
Sorption is often limited too, particularly for the less hydrophobic compounds where
compound solubility exceeds 1g/l (Table 4.1). A controlled emplacement of a DNAPL
chlorinated solvent source in the Borden aquifer research site, Canada, resulted in TCM
and TCE plumes exhibiting near conservative behaviour with retardation factors in the
range of 1.0-1.2 and no evidence of biodegradation for these solvents and also PCE that
was more retarded at about 1.6 (Rivett et al., 2001; Rivett and Allen-King, 2003).
Dispersion of these plumes, although moderate in this relatively homogeneous sand
aquifer, nevertheless produced leading plume contours at concentrations in the range of
drinking-water standards that had travelled toward 100 per cent further than the mean
advection (groundwater) velocity.
    In contrast, other sites have shown significant natural attenuation of chlorinated
hydrocarbons due to biodegradation activity. The most well known biodegradation
pathways are those involving the sequential reductive dechlorination of chlorinated
hydrocarbons where lesser chlorinated organics, chloride and ultimately hydrocarbons
such as ethane or ethane, are formed (Vogel et al., 1987), e.g. PCE is transformed to
TCE to cDCE (usually the predominant isomer) to VC to ethene. On average chlorinated
hydrocarbon plumes are significantly longer than the aforementioned BTEX plumes. For
example, Newell et al. (1990) reported a median length of 1000 feet (about 300 m) for
chlorinated ethene (PCE, TCE, DCE, VC) plumes (88 sites sampled).
    Biodegradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons has proven to be relatively complicated
with five possible degradation processes (Wiedemeier et al., 1999). Most chlorinated
compounds have been observed to biodegrade by three or four of these processes, only
DCE and VC may biodegrade via all five processes. Under anaerobic or low oxygen
conditions degradation processes include (i) dehalorespiration, in which the chlorinated
hydrocarbon is used as the electron acceptor and effectively respired, (ii) direct anaerobic
oxidation and (iii) anaerobic co-metabolism. Under aerobic conditions, further processes
are (iv) direct aerobic oxidation and (v) aerobic co-metabolism. Direct processes involve
the chlorinated hydrocarbon being used as the primary growth substrate.
Dehalorespiration and co-metabolism both require an alternative primary growth
substrate to be present. That primary substrate is normally a relatively biodegradable
substrate and may include anthropogenic carbon such as BTEX contamination.
Alternatively, anaerobic conditions may be driven by high levels of naturally occurring
carbon acting as the substrate, a primary example being wetland sediments and sub
riverbed deposits, e.g. Lorah and Olsen (1999) observed TCE and 1,1,2,2-PCE
dechlorinations in the former.
    Due to the complexity of biodegradation processes outlined, there is a wide
divergence in reported biodegradation rates of chlorinated hydrocarbons (Wiedemeier et
al., 1999; Noble and Morgan, 2002; Table 4.2). This is clearly illustrated by the Table
4.2 half-life data for the more common chlorinated hydrocarbon groundwater
contaminants, e.g. DCE field-based half life data vary from just 42 days to nearly 17 000
days. Also, Table 4.2 indicates laboratory half-life data are generally much shorter (by 1-
2 orders of magnitude) than equivalent field data, e.g. TCE data under anaerobic
conditions indicate a laboratory half life mean of 43 days compared to a field mean of
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   125

1460 days. This is perhaps ascribed to the fact that optimal anaerobic reducing conditions
can be achieved in the laboratory for the whole sample, whereas in the field such
anaerobic conditions may in fact only occur in localized portions of a plume. Table 4.2
emphasizes the sensitivity of half life to aerobic and anaerobic conditions and that much
longer half life values may occur for chlorinated hydrocarbons relative to the aromatics.
The above strongly endorses the need to recognize that literature half-life data have very
significant uncertainty when applied in a predictive manner to sites elsewhere. The
unfortunate reality is that most sites require individual case-by-case assessment to allow
effective prediction of natural attenuation rates.


4.6        PESTICIDES
Pesticides represent a wide range of compounds used mostly as insecticides, herbicides,
and fungicides. Formerly a small number of classes of chemicals included most
pesticides, i.e. organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, phenoxyacetic acids and
triazine herbicides. However, modern pesticides include other types of chemicals, and
therefore such a classification is of more limited use for descriptive purposes. Many of
the historically used pesticides, such as the organochlorines, are however
environmentally persistent and may pose a long-term groundwater problem.

Health aspects
In general, health effects associated with pesticides are specific for each chemical. This is
reflected in their different WHO guideline values for drinking-water quality (see WHO,
2004a) and in the wide range of acceptable daily intake values derived by the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) for exposure through food (resulting from pesticide
uses on crops; FAO, 2004). Most health effect studies are conducted using single
compounds, little is known about effects associated with pesticide mixtures. Health
effects from acute (short-term and high level) or chronic (long-term and low-level)
exposure include liver and kidney damage, major interference with nervous, immune and
reproductive system functions, birth defects and cancer. In most cases the risk from food
contaminated by unduly high levels of pesticides is likely to be more significant than that
posed by pesticide levels in drinking-water.
    Chronic exposure associated with pesticides has declined in Europe and North
America as many of the more persistent herbicides (such as chlordane, DDT, dieldrin,
endrin, heptachlor, γ-HCH and toxaphene) have been restricted or phased out (Barnard et
al., 1997). They have been replaced with less persistent and more species-specific
toxicants. While acute toxicities have often increased, some important new biologically-
derived insecticides have very low mammalian toxicity.

Sources and occurrence
Pesticides are intentionally applied to protect crops in agriculture (Chapter 9) as well as
to control pests and unwanted vegetation in gardens, buildings, railway tracks, forests
and roadsides (Chapter 13). They may be accidentally released from production sites
(Chapter 11) or, more often, transported away from their site of application in water, air
or dust. Pesticides can reach groundwater after accidental spills or excessive application
126                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

in geologically sensitive settings, from contamination of poorly sealed wells by surface
runoff after intensive rains following field application and from storage or production
sites. Though some organochlorine insecticides have been banned or are subject to
severe restrictions in many countries, in several developing countries production and use
of, for example, DDT has continued because of its relatively inexpensive production and
its high efficacy against mosquitoes in malaria control. Generally the dilemma of the low
cost and high efficacy of persistent pesticides versus their long term health and
environmental effects remains a contentious global issue which has been addressed by a
global convention (see Box 9.5).
    As sampling has become more extensive and monitoring programmes developed,
increasing numbers of pesticide compounds are being detected in groundwater. A major
study, the National Pesticide Survey, conducted by the US EPA in the late 1980s
detected 46 pesticides in groundwater in 26 states originating from normal agricultural
practice (Williams et al., 1988) but with low frequency and usually below health-based
standards. Pesticides detected in more than five states were alachlor, aldicarb, atrazine,
cyanazine, metolachlor and simazine. More recently, extensive sampling within the
USGS National Water Quality Assessment programme has confirmed the widespread
occurrence of pesticides in both surface water resources and groundwater, but generally
at concentrations below their respective allowable maximum contaminant levels (Kolpin
et al., 2000). The newer work has, however, shown that pesticides, especially
insecticides, are also reaching water resources in urban and suburban areas, including
residential sources. This work has also demonstrated widespread detection of pesticide
metabolites, often at concentrations exceeding the parent compound, and for which there
may not be adequate toxicity data to establish their health significance.
    This picture is largely confirmed by monitoring efforts in Europe. Herbicides which
are widely used in cereal cultivation, such as MCPP and isoproturon are detected in the
countries of northern Europe (Spliid and Køppen, 1998) with carbamates perhaps more
common further south. Most detected groundwater pesticide concentrations were in the
range 0.1 to 10 µg/l. Concentrations significantly above this range can probably be
attributed to local point source contamination from poor disposal practices, or from non-
agricultural usage such as on railways.
    Because of high analysis costs, much less monitoring has been undertaken in low-
income countries and data from tropical regions are scarce. However, atrazine residues
from its use in sugar cane cultivation were widely observed in groundwater in Barbados
and carbofuran was detected in shallow groundwater beneath irrigated vegetable
cultivation in Sri Lanka (Chilton et al., 1998). Elsewhere, presence of organochlorines in
groundwater reflects their highly persistent nature and perhaps continuing usage even
when banned (Matin et al., 1996).

Transport and attenuation
The mobility and persistence of pesticides in the environment are well understood
because admission of a new pesticide for the market requires a series of standardized
laboratory and field experiments.
   The overall likelihood of a pesticide to be a groundwater pollutant is dependent both
on its persistence and its soil sorption. Table 4.3 lists pesticides used in agriculture for
               Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                   127

which WHO has derived health-based drinking-water guideline values. It provides a
classification of their leaching and runoff potential based on their physical-chemical
characteristics, i.e. their persistence (characterized by soil half-lives) and soil organic
carbon sorption (KOC). Other pesticides used for public health purposes (e.g. DDT,
chlorpyrifos and pyriproxyfen in malaria control) and wood conservation (e.g.
pentachlorophenol or PCP) are not listed in Table 4.3.
    As for the organic contaminants discussed in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.5.2, soil organic
matter content, clay content and permeability all affect the potential for pesticides to
leach through soils. In general, soils with moderate-to-high organic matter and clay
content will absorb pesticides onto soil particles, making them less available for leaching,
and moderate or low permeability soils allow less water infiltration.
    A wide range of pesticide soil sorption Kd values (as defined earlier in Section 4.5.2)
exist. DDT, for example, has a Kd value roughly 20 000 times as high as that for aldicarb
and 1500 times as high as that for atrazine. This explains why aldicarb and atrazine have
been found in groundwater in agricultural areas while DDT has not.
    There are several processes by which pesticide may be degraded. Exposure to
sunlight may cause photolysis before they leach into soils. Hydrolysis, the degradation of
a chemical in reaction with water that may occur at surface, in the soil zone and
underlying groundwater; the longer the hydrolysis half-life the more probable it will
enter groundwater. Biodegradation, i.e. enzymatic reactions driven by microorganisms,
will occur at greatest rates in microbially active soil. Chlorinated pesticides and triazine
herbicides are the most resistant to biodegradation and may persist for years following
application. Although the mobility of some organochlorine insecticides is limited by their
high hydrophobicity (Table 4.3), their persistence is mirrored in the accumulation in fatty
tissues in animals, including fish and humans, mostly from pesticides in surface-water
food chains. Organic phosphorus pesticides tend to hydrolyse rather quickly at pH values
above neutral, thus losing their toxic properties. However, under dry conditions some
have been observed to persist for many months (Graham-Bryce, 1981). Carbamates are
noted for their high susceptibility to degradation (Williams et al., 1988).
    Higher water solubility does not necessarily correlate with a lower degree of
persistence, but highly sorbed pesticides tend to be more persistent. The biodegradability
of pesticides depends on their molecular structure and soil half-lives can vary between a
couple of days to years (Table 4.3). Quite long half lives can occur once pesticides leave
the soil and reach the less biologically active zones of aquifers (Lavu et al., 1996; Chilton
et al., 2000). It should be noted that although many pesticide half-lives, have been
determined for soils (Table 4.3); use of such half-lives to predict aquifer behaviour may
cause misleadingly optimistic attenuation estimates.
    Several other pesticide concerns remain. Little is known about the fate of pesticides in
tropical environments, most published data are from registration trials in temperate
regions. For all pesticides there is potential for incomplete transformation of the parent
compound into metabolites which may also be more or less toxic (Sawyer et al., 1994)
and may themselves be persistent enough to be detected in groundwater. When
pesticides do get into groundwater, cleanup of the contamination is usually prohibitively
costly and often may not be practically feasible. The contamination can last many years
128                               Protecting Groundwater for Health

and spread over a large area before dilution and degradation eventually reduce the
pesticide concentrations.

4.7       EMERGING ISSUES
4.7.1     Pharmaceuticals
There is increasing concern about micropollutants originating from pharmaceuticals and
active ingredients in personal care products excreted by people as complex mixtures into
wastewater systems (Kümmerer, 2004). There are a number of routes through which
pharmaceuticals can impact groundwater, but primarily the sources are both untreated
and treated sewage. There is also evidence that substances of pharmaceutical origin are
not completely eliminated during wastewater treatment or biodegraded in the
environment (Daughton and Ternes, 1999; Drewes and Shore, 2001).

Health aspects
Current knowledge on the health effects of pharmaceutically active compounds at
concentration levels found in groundwater samples, which are several orders of
magnitude lower than concentrations which would be therapeutically active, indicates
that there are no effects on human health reasonably to be expected from this source of
exposure (Ternes, 2001). However, there is an ongoing debate on how comprehensive
health effect data from short-term high dose exposure during diagnosis and treatment
should be extrapolated to long-term low dose exposure during drinking-water
consumption. Moreover, the problem of correctly assessing the risk from unexpected
environmental (underground) and technical metabolites (from oxidative drinking-water
treatment) is not resolved. Investigation on the fate of pharmaceutically active substances
in drinking-water unit operations and processes is in progress in numerous research
studies e.g. in Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America. Additionally, proposals for
risk assessment procedures have been suggested (Montforts, 2001).

Transport and attenuation
A lack of knowledge still persists regarding the fate of pharmaceuticals during travel
through the subsurface. Findings of recent studies indicate that travel through the
subsurface can substantially attenuate the majority of pharmaceutically active
compounds where surface water or domestic wastewater is used for groundwater
recharge. However, where groundwater is influenced by surface water, such as artificial
recharge, polar pharmaceutically active compounds such as clofibric acid (blood-lipid
regulating agent), carbamazepine and primidone (antiepileptic drugs) and iodinated X-
ray contrast agent can migrate through the subsurface and have been detected in
groundwater samples in Germany and the USA (Heberer et al., 1998; Kuehn and
Mueller, 2000; Drewes et al., 2001).

4.7.2     Endocrine disrupting compounds
There has been increasing public concern about various environmental contaminants
which mimic estrogens and other sex-hormones and hence interfere with endogenous
endocrine systems, with potential adverse effects on human health. A global assessment
of the state of knowledge on endocrine disrupters was published by the International
Programme on Chemical Safety (Damstra et al., 2002).
130                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    More than 70 000 chemicals are discussed with respect to endocrine disruptive
potential (Bradley and Zacharewski, 1998). These compounds represent both synthetic
chemicals produced industrially (such as cleaners, pesticides, food additives, birth control
pills, cosmetics) and naturally occurring compounds (such as steroidal hormones, plant-
produced estrogens, herbal supplements and metals). Whilst endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) are largely organic compounds, it should be noted that some
inorganic substances such as metals are also suspected of endocrine disrupting effects.
Although their potential occurrence in drinking-water has been the subject of public
attention and discussion in some countries, it is important to note that human exposure is
chiefly through food.
    The steroidal sex hormones estradiol, estrone and testosterone are a class of
hormonally active agents of particular interest because they are naturally excreted into
the environment from human and animal sources as well as extensively used as
pharmaceuticals (e.g. birth control pills). Of the numerous synthetic chemicals that have
been implicated as endocrine disrupters, many are no longer used in commerce in many
countries, such as some organochlorine pesticides (e.g. DDT, endosulphan, dieldrin, and
toxaphene), and PCBs. Other hormonally active compounds, such as various phenolics
and phthalates, continue to be used in a variety of industrial applications worldwide
(NRC, 1999). Alkylphenol is a biological metabolite of alkylphenol polyethoxylates
commonly used in a variety of industrial, agricultural and household applications as non-
ionic surfactants. Alkylphenol and compounds are both believed to be endocrine
disrupters (Lye et al., 1999). Another synthetic chemical that has measurable hormonal
activity is Bisphenol A used as a chemical intermediate for numerous industrial products
including polymers, resins, dyes and flame retardants.
    Health effects of hormonally active compounds are based on binding of these
compounds on steroid hormone receptors which control fundamental mechanisms of
gene regulation. The disruption of this process can result mainly in reproductive changes.
Developmental defects, neurobehavioral abnormalities, immunological deficits,
carcinogenesis and ecologic effects can also be induced (NRC, 1999).
    Determining the risk of EDCs to humans is difficult because exposure to these agents
has not been routinely monitored, and effects that might be attributed to background
concentrations could be complicated by endogenous hormones, pharmacological
estrogens (e.g. hormonal contraceptives), and naturally occurring hormonally active
agents (e.g. phytoestrogens) that are ubiquitous in the environment (NRC, 1999).
Although it is clear that exposures to EDCs at high concentrations can affect human
health, the extent of harm caused by exposure to these compounds in concentrations that
are commonly found in groundwater is debated (NRC, 1999). Generally, natural and
synthetic steroidal hormones are several thousand times more potent than industrial
chemicals, pesticides and metals (Khan and Ongerth, 2000).
    The WHO has not yet specifically proposed any guidelines for the occurrence of
EDCs in drinking-water. However, some of the organochlorine compounds are regulated
as pesticides.
    The relevance to human health of EDCs occurring in water is currently uncertain.
Their occurrence in groundwater is linked to the release of sewage, manure, or spill of
specific synthetic chemicals into the environment. The specific processes used in
                Chemicals: Health relevance, transport and attenuation                         131

wastewater treatment facilities play a key role in the introduction of EDCs into surface
water and groundwater (Drewes and Shore, 2001). The transport of EDCs to
groundwater depends on their hydrophobicity and degradability. The majority of highly
potent compounds such as steroids are hydrophobic and degradable. Degradation rates of
EDC compounds depend on temperature, soil characteristics and their molecular weights
(IUPAC, 2003).
   The potential risk related to an uptake of individual EDCs present in wastewater
affected groundwater by humans does not appear to be very significant. The small data
set about the fate of EDCs (such as natural and synthetic hormones, surfactants and
pesticides) during percolation through the soil and aquifer and the lack of toxicity data on
long-term exposure of low concentrations makes it at present impossible to finally assess
the impact of EDCs in groundwater on human health. However, contaminated
groundwater may be impacted by a mix of different compounds, which could additively
impose endocrine disrupting effects.

Socioeconomic, institutional and
legal aspects in groundwater
assessment and protection
G. Howard, P. Chave, P. Bakir and B. Hoque




The socioeconomic conditions in areas where groundwater is used or recharge occurs are
critical to the development of groundwater protection measures. The protection of
groundwater may be expensive and disruptive to the inhabitants of the land above the
aquifers. Socioeconomic conditions play an important role in determining the likely
contaminant loads and types of contaminant that affect the groundwater. It is also critical
in determining what types of intervention are possible, how such interventions will be
implemented and what resources (including human) will be required and are available.
    Institutional and legal issues are also critical in determining the success or failure of
groundwater protection policies and strategies. Weak institutions and poor institutional
frameworks are commonly identified with poor implementation of water policy (World
Bank, 1993; WELL, 1998). The development of groundwater policies and strategies
must therefore provide adequate consideration of the appropriate institutional
arrangements and consider how the needs of all stakeholders can be incorporated into the
policy. The latter demands that there are effective processes of public consultation and
participation in policy and strategy development. Legislation is also vital to support

effective groundwater protection. Not only should the law be supportive of groundwater
protection, effective implementation of the law is required to ensure groundwater
protection objectives are met (Caponera, 1992; Foster et al., 1992).
   The purpose of this chapter is to discuss some of the key socioeconomic, institutional
and legal issues that are important to consider in groundwater protection. In Chapter 7,
the types of information and methods of data collection will be discussed; Chapter 20
outlines how socioeconomic issues and the institutional and legal frameworks can be
addressed in developing groundwater protection.


5.1       SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS: ISSUES OF POVERTY
          AND WEALTH
Socioeconomic status is a measure of the wealth of individuals, households and
communities and reflects their assets as well as the ability of households to obtain goods
and services. Socioeconomic status is of importance when considering the level of
investment in groundwater management which individuals, communities and societies
are willing and able to make.
    Socioeconomic conditions influence the capacity for different groups to protect their
environment. For instance, in some communities short-term priorities for resource
exploitation override the need for resource protection necessary to secure a long-term
livelihood, despite the recognition in the communities of the need for such protection.
    The poor are usually at greater risk from the adverse effects of poor resource
management and it is essential that their needs be properly addressed when developing
groundwater strategies. Critical to this approach is to avoid disadvantage for the poor
caused by the implementation of groundwater protection policies and strategies. Such
disadvantage may occur, for instance, because agricultural use of land is restricted in
order to protect groundwater, which may result in reduced incomes and decreased
security for poor farmers. Consideration must be given to compensation, financial
support, the creation of alternative employment opportunities or provision of new land
when no restrictions apply. However, the latter is often difficult to implement and should
only be considered where there is strong evidence from consultations that such an
approach is acceptable to the communities affected and that the proposed land for
relocation is at least the same quality as the land being left.
    The implementation of groundwater protection measures will often have important
implications for the livelihoods of the households affected and this applies in all
countries. For instance, significant changes in land use regulations in developed countries
will also have a profound impact on the users of land, water and other resources.
Changes may have positive or negative impacts on some or all of the components of
livelihoods. The implications of such impacts in terms of compensation, social services
and environmental protection should be taken into account when reaching a decision
about what and how land use regulations are applied. The population affected must be
fully consulted and be willing to accept any restrictions as part of the process of
establishing protection norms. Box 5.1 outlines the problems faced in parts of Germany
in relation to controlling groundwater contamination when families facing financial
hardship are able to access alternative sources of water.

      Box 5.1. Socioeconomic factors and illegal use of private wells in some rural
                                 areas of Germany
    After the political changes in Germany in 1990, the connection of rural areas in
    eastern Germany to central water supplies was rapidly developed. This was
    particularly urgent in some mountainous areas of Erzgebirge, Thuringia, as the
    supply from individual wells was highly unsatisfactory because aquifers in
    fractured bedrock fell dry at intervals. They were also vulnerable to short-
    circuiting with surface water and sewage. Connection to central supplies of high
    quality and reliable quantity in the 1990s was therefore warmly welcomed by
    the population. Individual wells were abandoned and sometimes illegally
    misused as undrained sewage pits. As local aquifers were no longer needed for
    feeding household wells, their protection was no longer perceived as a priority.
    However, the introduction of cost recovery for drinking-water significantly
    increased prices within a few years. At the same time, unemployment rates were
    very high and available work often poorly paid. As a result, many households
    struggled financially. This made individual supplies attractive again, and a large
    number were re-activated illegally. The German Drinking-water Ordinance
    requires annual monitoring of private wells, which typically involves partial or
    total cost coverage for the analyses by the well owner, but numerous households
    connected to a central supply avoided these costs by not registering their re-
    activated wells for surveillance. Their use only became known because
    metering showed large numbers of households that were not using any water
    from the central supply.
    Ensuing public health concerns include the high rate of household wells with
    microbial contamination (up to 60 per cent in one survey) and a high risk of
    unintentional cross-connection between self-built piping from the household
    well and the public supply, potentially contaminating the public supply.
    Furthermore, because of increasing stagnation in the mains due to reduced flow,
    the costs of the central supply have further increased as flushing is required
    more often to prevent microbial re-growth. This further reduces the
    attractiveness of the central supply and encourages greater use of the re-
    activated wells.

    When actions are required by specific communities to protect groundwater resources,
consideration must be given to the incentives that may be required and how these can be
provided. It should be noted that in many cases such incentives do not refer to direct
monetary compensation packages but could, for example, address improved security of
tenure for poor farmers in order to promote reduced pollution loads derived from
agriculture.
    The socioeconomic status of communities is likely to influence the type of
interventions that will be feasible for groundwater protection. For instance, in low-
income communities in developing countries with shallow groundwater, the use of pit
latrines may not be the preferred technical solution for excreta disposal, as they lead to an
increased risk of contamination. However, alternative technologies may be too expensive
for the majority of the population to sustain. In this case, some degree of contamination
142                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

of groundwater may be tolerated in order to reduce a greater health risk caused by the
lack of excreta disposal. In urban areas, if contamination is deemed unacceptable, then it
is often more cost-effective to provide an alternative (often piped) water supply that uses
water from a more distant and protected water source (Franceys et al., 1992). In rural
areas it is often more difficult to implement such solutions and the use of an alternative
sanitation technology may need to be considered and potentially subsidized.
    Similar situations may occur in developed countries where balances need to be made
between protection of the groundwater resource and sanitation provision. In rural
communities, septic tanks may be used where shallow groundwater is tapped for
domestic supply thus representing a risk to the quality of the groundwater source. Off-
site methods may not be feasible because of the cost of operation and maintenance. In
this case, it is likely to be more cost effective to treat the water or use an alternative
source of water rather than attempt to change the sanitation technology.

5.1.1     Livelihood concepts
The concept of livelihoods is now used in many countries when considering the nature of
poverty. The basic concept of a livelihoods approach is that the ability of households and
communities to sustain and improve their livelihood relies on income, assets, capabilities
and their vulnerability. This approach also takes into account gender, environmental
sustainability and cultural norms in defining sustainable livelihoods. Chambers and
Conway (1991) provided definitions of sustainable livelihoods in relation to both
environmental sustainability and social sustainability. DFID (2003) has combined these
to define a sustainable livelihood:
    ‘A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and
    shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the
    future, while not undermining the natural resource base.’
    Stresses and shocks refer to events or changes in assets, income or vulnerability that
put pressure on the livelihood. For instance, sudden loss of employment or large
increases in price of basic goods result in a shock or stress to the livelihood. Equally, a
poor harvest or sudden change in allowed land use may affect the asset base of a
community. The onset of a significant health problem may increase vulnerability
(infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being a good example) of an
individual such that previous levels of health protection are no longer adequate.
    Water and health are both considered as assets within this framework and the degree
to which households or communities have access to these assets and their resilience to
shocks and stresses are fundamental components of securing a sustainable livelihood.
The livelihood approach also encompasses concepts of vulnerability and environmental
sustainability when considering poverty.
    Vulnerability is composed of risks that are shared by a community (sometimes called
exposure), which includes lack of access to a specific water resource, and those risks
unique to an individual (often termed susceptibility) such as HIV infection. Vulnerability
may be physical, social or political (Nichol, 2000). In the context of groundwater
protection, physical vulnerability may refer to the increased risk of contamination from
inappropriate land use. Social vulnerability arises from marginalization of parts of a
                    Socioeconomic, institutional and legal aspects                     143

community within the larger community or society and factors such as gender-specific
restrictions to assets or decision-making. In relation to groundwater, this may result in
marginalization of women in decision-making regarding groundwater development,
management and protection. Political vulnerability typically relates to the capability of
communities to be engaged in wider decision-making processes in relation to resource
access and management.
    The livelihood approach ensures that the sustainability of natural resources and the
environment is given an important place in the understanding of poverty. This may be
given greater priority in rural areas where livelihood may depend on sustainable use of
natural resources (Tamuno et al., 2003). However, natural resources always remain an
important component of livelihoods, as sustainability is defined in terms of a livelihood
that does not degrade the asset base. This has implications for both rural and urban
dwellers. For instance, the protection and sustainable use of groundwater has important
implications for urban households that rely on groundwater for domestic supply, as both
deterioration and protection of the resource may increase water costs and affect the
livelihood of the users.

5.1.2     Source of livelihoods
Understanding the source of livelihood of communities that utilize and potentially pollute
groundwater sources is important. Different means of sustaining a livelihood will result
in different types of pollution. Where commercial farming is the principal source of
livelihood, groundwater may be vulnerable to pollution derived from agrochemicals such
as fertilizers and pesticides (Chapter 9). Where irrigation is practised, contamination is
likely to increase because many irrigation systems are inefficient, resulting in significant
volumes of water infiltrating the aquifer. The water used for irrigation is frequently
under-priced and this tends to reinforce the inefficient use of water (World Bank, 1993).
However, where irrigation is essential for growing crops, the development of
groundwater protection strategies will have to take this into account and compensation
packages and alternative irrigation practices (such as drip irrigation) promoted
(Chapter 21).
    Small subsistence or near subsistence farming may make relatively little use of
agrochemicals or irrigation, but their use may be significant in countries where there are
government subsidies on agricultural production. In this case, it may be more appropriate
to remove the subsidy on agrochemical use than to try to regulate application in
particular areas.
    Where agrochemical use derives from private purchase, the groundwater strategy will
have to consider the capacity of regulatory bodies to develop and deliver incentives to
reduce or change applications and the cost of inspection and monitoring. Where there is
widespread small-scale private use of agrochemicals, it will be important to consider
targeting those areas where groundwater is at greatest risk from pollution, rather than
trying to implement broad measures.
    The situation with large commercial farming may be simpler to regulate, as there will
be a smaller number of people to deal with. Where direct actions are taken to change land
use to an economically less productive use, the land-owner would usually expect
144                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

compensation and this would have to reflect their overall economic loss. However, in
many cases, the restrictions may actually apply more directly to applications of
agrochemicals on a seasonal basis, which would not require the same level of economic
recompense. It may, however, require systems of monitoring to ensure compliance.
    Where the majority of the population derive an income from small-scale agriculture,
groundwater protection may be more difficult to regulate as there will be many more
farmers whose needs must be addressed. Any compensation packages that are developed
in such situations may have a lower per capita outlay than larger farms but it is likely to
result in a higher per ha cost. This will increase overall direct costs of the protection
strategy. As noted above, alternative incentives may need to be developed in some
situations. These may be related to land tenure, but also include aspects such as providing
more secure markets for produce or providing improved extension programmes as a way
of off-setting economic losses.


5.2       POPULATION AND POPULATION DENSITY
Increasing population and population density can increase the risk to groundwater from
pollution and unsustainable abstraction. Balancing the needs for protection of resources
against demands from rapidly increasing populations is a key element in groundwater
protection. Population growth often provides an impetus for improving protection
strategies as the need to secure and conserve high-quality water resources for domestic
supply becomes increasingly important. This can provide a strong argument for the need
to protect groundwater against pollution.
    It should be noted, however, that the protection of particular groundwater resources is
also dependent on whether it is considered a key source of domestic water in the long-
term. In some cases, other resources (either surface water or more remote groundwater)
can satisfy demands for water and the threatened groundwater will not form a key part of
the water resources used for supply. This is common in wetter countries where urban
groundwater has been abandoned. In other situations, typically much drier counties,
alternatives may not exist and groundwater resources will therefore need to be protected.


5.3       COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND
          CONSULTATION
Protection of groundwater resources is a public concern and a public responsibility and
therefore requires public participation. Participation can be defined as a process through
which all stakeholders influence and share control over development and environmental
initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect them. The principle of public
participation and consultation is found in developed and developing countries.
    The Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe states that:
‘The most fundamental interest that must be addressed in the process of public
participation is the basic right of individuals to have a say in matters affecting
their lives… The basic right to participate in decisions affecting oneself… applies
in circumstances where the rights and interests may be less recognizable [such as
                   Socioeconomic, institutional and legal aspects                    145

right to have a clean environment]… Taking into account the users’ interests
should actively involve the users themselves.’ (REC, 1995).
   The American Waterworks Association Policy Statement on Public
Involvement states that: ‘Involving the public in decision making… is… important
because many drinking water issues, including adequacy of supply, water quality,
rates and conservation, are not only technical issues, they are also social,
political, personal health, and economic issues. As such, they are best resolved
through a process of meaningful dialogue with concerned parties and the public.’
(Kusel, 1998; AWWA, 1995).
   The World Bank Policy Research Working Paper states that: ‘Recent evidence
from Asia, Latin America and North America suggests that neighbouring
communities can have a powerful influence on factories’ environmental
performance… where formal regulators are present, communities use the political
process to influence the tightness of enforcement. Where formal regulators are
absent or ineffective, ‘informal regulation’ is implemented through community
groups or NGOs.’ (Afsah and Benoit-Wheeler, 1996).
   Community or public participation and consultation are important aspects of resource
management as successful implementation is commonly dependent on broad agreement
with the objectives and in some cases active public participation in programmes, to
ensure these objectives are met. Although the general public in most countries is aware
that pollution of surface water is caused by mismanagement of waste and inappropriate
land use, awareness is more limited when it comes to groundwater, which is often
considered ‘pure’ and clean. This may present particular challenges to ensuring
commitment and participation by the public in protecting groundwater resources.
   The role of communities may be critical to promoting improved protection, but the
nature of the role that they will play may vary. In many situations, communities are
consulted but play limited practical roles in the implementation of groundwater
protection strategies. In other cases, communities are expected to play an active role in
the design, planning and implementation of groundwater protection.
   It is important to be clear about the differences in two of the principal approaches to
community involvement: consultation and participation. Consultation is a process of
discussion with stakeholders about proposed actions or strategy and is geared towards
obtaining the opinion from each stakeholder about these and to review the options that
are available. However, it may not mean that the agency undertaking the consultation is
bound by the outcome of these discussions and usually does not imply a responsibility
for action by the community.
   Participation is a set of processes where communities and individuals play an active
role in the design, planning and implementation of programmes of water resource
development or protection. This often implies that the agency and the community have
responsibilities for ensuring agreed actions are performed. It is therefore a more long-
term and proactive process than consultation. However, for successful participation there
must be effective consultation and therefore the two processes are often combined.
146                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

5.3.1     Consultation
It is essential that there is proper consultation with stakeholders in the development of
policy and implementation of groundwater protection plans. A key activity in the initial
stages of policy development is to ensure that the views and needs of different
stakeholders are properly reviewed and incorporated into the policy being developed as
far as possible. The stakeholders should also have an opportunity to comment on the
policy and strategies developed to ensure that these reflect a position of agreement
among key stakeholding groups.
    Consultation should bring in the views of Government, affected interest groups and
the views of the broader society. Therefore various consultation exercises may need to be
undertaken to ensure that the views of all concerned and in particular those groups whose
livelihood may be directly affected are collected and concerns addressed. Very often,
these groups are those most directly affected by water resource management through
lack of access to safe drinking-water supplies, contamination of water sources and
limited water for irrigation. In order for policy to be effectively implemented, it is
important that there is general support for the overall policy and strategy framework
within the country. This is an ongoing process and not something that is engaged in only
at the start of policy development. It should be seen as a necessary process which
supports the development and implementation of resource management policy and
strategy.
    Perceptions and cultural values attached to water are also important to understand in
the context of groundwater quality management and protection. Many of these concepts
provide a foundation upon which to build effective protection strategies as they attach
important religious or cultural values on the protection of the groundwater. Examples
include some aboriginal beliefs about the origins and sacred nature of water in Australia.
In other examples traditional beliefs may hamper the development of groundwater
protection strategies. For instance in Uganda beliefs about the use of certain springs by
ancestral spirits prevented action being taken to improve water sources.

5.3.2     Participation
In wealthier industrialized countries although public participation occurs, the emphasis
tends to be on consultation in the development of the underlying principles, policies and
plans that define the development of environmental protection. In most cases,
groundwater protection strategies are implemented by local or central government with
systems of land use restriction, compensation and appeal processes operating. Specific
activities required will often result in specific negotiated agreements with individual
land-owners.
   By contrast, in developing countries, the development of groundwater protection
plans and implementation of protection measures is likely to require the direct
involvement of large numbers of people and communities. Many of the tasks that will be
required can only be undertaken by local people taking responsibility themselves to
enforce protection measures, although this means that communities need support to
develop effective capacity. The development of community management committees or
                    Socioeconomic, institutional and legal aspects                      147

users organizations is an important component in promoting effective resource use
(Subramanian et al., 1997).
    By understanding these issues, appropriate strategies and plans can be developed that
identify key stakeholders, where responsibilities lie and what role is expected to be
undertaken by the community. Such decisions will be arrived at partly through
stakeholder consultation. However, during the initial stages of the development of the
policies and strategies, it is important to collect information about communities in order
to be able to provide direction for subsequent discussions.


5.4        LAND TENURE AND PROPERTY RIGHTS
Land tenure and property rights are an important consideration when planning
interventions to protect groundwater resources as they will directly influence the scope
and depth of consultation and negotiation regarding land use. They may also influence
what type of intervention is possible and the nature of any regulations that will need to be
developed.
    One aspect of land tenure of particular importance is the degree to which ownership
of land confers rights of ownership and use of underlying resources. In many countries,
ownership of land may confer automatic rights to exploit, although these are increasingly
subject to licensing and permitting procedures, but ownership resides with the
Government. In these cases, controls over abstraction and land use may be easier to
implement and monitor.
    In other countries, resource ownership has historically resided with the land owner,
although this is being revised in many countries. In the Sultanate of Oman, for example,
private ownership of water was abolished by a Royal decree in 1988 and a centrally
regulated system of water management introduced with an associated well permit system
(Government of Oman, 1995).
    Revisions to land laws may require significant transitional periods. For instance, the
Spanish Royal Decree of 1986 (No 849) considers underground waters to be in the
public domain and licences to abstract are required. Public ownership is however subject
to the right of landowners to carry out activities on their land but these must not interfere
with groundwater quality. In order to avoid opposition to the transition from private
ownership to public resource, the Act gave extensive protection to existing rights owners,
and complete transition will not occur until 75 years have elapsed.
    Land tenure is often complicated and there are many different forms of rights
including customary rights to land, private freehold ownership and publicly owned land,
with many different variants (Payne, 1997). In addition to issues of ownership, the nature
of tenancy arrangements varies and there are further groups who lack any form of de jure
right to abode, but which may have a variety of de facto rights (Hardoy and
Satterthwaite, 1989). There are also a significant number of people who have no rights
and no security of tenure. The sections below review some key forms of tenure and
discuss their implications in relation to groundwater management.
148                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

5.4.1      Private land ownership
Private land-ownership is common in many parts of the world and refers to situations
where individuals own land, for instance through freehold arrangements. This may be
complicated where land is subsequently let to third parties, a common arrangement in
European agricultural areas.
   This form of land ownership has particular consequences for the development of
groundwater protection strategies. The large number of land-owners or tenants may
make the process of consultation more cumbersome as the numbers of people involved
may increase the time it takes to collect and synthesize local opinions and a greater range
of views may need to be accommodated. Such patterns of land ownership will also often
result in compensation packages being developed to offset loss of earnings resulting from
restrictions placed on land use. However, where such tenure is in place, it may be easier
to define a legal framework that can be transparent in its operation and where
compulsory purchase or mandatory development controls can be enforced.

5.4.2      Customary land rights
This is common throughout much the developing world and reflects a situation where
rights to land are held by a community, although ownership is retained by an individual
or the Government. An example of such an arrangement is ‘common’ land within a
village where all residents have the right to graze their livestock. In some parts of the
world, this may be expanded into communal ownership of land.
    Customary rights imply that decisions relating to the use of the land require
agreement with all those with rights to use the land, which may result in a more difficult
decision-making process when establishing protection strategies. However, customary
rights may already implicitly or explicitly restrict activities acceptable on the ‘common’
land, for instance by proscribing activities that would restrict the full enjoyment of rights
by others.
    Communal rights to land can also offer benefits in terms of discussions with
communities regarding actions required to protect water resources. Firstly, the impact of
poor groundwater management is likely to be felt directly by the community as in many
cases they may be using the sources being polluted from land that is used by the
community. Secondly, it introduces the broader concept of public goods that may be
easier to accept when restrictions apply across a community rather than to specific
individuals. Thirdly, management and protection strategies can be designed to respond to
the demands of the community. Where communities have been active participants in
strategy development, they will be able to provide a degree of self-policing which may
ultimately prove more effective than outside inspection.

5.4.3      Publicly owned land
Publicly owned land is land owned by a Government for all its population. Examples
of publicly owned land include national parks where the land is held for the nation,
even though some of the land may be let to individual farmers. In some European
countries, the catchment areas of major sources of water are purchased specifically for
                    Socioeconomic, institutional and legal aspects                     149

the purpose of protecting the quality of the water source, particularly where it is used
for domestic purposes.
   As most groundwater protection policies and plans are implemented by Government
bodies, publicly-owned land is the most amenable to restriction of land use, but will still
require a process of public consultation during policy development. Particular issues that
are likely to need resolution will be changes in allowable use of land where part of the
land is let in long-term tenancy to farmers or where there is a public right of access. In
the former case, changes may need to be phased or supported by compensation
packages, whilst in the latter case, broad consultation should be undertaken to ensure that
there is public acceptance of the need for such restrictions. Where public access rights are
maintained within areas where there are restrictions, it is essential that appropriate
services (such as public toilets) are provided to reduce the potential for release of
contaminants into the groundwater.

5.4.4     Informal settlements
Informal settlements – situations where land tenure is unclear and where rights are
limited – represent particular problems for groundwater protection. In many cases the
residents of such settlements have little or no resources and are vulnerable both to
exploitation and to ill-heath derived from contamination in the environment. At the same
time, such settlements may become a major source of pollution for groundwater
resources as they typically lack basic sanitation, solid waste disposal or surface water
drainage. Where water supplies are also lacking use is likely to be made of shallow
groundwater systems, potentially leading to direct impacts on the health of the
community.
    Enforcement of land use restrictions in informal areas is unlikely to be successful as
they are illegal and unlicensed settlements. However, simply trying to remove such
settlements is not only highly discriminatory against the poor, but it is unlikely to be
effective and will result in simply shifting the problem and not resolving it. In these
situations, it is more appropriate to identify ways of working with community groups to
make improvements in environmental health that reduces health risks.


5.5       VALUING AND COSTING GROUNDWATER
          PROTECTION
An important approach to protection of groundwater is to put an economic and social
value on groundwater resources. This value should take into account the direct and
indirect cost of protecting the resources as a function of the direct compensation costs (if
any) and lost opportunity costs from other, potentially more productive, uses of the land.
This should be balanced through placing a value on the aquifer in relation to its
importance in supporting economic growth. The latter should consider the current value
of groundwater to different industries and the value of each industry to the overall
economy. It should also include the incremental marginal costs caused by increased
treatment costs (either derived from use of alternative sources or due to pollution of
150                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

groundwater) and increased abstraction costs derived from exploitation of deeper
resources due to contamination of shallow groundwater.
   Most environmental protection activities will result in some increase in the cost of
production and distribution of drinking-water and more generally in terms of overall
environmental protection. For instance, there may be a requirement to pay compensation
to existing land-users or to purchase land in drinking-water catchment areas. Within this
debate it is important to obtain the views of the public (perhaps represented by consumer
groups) on their willingness to pay for such improvements and to assess whether this will
be sufficient to off-set costs, discounted over an appropriate period where necessary.
Unless there is a willingness by the public (or specific water consumers) to pay the costs
of protection, it may be very difficult to sustain intervention strategies. This is discussed
further in Chapter 20.
   In addition to a direct balancing of economic costs, it is important that social aspects
such as the access to safe water supply and the burdens placed upon poor families from
having to walk long distances to collect poor quality water should also be assigned a
value. One way of doing this is to calculate the likely public health burden derived from
poor access to water supply. This may also include a factoring in of the numbers of
people whose welfare depends on the continued exploitation of groundwater, whether for
domestic use or in agriculture or industry. An example of an approach to valuing
groundwater protection is shown in Box 5.2.

      Box 5.2. Putting a value on groundwater: Managua (based on Scharp et al., 1997)
      The city of Managua in Nicaragua is dependent on groundwater for domestic
      water supplies and therefore groundwater protection is a priority. Work
      undertaken by the Sustainable Use of Water Resources project developed a
      methodology to assign a groundwater protection value to groundwater sources
      as an input to groundwater protection planning. The project used four criteria:
      available quantity, groundwater quality, present or planned use and sensitivity to
      changes in groundwater level. These criteria were based on the economic
      valuation of water resources in relation to current use, option for future use and
      environmental significance.
      A protection value was calculated based on scores calculated for each criteria.
      The scores for quantity, quality and sensitivity to changes in groundwater level
      were used to define the protection value, whilst the present or planned use
      criteria was overlain on a final map to indicate current and planned abstraction.
      The authors note that the protection value was a relative measure based on five
      classes. The data was compiled into a map on a Geographical Information
      System (GIS) platform that allowed abstraction to be overlain on the protection
      value. The authors concluded that the areas where there was currently greatest
      use corresponded to the areas where the protection value was highest. They also
      concluded that the approach provided a simple and effective tool to assist
      planners to develop groundwater protection plans.

5.6       SETTING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES – HOW MUCH
          WILL BE PROTECTED?
The goals and objectives of groundwater protection programmes must be determined
before appropriate choices can be taken. Where they existed, in the past, water resource
management and environmental protection agencies often made decisions on goals and
objectives exclusively. More recently, however, it has been increasingly recognized that
planning agencies, local government authorities, key industry groups and the general
community need to be consulted. If the inherent conflicts in land use controls are to be
resolved, then the understanding of the resource should be accompanied by an
appreciation of its value to the community and of the potential impacts of specific land
uses on groundwater quality. The community as a whole should decide what needs to be
protected and how much protection it can afford. The introduction of obligatory
environmental impact studies in Chile, for example, has included the whole community
of affected interests into the decision-making process for the first time (Garcés, 2000). Of
course, there are still many countries where little or no protection is afforded.
    Protection can either extend across an entire aquifer or be restricted to important
recharge areas, or capture zones, for specific water supply wells. The question of how
much protection is needed or desired depends on the characteristics of the resource, the
degree to which it is used, as well as other community social and economic goals.
Alternative macro-protection land use management policies include:
    No degradation. The maintenance of the quality of groundwater at no worse than
existing levels. Generally, such a policy would only be applied to vital resources,
typically a resource that provides the sole source of drinking-water. For practical reasons
it can only be applied to groundwater resources in undeveloped areas, or areas of very
low intensity development. Further land development will normally be excluded from
the designated area
    Limited or controlled degradation. Such a policy acknowledges that existing or
proposed land uses will cause a deterioration of groundwater quality, but strives to
maintain the quality above certain specified limits. This policy normally involves
controlling the density and types of land development, and the prescription of specific
management practices for activities that can affect groundwater quality.
    Differential protection. Differential protection policies allow for combinations of no-
degradation and limited degradation. Land use management practices normally result in
a combination of exclusion and restriction. Such differential protection policies allow the
development of different protection objectives taking into account factors such as present
and potential uses of water resources, the tenure, zoning and uses of land in the locality,
and the desires of the communities involved.
    Conflicts in land use management for groundwater quality protection. Restrictions on
land use for groundwater protection will always have an economic cost, and decisions
must be made about how to minimize these costs while maximizing protection. For
example, any limitation on the type and amount of industrial or urban development will
have a cost. Consequently, the setting of land use controls for groundwater protection can
be very controversial. Obviously, landowners have an expectation that their land can be
used freely in its economic highest value use. The wider community interest, on the other
152                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

hand, can require that groundwater should not be put at risk of pollution. Those
responsible, therefore, usually have the difficult task of trying to balance the optimum
protection of groundwater resources with the economic interests of the owners of the
overlying land surface.
    There may be many potential complications involved in land use management, for
instance in trying to control problems such as the salinization of groundwater due to
irrigation return waters. There may be extreme examples of conflicts, as for instance in
the Doon Valley in Uttar Pradesh, India where limestone quarrying is physically
destroying the aquifer (Shaman, 1996). Many different types of land use may have to be
restricted to protect the quality of groundwater. It is not simply a question of limitations
on activities involving toxic materials or the disposal of sewage. Run off from urban
areas can be a serious contaminant and it and other sources of diffuse contamination,
particularly from agriculture, are those that are best controlled through land use
management policies. However, it is with controls over diffuse sources that most
conflicts will tend to arise. The problem is particularly acute in rapid growing cities and
in those cities in poorer countries where there is reliance on water supplies from shallow
aquifers and disposal of excreta in situ.


5.7        INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
The development of groundwater protection strategies and policies requires effective
institutions responsible for the planning, implementation and management of
groundwater in the country. In a great number of cases, the failure to protect groundwater
resources results not from a lack of appropriate legislation, but because of the poor
enforcement of existing regulations. This frequently reflects both weaknesses in the
overall institutional framework for groundwater protection and weaknesses within key
institutions themselves. Part of the weakness often noted is that the institutions dealing
with health, water resource or water supply fail to collaborate to define groundwater
protection needs.
    Where groundwater policies do not exist or are in need of revision, it is important that
a lead institution should be identified for policy direction, and the co-operation of other
relevant organizations in decision making should be sought. Generally the lead
organization is placed at the central government level. Even in countries where local
public participation in water management is high, such as parts of the USA, local water
management plans must be consistent with national water quality management
objectives and plans.
    It is essential that the different roles and responsibilities of different agencies working
in the water sector are clearly defined and that one agency is charged with the
responsibility to develop, implement and enforce a groundwater protection plan. It is
important that the institution identified does not have any conflicts of interest that will
compromise its ability to work independently. It is usually preferred that a water
resources management body is established that is involved in the approval of
development of water sources and the control of the quality of the resource, but is not
directly involved in water source development.
                    Socioeconomic, institutional and legal aspects                     153

    Institutional mandates must reflect the aims and objectives of each institution with
respect to their roles and responsibilities within the sector (Alaerts, 1997). One of the
consequences of this is to consider carefully the scale and scope of activities. For
instance, water and wastewater service provision is often most effectively performed
when decision-making is devolved to decentralized bodies such as municipalities, water
companies or water users associations. National central bodies may still retain some
responsibility for policy or strategic development, but may have little influence on
operational matters. This implies that when considering roles and responsibilities, the
level of action (national policy or local implementation) needs to be considered as well as
the area over which the institution has a mandate for action.
    The regulation and control of groundwater quality requires a somewhat different
approach, although the principles of decentralized operation are still valid. However,
although implementation of regulatory activities may be decentralized, there is a need for
a strong national institution capable of providing the overall policy and strategic guidance
for groundwater protection.


5.8        LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The protection of groundwater requires an adequate legal framework (Caponera, 1992;
Soulsby et al., 1999). As governments move towards the strategic management of the
country’s water resources, it is often necessary to replace basic common law and
property rights with statutory provisions regulating the use, development and protection
of water (Caponera, 1992). Legal issues related to water ownership, the means used to
control abstraction and polluting activities, and the enforcement of such legislation
become important. The framework must be supported by appropriate institutions that are
capable of implementing the policies and enforcing the relevant laws and regulations,
and these organizations must also have the necessary legal status and powers. The
willingness to enforce compliance with pollution control measures and whether
regulatory frameworks create incentives for potential polluters to comply are critical in
ensuring effective regulation (Lane et al., 1999). Within the general considerations of the
scope of environmental legislation, the legitimate demands of economic development
must be considered to ensure that a sensible balance is struck between the two (Lane et
al., 1999).
    Legal frameworks in place or developed for water protection deal often with many
other issues apart from groundwater. It is possible to identify the shortcuts that relate
solely to groundwater, but it is not usually possible to change the laws so as to
concentrate only on groundwater quality. The use of more general laws must therefore be
accepted, and the specific legislative provisions that may be applicable to the
groundwater situation should be identified and used as appropriate, working within the
framework of all the provisions of the relevant legislation.
    Legislative reform may be required in order to achieve the objectives of groundwater
protection. This may involve the revision of existing legislation to encompass these
policy objectives or the development of new legislation geared towards groundwater.
The approach adopted depends in large part on the nature of existing legislation, the ease
with which this may be updated (bearing in mind that existing legislation may deal with
154                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

broader issues and updating may be time consuming) and the importance of groundwater
in the national water resources. Furthermore, as noted by Foster et al. (1992), legislative
reform will only be effective where political will exists to ensure implementation. These
issues are discussed further in Chapter 20.

Understanding the drinking-water
catchment
6
Collecting information for
characterizing the catchment and
assessing pollution potential
I. Chorus, J. Chilton and O. Schmoll




Sufficient information is key for adequately assessing both the groundwater pollution
potential and safety of a drinking-water source. This assessment requires a variety of
information, particularly relating to the hydrogeological setting (i.e. aquifer
vulnerability), socioeconomic conditions and the range of anthropogenic activities
present in the catchment which potentially release pollutants. The establishment of an
information inventory is therefore a central tool for developing a sound understanding of
potential pollution sources and the likelihood with which pollutants may reach
groundwater in concentrations hazardous to human health. The type of information
required for assessing groundwater pollution potential is highlighted by the checklists at
the end of Chapters 7-13. This chapter addresses general aspects of establishing an
information inventory, focusing on the following three questions:
    • Which types of information are useful or necessary, and where can they be
        obtained?
    • Who needs to work together to collate the information needed for a
        comprehensive characterization of the drinking-water catchment area?

    • What quality of information is necessary to assess groundwater pollution
        potential, prioritize hazards and decide on management options?
   A key element when compiling an information inventory is to establish adequate data
management. This is crucial for viable assessment approaches, regardless of the level of
sophistication of data and information that are available and are being used. A well
maintained information inventory also supports transparency in the chain from
assessment to subsequent management decisions, and is therefore helpful for ensuring
acceptance and relevance to all involved parties.


6.1        TYPES OF INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO IT
Information needed for assessing the groundwater pollution potential, i.e. the likelihood
that disease agents such as pathogens or chemicals reach groundwater (Chapter 14), can
be gained from four types of sources:
    • site and catchment inspections;
    • public consultation, i.e. communication with the local population;
    • collating existing data;
    • targeted hydrogeological field surveys (e.g. for aquifer vulnerability mapping as
          discussed in Chapter 8), and groundwater quality screening or monitoring
          programmes involving laboratory analyses.
    For the most effective use of available resources it is helpful to begin with an initial
assessment identifying which information is available. From this, it is often possible to
prioritize additional information needed as a basis for making decisions. Such an initial
assessment will begin with site inspection and careful evaluation of the available data.
Further steps may follow, involving different levels of field surveys including laboratory
analysis of samples.
    Generally, financial resources and institutional capacity significantly influence both
access to different types of information as well as scope and extent of the information
collection process. Institutional capacities may be very limited with respect to analytical
laboratory equipment or with respect to staff, or both, and this does not necessarily
correlate with economic potential. In some settings, financial resources and institutional
capacity may allow for regular groundwater monitoring with sophisticated equipment
and analytical methods, including modelling of groundwater flows and loading. In
contrast, in other settings available options may be limited to visual information gleaned
from site or catchment inspection and informal information from communication with
the population in the drinking-water catchment.
    Assessment strategies that are mainly based on high-tech monitoring easily neglect
site or catchment inspection as an important first-hand information sources whereas
communities with limited resources can successfully perform pollution potential
assessments on the basis of information gleaned from site inspection and public
communication. Some countries with excellent laboratory capacity face increasing staff
reductions, and site inspection has often been the first activity compromised by structural
changes in responsible authorities since they are labour intensive. Other countries with
lower labour costs may have more staff capacity for conducting site inspection – in spite
                                Collecting information                                161

of substantially less developed laboratory capacity – and thus have a high potential for
good situation assessments, if the staff are adequately trained.

6.1.1     Site and catchment inspection
Comprehensive site and catchment inspections provide highly valuable first hand
information about the area of interest, and in many cases they uncover self-evident
pollution problems in a catchment. Inspections often provide an important early warning
function as they can indicate the potential of future groundwater pollution which would
only be detected by monitoring after the fact.
    Sanitary inspections are specifically designed to provide an overview of the status of
drinking-water source contamination risks. They identify probable causes of failures
when drinking-water contamination is found (Howard, 2002a), and may include, for
example, an assessment of the proximity of polluting activities in relation to drinking-
water abstraction points and of the condition of wellheads. A more detailed description of
sanitary inspection is given in Chapter 18, and further guidance can be obtained from, for
example, Lloyd and Helmer (1991), WHO (1997) and Howard (2002a, 2002b).
    Inspections on a broader, catchment oriented scale target the collection of information
for the characterization of visible activities which may potentially pollute groundwater
and of hydrogeological conditions which determine aquifer pollution vulnerability. The
checklists at the end of Chapters 7-13 provide examples of aspects to consider when
performing site or catchment inspections. Inspections need to be repeated periodically, as
conditions and activities in the catchment are not static and change over time as new
development occurs in the area, or may be important only seasonally.
    Inspections can often gain more information if performed in collaboration with those
responsible for, or operating, activities in the catchment which may potentially
contaminate groundwater (e.g. farmers, operators of waste disposal sites or sanitation
infrastructure, etc.).

6.1.2     Consulting the public
Public consultation and involvement is best undertaken whilst collecting information
about groundwater. This is important to establish a basis of open dialogue and mutual
trust as well as ownership which is crucial for the implementation of management
responses. At this stage, however, public consultation is also important as a potential
source of information. People in the community can report how their livelihoods relate to
water use and water quality, which sources and wells are used for which purpose and in
what amounts, and pressures that have an impact on water uses and on pollution. This
helps assess the economic and social values placed upon groundwater in a given
community and understand reasons for quality and quantity problems (see also Chapters
5 and 7).
    Understanding the community’s perception of issues, e.g. land tenure rights in
relation to groundwater use, or performance of government institutions, may be an
important source of information for developing successful management responses. Other
issues for which this may be important are the perception of quality, e.g. confidence in
162                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

public supply and perhaps how this compares to confidence in water from private wells,
as well as willingness to pay for better quality of water.
   As discussed in Chapter 7, in undertaking community consultation, it is important to
ensure that all stakeholder groups are included, and to avoid potential bias in the findings
by concentrating on particularly vociferous groups that may have an unrepresentatively
negative or positive view of certain issues.
   Community consultation is generally an important source of ‘informal local
knowledge’. Targeted interviews, questionnaires, telephone or door-to-door surveys are
common tools for establishing communication with the local population and thus
accessing their knowledge. A wide range of information about technical groundwater
issues may be gleaned from interviewing community members, e.g. on water levels in
wells, patterns of rainfall and inundations, changes in vegetation cover that might
indicate changes in groundwater levels or seasonal patterns relating to groundwater.
Communication with the local population may also be a good – though usually
incomplete – source of information on potential pollution from human activities
(including illicit activities), as discussions can help identify the reasons for which
adequate control measures are lacking. Information gleaned from local knowledge may
be particularly valuable where those operating polluting activities are reluctant to provide
required information or deny access to operation sites for inspection. Consultation can
also help identify the numbers and locations of private wells and to map these in relation
to public supplies and to centres of population. Further, the community may be able to
actively support groundwater monitoring or even conduct elements of it.
   In order to maintain open dialogue and trust, it is important to inform the communities
of the results of the catchment assessment, e.g. by providing copies of relevant reports
and assessments and/or conducting meetings for oral reporting and discussion.

6.1.3      Evaluating existing data
Careful evaluation of existing data may prove to be a good basis for assessing
groundwater pollution potential. In most settings, current and historical data are likely to
be available although often compiled for specific purposes other than groundwater
assessments, i.e. for research, land use planning, environmental impact assessments or
registration and licensing of commercial activities. Data sources that can be evaluated
vary widely but include:
    • statistical data (e.g. population, water usage, agrochemical usage, economic
          activities, land ownership and use, health and epidemiology);
    • recorded data from ongoing monitoring programmes (e.g. drinking-water or
          groundwater quality, drinking-water abstraction, meteorology);
    • hydrogeological and geographical information (e.g. area, geologic, vulnerability
          or land use maps, air photos, satellite images);
    • published studies (e.g. from earlier surveys, programmes, inspections,
          environmental impact assessments).
   Water quality data may exist from various types of groundwater surveys or ongoing
monitoring programmes. Such data are a highly valuable support for the assessment of
pollution. Water quality data for delivered drinking-water are most frequently available
and can be helpful for assessing aquifer pollution as contaminants found in drinking-
                                Collecting information                                163

water are likely to have their source in the catchment area. Drinking-water quality
cannot, however, always be taken as indicative of the quality of groundwater within the
aquifer. This is because samples for drinking-water quality monitoring may be taken in
the distribution system, which may be after treatment to remove pollutants and/or after
mixing of water from more than one source. These data should be used with care, but can
provide useful information for many parameters if these potential constraints are taken
into account. In particular, data for natural constituents can provide information on the
origin and movement of the water and time series data are important for recognizing
potential trends of increasing or decreasing pollutant loading.
   Generally, when using data from programmes targeted at purposes other than
groundwater pollution potential assessments, their limitations must be kept in mind. For
example, existing monitoring programmes may be limited in scope and scale (e.g. in
selection of sampling sites, parameters tested or sampling frequency), and thus may not
provide satisfactory temporal and spatial coverage in relation to the requirements of a
comprehensive pollution potential assessment. However, even if information about
specific pollutants is lacking, general hydrochemical information can be valuable for
assessing groundwater flow patterns and residence times, as baseline quality from which
the effects of human impacts may be distinguished, as well as to provide vital
information about naturally-occurring groundwater constituents such as fluoride and
arsenic. General hydrochemical data can also provide useful information about the likely
behaviour of some pollutants (e.g. the mobility of metals), as referred to in Chapter 4.
   Data are available from various governmental and non-governmental bodies and thus
may be widely scattered. They include, but are not restricted to:
    • public authorities or agencies at different administrative levels (i.e. local,
          regional, national) and different responsibilities such as:
    • health, environment, water management or geology;
    • planning, permission or licensing bodies for commercial enterprises (e.g.
          industry, mining), sanitation, and traffic;
    • water suppliers and wastewater agencies;
    • health care facilities;
    • university departments and other research institutions;
    • NGOs
    • local community initiatives (e.g. in water supply, sanitation, environment or
          agriculture);
    • statistical bureaus;
    • scientific literature or archives;
    • aid or development organizations;
    • professional associations (e.g. of farmers, industries).
   Personnel and time demands on ‘data mining’ may be substantial: the authorities and
agencies possessing valuable databases are often scattered across different administrative
levels. Also, more often than not, data are likely to be available by administrative areas,
rather than by catchments. Thus for the purpose of an assessment of a given catchment, it
may be necessary to seek contact with authorities in several different administrative
units.
164                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Much of the data will be unpublished, available only in raw form, perhaps not
electronically, and possibly even classified as confidential. Distinction between useful
and unimportant data is not always self-evident. Considerable effort may thus be needed
to extract, process and categorize useful information. The challenge is to organize and
critically assess such data, and to document their sources, including suspected
uncertainties about data quality. A further challenge is balancing time and effort needed
to obtain data against their usefulness.
    Data mining may require more than one iteration of filling information gaps by
targeted checking for availability of further data that initially were not readily accessible.
This is often the case when data are scattered between different public authorities, water
suppliers or universities that produce them. Putting further effort into data mining by
revisiting the step of searching for information on activities in the catchment area on a
more detailed and targeted level may substantially improve the information inventory or
even close critical gaps.

6.1.4      Generating new water quality data
In the context of groundwater protection, the term monitoring is usually understood to
imply water quality monitoring, and is defined and sub-divided into categories in rather
different ways by different authors. Groundwater monitoring tends to be taken for
granted in most guidance documents on groundwater protection, e.g. as an ‘additional
and essential component’ (Foster et al., 2002). However, in practice groundwater
monitoring programmes are often implicitly geared towards scientific investigation per
se, and objectives are often not clearly defined and stated. Adriaanse and Lindgaard-
Jørgensen (1997) point out the importance of establishing meaningful objectives for
water monitoring programmes in order to avoid the data-rich, but information poor
syndrome. For providing a basis for management decisions, monitoring programmes
need to be tailored to the information needs in the specific setting. Often, the most
important information needs for the objective of controlling groundwater quality in
drinking-water catchments may not be gained from groundwater monitoring, but rather
from monitoring potentially polluting activities and the implementation of measures to
prevent them from releasing contaminants to the subsurface.

Water quality monitoring
Regular groundwater quality monitoring programmes have been established in many
countries worldwide. Generally, they provide valuable information on groundwater
chemistry, groundwater levels, seasonal quality patterns and other trends over time. Thus
they are a supportive component for sound understanding of the hydrological
environment, for developing conceptual models of groundwater systems or for mapping
groundwater vulnerability. However, as discussed above, it is important to realize that
comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring is not an essential prerequisite for
assessing groundwater pollution potential in a given drinking-water catchment (Chapter
14). Particularly (though not exclusively) in settings where implementation of regular
groundwater monitoring programmes is not feasible (e.g. due to limited financial
resources or institutional capacities) or is only just beginning, investigations such as site
                                 Collecting information                                 165

and catchment inspections and the evaluation of already existing data (Sections 6.1.1-
6.1.3) are also highly valuable information sources on which the assessment can build.
    In many settings, targeted water quality surveys or screening programmes for selected
parameters and/or specific purposes, possibly repeated at more extensive time intervals,
may prove sufficient to fill the crucial information gaps and thus confirm and improve
pollution potential assessments, e.g. to investigate the extent and severity of suspected
pollution ‘hot spots’. In addition, regular monitoring over a certain period of time – often
one to two years – may be important to reduce uncertainty of the assessment, particularly
in settings where important groundwater parameters show seasonal patterns and trends
over time.
    Groundwater monitoring in this context can have different objectives:
     • Understanding natural groundwater quality (i.e. by installing observation wells
         in pristine areas). Chemical parameters typically chosen for this objective may
         include conductivity, pH, redox conditions and natural groundwater constituents
         including those potentially hazardous to human health, e.g. arsenic and fluoride.
     • Provision of data needed for developing groundwater flow models. In this case,
         monitoring would include tracers or indicators of water movement, e.g. chloride
         or temperature.
     • Characterization of the current level of aquifer pollution. For this purpose,
         observation wells would be installed in areas of the aquifer considered to be
         representative of the human activities as well as of the hydrogeological
         conditions. Parameters for analyses would be selected in relation to
         contaminants expected from ongoing or previous activities.
    Where actual contamination of a drinking-water source is occurring, targeted analysis
of the raw water quality will usually identify the pollutant and its concentration. This will
then aid in tracking potential pollutant sources and in defining control measures and/or
drinking-water treatment requirements. If a pollutant is suspected, but not present in
drinking-water wells, water samples from observation wells between the pollution source
and the drinking-water well can be used to track movement of the pollutant. In many
cases, such observation points are critical in risk assessment of the pollution potential
from a known source. Where sufficiently comprehensive programmes can be
implemented, they may actually provide quantitative data on microbial and/or chemical
contaminants in groundwater to be used in quantitative risk assessments.
    Further guidance on specifying information needs in the context of planning
monitoring programmes is given by Bartram and Balance (1996), Chapman (1996),
UNECE (1996, 2000), Adriaanse and Lindgaard-Jørgensen (1997) and Timmerman and
Mulder (1999), provide general guidance and overview on water quality monitoring.
Technical aspects of constructing observation wells, sampling and analyses are beyond
the scope of this book, and readers are referred to Nielsen (1991), Lapham et al. (1997)
and Boulding and Ginn (2003). Because novel sampling and analytical methods are
always being developed to improve the monitoring and characterization of subsurface
environmental quality, printed material can quickly become dated, and the more
technically interested reader should look at the websites of organizations such as US
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), the American Society for Testing
Materials, and US Geological Survey (USGS).

Other types of monitoring
For the purpose of this book, the use and understanding of the term monitoring goes
beyond groundwater quality monitoring discussed above. The following monitoring
categories, which subsume other technical monitoring categories proposed elsewhere,
are used in this book, particularly in the context of Water Safety Plans (WSPs)
(Chapter 17):
    • Operational monitoring for process control does not focus on measuring
        groundwater quality but is a planned series of observations or measurements to
        timely quantify efficacy and changes in performance of a control measure that is
        established to control the occurrence of pathogens or chemicals in groundwater
        (for more details see Chapter 17 and for examples Chapters 20-25).
    • Monitoring for verification is the application of methods, procedures, tests and
        other evaluations in addition to operational monitoring to determine compliance
        with and efficacy of the WSP or the groundwater management system,
        respectively (for more details see Chapter 17 and for examples Chapters 20-25).


6.2       THE NEED FOR COLLABORATION
Groundwater assessments are typically undertaken by hydrogeologists, potentially
supported by sanitary engineers and/or environmental scientists. These qualifications are
indeed essential for understanding groundwater flow and potential contaminant transport.
For understanding the potential for contaminant loads to the aquifer, broader competence
is needed, preferably in a team that integrates hydrogeological knowledge and an
understanding of the potentially polluting human activities (e.g. from agriculture,
industry, sanitation, etc.).
    Also, as discussed above in Section 6.1.3, existing information on activities
potentially impacting on groundwater quality is likely to be broadly scattered. For
example, while health or environmental authorities may be responsible for assessing the
risk of groundwater pollution, information on human activity in the catchment may be
available from diverse government bodies responsible for health, commerce, statistics,
traffic, tourism, agriculture, mining, etc. Government agencies with executive and policy
functions for the environment and groundwater may have different types of information
from local government.
    Teamwork and intersectoral collaboration is vital for groundwater assessments. This
includes cooperation between all institutions that can contribute from various angles of
access to information. The task of collecting and evaluating relevant information will in
many cases be the responsibility of a core team of public health, groundwater and
environmental experts from public authorities, often supported by water suppliers.
However, this core team can be expanded by external experts from the scientific
community, representatives of the public, and possibly stakeholders from the catchment.
Health authorities may take the initiative in assembling such teams and/or in leading
them. The example from India provided in Box 20.2 shows how competence for
groundwater pollution potential assessments as well as for developing management
options can be built by training employees of government agencies.
                                Collecting information                                   167

    Water suppliers can successfully take the initiative in establishing interdisciplinary
teams for identifying groundwater pollution problems and implementing protection
strategies for their specific supply setting. This is mirrored by the WSP approach in
which the formation of an interdisciplinary team is a key requirement (Chapter 16).
Box 6.1 provides an example of such an approach in an urban setting and Box 16.1
shows how farmers were involved specifically to control nitrate contamination in a rural
setting.

       Box 6.1. Collaboration of water supply, sanitation and public authorities in
         Berlin, Germany: the Hygiene Commission of the Berlin Waterworks
    Members of The Hygiene Commission of the Berlin Waterworks include:
    - a staff member responsible for resource protection, the technical director and
      the laboratory director of the waterworks;
    - a staff member of the municipal public health authority;
    - a staff member of the municipal environmental authority;
    - a staff member of the municipal forestry authority;
    - a staff member of the local police department;
    - invited experts, e.g. from federal agencies.
    Tabling information. All of these members report to the Commission any
    changes that occurred in the water supply and its catchment since the last
    meeting. For example, the water supply representatives report on issues
    regarding water treatment and distribution as well as protection zones. The
    public authority members report any illegal activities in the catchment observed
    and/or reported, such as illicit waste disposal, construction activity or traffic,
    newly identified historic waste sites, and any conspicuous changes observed in
    the catchment. Reporting also includes public complaints about water quality,
    odour from sewage treatment works, or observations on recipient water bodies.
    Discussing solutions to problems. The Commission evaluates all reports and
    discusses proposed solutions. This includes administrational measures of public
    authorities such as issuing permits for construction of facilities, new or changed
    systems for wastewater collection and treatment, as well as direct regulatory
    measures of the local police directorate such as removing illegally parked
    vehicles, closing roads to traffic and posting signs and notices.
    Targets of the Hygiene Commission are to:
    - inform all members about current issues regarding operation of the water
       supply and sanitation system as well as catchment protection;
    - identify pollution potential for management of catchment and supply
       system;
    - coordinate management responses of public authorities from different
       sectors and develop intersectorally harmonized strategies for sustainable
       provision of safe drinking-water;
    - coordinate contingency planning.

   In many settings worldwide, the key challenge will be to build motivation for
collaboration. This may be particularly difficult in situations where, for example, data on
168                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

contaminant loading to aquifers are likely to be available only from the polluters
themselves, who have no primary interest in control and potential restriction of their
activity. Creating ownership, for example through involvement of such stakeholders in
drinking-water resource protection teams (Box 6.1), may, therefore, be crucial.
Motivation and commitment for collaboration are likely to increase if all players fully
understand both their individual contribution to, and benefits from, efforts in protecting
groundwater as a drinking-water source.

Accounting for value judgements
Assessments of the potential for groundwater contamination typically contain a major
component of expert judgement rather than being fully quantitative, and they often
include substantial uncertainty (Section 6.3). This has two major implications for
collecting and compiling information:
    • Hazard assessments themselves, but also the information on which they are
          based, are subject to bias by the knowledge background and the value
          judgments of the experts involved. It is important to understand implicit value
          judgements that may drive experts’ assessments, as they are likely to play a role
          in selecting questions asked, choosing which data are important, assessing data
          and drawing conclusions. This can be dealt with more appropriately if value
          judgements are understood, made transparent and explicitly acknowledged.
    • Teamwork may be encumbered by implicit value judgements due to differences
          in scientific background and perception of issues. Both for effective
          collaboration and for making uncertainties of pollution potential assessments
          transparent, it is important to be aware of differences in value judgements. In her
          comprehensive discussion of this aspect of evaluating information for decision-
          making, Harding (1998) makes the point that ‘even though controversies are
          typically seen as disputes over “facts”, in most environmental disputes it is the
          clash between people’s value positions which fuels debate, rather than a
          disagreement over the “facts”’ (page 61). This applies both to disputes within
          expert teams and with the general public and is therefore also important when
          organizing public involvement in the assessment and management of
          groundwater resources.
    For the perception of pollution hazards in groundwater, the general shift to greener or
more environmentalist ideology has become relevant in many countries. Environmental
protection arguments are often quoted in the context of protecting human health, even
where this connection is scientifically unsubstantiated. Perception of health hazards from
different classes of substances tends to be linked to the ‘reputation’ the substance has in
the media. For example, traces of pesticides in drinking-water may be seen as poisons
and therefore as objectionable even at orders of magnitude below health-based guideline
values. Specifically for groundwater, the knowledge of the often insurmountable
difficulties of removing pollutants from the subsurface has produced strong
environmental arguments for protecting aquifers from the impact of human activity.
    Often, in assessing information for protecting drinking-water catchments, it will be
important to explicitly differentiate between priorities for protecting the environment and
priorities for protecting human health. Showing respect for the ethical positions and
principles of others may facilitate making motivations transparent. For example,
                                 Collecting information                                169

explicitly acknowledging and respecting the position of a team member who considers
any groundwater pollution unethical and incompatible with the target of sustainable
environmental management may be the basis for attaining his or her support in
prioritizing pollutants for the purpose of keeping drinking-water safe for human health.


6.3       SUFFICIENCY AND QUALITY OF INFORMATION –
          DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY
Uncertainty is likely to be an issue in all elements of catchment analysis and groundwater
pollution potential assessment. The information base on hydrogeological conditions and
on the scale and range of human activities in the catchment are only rarely sufficiently
comprehensive to allow a fully quantitative determination or prediction of the pollution
potential or contaminant concentrations. For example,
    • data about the population’s water needs may be incomplete, e.g. with respect to
         the amount of groundwater abstracted from private wells, possibly illegally;
    • information on human activities in the catchment is likely to be incomplete, for
         potential loads from on-site sanitation and/or leaky sewers as well as for the
         range and amounts of hazardous substances used and potentially released to the
         underground in diverse enterprises, agriculture and traffic;
    • the meaning of data gained from groundwater monitoring is dependent on the
         representative selection of sites for observation wells, and costs for their
         installation constrain the number of sites that can be sampled.
   One consequence of this uncertainty is that the target in most cases is a qualitative or
semi-quantitative determination of pollution potential, as discussed in Chapter 14 as a
basis for risk assessment.

Understanding uncertainty of the information available
The concept of uncertainty can be classified in different ways. Harding (1998) proposes
the following categories that are relevant for assessing groundwater contamination of a
catchment:
    • Risk is the most quantifiable and measurable type of uncertainty. It implies that
         the parameters driving groundwater quality are basically understood. Though
         the concentration of a contaminant may not be fully quantified or predicted,
         structured analysis of mechanisms and probabilities allows prediction of the
         likelihood that it occurs or will occur in concentrations relevant to human health.
    • Uncertainty implies that the parameters driving the processes are understood,
         but not sufficiently well to assess the probability of pollution occurring.
    • Ignorance means that not even the most important parameters are understood,
         i.e. ‘we don’t know what we don’t know’.
   A key issue for making management decisions is to understand how sound the
available information base is for assessing aquifer groundwater pollution, i.e. the amount
of uncertainty involved. This is important both for avoiding wasting resources by poorly
informed decisions on management options which later turn out to be ineffective, and for
avoiding undue postponement of urgent measures in situations where in fact the
information base is already sufficient for making adequate decisions. The question to ask
170                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

is ‘how much do we need to know to assess hazards for groundwater quality, and how
much uncertainty can we tolerate?’ Aspects of information quality in relation to taking
management decisions are discussed in Chapter 15. In the following, the aspects of
documenting the quality and reliability of information during its collection are covered
together with options for identifying and filling gaps.
    Systematic documentation of the information inventory and the information sources,
including indication of information quality and reliability, is a useful tool for identifying
critical information gaps. Earmarking uncertainties in the database or in the assessment
of its quality helps to guide further work on the data inventory. This can be achieved by a
list of the factors which probably affect the data but are not well known (e.g.
heterogeneity of the subsurface environment as a factor affecting data on estimated flow
rates, or illegal manure application as a factor affecting nitrate loads). Such
documentation may prove important for acquiring funding for targeted programmes to
close gaps.
    A next step for assessing sufficiency and quality of information as well as of getting
improved information on missing, inconsistent or unverified data is to assign a level of
confidence to all data sets in the form of an uncertainty score. Low values of uncertainty
indicate data of high reliability, whilst high uncertainty scores indicate estimates or
unverifiable information. No data (i.e. a gap) should be given the highest uncertainty
score. As discussed in WHO (1982) and by Foster and Hirata (1988), assessments of
data quality will often be somewhat subjective. This is endorsed and encouraged,
provided that subjectivity is made transparent in the report. As assessment progresses, the
aim should be to reduce the uncertainty scores by infilling with more accurate and
reliable data. The use of uncertainty scores will aid in prioritization of data acquisition.
When the data are used collectively, a summed or weighted uncertainty score can be
used to indicate the relative confidence in the interpretation. An indication of where
uncertainties are most relevant for assessing potential pollution can often be gleaned
from targeted inspection of the respective sites and activities in the catchment.

Reducing uncertainty
An effective option for filling information gaps is the design of specific programmes that
may prove to be quite feasible if they are properly targeted. For example, where potential
pollution sources are known from assessments of activities in the catchment area, but the
scale of the activity with regard to the likelihood of the pollutants actually reaching the
aquifer is poorly understood or cannot be assessed, a survey of pollutant occurrence in
groundwater may prove possible even with limited budgets. Such surveys may be small-
scale and well-targeted to address the specific pollutants and limited to localities critical
for water supply. For example, in Tajikistan the authorities responsible for drinking-
water quality needed information on pesticide levels as a basis for making a decision
whether to use shallow aquifers as drinking-water sources. In the face of data showing a
substantial decline in the application of pesticides, a small initial survey of pesticide
concentrations in the aquifers that were envisaged for providing supplies helped decide
which ones could actually be used, and indeed this showed pesticide pollution to be
much less of a problem than had been assumed from the historic knowledge of high rates
formerly applied.
                                Collecting information                               171

   Hydrogeological information gaps are often perceived as intimidating. However, here
also, targeting investigations towards specific questions may narrow down the effort
required and thus make programmes feasible. Examples are the use of groundwater
temperature to indicate ingress of surface water (applicable in settings with seasonal
patterns of surface water temperature), the use of electrical conductivity as a simple
indicator of saline intrusion or the use of substances characteristic for sewage (e.g.
detergents, ammonia, caffeine) as tracers for sewage ingress.
   Another aspect of filling information gaps is checking whether further data may
indeed be available, though perhaps initially not readily accessible, as discussed in
Section 6.1.
   Decisions on investments into improving the information base will depend on the
consequences of uncertainty. For example, if the assessment of aquifer contamination is
highly uncertain (in ignorance of some polluting activity or because of poor
understanding of its vulnerability) and a large number of people use it as drinking-water
source, the consequence might be severe, e.g. high incidence of waterborne disease. This
would be a strong rationale for improving the information base. Vice versa,
consequences in terms of public health would be minor if the population is connected to
a central supply using an alternative water source, and improving public health would not
be a reason to invest in improving the database.


6.4       SUMMARY – HOW TO PROCEED
Figure 6.1 outlines principal planning steps that may be taken to glean sufficient
information for characterizing a drinking-water catchment as a basis for assessing
groundwater pollution potential (Chapter 14). Taking the initiative for compiling a
catchment specific information inventory may be the role of local or regional public
authorities either in charge of surveillance of drinking-water supplies or of overall
catchment management (e.g. environmental authorities or departments), but it may also
be taken by a water supplier in the context of protecting the supply’s catchment and/or
developing a WSP.
   The first step for those initiating a programme for catchment characterization and
building an information inventory, both a basis for the assessment of groundwater
pollution potential, is to outline the scope of the process. This particularly requires a
preliminary understanding of:
    • What area to assess, i.e. the delineation of the catchment of the water supply or
         well field. In many settings, some hydrogeological information is available in
         relation to the water supply. Where this is lacking, the surface profile gleaned
         from a topographic map and/or a first visit to the site may provide a preliminary
         indication.
    • The type of information expected to be available (e.g. on socioeconomic
         aspects, groundwater vulnerability and anthropogenic activities). This can be
         achieved by compiling and reviewing a first overview of the information
         sources accessible and the stakeholders involved.
    • Key issues to investigate within the process of catchment characterization.
172                          Protecting Groundwater for Health




Figure 6.1. Principal planning steps for collecting information

   Planning and designing the actual investigation requires defining its targets in
consideration of the financial, institutional and personnel resources available. For more
detailed guidance on how to design a groundwater quality assessment, see UNECE
(2000).
   The second step is to identify expertise and key players who need to be involved in
catchment investigation and pollution potential assessment, and to convene a team for
                                  Collecting information                                 173

conducting both. As discussed in Section 6.2, it is useful to involve public authorities
from the sectors important in the catchment as well as experts, particularly in the fields of
hydrogeology and public health. Often, it is useful to strive for public participation in this
early planning phase by including members of communities affected or special interest
groups. Supportive involvement of stakeholders from potentially polluting activities may
be particularly useful for obtaining sensitive information, e.g. on pollutant loads.
    The third step is to carry out the investigation. For gathering comprehensive
information, it may be useful to split the team into working-groups which focus on three
different activities that may be conducted in parallel. These include:
     • Site and catchment inspection (Section 6.1.1) to record and map all features
        potentially relevant to groundwater pollution, for example settlements and water
        use practices (Chapter 7), topographic features (such as sinkholes and abandoned
        wells) that could facilitate rapid transport of pollutants to groundwater (Chapter
        8), and human activities that might lead to groundwater pollution (Chapters 9-
        13). Depending on the scope of catchment characterization, this can include
        recording of hydrogeological information for assessing groundwater
        vulnerability, or the latter would be a separate activity conducted by a team of
        hydrogeologists. Templates for checklists to assist collecting this information at
        the end of Chapters 7-13 assist inspection and would be tailored to the specific
        setting. Notes should be included on uncertainties and information gaps
        perceived as potentially relevant to the assessment (Section 6.3).
     • Consult and liase with the local population as a source of information,
        particularly to glean local knowledge about, for example, economic or cultural
        values placed upon groundwater, community perceptions on the use and
        protection of groundwater resources, or information of a more technical nature,
        e.g. on potential pollution sources, location and use of wells, etc. (Section 6.1.2).
     • Evaluation of existing information and data (Section 6.1.3) already available
        from previous programmes and investigations into groundwater and drinking-
        water quality, aquifer characteristics which define its vulnerability, and
        anthropogenic activities in the catchment. This information amends the checklists
        from catchment inspection.
    Step three is followed by an iterative process as shown in Figure 6.1. It involves the
following elements, the order of which will depend on the situation and the approach
preferred by the team:
    • Drafting a groundwater pollution potential assessment as described in Chapter 14.
    • Identifying uncertainties and information gaps. The evaluation of information
         available may reveal that the understanding of catchment characteristics is not
         sufficient, or information from different sources is inconsistent, and therefore the
         information inventory needs to be improved for adequately assessing
         groundwater pollution potential as a decision basis for developing management
         responses to protect the drinking-water catchment.
    • Improving knowledge. Some of the identified information gaps may be fairly
         readily closed by revisiting specific sites in the catchment for more thorough
         inspection, or by requesting information from, for example, operators of farms,
         enterprises or other activities. If uncertainty is too large to make decisions,
         information gaps need to be closed with specifically targeted groundwater
174                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

         surveys and or regular groundwater quality monitoring. In many cases the need
         for this can be limited to selected localities and/or polluting activities in the
         catchment (Section 6.1.3).
   As settlements and human activities in the catchment develop and change, so will
pollution potential. Further, the impact of management responses needs to be assessed. In
consequence, the topicality of information inventories and pollution potential
assessments needs to be reviewed and repeated periodically, and improvement of the
assessment is an iterative process. The experience and knowledge gained over time will
serve to reduce the uncertainty of the assessment and increase the safety of the water
supply in the long term.

Characterization of the
socioeconomic, institutional and
legal setting
G. Howard, P. Chave, P. Bakir and B. Hoque




Building on Chapter 5, the purpose of this chapter is to review how data may be
collected on socioeconomic conditions, institutional and legal frameworks and valuing of
groundwater protection that may affect groundwater protection policies and strategies.
The chapter is a review of some of the tools that can be used to collect data and a short
check-list is provided for readers to identify the types of information that should be
collected.


7.1        DEFINING SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
How socioeconomic status is defined is important as it has implications with regard to
the impact of policy on livelihoods, support provided to households to help cope with
adverse economic consequences of land use restrictions, and to determine whether and
what compensation may be offered to households. There are a number of different ways
in which socioeconomic status can be assessed. The selection of the means of defining
socioeconomic status and in particular which households are poor, depends on how such

information will be used. Many countries define national ‘poverty lines’ that represent a
benchmark level of income associated with poverty. This level of income would usually
represent a level below which a set of basic goods and services can no longer be afforded
(Satterthwaite, 1997).
    In an international context, many organizations apply a measure of absolute monetary
poverty, which is usually taken at being less than US$ 1 per day per capita (World Bank,
2002). In many cases, this figure is refined based on purchasing power parity (PPP)
which is adjusted to the value of the dollar in 1993. The use of PPP is an attempt to
reflect that costs of living as well as incomes vary between countries (World Resources
Institute, 1996). The PPP uses a standard ‘shopping basket’ of goods and services and
calculates how many units of the national income are required to purchase the shopping
basket contents in comparison to the cost in US$ in an ‘average’ country (defined as
being the average costs from all countries included in international comparisons). Gross
domestic product is adjusted in light of these differential costs and typically lowers the
gross domestic product of wealthy countries and raises that of poorer countries (World
Resources Institute, 1996).
    The numbers of people living in absolute poverty in developing countries remains
high and about 1.2 billion people globally live on less than US$ 1 per day (World Bank,
2002). Another level of monetary poverty is sometimes applied to middle-income
countries (e.g. in Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America) of US$ 2 per capita per
day as a more meaningful description of poverty in these countries (World Bank, 2002).
    Although monetary factors are important, the usefulness of absolute monetary values
to describe poverty is questioned by many workers who argue that relative poverty is a
better measure as it reflects the inequalities within a society. Relative poverty is often
deemed to be more influential in determining access to goods and services than measures
of income (Hardoy and Satterthwaite, 1989; Stephens et al., 1997).
    Monetary definitions of poverty are also criticized because poverty lines are often set
too low in comparison to costs of living and because they place too great an emphasis on
income as a determinant of poverty (Satterthwaite, 1997). Income is often difficult to
precisely gauge and security of income may be at least as important as its value in
obtaining services. Furthermore, the means by which households obtain basic goods and
services is often complex and is not necessarily reliant on the cash economy (Bigsten and
Kayizzi-Mugerwa, 1992; Moser, 1995; Rakodi, 1995; Wratten, 1995). It should also be
noted that the poverty line approach takes the view that the lack of services is primarily a
consequence rather than a cause of poverty.
    An alternative view on poverty is to consider it as a complex set of social and
economic relationships (Moser, 1995; Satterthwaite, 1997). Such an approach defines
poverty as being dependent on many factors that influence the ability of a household to
access goods and services and their ability to fully participate in the society. An example
of an approach defining poverty in relation to access to basic goods and services is
provided by the UNDP Human Poverty Index (UNDP, 1999). This index incorporates
aspects such as access to water and sanitation, education and health care services, as
being a defining feature of poverty rather than simply a consequence of poverty.

Socioeconomic indices
Another approach that has been used in defining socioeconomic status is through the use
of indices based on a set of factors that reflect the standard of living of the household.
These indices include aspects such as housing quality or numbers of people living in a
dwelling (Rakodi, 1995; Satterthwaite, 1997). This information can take the form of a
quantitative index based on data from a census or a qualitative assessment built upon
community perceptions and utilizing a range of participatory techniques. Such
approaches have been used in developed and developing countries as a mechanism to
define vulnerability and disadvantage in relation to access to health care and other
services (Jarman, 1984; Stephens et al., 1997). These approaches have proven effective
in identifying priority areas and vulnerable populations and therefore in targeting
resources at those of greatest risk (Howard, 2002).
    Socioeconomic indices can be used at a variety of levels, including national,
international and city/town (Townsend et al., 1992; Stephens et al., 1997). When
defining these indices, it is important that the variables selected are those that are deemed
to be sensitive to changes in relative wealth or status and where there is more than one
condition that may be found within a country. Commonly used variables include
employment type, roof material, house type and level of education. These variables may
also include possession of consumable durables (such as televisions, radios, cars and
bikes). It is important when selecting variables to also consider the age of data, how
frequently these data will be collected and the rapidity with which ownership of a
‘variable’ by a household may change. For instance, in emerging economies the
ownership of consumer durables may provide a good indication of relative wealth.
However, if data on ownership of items are only collected once every five to ten years
and sales of items is rapidly increasing, the inclusion of such variables within a
socioeconomic index would have limited value as the data would rapidly become
inaccurate.
    The variables selected are typically weighted to reflect their sensitivity to
socioeconomic change. Thus variables deemed to be responsive to changes in wealth are
given a higher weight than those deemed to be important indicators but less sensitive to
change. For example, in the application of an index in Uganda, roofing material was
given a high weight and main source of livelihood a much lower weight as the former
was considered to be more sensitive to changes in wealth. Within each variable a number
of conditions is defined (for instance different types of roofing material) and these are
allocated a score that shows the socioeconomic status that the condition represents.
Commonly, negative scores are allocated to conditions indicating poverty and positive
scores to conditions indicating wealth, with zero representing a medium level of
socioeconomic status.
    Selection of variables, their weighting and condition scores depends in large part on
expert judgement. It is important to ensure that the expert judgement is drawn from a
range of people and a useful method to employ is the Delphi method, which allows
repeated consultation with different groups of experts building on the conclusions of
each group when initiating consultation with the next group (Stephens et al., 1997).

Qualitative approaches to defining poverty
All the above approaches rely to a certain extent on quantitative measures of poverty and
this aspect has been criticized, because it confers external judgements on the social
condition of people (Chambers, 1989). As such approaches use standardized measures,
which are usually determined by professionals, they allow little opportunity for
communities to describe their own circumstances in relation to their needs and
perceptions. As a result, there is often little depth to the description of poverty and this
may limit the understanding of the problems and difficulties faced by the poor and the
relative priority accorded by poor people to those problems. A consequence of this
approach can be that interventions to reduce poverty do not address the underlying
causes of poverty – such as lack of influence on decision-making – and therefore make at
best superficial changes in socioeconomic status while delivering little fundamental
community improvement.
    One approach to overcoming such problems is to use more qualitative techniques to
describe and identify poverty which allow greater depth to the definition of poverty and
place greater emphasis on the needs and perceptions of the poor themselves in defining
priorities (Wratten, 1995). Such approaches have an inherent advantage over quantitative
methods as they allow the people affected by poverty to define what it means to be poor,
what assets they hold that could be used to reduce poverty and what external support is
required. Many poverty assessments now utilize participatory approaches, which allow
much greater opportunity for those affected by poverty to directly engage in defining
ways of increasing assets, reducing vulnerability and achieving more sustainable use of
the natural resource base. This approach also has merit because it has a big impact on
capacity building for the community through allowing:
    • community identification of issues;
    • community identification of its own preferred approaches for addressing the
          issues;
    • community monitoring to ensure that the approaches selected are working to
          deliver the required outcomes.
    Such approaches have been used at national levels in poverty assessment as well as
small-scale community-orientated approaches to water resources management.
However, it is likely that for large-scale water resource management strategies both
quantitative and qualitative data may be required (Wratten, 1995). This approach may
lead to application of quantitative data being used to identify areas where poverty is
greatest or where natural resources are most vulnerable, with qualitative assessments
used to define appropriate local priorities and interventions.

Livelihoods analysis
Livelihoods analysis has emerged as a new paradigm for assessing the needs of
communities and the impacts of interventions by considering how the members of the
community ensure a sustainable livelihood. This approach provides a conceptual
framework in which to understand communities and the range of assets they posses and
the threats they may face in sustaining livelihoods. It therefore places community needs,
capabilities and vulnerabilities into the core of understanding socioeconomic conditions.
       Characterization of the socioeconomic, institutional and legal setting           179

    A set of tools has been developed for undertaking analysis of livelihoods which
addresses environmental sustainability as one of the core aspects. The guidance notes on
livelihoods prepared by DFID (2003) provide a wide range of quantitative and
qualitative tools that can be used to analyse livelihoods. Because there is a wide range of
data that may be collected and for each type of data a number of different tools that can
be used, they are not discussed in detail here.
    Data will often be collected through participatory assessment using tools such as
wealth ranking, transect walks, seasonal calendars, resource maps and a range of
different methods of interview and group discussion. Data may also be collected from
sample surveys looking at specific aspects of the livelihood, for instance access to water
sources or economic data. Data from secondary sources (often government or NGO
databases) are also often analysed and included within the overall analysis of livelihoods.
    Livelihoods analysis usually involves both macro and micro-level assessments and
for data to be collected on a wide range of factors that will influence livelihoods. The
detail of different methods is not reviewed here as each is underpinned by an extensive
literature. However, the most critical aspect of livelihoods analysis is the need to keep
livelihood considerations as the primary reason as to why the data are collected, rather
than the application of particular methods of data collection.
    During the livelihoods analysis, and when considering the likely type and extent of
pollution that can be derived from different areas, it is important to collect data on the
major source of livelihood and consider the impact that this may have on groundwater.
This approach would typically emerge from the assessments on environment and
vulnerability, but may also draw information from other aspects, for instance assessment
of social capital where governments subsidize access to agrochemicals.

Population and land tenure
Information on population density allows both the need for groundwater protection to be
defined and should also provide information as to what measures (if any) can be taken in
particular areas. It will also help in making a case for protection of less densely populated
areas by highlighting potentially negative impacts from more densely populated
settlements. Overall, population growth and numbers of people relying on groundwater
also help in shaping a policy and strategy that meets long and short-term needs.
Population density is relatively easy to calculate when reliable census and cadastral data
are available. Alternatively, qualitative estimates based on ranking may also be used.
    The degree to which land tenure systems confer rights over the ownership of
groundwater resources should be established. In many countries, ownership of land
confers rights to exploit resources on or underlying the land, although this may be limited
with regard to how much resource may be removed, over what time period and to within
what depth below the ground surface automatic rights to abstract extend. In many other
countries, ownership of land does not confer automatic rights to exploit resources
underlying the surface and any resource, including groundwater, is under public
ownership and exploitation is a public rather than private decision. The nature of rights to
exploit resources underground will influence how effectively protection strategies can be
implemented. This last point is important as rights are increasingly being unpacked from
a piece of land and are now being assigned to aspects such as biodiversity, the land itself,
180                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

water, other resources, erosion credits, salinity credits. All these factors are recognized as
having a significant impact on water quality and quantity and environmental integrity.
   Assessing the nature and security of land tenure will help determine what approaches
and incentives will need to be available for different communities and may help in
directing the overall approach to groundwater resource management. Much of this
information would emerge in an analysis of livelihoods as tenure systems will have
important asset and vulnerability implications.


7.2        INSTITUTIONAL AND STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
When characterizing current capacity and future development of groundwater protection
the different institutions and stakeholders, their roles and responsibilities should all be
identified and reviewed. This approach would typically be undertaken through a
stakeholder analysis that attempts to identify all those organizations, agencies and
departments (governmental and non-governmental) that have an interest in the use,
management or protection of the groundwater resource. A key element of this process is
to assess whether the current institutional responsibilities are supportive of the
development of effective institutional arrangements.
    A common problem is that institutional responsibilities are highly fragmented with
multiple organizations taking some responsibility for either provision of services or
control of groundwater. These responsibilities commonly overlap, have inherent internal
conflicts of interest and frequent inter-institutional conflicts. Therefore, a key component
for the institutional analysis is to define what roles different organizations play, the
degree to which these are consistent both with their internal and external environment
and what rationalizations are required to make institutional relationships more effective.
For example, a process for achieving integrated water cycle management has been
developed in New South Wales, Australia. Integrated water cycle management has been
particularly successful as it includes key government agency and community stakeholder
workshops at the beginning and throughout the study process. This approach ensures that
the agencies are not only cognisant of the issues pertinent to the study area, and therefore
impacts on the water resource(s), but also that the acts, policies, regulations and issues
which are administered by the agencies are made transparent and accommodated as part
of the integrated approach (Schneider et al., 2003).
    This process supports the identification of the appropriate institution to lead
groundwater protection and to outline its relations with other institutions and
stakeholders. It also helps to define what further strengthening and capacity building is
required in order to support the lead institution to develop and implement an effective
groundwater protection strategy.
    A review should also be undertaken of the roles, responsibilities and interests in water
safety of external stakeholders. This should address statutory roles, all aspects of
regulation (financial, safety, environment), involvement in capital and operational
investment, roles in specific circumstances (for instance epidemics) and interest groups.
For each stakeholder, the relative influence each has over policy, investment, regulation
and operations should be noted as a means of identifying how each stakeholder interacts
with the supplier. In undertaking this exercise, it is important to identify all stakeholders
        Characterization of the socioeconomic, institutional and legal setting         181

and not solely concentrate on those deemed powerful or influential. For instance,
consumers may not be powerful, but are the most important stakeholders.
    Developing a matrix as a result of the institutional analysis is a useful mechanism to
summarize the data and to gain a clear idea of which organizations are responsible to
different activities. Table 7.1 provides a summary of an institutional analysis in relation
to legislation and regulation for establishing WSPs.

7.2.1      The government environment
Government departments and agencies have a key role to play in the development of
groundwater management strategies as they usually develop policy and strategic plans. It
is important that both national and local government roles are analysed as both may exert
significant influence on the actual implementation of any groundwater strategy.
     The policy environment within which each institution operates should be analysed
and the mandate and jurisdiction that each holds should be identified and clearly defined.
Key questions at this stage include:
      • What level of autonomy does each institution have?
      • What level of decision-making are they invested with?
      • To what degree do they have to refer to other institutions in order to implement
            their plans and strategies?
      • Do they control their own budgets?
      • What proportion of this budget derives from local and what proportion from
            national grants?
     These questions help define the relative influence of each institution in the practical
application of the policy framework into definable strategies on the ground. For instance,
if a department is largely autonomous with its own funding base, it tends to have a
significant influence on how policy is translated into action. By contrast, weak
departments that have limited autonomy and little budgetary control are likely to have
little direct influence on actions related to policy.
     It is important to assess whether there are overlapping institutional responsibilities
between several government departments and levels of government. It is not uncommon
to find that several national government departments have some mandate on the
development of groundwater or land use for different purposes and have different policy
objectives on which they have to act. Rationalizing the institutional responsibilities is
often the critical first step in developing sustainable groundwater management policies
and strategies. Resistance to change and responsibility is common. Potential conflicts
between different institutions should be identified and addressed from the outset.

7.2.2     The non-governmental sector
NGOs include farmers groups, industry groups, Chambers of Commerce and
environmental groups that have a stake in groundwater management and use. It is
important to identify these players, review their potential contribution to the development
of groundwater policy and collect their views on the need for groundwater management.
This is important information which feeds into the policy development framework.
   When assessing the current and potential roles of the non-government sector, it is
important to understand whose views each organization represents, the role the
organization has in civic society and the influence the organization exerts on policy and
public opinion.

7.2.3     Governance
The style and means by which decisions are actually made are important considerations
within a review of institutional, policy and legal frameworks. The degree to which
outlined processes of decision-making and enforcement of legislation are followed by the
institutions responsible ultimately determines whether these processes are effective. It is
therefore important to evaluate the decision-making process when undertaking a
situation analysis.
    Evaluating governance can be politically sensitive, although this should not prevent it
being undertaken. The key aspect of assessing governance is to determine to what extent
requirements under existing legislation are met and whether procedures and criteria for
decision-making are documented and followed. This assessment can be done by
reviewing acts, policies and operating procedures to assess what should be done, and
through consultation with key stakeholders to obtain their perceptions of how processes
are followed. Where appropriate, case law may also be reviewed.
    Consultation with key stakeholders can be undertaken using a range of techniques,
including in-depth interviews, focus-group discussions and semi-structured interviews. In
undertaking consultation on these issues, it is important to ensure that all stakeholder
groups are included. It is important to avoid potential bias in the findings of such
exercises by only concentrating on particular groups that may have an unrepresentatively
negative or positive view. Important stakeholder groups will include Government
agencies with executive and policy functions for the environment and groundwater, local
government, pressure and consumer groups, agriculture and potential polluters. Within
these groups it is also important to obtain copies of relevant reports and assessments of
the implementation of protection laws and regulations, as this may provide a clear idea of
the overall performance.
    The review of enforcement actions and results of cases brought to prosecution is also
important in determining the extent to which procedures and processes are being
followed. This review will require some kind of value judgement being made on whether
these (in terms of both quantity and content) constitute showing good governance or
whether they indicate a failure in governance and unacceptable circumventing of

7.3        MANAGING STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS –
           LEVELLING THE PLAYING FIELD
It is important to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are able to participate in the
development process: ‘different stakeholders have different levels of power, different
interests, and different resources. Arrangements are needed to “level the playing field”
and enable different stakeholders to interact on an equitable and genuinely collaborative
basis’ (World Bank, 1996).
    Most activities involving groundwater protection involve some technical aspects –
assessment, design, construction and/or operation and maintenance. Public participation
needs to be co-ordinated with the technical aspects. In addition, the technical aspects
need to be carried out professionally and efficiently otherwise the public participation
will not ensure mutual trust and support between stakeholders. Although proponents of
public participation often blame project failure on the fact that a community was not
consulted, there are many cases where failure is due to faulty design of technical aspects.
There is no faster way to kill stakeholder support for a project than to include them in all
the planning, design, etc., and then to find that the actual design is faulty.
    Public participation takes place in all countries of the world, in some form or another.
The level of participation varies from country to country, project to project, but many of
the lessons learned remain the same. In developing countries, the participating hygiene
and sanitation transformation (PHAST) approach has been used as a methodology of
participatory learning, which builds on people’s innate ability to address and resolve their
own problems. PHAST was developed specifically to help communities manage their
water supplies and control sanitation-related diseases. Examples of how this has been
used to promote source protection is given in Box 7.1.


7.4        DEVELOPING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Human settlements are made up of communities and within each community, a number
of social structures may be found which represent the interests of the community as it
deals with the external world. Whilst community structures and participation are often
discussed in the context of developing countries, similar structures often exist in
developed countries and in both cases existing community organizations should be
incorporated within an assessment of the socioeconomic factors of importance for
groundwater protection.
   Public participation is useful in improving the outcomes of strategy development,
even if it comes too little or too late. However, the ideal scenario is for stakeholders to be
included right from the start of project conceptualization and planning. Better yet, the
idea comes from the stakeholders themselves, with the role of the outsiders being only
one of advisors and catalysts to assist the process.
186                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

          Box 7.1. PHAST and the children of Dhlabane (based on Breslin, 2000)
      Dhlabane is an isolated community in rural KwaZulu/Natal with limited water
      supply options. Half of Dhlabane is serviced by a reticulated water system while
      the other half relies on unprotected springs. A series of water quality tests was
      administered and analysed by children at a local secondary school. The results
      suggested that water quality was poor at all collection points in the community.
      Children participated in a range of PHAST exercises that helped them clarify
      the links between poor water quality and health using a sorting exercise with
      pictures that depicted activities that could be interpreted as either beneficial or
      detrimental to water source protection. Children suggested that factors
      contributing to poor water quality in Dhlabane were:
      -   open-field defecation near community water sources;
      -   poor animal management near community water sources;
      -   poor waste disposal practices;
      -   infrequent hand washing.
      Children were then introduced to a planning exercise story with a gap. The first
      picture depicted a community with poor water quality, while the second picture
      was of a community that enjoyed access to clean water supplies. Children were
      asked how Dhlabane could move to the improved situation depicted.
      The children then developed a water quality plan for Dhlabane. They decided to
      protect a spring that was servicing the school. They developed a plan showing
      where the pipes would go, what they would feed into, and how the spring could
      be protected from human and animal contamination. They suggested that
      Dhlabane residents should provide the labour, but that help was required to fine-
      tune the design.
      The spring was constructed under the supervision and guidance of a local
      engineering firm that was active in the area and also had invested into child-to-
      child programmes in the area. The children’s model was followed, although
      some technical modifications were made. Through the process, the children not
      only took on responsibility for their water quality, but also managed the process
      of change in their village.
      A fence was put up to protect the spring from contamination (as suggested by
      the children), and students continue to monitor water quality at the source as
      part of a school course. Results to date have suggested that water quality has
      been improved and sustained. The children have also developed plays
      highlighting the linkages between water quality and poor health, which has also
      raised awareness..

   The earlier that stakeholders are involved, the greater chance that they will support
changes and be active partners in the process. There is a recognized sequence towards
successful community participation as set out below (Oakley, 1989):
   (1) Initial contact by change-agents; participant observation and assessment by
        change-agent.
       Characterization of the socioeconomic, institutional and legal setting       187

   (2) Group identification and analysis of problems.
   (3) Development and strengthening of community structures; emergence of
       appropriate organizations, identification of local cadres.
   (4) Widespread community awareness of causes of problems; awareness of
       community ability to resolve problems.
   (5) Leadership training, briefing, community education.
   (6) Concrete group action; programme management.
   (7) Networking; making outside contacts; building alliances.
   (8) Self-evaluation; adjusting strategies; expansion.
   (9) Stabilization; autonomy; functioning alone.

   There is no magic formula for the process of participation, and many good references
are available which describe the various techniques and examples (Narayan, 1993; Nagy
et al., 1994; Yacoob and Whiteford, 1995; World Bank, 1996). The most important
aspect of participation is establishing open dialogue and mutual trust, which can only be
achieved by understanding the current level of knowledge, attitudes and practices of the
various stakeholders. The US EPA has developed seven rules for successful
communication with the public concerning groundwater contamination, shown in
Box 7.2.

           Box 7.2. Seven cardinal rules for communication on groundwater
                    contamination (based on Chun and Den, 1999)
    1. Accept and involve the public as a legitimate partner in the issue
    2. Plan carefully and evaluate your performance as a communicaton
    3. Listen to the public’s feelings (active listening)
    4. Be honest, open, frank, kind and respectful
    5. Coordinate and collaborate with other credible sources
    6. Meet the needs of the media
    7. Speak clearly with compassion

    In developing a communication plan and information needs, the example of the
WaterCOM approach, developed for use in water and wastewater projects, can be used
(Chemonics International, 2000). Key organizations, groups and individuals are
identified and analysed in terms of their potential roles in policy formulation, policy
implementation, management of water resources and actual implementation of water,
wastewater and/or irrigation projects. These groups cover all levels, from the individual
citizen to the top policy makers. Once these groups and individuals are identified, three
types of communication flow are established:
     • UP from water users to policy makers and senior managers, e.g. on needs,
         willingness to pay for services, willingness to support water conservation and
         pollution prevention policies.
     • DOWN from policy makers and senior managers to water users, e.g.
         explanation of a situation and scale of the water shortage problem, technical
188                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

        considerations, government priorities for assistance to different areas, input
        needed from the users.
   • ACROSS between groups, e.g. between Ministries of Agriculture and Water,
        NGOs and government, technical groups and NGOs. Communication between
        government ministries needs to take place to reduce confusion and conflicts,
        which can lead to distrust in government and therefore lack of support for water
        conservation and pollution prevention programmes.
   Once established, these communication links are used throughout a project to
continue dialogue and fulfilment of commitments made by government and other service
agencies.


7.5        ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND GROUNDWATER
           USE FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT
In the development of policies, the core elements in groundwater management are the
functions and uses of the groundwater, the problems and threats to it, and the impact of
possible measures that are proposed to deal with the problems (UNECE, 2000;
Schneider et al., 2003). Measures can include investigations, risk analysis, remediation,
control of polluting activities or land uses. When developing management strategies the
following need to be identified:
     • the boundaries of the aquifers and their relation to surface waters and associated
          ecosystems (Chapter 8);
     • human uses (Chapters 9-13) and ecological functions of the groundwaters;
     • pressures which have an impact on the uses;
     • management targets which can be implemented within a specified timescale.
    Some functions have an impact on other important functions, which may not be
directly related to health or to groundwater, but which must be taken into account when
protection policies are being developed because they affect the success of protection
measures. For example, cultural or legal problems may be barriers to the use of some
possible protective measures and these must be recognized at the outset. However, if it
can be shown that the chosen control measure ensures the best use of the resource, can
minimize extractions from the environment and is best suited to the community for
which it is intended, then it is not out of the question to lobby for changes in statutory or
other potentially limiting barriers connected (with the appropriate controls) to the
reticulated supply.
    If land use planning and management is to be an effective tool for groundwater
protection, a good understanding of the distribution and quality of the groundwater
resource is necessary. Effective land use management means that sufficient
investigations should be undertaken to define groundwater flow patterns and interactions
between aquifers, identify recharge and discharge areas and recognize spatial variations
in groundwater quality (see Chapter 8). Vulnerability mapping will identify areas that are
particularly susceptible to contamination (see Chapter 8). Modelling techniques can be
used to predict the movement of contaminants in aquifers, estimate the impact of land
use changes in drinking-water catchments, and predict the effects of particular types of
developments on groundwater quality. Models can also help define the maximum
        Characterization of the socioeconomic, institutional and legal setting           189

density of particular types of development compatible with specific groundwater quality
objectives.
    It is important in this context that spatial variations in groundwater quality, both those
caused by natural processes and those caused by existing land use, are identified.
Information is also required about the distribution of land use and its impact on
groundwater quality. Some of this information is common to all uses and can be obtained
from studies carried out elsewhere. However, there are often local peculiarities in
climate, hydrogeology or in the way a particular activity is undertaken that will require
site-specific investigations (see Chapters 9-13). Local problems can be obscured by
scale, so detailed information is often required (Rudnitski, 1998). Moreover, it is not only
present economic activities that affect the environment, and so as well as information
about the distribution of existing land uses, information about the distribution of past uses
that may have affected groundwater quality should also be investigated if it has not been
recorded. Also intrinsic to water resource use is the changing consumption patterns and
growth of the community and how this will impact on the resource base. Not only does
information need to be gathered on community demographics and growth, but also on
system analysis including factors such as unaccounted for water (system leakages) and
where water can be accessed from other sources, such as rainwater, storm water and
effluent, to supplement the potable water supply. Knowing how water can be best
targeted for its intended use can facilitate the sustainable use of the community’s and the
environment’s water resources.

7.5.1      Importance of groundwater for domestic supply
One of the major issues to be addressed when developing groundwater protection
strategies is the level of groundwater use within the country, to what types of use
groundwater is put and the long-term strategies for groundwater development within the
country. In industrialized countries, use of groundwater is often easy to calculate as
access to domestic water supply direct to the homes of the population is effectively
universal and the proportion of this water that is derived from groundwater is then easily
calculated. A similar situation would also be true for agricultural use of groundwater.
However, in some countries, a lack of knowledge of water resources has resulted in over
allocation of licences and this fact may cause problems in terms not only of the resource
itself but also in terms of compensation as water licences may need to be bought back by
the state.
    In developing countries, the use of groundwater is likely to be more difficult to
accurately calculate. Access to water supplies piped to the home may be restricted to a
relatively small proportion of the population, such as the wealthy elite. The remaining
population must develop a variety of different strategies to secure a water supply
(Howard, 2002). In some countries, people who lack access to a water supply piped to
the home will use communal sources, such as public taps or small groundwater sources
such as protected springs, tubewells and dug wells (Gelinas et al., 1996; Rahman, 1996;
Howard et al., 1999). Levels of use of such supplies may be significant, for instance in
Kampala, the capital city of Uganda, it was estimated that protected springs were used
for part or all of the domestic water collection by over 60 per cent of poor households
190                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

living in areas where springs were found. In a town in the east of the country, this figure
went up to over 70 per cent. However in both cases it was noted that most households
used several water sources (Howard et al., 2002).
    In other countries, whilst multiple source use may be common, the use of water from
particular sources may be restricted to specific uses, based on the perception of the users
on the quality of that water (Madanat and Humplick, 1993). As the protection of
groundwater should take into account the use for which the water is intended, it is
therefore important to understand water use patterns. This requires a water usage study to
be undertaken in at least a sample of communities in order to understand the importance
of groundwater.

7.5.2      Private supplies
In many countries, a significant proportion of the population will construct a private
water supply and these are often shallow tubewells or dug wells. These are found in both
developed and developing countries and the quality of the water and its surveillance are
often unsatisfactory. Where access to piped water supply is limited, the total number of
private supplies may be very high and greatly exceed the number of public supplies.
    For example, in many large Asian cities by far the majority of the wells and boreholes
sunk are owned by individuals and thus any estimated use of groundwater would need to
take private as well as public tubewells into account. Private supplies are often not
adequately controlled. In a number of large cities (e.g. Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila and
Dhaka) there are very large numbers of shallow private wells that are largely
uncontrolled and unlicensed, are poorly constructed and are rarely monitored (Foster and
Lawrence, 1995). When assessments of quality are made, these often indicate poor and
deteriorating quality of the water and increasing health risks. In these situations, control
of licensed large water supplies operated by utilities or municipalities is of limited benefit
if the private supplies are not also adequately controlled (Foster and Lawrence, 1995).
    Similar situations are also found in rural areas and the lack of information and control
of such small private supplies represents a more significant challenge to the protection of
groundwater than where exploitation is through a relatively small number of high
volume production sources. It is important to identify the numbers and location of private
wells and to map these in relation to public supplies and to centres of population. It is
also important to establish some programme of monitoring of these supplies and what
response will be made to evidence of poor quality.
    The use of private supplies is also widespread in rural areas in Europe, North
America, Australia and New Zealand and in many cases the quality of such supplies is
problematic. Quality problems include microbial and chemical hazards and control of the
quality of such supplies still represents a significant challenge in many countries. In parts
of Central and Eastern Europe, there have been very large increases in the numbers of
private water supplies since the early 1990s, at a time when the ability of national and
local authorities to monitor and advise owners on improvements has declined.
    In developing a response to identified contamination, the likely importance of private
wells providing a route for contamination of the wider aquifer, thus potentially affecting
public supplies, should be considered as there is evidence in some situations of this
        Characterization of the socioeconomic, institutional and legal setting          191

causing significant quality problems (Rojas et al., 1995). There may therefore be a case
for closure of existing private wells and/or prohibiting development of new wells as a
means of protecting the public supply. However, such approaches are only feasible if
viable alternative supplies are provided to the population: simply prohibiting private
supplies in situations where the public supply is inadequate will not be effective and
would be likely to lead to greater public health risks. Furthermore, prohibition of such
sources (particularly in rural areas) is unlikely to be fully effective and will be expensive
and complicated to enforce.

7.5.3      Long-term sector plans
Long-term water supply development plans are also important to consider. In particular it
is important to collect information on how shallow and deep groundwater will be
developed in the long term. For instance, some contamination of shallow groundwaters
may be tolerated if the long-term plan is a water supply based on deeper groundwater or
surface water. In the case of deeper groundwater, however, the degree of hydraulic
continuity between shallow and deep groundwater should be taken into consideration.
This will help to avoid the creation of a long-term resource quality problem that will not
be easy to resolve.
   When collecting information for a situational analysis, it is important to determine
what economic and social values should be placed upon the groundwater taking into
account the issues raised above. In Chapter 17 examples are provided of how
groundwater protection strategies can take into account the economic value placed upon
groundwater through practical measures.


7.6        VALUING GROUNDWATER PROTECTION
Valuing of groundwater and estimating the costs of protection measures must take into
account several factors in order to gain a clear understanding of the comparative costs of
different levels and methods of protection that can be applied. This should address
whether it is more effective to purchase land in the drinking-water catchment or whether
changes in existing land users’ practice is more effective. The purchase of the land in the
catchment will represent a large single capital payment, which can either be recovered or
written off (depending on the nature of body purchasing the land and their accounting
obligations) or defrayed over several years. Where the approach is to change existing
land use, costs will be incurred on an annual basis if compensation is provided to land
users. In some cases this may be covered in land rents charged for the use of the land, but
where this is not covered the incremental costs must be either absorbed into the overall
costs of water production or written off. Where these costs are incorporated into the
water production costs they will typically be passed, at least in part, to the consumers of
the water produced.
    The protection of groundwater will usually incur some costs to the public through
taxation, water tariffs or costs of goods that would otherwise have been produced on the
land where activities are to be controlled. Therefore, it is important that there is
consultation with the public to develop a coherent overview regarding their willingness
192                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

to pay for groundwater protection. Willingness to pay may be critical in defining what
level of protection will be implemented.
    Willingness to pay for environmental improvements is often undertaken through the
use of contingent valuation methodologies (CVM) (Mitchell and Carson, 1989;
McGranahan et al., 1997). In CVM, an attempt is made to provide a monetary value to
non-financial resources or public goods and to elicit from participants what they would
pay for environmental improvements or protection. CVM were originally applied in the
1960s but were only later more widely used in the evaluation of the willingness to pay
for public goods. This has included increasing application within environmental
improvements in and provision of services such as water supply (Briscoe and Garn,
1995; McGranahan et al., 1997; Wedgewood and Sansom, 2003).
    There are a number of different approaches to using CVM, but common to all is that
participants are asked to state a value they would be willing to pay for a (as yet)
hypothetical level of protection or service (Wedgewood and Sansom, 2003). Some
approaches present participants with a specified amount for a public good and they find
out whether the participant would be willing to pay that sum for the good. This is a
relatively simplistic approach and may have limited value for groundwater protection,
where it may be more important to provide participants with a broader range of levels of
protection and costs in order to determine the optimum willingness to pay. More
sophisticated CVM approaches involve bidding games which allow the researcher to
raise the stakes in terms of costs and in levels of protection as a means of identifying both
the upper limits of willingness to pay and the limits of protection desired. The advantage
of bidding games is that it allows much greater flexibility in the options that can be
offered to participants and an iterative approach can be used to define optimum
interventions matched against willingness to pay. However, it is more complex to
analyse as different participants will identify different levels of willingness to pay.
    Some other approaches to CVM try to establish lower and upper limits of willingness
to pay, which may utilize bidding game processes or may simply ask people to state the
least and most they would be willing to pay for groundwater protection. The specific
methods are not detailed here and the choice of method will be determined by the range
of options available, resource to undertake studies and the participation of the public.
    CVM studies may also be subject to a variety of biases and these must be addressed
during the design stage. Wedgewood and Sansom (2003) note that these include:
    • bias introduced by participants deliberately under-stating their willingness to pay
          as they perceive that this may deliver lower-cost solutions (strategic bias);
    • bias introduced because the participants do not understand or believe the
          hypothetical scenarios (hypothetical bias);
    • bias introduced because there is insufficient quantity and/or quality of
          information (information bias);
    • bias introduced because the starting point in relation to the costs is excessively
          high or low (starting point bias);
    • bias introduced by the interviewer or because the respondent attempts to guess
          the ‘right’ answer (interviewer/compliance bias);
    • bias introduced by the nature of payment method (payment method bias).
        Characterization of the socioeconomic, institutional and legal setting            193

   All these biases may be overcome through good design, but their potential should not
be ignored. In addition to potential for bias in the results, a sound statistical basis for the
survey design is preferred. This can use a range of techniques, from simple random
sampling to cluster sampling, with the technique being determined by the size,
distribution and nature of the population being studied and the degree to which these
have common traits among sub-groups.

Assessment of aquifer pollution
vulnerability and susceptibility to the
impacts of abstraction
J. Chilton




Information about subsurface conditions is needed for the area of investigation,
which may be a complete catchment, the outcrop or recharge area of an aquifer or
the part of the aquifer contributing water to individual public supply sources or
wellfields. The latter is often referred to as the capture zone, and represents the
size of the area from which adequate recharge is obtained to balance the total
amount of water abstracted. The information required is that which will enable
assessments to be made of both the vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution and its
susceptibility to the impacts of heavy or even excessive abstraction of
groundwater. This chapter first defines aquifer vulnerability and describes how it
is assessed, and reviews the range of information types that are likely to be needed
about the hydrogeological conditions to enable this to be done. The chapter also
provides some general guidance on where such information might be found. While
this information is mostly of a physical geographical and geological nature, it can
also include land use, as this is often closely linked to or determined by
geographical factors. An obvious example of this would be mining, the presence

or absence of which is clearly determined by the geology. The chapter provides a
brief summary of the ways in which abstraction can have negative consequences
for groundwater. As with the other chapters in this section, a checklist is provided
at the end.


   NOTE X          Hydrogeological conditions which determine aquifer pollution
                   potential vary greatly. They therefore need to be analysed
                   specifically for the conditions in a given setting. The
                   information in this chapter supports hazard analysis in the
                   context of developing a Water Safety Plan for a given water
                   supply (Chapter 16).




8.1       DEFINING, CHARACTERIZING AND MAPPING
          GROUNDWATER VULNERABILITY
8.1.1     Vulnerability of groundwater to pollution
In view of the importance of groundwater for potable supplies, it might be
expected that aquifer protection to prevent groundwater quality deterioration
would have received due attention. However, even in and around urban and
industrial areas where many actual or potential sources of pollution are located,
aquifer protection has, until relatively recently, not been given adequate
consideration. One important reason for this lack of consideration is that
groundwater flow and pollutant transport are neither readily observed nor easily
measured. These are generally slow processes in the subsurface, and there is
widespread ignorance and indeed complacency about the risk of groundwater
pollution amongst administrators and planners with responsibility for managing
land and water resources. In the long term, however, protection of groundwater
resources is of direct practical importance because, once pollution of groundwater
has been allowed to occur, the scale and persistence of such pollution makes
restoration technically difficult and costly. In taking care of the quality of
groundwater, as in many other things, prevention is better than cure.
   Natural attenuation capacity varies widely according to geological and soil
conditions. Instead of applying controls on possible polluting activities
everywhere, it is more cost-effective and provides less severe constraints on
economic development if the degree of control is varied according to attenuation
capacity. This is the general principle underlying the concept of aquifer
vulnerability, and the need for mapping vulnerability distribution (Foster et al.,
2002).
   Given the complexity of the factors governing pollutant pathways and transport
of pollutants to aquifers, it might appear that hydrogeological conditions are just
too complicated for vulnerability to be mapped, and that each polluting activity or
                   Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                   201

pollutant should be treated separately. While it is clear that general vulnerability to
a universal contaminant cannot really be valid, nevertheless trying to define
vulnerability separately for specific pollutants is unlikely to achieve either
adequate coverage or universal acceptance, and would have data requirements that
are unrealistic in terms of human and financial resources.
   A logical approach to assessing the likelihood of groundwater pollution is to
think of it as the interaction between the pollutant load that is, or might be, applied
to the subsurface environment as a result of human activity and the pollution
vulnerability, which is determined by the characteristics of the strata separating
the aquifer from the land surface.
   In these terms, vulnerability is a function of the ease of access to the saturated
aquifer for water and pollutants, and the attenuation capacity of the soil and
geological strata between the pollution source and the groundwater. Information
needs concerning possible pollutant loads and sources are dealt with in Chapters 9
to 13, and the general guiding principles of aquifer vulnerability are covered
below. Firstly, however, some words of caution need to be born in mind in
relation to the applicability of the above approach (Foster and Hirata, 1988; NRC,
1993):


   NOTE X           All aquifers are vulnerable to persistent, mobile pollutants in
                    the long term.
                    Less vulnerable aquifers are not easily polluted, but once
                    polluted they are more difficult to restore.
                    Uncertainty is inherent in all pollution vulnerability
                    assessments.
                    If complex assessment systems are developed, obvious factors
                    may be obscured, and subtle differences may become
                    indistinguishable.


   The term pollution vulnerability refers to the intrinsic characteristics of an
aquifer that represent its sensitivity to being adversely affected by an imposed
contaminant load. It is, in effect, the inverse of the pollution assimilation capacity
of the receiving water in river quality management, but with the difference that
aquifers usually have at least some overlying strata that can provide additional
protection. If such a scheme is adopted, it is possible to have high vulnerability but
no pollution risk, because there is no pollution loading, or vice versa. Both are
quite consistent in practice. Moreover, the contaminant load can be removed,
controlled or modified, but the aquifer vulnerability, which depends on the
intrinsic properties of the subsurface, cannot.
202                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

8.1.2     Defining aquifer pollution vulnerability
The concept of groundwater vulnerability is derived from the assumption that the
physical environment may provide some degree of protection of groundwater
against natural and human impacts, especially with regard to pollutants entering
the subsurface environment. The term ‘vulnerability of groundwater to
contamination’ was probably first introduced in France in the late 1960s (Albinet
and Margat, 1970). The general intention was to show that the protection provided
by the natural environment varied from place to place. This would be done by
describing in map form the degree of vulnerability of groundwater to pollution as
a function of the hydrogeological conditions. Thus the fundamental principle of
groundwater vulnerability is that some land areas are more vulnerable to pollution
than others, and the goal of a vulnerability map is to subdivide an area
accordingly. The differentiation between mapped units was considered arbitrary
because the maps showed the vulnerability of certain areas relative to others, and
did not represent absolute values. The maps, however, would provide information
from which land use and associated human activities could be planned and/or
controlled as an integral part of an overall policy of groundwater protection at
national, sub-national (province or state) or catchment scale.
    Although the general concept has been in use for more than thirty years, there
is not really a generally accepted definition of the term. The historical evolution of
the concept of vulnerability was reviewed by Vrba and Zaporozec (1994).
Hydrogeologists have debated in particular whether vulnerability should be
determined in a general way for all pollutants, or specifically for individual or
groups of pollutants. The following is considered to adequately define the concept
of vulnerability:


   DEF X            Vulnerability comprises the intrinsic properties of the strata
                    separating a saturated aquifer from the land surface which
                    determine the sensitivity of that aquifer to being adversely
                    affected by pollution loads applied at the land surface.


   Vrba and Zaporozec (1994) recognized that there could be more than one type
of vulnerability: intrinsic (or natural) which was defined purely as a function of
hydrogeological factors, and specific for those users who wished to prepare and
use maps related to specific pollutants, for example agricultural nitrate, pesticides,
or atmospheric deposition. It would be more scientifically robust to evaluate
vulnerability for each pollutant or class of pollutant or group of polluting activities
separately (Anderson and Gosk, 1987), especially for such diverse pollutants and
activities as those listed above, or unsewered sanitation and wastewater use, for
example. There is, however, unlikely to be adequate data or human resources to
achieve this. Development of a generally recognized and accepted definition of
vulnerability does not, however, imply that there should be a standardized
approach to its mapping. Hydrogeological environments and user requirements in
                     Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                        203

terms of scales are too diverse to be dealt with in a standardized way, but it is
important to agree on a common basis – the definition of vulnerability – before
considering approaches to the assessment of such diversified conditions.
   Representation of the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution by means of
maps has become an important tool by which hydrogeologists can assist the
planning community. However, the inevitable limitations of such maps need to be
explained to the users by the groundwater specialists who prepare them. These
limitations come from the conceptual distinction between intrinsic and specific
maps referred to above, from the simplifications imposed by the scale of
heterogeneity of soils and aquifers compared to the scale of the map, and from
deficiencies in the data available for whatever method of depicting vulnerability is
adopted. Given an appreciation of these limitations, vulnerability maps have been
demonstrated to play a useful part in groundwater protection (NRC, 1993; Vrba
and Zaporozec, 1994).

8.1.3      Classifying aquifer vulnerability
Vulnerability assessment involves evaluating likely travel times from the ground
surface to the water table, or to the aquifer in the case of confined conditions. The
greater the travel time, the more potential there is for pollutant attenuation by the
processes outlined in Chapters 3 and 4. Aquifer vulnerability can be subdivided
simply into five broad classes (Table 8.1). Extreme vulnerability is associated with
aquifers having a high density of open fractures and with shallow water tables,
which offer little chance for pollutant attenuation.
Table 8.1. Broad classification of aquifer vulnerability (based on Foster et al., 2002)

Vulnerability Definition
class
Extreme       Vulnerable to most water pollutants with relatively rapid impact in many
              pollution scenarios
High             Vulnerable to many pollutants, except those highly absorbed and/or
                 readily transformed, in many pollution scenarios
Moderate         Vulnerable to some pollutants, but only when continuously discharged or
                 leached
Low              Only vulnerable to the most persistent pollutants in the long term, when
                 continuously and widely discharged or leached
Negligible       Confining beds are present and prevent any significant vertical
                 groundwater flow

   Thus for preliminary assessment purposes, it is instructive to note that the
hydrogeological environments described in Chapter 2 differ greatly in the time
taken for recharge entering at the land surface to reach the water table or
potentiometric surface of the aquifer (Table 8.2). Table 8.1 also indicates the
likely vulnerability class for each environment, and the general vulnerability of
some common soils and rocks is summarized in Figure 8.1, in which the arrows
204                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

indicate increasing vulnerability, and the three classes used in this earlier attempt
at classification roughly correspond to the three middle classes in Table 8.1.

    Unsaturated zone travel time and aquifer residence time are important factors in
any aquifer assessment because they affect the ability of the aquifer in question to
protect against pollution. For instance, a residence period of a month or so is
adequate to eliminate most bacterial pathogens (Chapter 3). Spillages of more
intractable pollutants such as petrol or other fuels, and other organic compounds
can, given time, undergo significant degradation in-situ by an aquifer’s indigenous
microbial population (Chapter 4).
    The soil zone is usually regarded as a principal factors in the assessment of
groundwater vulnerability and the first line of defence against pollution. The main
properties of soils that relate to vulnerability to pollution are discussed in Section
8.2.4 below. The soil layer is usually continuous, but the spatial variability of its
physical, chemical and biological properties can be very great, and generalizations
of soil parameters have to be undertaken with some care. Because of its potential
to attenuate a range of pollutants, it plays a critical role when considering specific
vulnerability to diffuse sources of pollution such as agricultural fertilizers,
pesticides and acid deposition. Not all soil profiles and underlying materials are
equally effective in attenuating pollutants, and the degree of attenuation will vary
widely with the types of pollutant and polluting process in any given environment.
    The soil has a particularly important position amongst vulnerability factors
because the soil itself is vulnerable. The soil’s function as a natural protective
filter can be damaged rather easily by such routine activities as cultivation and
tillage, irrigation, compaction and drainage. Human activities at the land surface
can greatly modify the existing natural mechanisms of groundwater recharge and
introduce new ones, changing the rate, frequency and quality of groundwater
recharge. This is especially the case in arid and semi-arid regions where there may
be relatively little and infrequent natural recharge, but also applies to more humid
regions. Understanding these mechanisms and diagnosing such changes are
critical, and the use of soil properties in vulnerability assessment should always
take into consideration whether the soils in the area of interest are in their natural
state. Further, there are many potentially polluting human activities in which the
soil is removed or otherwise by-passed and for these the component of protection
provided by the soil does not apply.
    Below the soil, the unsaturated zone is very important in protecting the
underlying groundwater, especially where soils are thin and/or poorly developed.
The character of the unsaturated zone and its potential attenuation capacity then
determine decisively the degree of groundwater vulnerability. The main
unsaturated zone properties that are important in vulnerability assessment are the
thickness, lithology and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the materials. The
thickness depends on the depth to the water table, which can vary significantly due
to local topography and also fluctuates seasonally, and both these have to be taken
into account when determining thickness. The importance of hydraulic
conductivity, its distribution and its role in determining groundwater flow rates
should be particularly emphasized. Porosity, storage properties, and groundwater
flow direction may also be important, and another supplementary parameter in
206                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

some types of aquifers and circumstances may be the depth and degree of
weathering of the upper part of the unsaturated zone.
   Degree of confinement is also an important factor in determining vulnerability.
Concern about groundwater pollution relates primarily to unconfined aquifers,
especially where the unsaturated zone is thin because the water table is at shallow
depth. Significant risk of pollution may also occur in semi-confined aquifers, if the
confining aquitards are relatively thin and permeable. Groundwater supplies
drawn from deeper and more fully confined aquifers will normally be affected
only by the most persistent pollutants and in the long term. Data requirements are
summarized in Table 8.3 below.

   Additional attributes that can be considered as of secondary importance to
those in Table 8.3 include topography, surface water features and the nature of
geological formations beneath the aquifer of interest. Some of these may have
only local significance. Topography influences the location of recharge, soil
development, properties and thickness and local groundwater flow. The
interaction between surface water and groundwater, i.e. in which direction water is
moving, may be important locally.

8.1.4     Mapping aquifer vulnerability
A vulnerability map shows in a more or less subjective way the capacity of the
subsurface environment to protect groundwater. Like all derivative or interpreted
maps, it is somewhat subjective because it must meet the requirements of the user.
The maps should provide the user with the most accurate and informative
assessment of the sensitivity to impacts, allowing comparison between aquifers
and between different locations and different parts of the same aquifer.
Preparation of the maps usually involves combining or overlaying several
thematic maps of selected physical factors that have been chosen to depict
vulnerability. These are discussed below, but have been grouped by Vrba and
Zaporozec (1994) into those associated with:
    • the hydrogeological framework – the characteristics of the soils and
         underlying geological materials;
    • the groundwater flow system – the direction and speed of groundwater
         movement;
    • the climate – the amount and type of recharge.
    A further general consideration is that vulnerability maps are normally prepared
from existing information only, without the collection of new field data.
    A number of approaches to the assessment and mapping of vulnerability have
been developed, using varying combinations of the soil, unsaturated and saturated
zone factors outlined above. These can be considered in three groups:
    • hydrogeological setting methods
    • parametric methods
    • analogical relation and numerical model methods.
    All methods are briefly explained below and described in more detail by Vrba
and Zaporozec (1994). The ways they are incorporated into groundwater
protection strategies are discussed in Chapter 17.
    The hydrogeological setting methods use the comparison of a subject area to
criteria that are judged to represent vulnerable conditions in other areas. A
hierarchical system of two or usually more classes is established to cover the
range of vulnerability. These widely used methods evaluate the vulnerability of
hydrogeological complexes and settings, using an overlay cartographic method
(Albinet and Margat, 1970). These methods produce universal systems suitable for
large areas and a variety of hydrogeological conditions, and therefore lend them-
selves to the production of maps of large land areas, including national coverage.
    The second group, parametric methods, can be further subdivided into matrix,
rating or point count systems, although the overall approach is the same. Factors
judged to be representative of vulnerability are selected, and each has a range that
is divided into discrete hierarchical intervals (e.g. 0-5 m, 5-10 m, 10-20 m depth to
water), and each interval is assigned a value reflecting its relative degree of
vulnerability. Matrix systems are based on a limited number of factors for
example two to four classes of vulnerability of soil and aquifer types, two or three
intervals of depth to water. Vulnerability mapping of the United Kingdom follows
this approach (Adams and Foster, 1992). The Jordan case study presented in
Section 8.1.5 is an example of a rating system. Rating systems are largely derived
208                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

from the work of Le Grand (1983). A fixed range is given to any parameter
considered necessary and adequate for vulnerability assessment. The range is
divided according to the variation interval of each parameter and the sum of the
ratings for each parameter provides the vulnerability assessment for any point or
area. The range of final scores is divided into segments representing relative
vulnerability. Some rating systems use primarily soil parameters, others
hydrogeological factors, but they are generic and not specific to any pollutant.
   An index-based parametric method developed by Foster and Hirata (1988) has
been applied in several Latin American countries (Foster et al., 2002). The GOD
system uses three generally available or readily estimated parameters, the degree
of Groundwater hydraulic confinement, geological nature of the Overlying strata
and Depth to groundwater. Each is rated on a vulnerability scale of 0 (lowest) to 1
(highest), and multiplied together to provide an overall index of pollution
vulnerability. This method has recently been further developed and adapted to take
account of the soil component of vulnerability (Foster et al., 2002). Another
approach specifically for karstic areas is the EPIK method developed by
Doerfliger and Zwahlen (1998) and discussed by Daly et al. (2001).
   Point count systems are a further development in parametric approaches in
which a weighting factor or multiplier is added to represent the importance of each
parameter in the vulnerability assessment. The ratings for each interval are
multiplied by the weight for the parameter and the products summed to obtain a
final numerical score, which is higher for greater vulnerability. However, a
potential problem with this approach is the breaking down of the final scores into
classes of relative vulnerability. One of the best known point count systems is
DRASTIC, developed by the US EPA (Aller et al., 1987; US EPA, 1992), which
has been widely tested (Kalinski et al., 1994; Rosen, 1994). The method employs
seven hydrogeological factors to develop an index of vulnerability:
    • Depth to water table
    • net Recharge
    • Aquifer media
    • Soil media
    • Topography (slope)
    • Impact on the vadose zone
    • hydraulic Conductivity
   An index is generated by applying a weight to each hydrogeological factor that
is represented numerically. As the hydrogeological factors vary spatially, the
DRASTIC index provides a systematic way of mapping the relative vulnerability
of groundwater to contamination and can be readily incorporated into a GIS (Kim
and Hamm, 1999; Shahid, 2000). However, the large number of parameters
included means that data requirements are invariably difficult to meet. Further, the
large number of variables factored into the final index number may mean that
critical parameters may be subdued by other parameters having little or no bearing
on vulnerability in that particular setting. Some DRASTIC parameters, such as
aquifer and soil media and hydraulic conductivity, are not fully independent but
interact with each other.
                   Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                  209

   Whichever system is used, the primary sources of data for assessing aquifer
vulnerability are soil and geological maps and cross-sections, data or maps of
depth to groundwater, supplemented by information from existing
hydrogeological investigations that can provide additional information on
subsurface transport and attenuation properties (Table 8.3).
   Overall, allowing for the cautionary words at the beginning of this discussion,
the concept of groundwater vulnerability has become both broadly accepted and
widely used (NRC, 1993; Vrba and Zaporozec, 1994). Vulnerability maps should
not be used to assess hazards where pollutants are discharged deeper into the
subsurface, for example leaking tanks and landfills, or for spillages of DNAPLs. A
further note of warning is that for most methods the resulting assessment of
vulnerability applies only to the aquifer closest to the ground surface if there is
more than one aquifer in a vertical sequence. While this is often the most
important for local water supply, deeper aquifers may also be exploited. At first
sight, such aquifers may appear to be more than adequately protected from
pollution, but they may in fact be vulnerable to downward leakage of pollutants,
which can be induced by pumping from the deeper horizons, or to pollutants
moving laterally from a more remote source.

8.1.5     Case study: Groundwater vulnerability mapping in the
          Irbid area in Northern Jordan
The method applied
The method established by the State Geological Surveys of Germany (Hölting et
al., 1995) for the preparation of groundwater vulnerability maps uses a rating
system for the properties of the unsaturated zone. The degree of vulnerability is
specified according to the protective effectiveness (the ability of the cover above
an aquifer to protect the groundwater) of the soil cover down to a depth of one
metre (the average rooting depth), and the rock cover (the unsaturated zone). The
following parameters are considered for the assessment of the overall protective
effectiveness: effective field capacity of the soil, percolation rate factor, rock type
and thickness of the rock cover above the saturated aquifer. Additional positive
weightings are given for perched aquifer systems, and for aquifers under strong
hydraulic pressure and upward flow conditions.
    The process of calculating the overall protective effectiveness for a large area is
complex and requires the use of Geographical Information System (GIS) software.
Hölting et al. (1995) distinguished five classes of overall protective effectiveness
of the soil and rock cover (Table 8.4). The higher the total number of points, the
longer the approximate residence time for water percolating through the
unsaturated zone and in consequence the greater the overall protective
effectiveness.
    The Irbid area was selected to test vulnerability mapping for the first time in
Jordan, and this method was selected since it allows assessment of groundwater
vulnerability over large areas based on existing data, i.e. at low cost and in a short
amount of time.

Features of the study area
The study area is characterized by altitudes varying from more than 1100 m above
sea level in the Ajlun Mountains in the south to more than 200 m below sea level
in the Yarmouk valley in the north. Towards the Yarmouk River and the Jordan
valley, the wadis are steeply incised and slopes exceeding 30 per cent are
common. Part of the study area is intensively cultivated and industrial
development is expected to increase rapidly in the future. The climate is semi-arid
with annual rainfall ranging from less than 200 mm in the east to more than
500 mm in the area west of Irbid.
   The main aquifer of the Jordanian Highlands is the moderately to highly
fractured and moderately karstified A7/B2 (limestone) aquifer with a total
thickness of 300-500 m (Figure 8.2). In the western and northern directions, the
A7/B2 aquifer is covered by the predominantly marly B3 aquitard with a thickness
increasing from some 100 m in the east to more than 500 m towards the Jordan
and Yarmouk valleys. In the northern half of the study area the moderately
fractured but almost unkarstified B4/B5 (limestone) constitutes the uppermost
aquifer overlying the B3 aquitard (Figure 8.2). Its thickness may exceed 200 m.

   In areas where the A7/B2 aquifer is protected by the overlying B3 aquitard,
observed groundwater nitrate concentrations are usually below 15 mg/l and often
below 1 mg/l. At a few sites of uncovered A7/B2 aquifer, nitrate concentrations
above 80 mg/l indicate anthropogenic contamination. In the B4/B5 aquifer,
however, many springs cannot be used for public water supply because of
chemical or bacteriological contamination. At some intensively cultivated sites
nitrate concentrations exceed 100 mg/l.

The resulting vulnerability map
Figure 8.3 shows the resulting groundwater vulnerability map of the Irbid area.
The protective effectiveness of the soil and rock cover above the saturated B4/B5
aquifer has been classified as low to very low. In the main wadis and in the areas
where the groundwater is close to the ground surface, the vulnerability of the
groundwater is extremely high. Protective effectiveness is classified as moderate
only on the high plateaus between the deeply incised wadis running towards the
Yarmouk River in the north. Vulnerability of the A7/B2 aquifer is especially high
in areas where an effective soil cover is missing, the groundwater table is
comparatively shallow and the aquifer is unconfined. Areas of medium
vulnerability are widely distributed on the outcrop areas of the A7/B2 aquifer in
the southern part of the mapped area.
   Further north and west, where the A7/B2 aquifer is overlain by the
predominantly marly B3 aquitard and well developed soils, the protective
effectiveness of the soil and rock cover has been classified as high and, in the
areas where the groundwater is confined, as very high. The Yarmouk Valley in the
extreme northern part of the study area, where the B4/B5 unit has been eroded and
the highly confined A7/B2 aquifer forms the uppermost aquifer, also belongs in
this category. Associated mapping of potential groundwater pollution sources in
the same area was also part of the study (Margane et al., 1999).

8.2       INFORMATION NEEDS AND DATA SOURCES FOR
          VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
8.2.1     Regional geological and hydrogeological setting
The first important step in characterizing the physical environment for
groundwater protection is to define the principal features of the regional geology
so that the dominant aquifer types and hydrogeological settings outlined in
Chapter 2 can be identified. The best sources of information from which the
aquifer types can be defined are geological maps, which in most countries are
produced by the national geological survey organization. Where these are
published, printed and sold, they provide a cheap and usually easy to obtain source
of this basic but vital information. However, these maps, which are often
accompanied by descriptive memoirs, are prepared by, and mainly for, geologists,
and this is the reason that at least some knowledge of the technical terms is
required, as mentioned in Chapter 2. The associated descriptive notes or memoirs
can be very useful as they usually include cross-sections showing the geometry,
structure, dip and orientation of the various geological formations, from which the
first indications of the likely groundwater flow system can be obtained. In some
countries, such memoirs also include a general summary of the hydrogeology and
groundwater development of the area covered.
    An alternative and often better source of basic information about the
groundwater conditions in an area is a hydrogeological map, if such exists. Their
production and usage has been promoted for many years by UNESCO, which
produced a universal legend to assist in the preparation of hydrogeological maps
that could be easily compared with each other (UNESCO, 1970). As a result,
national and regional maps showing the distribution of productive aquifers and
less productive lower permeability materials now exist for much of the world. The
maps distinguish between aquifers in which groundwater flow is dominantly
intergranular and those in which it is dominantly through fractures, and also
indicate the distribution of the main lithological types. Groundwater level contours
provide a general indication of flow directions. The maps can also, therefore, be
used as a source of information from which to develop a conceptual model of the
groundwater flow regime. The principal groundwater supply sources – boreholes,
springs or wellfields are sometimes shown. Groundwater quality information is
usually restricted to indications of general groundwater salinity. Struckmeier and
Margat (1995) provide a comprehensive list of hydrogeological maps, together
with guidance on map preparation and a revised standard legend.
    Issues of scale of information availability in relation to the scale of interest can
be important. National geological mapping is often undertaken in the field at
scales ranging from 1:10 000 to 1:50 000, and the final maps are usually produced
at 1:50 000 to 1:100 000, or even broader scales for large countries which are
being mapped for the first time. Maps of such scale can provide information about
the distribution of the main rock types and may give a preliminary indication of
their nature as either granular or fractured aquifers. The maps may, however, be
214                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

rather scientific and technical in the names and ages of the rock types depicted,
and some help and interpretation from a geologist or hydrogeologist will probably
be required. Additional information and first-hand knowledge and experience can
often be obtained from local technical staff of, for example, the water utility
operating the groundwater supply sources which require protection.
Hydrogeological maps may have more simplified depictions of the geological
units and are often prepared at even broader scales, 1:250 000 being common.
With increasing usage of digital technology, it may be possible to obtain digital
geological or hydrogeological maps to be used as layers in a GIS approach to
depicting groundwater vulnerability and planning groundwater protection.

8.2.2     Groundwater flow systems
Having identified the overall hydrogeological setting and determined the lithology
and geometry – the extent and depth – of the relevant aquifers in the area of
interest or catchment, the next step is to develop a broad conceptual model of the
groundwater flow system. In relation to groundwater protection, this means
understanding where groundwater recharge occurs, how it moves and where it
discharges, as this forms the hydrogeological basis for the source-pathway-
receptor approach to considering pollution threats.
    Figures 8.4 and 8.5 provide examples of conceptual groundwater models. The
first example shows a sedimentary sequence from the north east of the United
Kingdom in which several aquifers and intervening clay layers are dipping
eastwards towards the coast. The main chalk aquifer, the minor aquifers of the
Carstone and Roach Formation immediately below it and the Spilsby Sandstone
(Figure 8.4) are confined. The general scarcity of boreholes in the area means that
there are few groundwater level measurements and the positions of the respective
piezometric levels are uncertain, as show in Figure 8.4. A component of
groundwater discharge from the chalk occurs as springs at the buried cliff, and it is
assumed that there is a component of vertical flow between the aquifers through
the intervening clay strata.
    In contrast to the largely natural groundwater flow system in Figure 8.4,
Figure 8.5 shows a highly-developed shallow aquifer beneath the city of Merida in
Mexico, which is characterized by very high hydraulic conductivity, low hydraulic
gradient and water table within a few meters of the ground surface. The aquifer is
an unconfined karstic limestone, with little or no soil cover, providing little scope
for attenuation of pollutants, and hence is highly vulnerable to pollution. Rainfall
infiltration is supplemented by additional water from leaking mains, wastewater
from unsewered sanitation and storm drainage, more than doubling the annual
recharge (Morris et al., 2003). As a result, microbial pollution of the shallow
aquifer is widespread (Morris et al., 2003), and there is a danger that the increased
recharge within the city boundary could change the shallow hydraulic gradient and
allow pollution to move towards the public supply wellfields in the neighboring
peri-urban and rural areas (Figure 8.5).

216                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

   The geological history and structure of the region provides some of the most
important information, especially about the nature of the boundaries of the
aquifers. The geological age and stratigraphic sequence define the vertical
distribution of aquifers and aquitards, and the folding history determines the way
in which aquifer sequences are tilted and dipping. Geological faults with
significant displacement can bring permeable and impermeable materials adjacent
to each other and reduce or prevent lateral groundwater flow. The geological
structure may in fact help to determine the limits of the catchment or recharge
area. Understanding of the aquifer boundaries and their hydraulic nature should be
part of the development of a three-dimensional conceptual model of the
groundwater flow system.
   As introduced in Chapter 2, natural groundwater flow directions generally
reflect the land surface, and movement is usually from topographically high
recharge areas to lower areas of groundwater discharge (Figure 2.7). While this
generalization holds for many cases, the occurrence of separate local and regional
groundwater flow systems operating at different scales and depths (Figure 8.4)
may mean that groundwater flow can be in opposite directions at different depths,
and sometimes contrary to the topographic gradient. Also, human activities can
affect the flow system by providing additional recharge sources and by abstraction
of groundwater modifying or even reversing groundwater flow directions
(Figure 8.5).
   In many situations, there will be scope for interactions between surface water
and groundwater. Thus rivers and lakes may be either losing or gaining, i.e. water
can move from the surface water body downwards into the ground, or
groundwater may be discharged into the river. To make matters more complicated,
the direction of water movement may be different along the length of the river or
lake, depending on the topographic relationship and hydraulic connection and
gradient between surface water and groundwater. Thus in some places where the
stream or riverbed is cut down into a shallow aquifer, groundwater will flow
towards the river and augment surface water discharge. Elsewhere, a stream or
canal may be located above an aquifer and separated from it by either a significant
unsaturated zone or impermeable materials. Slow infiltration of water from the
river to the aquifer could occur. Further, the direction of groundwater movement
may be reversed at different times of the year as the relationship between river
levels and groundwater table can vary seasonally. Only in karstic limestone areas
is surface water largely absent, as rainfall that does not evaporate infiltrates, and
there is hardly any runoff. Indeed, extreme examples of surface water/groundwater
relationships changing along a river course are seen where streams flowing over
relatively impermeable materials cross a geological boundary onto karstic
limestones and disappear completely.

8.2.3     Physical geography and topography
Having established the regional geological setting and consequent hydrogeological
conditions and flow regime as outlined above, some other general physical
                   Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                  217

features of the study area are also important. Useful information can often be
gained from the topographic maps of the national survey, commonly at scales of
1:50 000 or 1:25 000, and from driving around and looking at the area, and this
should always be done. One of the main features directly linked to geology that is
of interest from the point of view of this monograph is the occurrence of minerals
and the related mining activities, which are discussed in Chapter 11.
    Geology and present or past climate interact to define the topography and
geomorphology, the hills, mountains, valleys, rivers and lakes and other physical
expressions of surface landforms. Steepness of slopes helps define runoff to rivers
and concentrates and localizes recharge to groundwater. The configuration of the
drainage system defines individual catchments and sub-catchments, and may help
to indicate whether there is likely to be close interaction between surface water
and groundwater systems. Limestone terrains are, for example, often characterized
by a lack of surface drainage, and this often shows on topographic maps. The
presence of springs, caves, swallow holes, often marked by their own symbols,
also provides an indication of limestone and rapid conduit flow systems. Even the
names of villages, farms and natural features such as hills and rivers can provide
useful information about the area.
    The interaction in turn between physical geomorphology and climate defines
soil conditions and fertility, and hence land use and human activities, population
density and distribution. As well as controlling runoff and recharge as mentioned
above, steepness of slopes also plays a key role in land use – steep slopes may be
unsuitable for both cultivation and human settlement. Topographic maps can
indicate the main features of land use such as forests, orchards, artificial drainage,
irrigated farming, glasshouse cultivation, nature reserves and other protected
areas, but actual visits and looking may be required to determine the type of crops
grown, cultivation regimes and livestock farming and to provide the more detailed
information specified in Chapter 9. The patterns of rural, periurban and urban
settlement, and transport infrastructure such as roads, motorways, railways and
airfields are also apparent from topographic maps. This overview will, however,
need to be supplemented by visual inspection and specific surveys to see the types
of industries and their age and degree of activity, as described in Chapter 11.

8.2.4     Characteristics of the soil
The soil is the uppermost layer of the earth's crust and is the product of complex
interactions between climate, living organisms, parent material and topography.
Soils develop through the accumulation of unconsolidated mineral grains from the
physical and chemical weathering of rock fragments and the addition of organic
material from vegetation. Soil is defined and described in many ways, which differ
according to the interests and requirements of the user. For the purposes of
groundwater protection, it can be considered as the weathered zone into which
plants will root and which experiences seasonal changes in moisture content,
temperature and gaseous composition. In temperate regions, it is generally 1-2 m
thick and in tropical regions can exceed 5 m. It should already be clear from
218                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

Chapters 3 and 4 that the soil is an important factor in groundwater protection,
because it is the most chemically and biologically active part of the subsurface
environment.
   The characteristics of the soil at any particular location and time depend on five
main groups of factors that have helped to produce it (Palmer et al., 1995):
   • physical and chemical constitution of the parent material;
   • past and present climate;
   • relief and hydrology;
   • length of time during which soil forming processes have operated;
   • the ecosystem, including the modifying effects of man's activities.
To provide a consistent and systematic basis for differentiating the characteristics
and properties of soils, soil scientists develop classifications which group soils that
behave in similar, and therefore predictable ways. Maps of soil types (usually
called Soil Series) are based largely on the following observable or measurable
criteria (Palmer and Lewis, 1998):
    • texture of the whole soil profile;
    • soil water regime – depth to and duration of waterlogging in a soil;
    • substrate type – the underlying geological material from which the soil has
        developed;
    • organic matter content.
   In the United Kingdom, this approach defines the 725 Soil Series used to
produce a national soil map. Given the complexity of interactions that are possible
between the five groups of factors listed above, it is clear that the resulting spatial
distribution of soil series within the landscape can be very complex. It may be
difficult to map the variations adequately even at a scale of 1:10 000. For maps at
a scale of 1:100 000 or smaller, which may be the chosen publication scale in
many instances, soil series which are so intricately mixed within the landscape
that they cannot be represented separately may be grouped together into soil
associations. These usually reflect the same parent material (and hence the same
underlying aquifer), but differ in characteristics related to texture, relief and
hydrological conditions.
   So that soils can contribute to the assessment of groundwater vulnerability,
these series have then been classified according to their potential for allowing
pollutants at the ground surface to be leached into underlying aquifers. The
classification is based on knowledge of those physical and chemical properties
routinely measured during soil surveys. These properties include texture,
stoniness, organic matter content, presence of raw peaty topsoils and low
permeability layers, and soil water regime, and they will determine the soil's
tendency to encourage lateral movement of pollutants, speed of downward
pollutant movement and capacity for attenuation and degradation of pollutants by
the processes outlined in Chapters 3 and 4. Derivation of the resulting leaching
potential classification is described by Palmer et al. (1995) and summarized in
Table 8.5.

   The nature of the soil is important in two other respects. Firstly soils have a
direct influence on land use, especially in conjunction with climate, and help to
determine the distribution of human activities. The deepest and most fertile soils
are generally used for cultivation with or without irrigation, and poorer soils for
forestry, grazing and wildlife conservation. Soil type hence influences the distribu-
tion of potential pollutants. Secondly, soil properties that affect leaching potential
also have a bearing on the mechanisms and amounts of recharge to groundwater.

8.3       ESTIMATING GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
In characterizing catchments or aquifers for protection, understanding how and
where recharge occurs is necessary for three principal reasons:
   • the relationship between the amount of recharge and the amount of
       abstraction defines the land area subject to or receiving the recharge that
       needs to be protected;
   • the locations and processes of recharge and their relationship to potential
       sources of pollution help to determine pollutant loads;
   • the relationship between the amount of recharge and the amount of
       abstraction helps to define the susceptibility of the aquifer to the effects of
       excessive pumping.
220                                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

   The distinction between the last two is important. Thus in relation to the
objective of groundwater protection, it may often be more critical to identify
locations, mechanisms and speed of recharge rather than total volumes. General
estimates of total recharge volumes are needed to help define catchments and to
estimate diffuse pollution loads. A greater degree of effort is required to make
estimates that are as precise and reliable as possible for groundwater resources
management. Recharge estimation can be technically difficult and costly.

8.3.1     Recharge components and processes
Recharge of groundwater may occur naturally from precipitation, rivers or lakes
and/or from a whole range of man’s activities such as irrigation and urbanization.
Further, an important way of categorizing recharge is to consider it as direct,
localized or indirect (Simmers, 1997). The first is defined as water that is in excess
of soil moisture deficits and evapotranspiration and which is added to the
groundwater reservoir by direct vertical percolation through the unsaturated zone.
The second is an intermediate form of recharge that results from percolation to the
water table following surface or near-surface movement and subsequent collection
and ponding in low-lying areas and in fractured zones as a result of small-scale
topographic or geological variability. Indirect recharge is percolation to the water
table through the beds of rivers, lakes and canals (Figure 8.6).

   While important conceptually, these distinctions are in practice a simplification
of complex natural environments in which both may occur. However,
comprehensive reviews of the subject by Lerner et al. (1990) and Simmers (1997)
concluded that the following general guidelines were evident from the literature:
   • recharge occurs, albeit to a limited degree, even in the most arid
       environments although increasing aridity will be characterized by a
       decreasing net downward flux and greater time variability;
   • direct recharge is likely to become less important and indirect recharge
       more important with increasing aridity;
   • estimates of direct recharge are likely to be more readily derived than those
       of localized or indirect recharge.
   These generalizations certainly show that successful estimation of groundwater
recharge depends on first identifying the probable recharge mechanisms and the
important features influencing recharge, and secondly on selecting an estimation
method which is suitable for the environment. Even with this understanding,
recharge estimation remains one of the most difficult tasks for the groundwater
specialist and, in many circumstances, groundwater recharge has proved much
more difficult to measure than other components of the hydrological cycle.

8.3.2     Methods for estimating recharge
While comprehensive technical guidance on the estimation of recharge is outside
the scope of this monograph, nevertheless the features that good methods of
recharge estimates should have, and the most likely sources of error can be
summarized. Simmers (1997) identified four general sources of error:
   • Adopting an incorrect conceptual model. This is the most common and
       serious source of error, and arises when the groundwater flow system and
       recharge processes are not fully understood or the simplifying assumptions
       made are too great or unsound. It is important on the one hand to take
       account of all of the natural and artificial sources of recharge and on the
       other hand to avoid double accounting of any sources.
   • Neglecting spatial and temporal variability. A particular rainfall amount
       may not cause recharge if it falls at low intensity during times of high
       evapotranspiration, but the same amount could produce recharge if it
       occurred with high intensity when evapotranspiration was low. Major
       errors can arise if temporal variation is not taken proper account of by
       using monthly, annual or longer-term average data. Recharge estimates
       over long periods should be obtained from the sum of values over shorter
       periods – soil moisture balances based on monthly data may indicate no
       recharge, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, whereas daily time steps
       will often show that recharge can occur. The high degree of spatial
       heterogeneity of soils and aquifers will also limit the degree to which
       estimates at one location can be applied regionally.
   • Measurement error. This is governed by the equipment used and operator
       skills and, for those parameters that are readily measured such has rainfall,
       is unlikely to be as important as either of the two above.
222                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    • Calculation errors. These can usually be avoided by taking care and by
         checking that the units in which the various parameters used are either
         compatible or correctly converted.
Further discussion of these sources of error is given in Lerner et al. (1990). There
are five features that should be looked for in a recharge estimation method (Lerner
et al., 1990; Simmers, 1997):
    • The method should explicitly account for the water that does not become
         recharge.
    • Most methods rely on knowledge of the processes that convert source
         water into recharge and of the flow mechanisms for that water. Good
         methods should reveal if the conceptual model underlying the method is
         correct.
    • The method should have low errors associated with it and should not be
         sensitive to parameters which are difficult to measure or to estimate
         accurately.
    • The method should be easy to use.
    • Methods utilizing readily and widely available data, such as rainfall are
         more useful than those requiring specialized observations.
   The applicability of a number of recharge methods is shown in Table 8.6. The
time in the last column of the table refers to the typical period over which data are
needed to apply the method. For those methods that are event, season or yearly
based, the actual data for parameters used may be needed at time steps ranging
from hourly through daily and weekly to monthly, depending on the hydrologic
setting and the precision required. Large volumes of existing data for things like
rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and river flow may need to be collected from
the appropriate authorities.

costs substantially; E: event; S: season; Y: year; H: hydrological time; G: geological time.

   Most of the methods listed in Table 8.6 have some but not all of these features,
and it is therefore desirable to apply and compare a number of independent
approaches. The applicability and potential accuracy of these methods depends on
the superficial environment of geology, geomorphology, soils and the climatic and
hydrological regime. These factors determine the spatial variability of recharge
                   Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                 223

processes, the distribution and extent of runoff, and the characteristics of the
vegetation cover, particularly whether it is natural or agricultural and whether the
latter is with or without irrigation. An initial indication of how variable the
recharge is likely to be can be gained from the overview of the physical conditions
of the area of interest outlined above. It is important also to appreciate that
average groundwater recharge is not necessarily constant over time, as changes in
land use, irrigation infrastructure (such as construction and operation of canals),
irrigation technology and cropping regimes can produce significant changes in
recharge rates and also affect the quality of the infiltrating recharge water, as
shown in Chapter 9.
    Two other major human activities can greatly influence recharge processes.
Firstly, the covering of the land by impermeable surfaces in urban areas reduces
direct infiltration, can lower evaporation and increase and accelerate surface
runoff. Depending on the specific arrangements for storm drainage, overall
groundwater recharge may be increased or decreased (Foster et al., 1998). Leaking
water mains, on-site sanitation and leaking sewers also contribute urban recharge
of differing water quality, and the preliminary physical appraisal of the catchment
referred to in Chapter 6 will indicate whether a more detailed consideration of
urban recharge processes, as given in Lerner et al. (1990) and Foster et al. (1998)
is required to support the assessment of urban impacts in Chapters 10 to 12.
    Secondly, because of ever-rising water demands and increasing scarcity of
freshwater resources, artificial recharge is becoming more widely used as a
component of overall resource management to maintain resources, restore
groundwater levels or prevent saline intrusion (Chapter 19). Various sources of
water are used in artificial recharge schemes, including rainfall harvesting and
collection, river water, mains water, groundwater and reclaimed wastewater, and a
wide range of technologies is employed. In general, artificial recharge may
improve groundwater quality as well as increasing the available storage in an
aquifer. Reclaimed wastewater, however, may contain chemical or microbial
pollutants that are poorly characterized but could impact human health. Primary,
secondary or tertiary treatment progressively removes these pollutants, provided
the treatment facilities are of sufficient capacity, properly designed and correctly
operated. Reclaimed water has been used to augment groundwater supplies in the
southern USA and in Israel for many years. These are well monitored, high
technology installations, but there is increasing interest in the use of untreated or
partially treated wastewater to augment scarce water resources, either by direct
infiltration or through irrigated cultivation (Chapter 9), and an understanding of
the likely pollution threats is therefore required.


8.4       NATURAL HYDROCHEMICAL AND
          GEOCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS
Natural quality varies from one rock type to another, and also within aquifers
along groundwater flow paths, as described in Chapter 4. It is important for those
with responsibility for protecting groundwater quality to be aware of the
224                            Protecting Groundwater for Health

geological environments in which naturally-occurring substances are likely to
exceed drinking-water criteria so that groundwater is properly tested for these
substances and, if necessary, adequately treated to ensure that water is safe for
potable use.
   The potential for a naturally occurring chemical constituent to pose a threat to
public health from drinking-water depends on the distribution of the constituent in
the environment, and on the extent to which the physical and chemical
environmental conditions ensure that the constituent has a high solubility, and
remains soluble. The geology of an area fundamentally controls the distribution of
chemicals in the environment, as particular chemical constituents are generally
associated with particular rock types. Very high concentrations can occur in rocks
associated with specifically mineralized areas (Chapter 11). Climate also plays an
important role in controlling the way that rocks are broken down, and climatic fac-
tors influence soil forming processes and the extent to which specific constituents
are either concentrated in soil profiles, or are leached into rivers or groundwater.
   The geological environments from which the most important health-related
chemicals are derived are shown in Table 8.7. Further information about the most
important individual chemicals is provided in Chapter 4.

8.5       CHARACTERIZING GROUNDWATER
          ABSTRACTION
The scale of groundwater abstraction and methods of abstraction used are also
important factors in assessing groundwater pollution and protecting groundwater
quality. In relation to the former, abstraction sources may create pathways for
groundwater pollution, either directly via the borehole or well itself or through the
aquifer because heavy and prolonged pumping can modify natural groundwater
flow regimes. In relation to the latter, the type, scale and numbers of groundwater
abstraction sources have a bearing on the way in which groundwater protection
measures can be implemented. Further, the condition of wellheads will influence
the potential for direct contamination of drinking-water during abstraction, as well
as the potential for ingress of pollutants into the aquifer. The situation assessment
should therefore include an appraisal of the condition of the wellhead and its
surroundings.

8.5.1     Groundwater abstraction types
Groundwater abstraction takes many forms and employs a range of techniques.
The use of traditional open dug wells goes back thousands of years, drawing water
by hand or using animal power, and there are many parts of the developing world
where these remain important supply sources. They are cheap, relatively easy to
construct in unconsolidated aquifers and simple to maintain, and therefore remain
popular in programmes in which community involvement is strongly promoted.
They are, however, highly sensitive to pollution being directly introduced into the
open top of the well or through the ground immediately around the well. This
direct pollution can be greatly reduced by the use of proper sanitary seals and
aprons around the well (Chapter 18), by covering them and by installing hand
pumps. Drilled boreholes take many forms from very simple, narrow diameter
holes for hand pumps producing less than 0.5 l/s to shafts up to 1 m across from
which tens of litres per second can be abstracted for urban supply or irrigation
(Driscoll, 1986), or wellfields of individual boreholes all connected up to a major
supply, such as those of the Great Man Made River project in Libya. Groundwater
is also abstracted from protected springs and from galleries such as the ancient
qanats of the Middle East.
   Clearly, large-scale groundwater abstraction requires major investment in
drilling, borehole materials, pumps and power supplies and the associated
pipelines and tanks. The loss of a major supply could be a significant problem to
the operator if groundwater pollution were severe enough to render the water
unusable. Treatment to remove pollutants, or the location and development of an
alternative supply, both of which could be very costly, would be required,
emphasizing the benefits of prevention by protecting groundwater.
226                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

8.5.2     Groundwater abstraction and pollutant pathways
Large and prolonged abstraction can modify groundwater flow rates and directions
by reducing or reversing hydraulic gradients and producing cones of depression in
the water table or piezometric surface around pumping wells and wellfields. These
hydraulic changes can in turn create new pollutant pathways or modify existing
ones. In multi-layered aquifer systems in urban areas, the uppermost zones have
usually been developed first for groundwater supply, often with many shallow,
relatively small boreholes and wells. These are typically privately owned and used
for domestic, industrial and commercial supply, and often unregistered and
uncontrolled. As cities have grown, the uppermost aquifer is also used, either
deliberately or accidentally, as a receptor for urban waste and the shallow
groundwater becomes more and more polluted, sometimes to the extent that it
becomes unusable. Municipal authorities and other larger groundwater users
consequently drill into deeper aquifers in search of better quality groundwater, and
the increasing abstraction from depth can induce downward movement of polluted
groundwater, threatening these deeper supplies, as described in Section 8.6.
    In some circumstances, the very act of constructing wells or boreholes may in
itself encourage groundwater pollution by puncturing protective layers above or
between aquifers. There are examples both of boreholes permitting downward
movement of polluted groundwater from shallow to deeper aquifers, and of deep
boreholes penetrating confining layers and allowing naturally saline groundwater
to move up into aquifers containing high quality water. Sometimes even
observation boreholes for measuring groundwater levels or taking groundwater
samples, if constructed without proper understanding of the three-dimensional
hydrogeological conditions, can allow this to happen. Abandoned boreholes can,
therefore, remain as a potential short-circuiting route for pollutants, and
consideration may need to be given to sealing them to try to restore the protective
layer. If disused or abandoned boreholes are used, perhaps covertly and illegally,
for effluent disposal then their passive short-circuiting role can become an active
one as a pollution source, releasing pollutants directly into what may be the most
permeable and productive part of the aquifer. Backfilling and sealing may then be
urgently required.
    Within the situation analysis it is also necessary to assess wellhead
protection/sanitary completion. It is important to bear in mind the source-pathway-
receptor model introduced in Section I, as pollution at wellheads may require a
number of factors to be present. These include hazards (i.e. sources of pollutants)
and pathways (which often reflect specific problems with the infrastructure). In
addition, it may also be useful to assess indirect or contributing factors (Howard,
2002). These do not either directly cause contamination or offer a pathway for the
contamination to enter the groundwater source, but may contribute to the
development of a pathway or lead to build up of contamination within the
immediate vicinity of the borehole. Examples include aspects such as fencing
around the groundwater source, allowing animals to gain access close to the
source, lack of drainage to divert contaminated surface water from the wellhead
area and deterioration in the engineering works at the wellhead (Table 8.8).

8.5.3     Abstraction types and groundwater protection
The ways in which groundwater is abstracted need to be considered when thinking
about its protection. Scale and distribution are particularly important. Taking the
example of the United Kingdom, three large consolidated aquifers provide half or
more of the public supplies in the south, centre and east of the country from
several hundred high yielding boreholes. The United Kingdom’s national
approach to protecting groundwater supplies (Adams and Foster, 1992) designates
zones from which the recharge is derived around these supplies, in which certain
potentially polluting activities are prohibited or controlled. This and other
strategies for groundwater protection are discussed in more detail in Chapter 17.
While this approach is sometimes hydrogeologically problematic, given the
complex local groundwater flow systems that are often encountered in aquifers, it
is logistically and institutionally reasonable to establish protection zones around a
relatively small number of large abstractions. This protection approach has been
applied widely in Europe and North America to large groundwater supplies, both
in the form of individual wells or boreholes and as wellfields – small groups of
closely-spaced boreholes all drawing water from the same aquifer and feeding into
a common pipeline to convey the water to where it is being used.
    The situation would be very different where groundwater is drawn from a large
number of much smaller groundwater supplies widely dispersed over the aquifer
such as, for example, in India and Bangladesh and large parts of Africa. Not only
228                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

is it more difficult to implement protection zoning on this broad scale, the shallow
aquifers used for supply may be highly vulnerable to pollution, and many of the
boreholes or wells may be privately owned. While this situation may occur in
either rural or urban environments, protecting small groundwater supplies from
the wide range of potential polluting activities in urban areas is especially
problematic. Shallow hand dug wells are often particularly difficult to protect. The
conventional approach of protection zoning cannot be easily applied, and the best
strategy may be to ensure careful borehole or well siting in relation to pollution
sources, together with good construction practice with adequate sanitary seals.
This may be backed up a by a policy of resource protection, in which the whole
aquifer outcrop, rather than defined zones around individual supplies, is subject to
some degree of control of likely pollution sources. In practice, however, any
groundwater protection measures may be difficult to implement for large numbers
of small dispersed, perhaps private and usually unregistered supplies. Siting
supplies to avoid pollution sources (and vice versa) and adequate sanitary
protection should always be seen as important lines of defence in protecting
health.
    At the opposite end of the spectrum of groundwater supplies, in karstic areas
large springs are often used. Because of the rapid groundwater flow and response
times in karstic aquifers, these may be especially vulnerable to pollution. In
addition, karst springs may be supported by groundwater recharge from large
catchments that are notoriously difficult to define.


   NOTE X          Approaches to protecting groundwater quality need to be
                   matched not only to the hydrogeological situation, but also to
                   the types and scales of groundwater abstraction.




8.6       SUSCEPTIBILITY OF GROUNDWATER
          RESOURCES TO DEGRADATION
8.6.1     Scope and scale of resource degradation
As a component of the overall sustainable management of water resources, i.e. the
quantity of water available for use, is largely outside the scope of this monograph,
but it is nevertheless necessary to comment on the potential impacts of
groundwater usage on the overall resource situation. This is because heavy and
prolonged groundwater abstraction and poor management of groundwater
resources can have negative consequences for groundwater quality. These
consequences can be severe and are often difficult and costly to manage and
remedy. Also, lack of water availability for domestic uses can have severe public
health consequences, and in such circumstances health authorities may need to
                   Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                 229

ensure their needs are taken account of in overall water resources management.
Approaches to managing water resources are dealt with in Chapter 19.
   The availability of groundwater in an area affects current and future drinking-
water quality either by the direct effects on groundwater quality or indirectly by
changing the degree to which groundwater is available for use. For example, lack
of future availability of groundwater may force communities to use surface water
that is more contaminated or more difficult to access. Thus there is a need to
interact with those outside the health sector involved in the management of
groundwater to address all aspects of water management. It is also important to
recognize that domestic use of groundwater for drinking-water and household
purposes is but one use of groundwater. In many areas, withdrawals for other
water-use sectors, particularly agriculture, but also possibly industrial uses, may
far exceed withdrawals for domestic use. Worldwide, about 70 per cent of total
water use (surface water and groundwater) is for agriculture, 22 per cent for
industry, and 8 per cent for domestic purposes (Bowden, 2002). Heavy
groundwater use for irrigation is commonly a major cause of groundwater level
declines. The linkages between water quality and water quantity suggest that
monitoring programmes for each should be integrated. Greater attention is needed
to the long-term value of water-level data collected as part of water-quality
monitoring and to the potential synergies between water quality and water level
monitoring networks (Taylor and Alley, 2002).
   Traditionally, surface water and groundwater have been treated as separate
water resources, so that one could be utilized independently without affecting the
other. With increased utilization of water resources, has come greater recognition
of surface water and groundwater as fundamentally interconnected (Winter et al.,
1998). Depletion of one resource eventually results in depletion of the other, and
likewise, contamination of one resource can contaminate the other. This
recognition of groundwater and surface water as a single resource has increased
the imperative for those involved in development of groundwater to interact with
those involved with surface water, and vice versa. This is true from both water
quantity and water quality perspectives.
   Over-exploitation of groundwater resources or individual aquifers by
uncontrolled, excessive abstraction, while often not precisely definable in
scientific terms is nevertheless an emotive term when used at the political or
institutional level (Foster et al., 2000). At this level, concern relates more to the
consequences of excessive abstraction rather than to the volumes of water
themselves, although the latter need to be regularly monitored to determine
whether control measures are proving effective. Many of the changes in response
to groundwater pumping are subtle, and they may occur over long periods of time.
Development of groundwater resources increasingly requires a more complete
understanding of the effects of abstractions on groundwater systems (Alley et al.,
2002).
   The impacts of excessive abstraction range from the often reversible
interference with springs and other wells to much less reversible degradation
caused by ingress of saline or polluted water and land subsidence (Foster, 1992;
230                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

Alley et al., 1999; Custodio, 2002). While declines in groundwater levels and
reduced spring flow or baseflow may be reversible in humid areas, groundwater
mining in arid regions can be virtually irreversible (in the absence of artificial
recharge) on any practical time scale. The cumulative effects of pumping can
cause significant and unanticipated consequences when not properly considered in
management plans. The possible consequences of large abstractions are
summarized in Table 8.9 and in the text below, and the susceptibility of the broad
classes of hydrogeological environments defined in Chapter 2 to some of these
effects is shown in Table 8.10.

              land subsidence and related effects          lying/interbedded aquitards

    The reversible effects in the upper part of Table 8.9 result when an excessive
number of boreholes or wells are constructed and heavily pumped, especially if
the uppermost part of the subsurface geological sequence provides the most
productive aquifer. The two effects in the middle of the table, vegetation stress
and aquifer compaction with reduction in transmissivity, may be reversible or
irreversible, depending on the hydrogeological conditions and the length of time
over which the excessive abstraction has been established. The most serious
effects, which are irreversible or nearly so, include the mechanisms of quality
deterioration given at the bottom of Table 8.9.

8.6.2      Deterioration of groundwater quality
Groundwater abstraction can affect water quality in several ways. Perhaps best
known is saltwater intrusion in coastal areas resulting from large withdrawals of
groundwater. Some inland aquifers also experience similar problems, where
withdrawal of good-quality water from the upper parts of aquifers allows underlying
saline water to move upward and degrade water quality. Changes in the quality of
water as a result of abstractions also can occur as water levels decline and the
pumped water originates from different parts of the aquifer system, usually because
of the downward movement of polluted water in response to pumping. Likewise,
declining water levels can result in changing oxidation and other hydrochemical
conditions, mobilizing or precipitating different chemical constituents. In addition,
                    Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                     231

surface water can be drawn into the aquifer with poorer water quality or of a
chemical composition that mobilizes naturally occurring chemicals.
   There are numerous examples of saline intrusion where heavy groundwater
abstraction from productive coastal limestone or alluvial aquifers for urban,
industrial or agricultural usage has produced serious intrusion of saline water into
these aquifers, often stretching far inland. Under natural conditions in coastal
aquifers, fresh water derived from recharge overlies saline water in such a way
that flow takes place towards the sea (Figure 8.7A). Their relative densities govern
the position of the boundary between fresh and saline water. Under simplifying
assumptions (homogeneous aquifer properties and no vertical gradients in heads),
the depth of the interface below sea level can be assumed to be about 40 times the
height of the fresh groundwater table above sea level. This is known as the
Ghyben-Herzberg relationship, and is described in most hydrogeology textbooks
(Freeze and Cherry, 1979; Domenico and Schwartz, 1998). On small islands such
as those of the Caribbean and the Florida Keys the result is a lens-shaped body of
freshwater which can be difficult to exploit without causing quality deterioration.




Figure 8.7. Impact of abstraction on a coastal aquifer system (Morris et al., 2003; British
Geological Survey ©NERC)

   When pumping disturbs the natural conditions (Figure 8.7B), the consequent
lowering of the freshwater table results in a corresponding movement of the
freshwater-salt water interface which, given the relationship described above, is in
the ratio of 40:1, i.e. 1 m of water level decline produces about 40 m of upward
232                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

movement of the interface. In practice the interface is not usually sharp and
uniform, but affected by dispersion, and in detail the three-dimensional picture of
saline intrusion can be particularly complicated where rapid movement along
fractures and fissures permits a complex fingering of saline water far inland.
Given that coastal plains are often densely populated and agriculturally productive
regions, it is not surprising that groundwater abstraction has grown rapidly. The
resulting serious saline intrusion problems have been encountered in many
aquifers, e.g. on the Mediterranean Coast of Spain, in the Netherlands, Mexico,
Florida, Cyprus and some of the Caribbean islands. Even far from coastal regions,
upconing of saline water from deeper aquifers can be caused by heavy
groundwater abstraction from freshwater zones above.
   Induced downward movement of pollutants is widely observed in many rapidly
developing urban areas underlain by multi-layered aquifer sequences in which the
establishment of large-scale abstraction from deeper aquifer horizons imposes or
accentuates downward hydraulic gradients and induces accelerated downward
movement of polluted water from shallower aquifers. In the city of Santa Cruz in
Bolivia, for example, most private boreholes supplying water for industries, small
businesses and private domestic use draw groundwater from less than 90 m depth,
whereas the public supply is largely dawn from deeper aquifers between 90 and
350 m below ground. The shallow groundwater has become polluted (Figure 8.8)
from poor waste disposal practices, and abstraction has induced downward
movement of polluted water. This general situation is rather widespread, but the
degree of protection of the deeper aquifers and likely timescale of any
deterioration in the quality of the groundwater abstracted from them depends on
the local hydrogeological situation, and will certainly need specific assessment.

   The second situation mentioned above, i.e. changes in the oxidation-reduction
potential of the groundwater resulting in the mobilization of metals is illustrated
by the situation in Hat Yai, Thailand. The city obtains about 50 per cent of its
water supply from private boreholes drawing from an aquifer below a semi-
confining layer consisting of about 30 m of silts. Seepage of organic-rich
wastewaters from collection canals into the upper part of the underlying alluvial
aquifer sequence has produced strongly reducing groundwater. This permits the
release of naturally-occurring iron and manganese from the sediments and allows
the build up of troublesome concentrations of ammonium, which are being drawn
down to the abstraction boreholes (Figure 8.9).

    This general picture of urban public supplies being vulnerable to polluted
shallow groundwater is probably a widespread problem, and cities such as
Nottingham (United Kingdom), Lahore, Karachi (Pakistan) and New Delhi (India)
are either experiencing such pollution already or it can be anticipated in the future.
The degree of protection afforded by any intervening lower-permeability strata,
and the likely timescale of any impacts on deeper groundwater require specific
investigations in each case. Similar problems can also be experienced where
municipal water supplies are drawn from neighbouring rural areas in which urban
wastewater is used for irrigation.
    The linkages between groundwater quantity and quality management are well
illustrated by the region west of Lake Michigan in the USA, an area that includes
the major cities of Chicago and Milwaukee and hosts a population in excess of 12
million people. A number of converging issues have placed increasing pressure in
234                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

recent years on groundwater resource for these communities, most of which rely
heavily on a regional sandstone aquifer. Pumping from this aquifer has resulted in
a drawdown cone that extends throughout much of the region, with water-level
declines in excess of 300 m measured at some locations. This regional drawdown
cone is one of the largest in the USA. Although partial recovery has taken place in
some areas through reduction in withdrawals, concern continues about the
drawdowns, as well as their water quality implications. For example, the presence
of high levels of arsenic in the upper part of the sandstone aquifer in some areas
has been attributed to the oxidation of minerals in the newly unsaturated deposits
at the top of the sandstone aquifer. Likewise, proposals for artificial recharge to
store Lake Michigan water in the aquifer have been hampered by the detection of
arsenic in the recovered water. Drawdown in the sandstone aquifer has also
coincided with increases in the concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) in
much of the aquifer from upcoming of saline water and leakage from shale beds.
Radium concentrations generally show a direct correlation with the concentration
of TDS, and it is anticipated that increases in TDS associated with drawdown in
the sandstone aquifer may result in an increase in radium concentrations. To
properly address these multi-faceted issues, cooperative efforts are needed on a
region wide basis to examine various approaches such as strategically shifting
water supply to surface water or to other aquifers, optimizing the location and
pumping from wells so as to minimize drawdown problems across pumping
centres, installation of deeper casing for new private wells or use of deeper
‘cluster’ wells for multiple households, further investigation of the water-quality
effects of artificial recharge, and various treatment options.

8.6.3     Other effects of excessive abstraction
As the depth to water increases, the water must be lifted higher to reach the land
surface, and as the lift distance increases, greater energy is required to drive the
pump. Depending on the use of the water and the cost of energy, it may no longer
be economically feasible to use water for a given purpose. Furthermore, with
declining water levels, well yields will decline, possibly below usable rates. In
extreme cases, groundwater levels may fall below the bottom of existing pumps,
necessitating the expense of lowering the pump, deepening the well, or drilling a
deeper replacement well.
   In many environments, surface-water and groundwater systems are intimately
linked. Groundwater abstraction can reduce spring flow, or alter how water moves
between an aquifer and streams, lakes, or wetlands. The decrease in contribution
to surface water may occur either by intercepting groundwater flow that
discharged into a surface water body under natural conditions, or by increasing the
rate of water movement from surface water into an aquifer.
   Although several different earth processes can cause land subsidence, a
considerable amount is caused by groundwater withdrawals. For example, more
than 80 per cent of the land subsidence in the USA is related to the withdrawal of
groundwater (Galloway et al., 1999). Geologic conditions most susceptible to
                     Assessment of aquifer pollution vulnerability                    235

subsidence are the existence of compressible clay and silt layers or rocks that are
relatively soluble, such as limestone, dolomite or evaporite deposits.

8.6.4      Impacts of abstraction and hydrogeological environments
All groundwater abstraction results in some decline in water levels in the aquifer
over a certain area. Some reduction is often necessary and desirable since
improved land drainage is often a side effect or even an objective of the pumping.
A degree of induced seasonal water level decline may also be desirable for
creating subsurface storage to receive the high rates of wet season recharge. If,
however, the overall abstraction rate in the area of interest, or in the aquifer as a
whole, exceeds the long-term average rate of replenishment, then there will be
continuous decline in groundwater levels and mining of aquifer storage is the
result. The presence or absence, and the relative severity of the effects of
excessive groundwater exploitation are highly dependent on hydrogeological
environment, as shown in Table 8.10.

abstraction

Agriculture: Potential hazards and
information needs
S. Appleyard and O. Schmoll




Agriculture has only received serious attention as a source of groundwater contamination
in the last few decades because of the intense focus on industrial and urban pollution
problems in many developed countries. However, agricultural practices are often
significant sources of health-relevant groundwater pollution. Nitrate contamination can
be found in many parts of the world mainly due to the large land area used for agriculture
and the usage of chemical fertilizers and animal manures to enhance crop yields. The use
of animal manures and the production and disposal of wastes from livestock can also
contaminate groundwater with pathogens. A wide range of pesticides used in agriculture
to control weeds, insects, nematodes, and fungi in crops, can pollute groundwater.
Further, land clearing for agriculture can also lead to groundwater quality problems due
to changes in hydrological conditions.
    Contamination of groundwater by agriculture can cause serious health problems in
rural and urban populations that depend on groundwater for water supply. The discharge
of polluted groundwater into wetlands, rivers, estuaries and the coastal environment can
contribute to toxic algal blooms in these water bodies that can also cause health
problems. These problems have progressively increased over the last few decades with
the general intensification of agriculture to feed the world’s growing population.

   In many parts of the world, more than 40 per cent of the land surface is used for
agricultural production, and in very densely populated countries, the proportion of
agricultural land is often greater than 70 per cent of the land surface. An increasing
proportion of the world’s population is moving from rural areas to large urban centres. In
both developing and developed countries, horticulture and market gardening are
increasingly being carried out on vacant land within cities and in peri-urban areas. Urban
agriculture is extremely important for impoverished urban dwellers in low income
countries, as it provides a measure of food security when there is little disposable income
to purchase food, and urban agriculture typically provides more than half of the urban
household’s food needs in many Asian cities.
   Agricultural practices vary enormously throughout the world due to variations in
climate and soil types, population density and traditional and modern methods of
cultivation. However, there are a number of common agricultural activities that
frequently are significant sources of groundwater pollution. These are presented here
together with guidance on how to compile the information needed for situation
assessment.


   NOTE X            Agricultural practices and the environment in which they take place
                     vary greatly. Health hazards arising from agriculture and their
                     potential to pollute groundwater therefore need to be analysed
                     specifically for the conditions in a given setting. The information in
                     this chapter supports hazard analysis in the context of developing a
                     Water Safety Plan for a given water supply (Chapter 16). Options
                     for controlling these risks are introduced in Chapter 21.




9.1       USE OF MANURES AND FERTILIZERS
Animal manures and human excrement have probably been used as a source of nutrients
to enhance crop yields since agriculture commenced more than 4000 years ago. They are
still widely used as fertilizers in the developing world, where chemical fertilizers are
often expensive and not widely available. Animal manures are also still used in the
developed world to reduce fertilizer costs and as a disposal method for animal wastes,
particularly from intensive animal rearing. They are also being re-introduced to
agriculture as alternatives to chemical fertilizers through the increased popularity of
organic farming methods. Chemical fertilizers in contrast have only been available for
the last 100 years, and only widely available for the last 50 years.

Nitrate contamination
Among the nutrients, nitrogen species in manures and fertilizers are the chemicals of
greatest concern as groundwater pollutants, and among them particularly nitrate because
of the high solubility of most nitrate salts and because of its potential health effects in
drinking-water.

    Livestock manures mainly consist of organic matter, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium) and trace elements. When managed correctly, nutrients in livestock can
be a valuable resource. The nutrient content of manures varies considerably depending
on animal species, manure moisture, feeding methods and nutritional conditions, but is
generally much higher in poultry than other livestock. Table 9.1 shows the mass of
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contained in excreta for a variety of animals.

    Nitrogen occurs in both inorganic and organic chemical species in manure. The
ammonium form (NH4+) originates from urea nitrogen in the urine, and the more stable
organic form largely originates from faeces. The nitrogen content of manures varies
considerably depending on its age and on how it is handled and stored, and is generally
much lower in well aged manures due to the volatilization of ammonia (NH3) into the
atmosphere. During storage either in open or closed systems ammonia losses occur in a
range of 5-40 per cent (White and Sharpley, 1996).
    Losses due to ammonia volatilization can occur very rapidly, and up to 20 per cent of
nitrogen can be lost within 4 days of fresh manures being applied to the surface of soils.
If manures are ploughed into the soil, ammonium is either directly available to the plants
or converts to another plant available form, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-), and the losses may be
reduced to about 5 per cent (White and Sharpley, 1996). Figure 9.1 summarizes the
chemical behaviour of nitrogenous material applied to soils in manure and fertilizers.
    Once manure is applied to a soil as solids or in slurries, a number of chemical and
microbial processes can occur depending on chemical conditions within the soil. Organic
matter containing nitrogen is progressively broken down by microbial activity releasing
ammonium ions that are generally absorbed by clay particles in the soil. In well aerated
soils, nitrifying bacteria oxidize ammonium to nitrate, and if there is abundant organic
matter within the soil profile and anaerobic conditions, denitrifying bacteria can convert
nitrate to nitrogen gas which diffuses through the soil back into the atmosphere. Plant
uptake of nitrate and ammonium removes nitrogen from the soil profile. Organic
nitrogen is largely unavailable to plants until microbial activity in soil releases
ammonium from the organic matter (Figure 9.1; also see Chapter 4.3).

Figure 9.1. The physical and chemical behaviour of nitrogen in an agricultural catchment

    Chemical fertilizers consist of inorganic salts of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and
sulphur with the addition of some trace metals necessary for healthy plant growth.
Generally, nitrogen is present in inorganic fertilizers in the form of soluble salts of
ammonium and nitrate. Nitrogen in fertilizer is generally more available for plant uptake
than from manures, but is also more easily leached into groundwater if used in excess.
Slow release fertilizers greatly reduce the risk of nutrient leaching, but these are often too
expensive for widespread use in agriculture. Table 9.2 shows the typical chemical
composition of common inorganic fertilizers or constituents of fertilizer formulations.
    The amount of nitrogen applied in manure and fertilizer varies greatly depending on a
range of factors. Ideally, application rates should be adapted to the cropping system used,
plant uptake rates, soil contents of nutrient fraction available to the crop and climate and
soil conditions in the drinking-water catchment area (see Chapter 21). However, in many
situations rates of application exceed crop uptake rates. This is especially the case in
areas with high livestock densities or intensive livestock farming where volumes of
animal waste produced often exceed local demand for use as fertilizer. In these areas,
application practices for manures may be driven by the need of getting rid of them rather
than their use as a nutrient source. This problem tends to occur where other means of
managing the large amounts of animal wastes are difficult and transportation costs for a
wider distribution of manure to areas where soils show fertilizer deficits are unattractive
or prohibitive. Moreover, application of chemical fertilizers and manures can also
                Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                    247

substantially exceed recommended rates due to the lack of knowledge or information of
farmers on the factors which determine good application practices, or under the influence
of ‘advisers’ or aggressive marketing strategies that try to convince farmers that crop
yields will be bigger and better by using excessive fertilizers. In both cases, behaviour of
single farmers can become the key factor in whether or not nitrogen pollution of
groundwater is likely to occur.

    Often more than 200 kg/ha of nitrogen is applied for intensive production of non-
leguminous crops, and Salama et al. (1999) reported even more than 500 kg/ha on some
horticultural crops in Malaysia. Loading rates on fertilized improved grazed pasture may
exceed 400 kg/ha of nitrogen due to the combined effects of fertilizer use and high stock
densities in fields (Sumner and McLaughlin, 1996). Nitrogen application in excess of
140 kg/ha on coarse sandy soils, or in excess of 200 kg/ha on loamy soils, have caused
nitrate concentrations in groundwater to exceed drinking-water criteria in irrigated
horticulture in Perth, Western Australia (Water and Rivers Commission, 1996).
Although these loadings do not seem high in comparison with crop nitrogen
requirements which typically vary between 50 and 400 kg/ha (USGS, 1999), the rate and
timing of individual applications of fertilizer is critical in determining how much nitrogen
leaches past the root zone and into groundwater.
    Much of the ammonia in animal urine may be oxidized to nitrate, and the nitrification
of localized patches of urine in soil can cause significant contamination of groundwater
by nitrate (Close et al., 2001). The amount of mineralized nitrogen in urine patches on
grazed pasture may be up 600 kg N/ha (Ball and Ryden, 1984) and can greatly exceed
the capacity of the pasture to take up the nitrate, leading to leaching to groundwater. The
problem is exacerbated by the uneven distribution of urine patches in pasture, with high
concentrations of mineralized nitrogen in soil often occurring near watering points or
stock yards. For example, Ruz-Jerez et al. (1994) estimated that for a rotationally grazed
clover-ryegrass pasture in New Zealand that was fixing 144 kg/ha of nitrogen yearly,
248                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

only about 10 per cent of the area was affected at any time by urine patches, but these
patches contributed about 55 per cent of the nitrate leached from the pasture.
   In addition to the application rate of manure and fertilizer, the factors that significantly
determine the extent to which nitrate is leached from soils are the physical and chemical
properties of the soil, climate, land use and whether or not irrigation is used. The soils
most vulnerable to nitrate leaching are sandy soils with a low organic matter content.
Nitrogen compounds applied to these soils are readily nitrified to form nitrate, and the
high permeability of the soils may allow nitrate ions to be rapidly leached, allowing
limited opportunity for plant uptake or denitrification (Box 9.1). The poor nature of these
soils often encourages farmers to add excess manure and fertilizer to get reasonable
yields, particularly in horticultural areas. Nitrogen is retained more effectively in loamy
soils containing large amounts of organic carbon, but nevertheless nitrate leaching still
occurs in this type of soil.

            Box 9.1. Sandy soils and nitrate concentrations in groundwaters
      Work by Pionke et al. (1990) estimated that farmers applied between four and
      seven times the amount of nitrogen in poultry manure and fertilizer than could
      be taken up by crops in areas used for irrigated horticulture on sandy soils in
      Western Australia. Nitrate concentrations in leachate below the root zone of the
      crops were up to 200 mg N/l. Concentrations in groundwater beneath the crops
      commonly ranged between 10 and 70 mg N/l (Pionke et al., 1990; Lantzke,
      1999), compared to concentrations of less than 1 mg N/l in groundwater beneath
      uncleared native vegetation.
      Weil et al. (1990) found that groundwater in sandy soils in Maryland in the
      USA, an area used for irrigated maize cropping, contained between 10 and 20
      mg N/l and 20 and 30 mg N/l from fertilizer and manure use respectively.

    Nitrate leaching is also strongly influenced by climatic factors. In climates with
strongly seasonal rainfall, nitrate concentrations in groundwater may vary seasonally,
peaking after the onset of the rainy season when infiltrating water flushes nitrate out of
the vadose zone into groundwater. In climates with cold winters where the ground
freezes or there is snow cover, maximum nitrate leaching often takes place during the
spring thaw (Box 9.2).
    Land use and vegetation cover have a strong effect on nitrate leaching. Less nitrate is
generally leached under permanent grassland than under either arable land or ploughed
grassland (DOE, 1986). Tilling and leaving agricultural land fallow increases the risk of
nitrate contamination caused by the mineralization of nitrogen-rich organic material in
the soil profile. Keeping land fallow can accentuate nitrate leaching by up to nine-fold
from pasture, and by a factor of two from cropped land (Juergens-Gschwind, 1989).
    The use of artificial irrigation in pasture and cropping increases the risk of nitrate
being leached to the water table due to increases in infiltration rates of water through the
soil profile. This may cause nitrogen leaching rates to more than double. For instance,
annual nitrogen leaching rates from unimproved (i.e. not irrigated) dairy pasture in New
Zealand are typically 10-25 kg/ha, whereas leaching rates from irrigated pasture areas are
                Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                    249

65-70 kg/ha (Burden, 1986). Excessive irrigation in semi-arid or arid areas can further
increase nitrate and other dissolved salt concentrations through evapotranspiration of
water in the soil (Romijn, 1986). This may also cause water near irrigation areas to
become too saline for potable use.

              Box 9.2. Rainfall and nitrate concentrations in groundwaters
    In the United Kingdom nitrate leaching is least in spring and summer due to
    crop uptake and is greatest during autumn and winter when there is little uptake
    and soils are saturated with water. Annual rates of nitrogen leaching from arable
    land in the United Kingdom range from 40-120 kg/ha, with a weighted mean of
    about 50 kg/ha (Addiscott and Gold, 1994).
    In tropical regions with monsoonal climates, leaching of nitrogen from soil
    profiles increases at the onset of the wet season. In a study of the impacts of
    agriculture on groundwater quality in Sri Lanka, Lawrence and Kumppnarachi
    (1986) found that nitrate concentrations in groundwater beneath rice paddies
    and other horticultural areas typically increased from an average of 10 to 25 mg
    N/l in the dry season to more than 40 mg N/l at the onset of the wet season.
    Concentrations in groundwater then progressively declined to dry season levels.
    The high nitrogen concentrations in groundwater were due to both the high rate
    at which nutrients were applied to crops, and due to the fact that several crops
    could be grown in a year in the tropical climate.

Pathogen contamination
In addition to being a potential source of nitrate contamination, manure can also
contaminate groundwater with a variety of pathogens that can affect human health, either
through the ingestion of unwashed crops, or through the ingestion of polluted
groundwater used as a source of drinking-water.
   Animal manure can contain large numbers of pathogenic organisms such as bacteria,
viruses, protozoa and helminths that can cause human disease, i.e. up to 106 pathogens
per gram of faeces (Gannon et al., 2004). However many species excreted by farm
animals do not cause disease in humans. Pathogens from manure that may cause disease
from drinking contaminated groundwater are shown in Table 9.3.
   The number of viable pathogens in manure can be greatly reduced by storing manure
before use. Survival times of disease-causing bacteria and protozoa are greatly affected
by ambient temperature (Table 9.4). Viruses may become dormant and can persist for
long periods in manure. For example, the infectious avian influenza virus can survive in
water for 207 days at 17 °C (Brown and Alexander, 1998), and rotaviruses are stable in
faeces for 7 to 9 months (Goss et al., 2001). However, the longevity of some viruses can
be reduced by the presence of predatory bacteria. The longevity of pathogens can be
further reduced by either aerobically composting or drying manure, and most pathogens
die within a week if manure is treated in this manner provided that the temperature in the
compost pile reaches 55 °C (Goss et al., 2001) (see Chapter 21 for details).

    Soils generally provide an effective barrier against pathogens reaching the water table,
and short die-off time of most pathogens in the sub-surface ensures that the number of
viable organisms reaching groundwater are low (Chapter 3). Most cases of waterborne
disease from groundwater consumption are caused by viruses and bacteria as protozoa
and helminths are too large to be transmitted far through the pore spaces between soil
particles (although some occurrences of groundwater contamination by the protozoa
Giardia and Cryptosporidium have been recorded). Most cases of waterborne disease
from wells where there is a thick soil cover are due to the faulty construction of head
works, or to the use of manure near sinkholes, abandoned wells or other features that will
allow water and contaminated material direct, rapid access to the water table (Figure 9.2).
    Contamination of groundwater by pathogens is often a significant issue in areas
where there is a thin or no soil cover over fractured rock or karstic limestone (Box 9.3;
Figure 9.2). In these terrains, pathogens can be rapidly carried through preferential flow
paths into groundwater with little or no attenuation (Chapters 2 and 3). Pore spaces in

karstic aquifers may even allow large organisms like protozoa to be transmitted through
the aquifer to water supply wells.

      Box 9.3. Microbial quality of water in karst aquifers and in badly constructed
                                          wells
    Studies of bacterial contamination in springs in a limestone terrain in
    Ireland (Thorn and Coxon, 1992) indicated contamination with coliform
    bacteria in spring water samples to be derived from dairy cattle. Detected
    numbers of microorganisms vary greatly with time from 0 to 300
    cfu/100 ml of water within a two hour period. The bacterial quality of
    water is usually at its worst after heavy rainfall, and water from some
    springs was estimated to have travelled about 1 km from recharge areas within a
    12 to 18 hour period after heavy rain.
    One of the best documented outbreaks of disease caused by groundwater
    contamination by manure occurred in the small Canadian town of Walkerton in
    May 2000. Seven people died and more than 2300 people became
    seriously ill when pathogens from manure spread on a nearby farm was
    washed in surface runoff into a badly constructed and poorly monitored
    well used as a water supply for the town. The disease was caused by the
    virulent strain of E. coli O157:H7 and by Campylobacter jejuni. A
    Parliamentary Enquiry into the incident was held in 2001, and an initial
    report published (O’Connor, 2001).

Figure 9.2. Potential pathways for groundwater contamination by pathogens in an agricultural area
252                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Contamination of groundwater by pathogens is also an issue in shallow fractured rock
aquifers and in volcanic aquifers. Large cave systems may also be formed in some
volcanic terrains as a result of the degassing of volatiles dissolved in molten lava flows,
and the interface between individual lava flows may contain interconnected voids that
may allow groundwater to transmit contaminants over long distances. Therefore volcanic
aquifers show some of the hydrogeological characteristics of karst aquifers, and share the
same extremely high vulnerability to groundwater contamination.
   Karst-like features can also develop in tropical or subtropical regions with lateritic
soils. Voids can form in lateritic duricrusts due to the erosion of soft, poorly consolidated
clays in an otherwise cemented ferruginous matrix. This can give rise to a spongy
network of interconnected voids which may be at least several millimetres in diameter,
and which can rapidly transmit water and pathogens (Box 9.4).


                              Box 9.4. Voids in lateritic soils
      In Brazil, voids in lateritic soils appear to be caused by termite activity
      (Mendonça et al., 1994). Where intensive urban development takes place,
      increased point sources of recharge such as storm water soakwells and sewage
      disposal systems, coupled with intensive groundwater abstraction, can erode
      these voids to form sinkholes and caves which may be 5 m or more in diameter
      and several hundred metres long. These so called ‘pseudosinkholes’ may cause
      groundwater contamination problems of a similar nature to limestone karst
      aquifers. Contamination of shallow groundwater by pathogens may become a
      problem in countries like Brazil where tropical forests overlying laterites are
      being rapidly cleared and developed for agriculture and urban land use.



9.2         DISPOSAL OF ANIMAL CARCASSES
The disposal of animal carcasses by burial on farms or in landfill sites may pose public
health problems if burial sites are located near wells or tubewells used as a source of
drinking-water (see Figure 9.2). Generally, the risks are similar than those posed by the
excessive use of animal manures, including contaminating groundwater with nitrates and
pathogens such as verotoxin-producing E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella,
Cryptosporidium and Giardia.
    The risks of groundwater contamination are greatest when very large numbers of
animals may be destroyed and buried to control the spread of animal diseases in
agricultural areas. Of particular concern to public health are epidemics of animal disease
that may also cause disease in humans, especially where the disease-causing agent is
persistent in soil and groundwater. The mass burial of animal carcasses infected by such
a disease-causing agent may pose a risk to nearby groundwater supplies, although the
risks are often reduced by burning of carcases prior to burial (UK Department of Health,
2001).
    One group of disease-causing agents of concern in this regard are prions, particularly
the prion that causes the disease BSE (Mad Cow disease) in cattle. Ingestion of the prion
                Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                    253

can also infect humans and cause the disease variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in
humans. Prions are inanimate disease-causing agents. It is hypothesized that they are
distorted forms of proteins naturally present in neural as well as many other body tissues
of animals (Gannon, 2004). In contrast to beef products, the BSE agent is likely to be
highly dispersed in water and therefore the daily intake of infectious prions is likely to be
very low by nature (Gannon, 2004). The proteins are highly resistant to physical and
chemical agents, such as heat, ultraviolet light and oxidants (e.g. chlorine) and may pass
through water treatment plants (Gannon, 2004).
   Prions behave as particulates in soil and groundwater, and the movement of these
proteins in geological media is likely to be affected by the same processes that influence
the behaviour of other particulate infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses (UK EA,
2000). The prion protein has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, and this
property limits mobility in groundwater and promotes adhesion to hydrophobic particles
(Gannon, 2004). However, it is uncertain whether significant amounts of prions are
moved by filtration in soils, and thus the risk of groundwater contamination is uncertain
(UK Department of Health, 2001). Therefore the risk of groundwater contamination is
most likely when:
    • prion-contaminate carcass are disposed of in areas where there is little or no soil
         cover, and fractures or karstic features provide a direct conduit between land
         surface and groundwater;
    • overland flow transports material from carcasses in fields or from prion-
         contaminated animal-based fertilizer (blood and bone fertilizer) directly into
         poorly constructed wells or tubewells.


9.3        ANIMAL FEEDLOTS
Stocking densities on agricultural land have progressively increased in many parts of the
world due to an increasing demand for animal products and improvements in agricultural
techniques. This has culminated in the development of animal feedlots, where animals
are maintained in pens in a controlled environment. Feedlots may either be open-air
facilities, or completely enclosed within large buildings. Typically feedlots are used for
beef and pork production, and for poultry, meat products and eggs. Dairies are similar to
feedlots in that a large number of cows are gathered together for milking, although they
may be allowed to run free range in between milking events.
   The large number of stock housed in animal feedlots generates great amount of
wastes that can become an unintended, but nonetheless substantial, point sources of
widespread groundwater pollution if not managed properly. For example, beef feedlots
may contain 500 or more steers, and a typical 450 kg steer will produce up to 30 kg of
solid and liquid wastes each day. The 1996 National Water Quality Inventory carried out
by the US EPA (1997) found that agriculture in general was the leading cause of water
pollution in the USA and that 20 per cent of the problems were due to animal feedlots
alone.
   The major sources of pollution from feedlots are manure, animal carcasses, process
wastewater (e.g. dairy wastes), feed, and bedding materials. The contaminants of highest
concern for groundwater are nutrients, particularly nitrogen and pathogens. Wastewater
254                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

from feedlots may also contain growth hormones and pharmaceuticals (e.g. antibiotics)
used to accelerate the growth of livestock. Table 9.5 shows the typical nutrient content of
wastes from feedlots.

    Groundwater contamination problems from feedlots are mostly from wastewater
generated by the washdown of the feedlots, and storm water runoff from manure
stockpiles and other wastes. If feedlot pens are constructed on bare soil without
impermeable floors, leachate for manure and urine can percolate into groundwater.
Moreover, if liquid wastes and washdown are not drained into lined retention and
treatment ponds but are allowed to discharge directly to the environment, feedlots may
become significant point-sources of groundwater contamination. This is particularly
critical for feedlots sited in areas with sandy soils or high groundwater tables, and if
feedlots are located in flood-prone areas or next to a sinkhole, abandoned well or other
feature that will allow direct access to the water table. For example, the Western
Australian policy on feedlots states that there is a high risk of groundwater contamination
from feedlots occurring if the water table is less than 1.5 m below the surface,
particularly if soils are sandy and if they are sited in flood-prone areas with more than 1
in 100 year flooding frequency, or on land sloping at more than 5 per cent (1 in 200
grade), as this makes wastewater management in the feedlot extremely difficult, and
indirectly increases the risk of contamination (Agriculture WA et al., 2000). The
Government British Columbia, Canada, requires that feedlots and manure storages are
not located within 30 m of wells used for water supply, on land with a slope of more than
4 per cent, and that there is sufficient land area to allow for manure application in a
sustainable manner that will not cause groundwater pollution (BC MAFF, 2000).
    Well-managed feedlots usually have wastewater retention and treatment ponds to
contain feedlot effluent. However, feedlots commonly leak if pond liners have not been
properly constructed or are not well maintained: a study of feedlot wastewater ponds in
North Carolina, USA, found that 50 per cent of the ponds leaked (Centner and Risse,
1999).
    Typically, there is a much higher amount of waste generated, and therefore a greater
risk of groundwater contamination occurring, in uncovered open-air facilities than in
enclosed feedlots with roofs. This is particularly the case if treatment and/or storage
                Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                    255

ponds do not have sufficient storage capacity to store water from intense rainfall events.
Treated pond effluent is commonly used to irrigate pasture (Section 9.4), but treatment
ponds have to be designed to store water for the wettest period of the year when there is
little opportunity to dispose of effluent through land irrigation.
     Manure collected in feedlots will commonly be applied as fertilizer on cultivated
fields and may become diffuse source of groundwater pollution, particularly in areas
where feedlots significantly increase stock densities in relation to application options for
manure within economically viable distances. Application of manures is discussed in the
previous Section 9.1.


9.4        USE OF WASTEWATER AND SEWAGE SLUDGE
           ON LAND AND IN AQUACULTURE
There has been an increasing interest in the use of wastewater in agriculture over the last
few decades due to increased demand for fresh water. Population growth, increased per
capita use of water, and the demands of industry and of the agricultural sector have all
put pressure on limited fresh water resources. The use of wastewater has been successful
for irrigation of a wide array of crops, and increases in crop yields from 10-30 per cent
have been reported. In addition, the use of treated wastewater for irrigation and industrial
purposes can be a strategy to increase the amount of fresh water available for domestic
use, and to improve the quality of river waters used for abstraction of drinking-water (by
reducing the disposal of effluent into rivers).
    Sewage sludge (or biosolids) are the organic solids derived from municipal sewage
and septic tank treatment processes (Chapter 10). In many countries, this material is
being disposed of to landfill or offshore, but these practices are increasingly being seen as
environmentally unacceptable, and an increasing proportion of this material is being used
as a source of nutrients and as a soil amendment in many agricultural areas.
    Municipal wastewater and sewage sludge contain considerable amounts of nitrogen
and phosphorus. In sewage sludge, nitrogen content ranges between less than 0.1 and 18
per cent (dry weight), and nitrogen concentrations in secondary effluents of wastewaters
range between 10 and 30 mg/l (US EPA, 1996). Used at appropriate application rates,
these are a valuable resource. However, in regions with a high population density which
produce large volumes of sewage wastes, excessive use on agricultural land can pollute
groundwater, particularly with nitrate. As with manures and fertilizers, whether or not
irrigation of wastewaters and land application of sludges leads to groundwater
contamination depends strongly on physical conditions in the drinking-water catchment
area, and on the criteria on which rates and timing of application are based (for more
detailed information see Section 9.1).
    The variety and concentrations of pathogens contained in sewage sludges and
wastewater derived from sewage and agriculture strongly depends on treatment and
storage practices, which impact on their die-off rates. Viruses in particular accumulate in
sewage sludge. For example, Cliver (1987) reported 2400-115 000 pfu/l in primary
sludge and 5000 pfu/l in secondary sludge. Poorly or untreated sludge and wastewater
can cause significant health effects. The most significant health risk from wastewater use
is the consumption of food directly irrigated with the effluent or the direct contact with
256                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

contaminated wastes (e.g. by field workers or by children playing in irrigation channels).
Consequently, the WHO has developed guidelines for the application of wastewater
intended for use in agriculture to protect human health (WHO, 2005).
    In groundwater, wastewater irrigation and spreading of sludges in agriculture – like
use of manures – can cause serious pathogen contamination, particularly in areas with
high vulnerability (e.g. high water table, thin soil cover over fractured rock or karstic
limestone) and features that allow rapid movement of pathogens in the subsurface
(Chapter 8 and Section 9.1). For example, Moore et al. (1981) has found virus particles
in groundwater up to 27 m below sites irrigated with sewage wastewater, and Jorgensen
and Lund (1985) found enteroviruses 3 m below a forest site used for sludge application.
However, Liu (1982) found that over a period of 4 years of heavy sludge application to
farmland, 92-98 per cent of the bacteria were inactivated by the soil.
    Use of sludges which are treated either by composting or by other disinfection
methods generally poses a lower risk of groundwater contamination due to greatly
reduced numbers of pathogens. Risks to groundwater will depend on both good
agricultural practices in use of sludge (e.g. maintaining a suitable buffer zone between
areas used for application and water supply wells – Chapter 21) and good sanitation
practices in sludge treatment.
    Chemical pollutants may be a further concern if wastewater or sewage sludge used in
agriculture originates from treatment plants receiving substantial amounts of industrial
effluent, or if specific household chemicals are widely used. However, these
contaminants generally accumulate in the soil profile (Chapter 4) and are strongly bound
by organic matter in the sludge. In most cases, the predominant health concerns are the
uptake of these chemicals in crops used for human consumption rather than their role as
groundwater pollutants. However, these contaminants are very persistent in soils and
may take many decades to degrade into harmless by-products. If excessive amounts of
wastes containing these chemicals are applied to soil, there is a risk that the normal
biological degradation processes in the soil could break down, and that leaching into
groundwater could take place. Therefore, detailed investigations of local soil properties
are required if contaminated sludges and wastewater are applied on a long term basis in a
particular area to ensure that groundwater contamination does not occur.

Wastewater use in aquaculture
Aquaculture is a possible reuse strategy. Fish raised in wastewater-fed ponds are an
important source of protein for many millions of people, particularly in countries in Asia
where the fertilization of fish ponds with human wastes has been practised for several
thousand years. Today, at least two-thirds of the world yield of farmed fish comes from
ponds fertilized in this way. China alone produces 60 per cent of the world’s farmed fish
in only 27 per cent of the world’s area of fish ponds. The largest wastewater-fed
aquaculture project in the world is the Kolkata wetland system. This consists of a 3000
ha area of constructed fish ponds which are fed with 550 000 m3 of untreated wastewater
each day. The wetlands produce about 13 000 tonnes of fish each year (mainly Carp and
Tilapia) which are supplied to fish markets in central Kolkata and are consumed more
widely in the region.
                Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                  257

   The use of wastewater and human excreta in aquaculture poses a great threat to
groundwater quality. This is because fish ponds are often unlined and in direct contact
with the water table, and there is no soil profile to allow the die-off of pathogens or the
removal of chemical constituents from the effluent. For this reason, there are significant
health risks (particularly from pathogens) from using groundwater from wells construc-
ted near fish ponds filled with untreated wastewater and fertilized with raw excrement.


9.5       USE OF PESTICIDES
Many pesticides and degradation products are toxic at low concentrations and have the
potential to cause health effects if groundwater used for water supply is polluted with
these chemicals.
    In general, the progression of pesticide development has moved from highly toxic,
persistent and bioaccumulating pesticides such as DDT, to pesticides that degrade rapidly
in the environment and are less toxic to non-target organisms. Many of the older
pesticides are now banned in many countries due to their health and environmental
effects (see Box 9.5).
    There are a large number of pesticides for control of insects (insecticides), weeds
(herbicides), fungus (fungicides), nematodes (nematicides) and mites (acaricides)
currently used in agriculture throughout the world. However, the largest usage tends to
be associated with a relatively small number of pesticides.
    Table 9.6 lists the world’s 35 major crops (on a harvested area basis according to
FAO, 2002 statistics) and assigns the known, major uses for pesticides for which WHO
has set drinking-water guideline values. In addition to the major uses listed in Table 9.6
there will also be many minor uses of each pesticide which are not stated in the literature
because the manufacturers consider this use to be insignificant. In general, similar suites
of pesticides are used on different crops in a related group. For example, many more
sorghum pesticides may be used on millet than is shown in the table and similar
pesticides are likely to be used on chickpeas as cow peas. Table 9.6 is also based on
approved or recommended uses for each pesticide. In countries where pesticide use is
less well regulated, farmers and growers might use a much greater range of pesticides on
each crop than is shown, particularly if the pesticides do not cause unacceptable damage
to the crop. Many insecticides in particular could be used on a much wider range of crops
than is shown, without damage to the crops (unlike herbicides). It is possible that most of
the insecticides shown could be used on most of the crops shown.
    Pesticides use creates a risk of a diffuse groundwater pollution. Whether or not
pesticides reach groundwater depends on the chemical and physical properties of the
active ingredient (see Chapter 4.6), on the local hydrogeological conditions and soil
characteristics, and on the manner in which these chemicals are applied to crops. Box 9.6
shows some examples of groundwater contamination by pesticides.
    Generally, the usage of pesticides should follow codes of good practice. Application
patterns and rates need to be based on the recommendations given by the producer or/and
the criteria developed by licensing authorities. The way that pesticides are applied
depends on the target pest and on the scale of the agricultural operation. Formulations to
kill nematodes, fungal infections or insects (systemic insecticides) are usually applied
258                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

directly to the soil as solid granules, solutions or sprays. Most other pesticides are applied
as foliar sprays, either from hand-held spraying equipment for small plots, or from
vehicles or aircraft for commercial scale agricultural operations.

                 Box 9.5. Stockholm Convention (based on UNDP, 2001)
      Organochlorine pesticides belong to a group of organic compounds known as
      persistent organic pollutants (POPs) which are considered to pose such a
      significant threat to human health and the environment that there is a major
      international effort to remove these chemicals from use. The Stockholm
      Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted in May 2001. Its
      objective is to protect human health and the environment from POPs.
      Convention parties will be required to take actions to reduce or eliminate POPs
      releases and ultimately eliminate the production of these chemicals. The
      convention identifies 12 initial POPs of global concern which include 9
      organochlorine pesticides. All substances are characterized by adverse effects
      on human health and environment, high persistence, and the potential for bio-
      accumulation and long-range environmental transport.
      Seven of the listed POPs are produced mainly for use as insecticides – Aldrin,
      Chlordane, Dieldrin, Endrin, Heptachlor, Mirex and Toxaphene. These have
      been mainly applied in agriculture. In many countries, all seven insecticides are
      already banned or are subject to severe restrictions. However, the Convention
      will lead to the use of these pesticides being phased out and banned. This will
      include the prohibition of their production and use, and bans on the import and
      export of these chemicals.
      Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is also an insecticide. It was
      extensively used against insect pests on a variety of agricultural crops (e.g.
      cotton). Another important use has been in combating vector born diseases such
      as malaria. While the Convention requires the phasing out of all agricultural
      DDT uses, production and use will be permitted for disease vector control under
      specific circumstances (e.g. areas where malaria is endemic).
      Hexachlorobenze (HCB) has mainly been used as a fungicide for seed
      treatment, or as solvent in other pesticide applications. Under the POPs
      Convention, the use of HCB will also be phased out.
      Despite international efforts to remove these chemicals from use, large amounts
      of organochlorine pesticides are stored throughout the world and continue to be
      traded on the black market. As it is likely that usage of these will continue in
      many countries until stockpiles are depleted, it is important that water suppliers
      continue to test for the presence of organochlorine pesticides in groundwater
      supplies in agricultural areas used as a source of drinking-water.

   Lack of knowledge or of training in the usage of pesticides may lead to over-
application of these chemicals in an inappropriate way (Figure 9.3). Improper usage of
pesticides such as the use of inappropriate spraying equipment, or practices like
preventative spraying instead of scheduling application to crop needs and avoiding
spraying prior to heavy rainfall, can significantly increase the pollution risk.

             Box 9.6. Examples of groundwater contamination by pesticides
    A nationwide study of more than 1000 shallow wells and springs in the USA
    found that one or more pesticides were detected in more than half of the samples
    collected (Kolpin et al., 1998). 95 per cent of the pesticide detections were at
    concentrations less than 1 µg/l. The most commonly detected pesticide was
    atrazine, reflecting both the widespread use of this chemical in agriculture, and
    its chemical stability and mobility in soil and groundwater. The frequency of
    pesticide detections was highest in agricultural areas where there was intensive
    use of these chemicals. Dieldrin was also commonly detected, despite its ban for
    agricultural use in the USA since the mid 1970s.
    Some 40 pesticides were detected in drinking-water supplies in the United
    Kingdom (England and Wales) each year between 1989 and 1996. Most
    frequently detected pesticides were the herbicides isoproturon, simazine,
    atrazine, chlorotoluron MCPP and diuron. The percentage failing the drinking-
    water standard of 0.1 µg/l fell from 2.8 in 1991 to 0.2 per cent in 1996 (DWI,
    1992, 1996, 1997).
    Brazil has become the third largest user of pesticides in the world, only
    exceeded by France and the USA (Andreoli 1993). Contamination of surface
    water and groundwater by pesticide residues is widespread, and 100 per cent of
    water samples from springs in the Pirapó sub-basin contained pesticide residues.
    A pesticide spill at a mixing site into a storm water soakwell in Western
    Australia contaminated a nearby irrigation well with concentrations of
    fenamiphos and atrazine exceeding 1000 and 2000 µg/l respectively
    (Appleyard, 1995). The concentration of fenamiphos was high enough to be
    toxic on prolonged skin contact, and would have caused severe health effects if
    the water had been used for drinking. Ten years after the spill, contamination is
    still present in toxic levels in groundwater at a distance of more than 300 m
    from the spill site. Investigations at other pesticide mixing sites in Western
    Australia (Appleyard et al., 1997) detected a range of pesticides in groundwater
    including atrazine, chlorphyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, fenamiphos, maldison,
    aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin and heptachlor. The most commonly detected
    pesticide in groundwater was diazinon, which was detected in 63 of the 78
    groundwater samples collected at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and
    4 µg/l.

   Pesticides have a wide range of physical and chemical properties. As discussed in
Chapter 4.6, the extent to which pesticides can be leached into groundwater through
normal agricultural use depends on a number of factors. These include the degree to
which pesticides are adsorbed onto organic matter in soils, the degree to which they are
volatilized from the soil, the rate at which they degrade within the soil environment, their
solubility in water, and the amount of water percolating through the soil profile available
to mobilize a specific pesticide (Figure 9.3). Table 4.2 in Chapter 4.6 summarizes the
extent to which the major groups of pesticides used in agriculture are retained or
degraded in soils.

Figure 9.3. Transport of pesticides to groundwater, degradation behaviour and possible pathways
that can cause human health problems

    Low level contamination of groundwater by pesticides (concentrations less than
1 µg/l) commonly occurs in agricultural areas where the water table is shallow, and
where soils are sandy and contain little or no organic matter. High concentrations of
pesticides in groundwater (greater than 5 µg/l) are much more likely to result from the
percolation of contaminated runoff into natural and man-made pathways through the soil
profile than through their normal agricultural use (DeMartinis and Cooper, 1994).
Natural preferred pathways due to vulnerable hydrogeology include karst features,
fissured or fractured bedrock exposed at the surface, fissured clays, and deep animal
burrows (Figure 9.3).
    The most common man-made causes of severe groundwater pollution by pesticides is
the infiltration of contaminated runoff directly into poorly constructed or abandoned
water-supply wells, soak wells and other man-made conduits. This takes place either
through the open casing, if the well is not properly capped, or through the annular space
around the casing if the well has not been properly constructed. In particular, practices
such as mixing of pesticides and cleaning of pesticide spraying equipment on bare soil,
or the disposal of pesticide residues and empty drums near to man-made or natural
features that allow rapid infiltration of contaminated runoff, pose a significant risk to
groundwater. Drainage wells used to drain excess water in some irrigation areas are
another common point of entry of pesticides into groundwater (DeMartinis and Cooper,
1994). Important point sources of pesticide pollution in groundwater are dip sites used to
                Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                     263

treat sheep and other livestock for ectoparasites (Hadfield and Smith, 1997), and spills or
poor handling practice at sites used to mix or store pesticides before use. Moreover, there
are large stockpiles of persistent pesticides in many countries, and if storage facilities are
poorly designed or constructed (e.g. not sealed, covered or lockable) they may leak and
cause pollution of waters. In this context, abandoned stockpiles (for example as a result
of storage of older batches of pesticides or of civil war) are of particular concern as those
normally are not subject to any means of control. Generally, all point sources can
produce extremely high concentrations of pesticides that may persist in groundwater for
long periods with little or no degradation.
    Generally, there is much less information on the extent and severity of groundwater
contamination by pesticides in developing countries. Pesticide usage in low-income
countries is extremely variable, varying from almost no usage in large parts of Africa and
Asia that rely on traditional and subsistence agriculture, to very high application rates in
plantations in Central and South America.


9.6        IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
Irrigation is widely used in agriculture as a means of making otherwise unproductive
land suitable for agriculture, or for substantially increasing agricultural productivity.
However, this activity can affect groundwater quality by altering the water and salt
balance in soil profiles, which in turn can change the physical and chemical
characteristics of the soil. The large volumes of water used in irrigation – typically
between 5000 and 15 000 cubic m per year per ha (Romijn, 1986) – allows solutes in
irrigated soil profiles to be readily leached and affect groundwater quality.
    Water can be applied to crops or pasture by surface irrigation (often by land flooding),
by sub-surface irrigation, or by overhead irrigation through sprinklers, drip or trickle
systems. Growing plants selectively uptake nutrients and some solutes, such as calcium
and magnesium ions, from the irrigation water and water in the soil leaving residual soil
water that is progressively enriched in some ions, particularly sodium. The solute content
in the residual soil water cannot be allowed to increase too high, or else the changes in
osmotic pressure across plant roots will inhibit the ability of plants to take up moisture
and nutrients, so salts are generally allowed to leach to groundwater by applying excess
irrigation water. However, even minor increases in the salinity of groundwater can affect
the viability of growing some highly salt-sensitive crops like some vegetable species.
    The problems can be compounded if irrigation water contains a high proportion of
sodium ions. Sodium ion concentrations in residual water in these soils can accumulate
to the point that ion-exchange sites on clays in the soil become saturated with sodium,
changing the physical properties of the soil. Soils with excess sodium often become
structureless and impermeable to water and air, and may not support plant growth.
Sodicity problems in soils can also develop if the irrigation water contains high
concentrations of bicarbonate or carbonate ions which causes calcium and magnesium
carbonates to precipitate within the soil profile. Under these circumstances, residual soil
water again becomes preferentially enriched in sodium ions.
    As well as creating salinity and sodicity problems, irrigation can introduce a number
of contaminants into groundwater that can affect human health. The large amount of
264                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

water used in irrigation makes the risk of nitrate and pesticide leaching greater in
irrigated than non-irrigated areas. In areas where soils contain significant concentrations
of selenium, like parts of the USA and the Indian subcontinent, the infiltration of
irrigation water can leach selenium and locally contaminate groundwater with this
element. Water in soils beneath irrigation areas is often alkaline, and can leach significant
amounts of fluoride that naturally occurs in soils at high concentrations in many areas,
and is also introduced into soils as a contaminant in phosphatic fertilizers (Kolaja et al.,
1986).
    Water is often drained from land to maintain or increase the agricultural productivity,
but this activity can also have adverse impacts on groundwater quality. The major
impacts include increasing groundwater salinity and nitrate concentrations and, in some
areas, increasing sulphate, iron and heavy metal concentrations due to the acidification of
soils caused by drainage.
    Drainage systems often consist of a series of ditches or drainage pipes in or around
individual fields to control the position of the water table, connected to collector and
main drains designed to move the drained water to a convenient discharge area. In
irrigation areas, water collected in drains can have a salinity up to ten times that of the
applied irrigation water (Romijn, 1986), and in semi arid or arid areas, the salinity can be
further increased by evaporation as water is moved in open channels away from the
irrigated fields. Leakage of water from drainage channels can contaminate groundwater
at some distance from irrigated areas with salt and nitrate and, in some areas, with other
contaminants like selenium and fluoride.
    Reclamation of waterlogged peaty soils by drainage causes land subsidence, firstly
due to the shrinkage and compaction of the peat, and then due to the oxidation of the
organic matter. It is estimated that drainage of peaty soils over the last 900 years in the
Netherlands has caused land subsidence of about 2 m, of which 85 per cent is due to the
oxidation of the peat (Romijn, 1986). The oxidation releases substantial amounts of
nitrogen bound up in organic form in the peat, and nitrate concentrations in groundwater
near drained peat areas often greatly exceed drinking-water guidelines. Drained peat soils
are often grazed by a high density of livestock which can further increase nitrate
concentrations in groundwater. The rate of oxidation of organic matter in peat is much
greater in subtropical or tropical climates than in temperate areas, and the peat loss
caused by oxidation can exceed 5 cm per year in some areas (Romijn, 1986).
    The drainage of soils containing pyrite and other sulphide minerals can further cause
severe environmental and health problems due to the release of sulphuric acid and toxic
levels of metals caused by the oxidation of sulphides. These so called ASS were first
recognized in the Netherlands more than 250 years ago, and although localized problems
occur in parts of Europe, these soils are particularly widespread in some coastal parts of
Asia, Australia, Africa and Latin America, and worldwide cover an area of more than
one million square kilometres (ARMCANZ, 2000). It has been estimated conservatively
that Australia alone has over 40 000 km2 of acid sulphate soils, containing in excess of
one billion tonnes of pyrite. If these soils were fully drained and developed for
agriculture, the total amount of sulphuric acid released would be about 1.6 billion tonnes.
    Groundwater beneath ASS areas can become contaminated with high concentrations
of arsenic and heavy metals. The health status of farming communities living in ASS
               Agriculture: Potential hazards and information needs                265

areas in Asia is often poor as they rely on metal rich acidic water for water supply
(ARMCANZ, 2000). There is also evidence that certain species of disease-carrying
mosquito actively seek acid drainage for breeding, compounding health effects in these
areas.

Human excreta and sanitation:
Potential hazards and information
needs

In 2002 some 2.6 billion people (almost half of the world’s population) did not have
access to basic sanitation, based on the definitions given in Table 10.1 below (WHO and
UNICEF, 2004). The population lacking sanitation is more than twice as many people as
those lacking access to an ‘improved’ water supply. Increases in sanitation coverage have
been achieved during the last decade, but they have essentially done little more than kept
pace with population increase. It is in the rural areas of developing countries that access
to sanitation remains most limited, in particular African and South Asian countries have
very low rates of rural sanitation access. Current estimates suggest that access to
improved sanitation has not increased above approximately half of the population of
developing countries (WHO and UNICEF, 2004).
    The lack of adequate sanitation is a key contributing factor to the ongoing high rates
of diarrhoeal disease noted in developing countries. Improvement in sanitation has been
consistently identified as being an important intervention to improve health (Esrey et al.,
1991; Esrey, 1996).

    Improvements in sanitation continue to lag behind the needs of the population and the
provision of water services for a number of reasons. The water and sanitation sector has
traditionally focused more on the provision of water services than sanitation facilities.
This is partly due to the differing domains in which such facilities operate and the greater
attractiveness of community as opposed to household interventions. As the provision of
sanitation primarily functions at a household level, it has attracted less support from
governments and donors more interested in community interventions, despite the gains
delivered to the broader community by sanitation improvements. The demand for
sanitation by households and communities has also sometimes been limited when there
are other competing demands for environmental improvements (Briscoe, 1996).
    There are numerous low-cost technologies that may be used to improve access,
mainly using simple on-site disposal methods. The potential for such sanitation facilities
for contaminating groundwater used for drinking supply is well recognized (Lewis et al.,
1982; ARGOSS, 2001), and it is strongly related to the hydrogeological and
demographic characteristics of the settings in which they are applied. There is often a
need to balance these risks and to accept some degradation in water quality where the
health gains from improved sanitation outweigh potential risks of contamination from
sanitation. This is most obvious in relation to chemical contamination, but also applies to
microbial quality. For example, where potential contamination of shallow groundwater
from on-site facilities is not a health threat because other water sources are used for
drinking or because the filtration efficiency of the soil is likely to reduce pathogens,
health gains from excreta disposal will outweigh potential risks from groundwater
contamination through sanitation. However, such degradation should be prevented as far
as feasible in order to avoid compromising future as well as present use of such
groundwaters.
    Contamination of groundwater by sanitation systems also occurs in settings where
centralized sewerage systems are widely in place, as is common in most industrialized
countries. They are often poorly maintained and leaks contaminate groundwater with
pathogens and a diverse array of household and industrial chemicals. If sewage is treated
in treatment plants and discharged into surface waters, in a number of settings persistent
substances then reach groundwater, particularly where artificial recharge or bank
filtration are practised. Further, in high income countries, groundwater contamination
from decentralized on-site sanitation systems is also common, and may be due to
inadequate design and maintenance. These typically occur in proximity to private wells
and may become a hazard to such decentralized drinking-water supplies.
       Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 277


   NOTE X           Sanitation practices and the environment in which they take place
                    vary greatly. Health hazards arising from sanitation practices and
                    their potential to pollute groundwater needs to be analysed
                    specifically for the conditions in a given setting. This chapter
                    supports hazard analysis in the context of developing a WSP for a
                    given water supply (Chapter 16).Options for controlling these risks
                    are introduced in Chapter 22.




10.1      CONTAMINANTS OF CONCERN FROM
          SANITATION SYSTEMS
10.1.1 Pathogens
Table 3.1 in Chapter 3 provides an overview of those viruses, bacteria, and in some
settings protozoa, which are of concern in groundwater affected by human excreta.
When assessing the risk of pathogen occurrence in groundwater, it is important to bear in
mind that pathogens may be transmitted via a number of routes other than ingestion from
water, including direct contact with excreta, food, flies or from aerosols emanating from
excreted wastes. In developed countries, because of their infectivity, small size,
persistence and low adsorption to solid surfaces, viruses can be regarded as the most
critical microorganisms with respect to groundwater contamination and the related health
risks. In developing countries, viral exposures may be much greater through other routes,
notably related to poor hygiene and sanitation and the residual risk presented by viruses
in groundwater is very low in comparison. Bacterial contamination of groundwater in
these situations remains common and prevention of this may take precedence.
    The presence of pathogens derived from human faeces in groundwater requires that
faecal material leaching into the sub-surface contains pathogens excreted by infected
individuals. Predicting whether pathogens may be in the population is difficult as the
outward health of an individual cannot be taken as determinant of their status as pathogen
reservoirs. An asymptomatic individual may harbour pathogenic organisms and serve as
a carrier of disease. Therefore, because the majority of pathogens that affect human
health are derived from human faeces, sanitation facilities should be sited, designed,
operated and maintained on the assumption that excreta will contain pathogens.
    Table 10.2 below provides data on the microbial content of untreated sewage entering
into two sewage treatment works in the Netherlands and waste stabilization ponds in
Brazil. The figures all refer to organisms per litre and the figures for bacterial content
from Brazil have been adjusted from those reported in relation to numbers per 100 ml.

10.1.2 Chemical contaminants
Where dry on-site latrines are used and no other wastes are disposed into the on-site
system, contaminants are expected to be derived wholly from excreta. The major risk
will therefore be from nitrate contamination. Nitrate is formed by the sequential,
microbially-catalysed oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate (Cantor, 1997).
Most nitrogen is excreted as urea, which readily degrades to ammonium. The person
specific nitrogen load daily excreted amounts to 11-12 g (Hamm, 1991). With respect to
manure, storage times and conditions will affect ammonium losses due to volatilization
(Chapter 9). Most relevant for groundwater, microbial oxidation may convert
ammonium to nitrate, which is conserved in oxidizing subsurface environments. As
nitrate is highly soluble in water and very mobile it readily poses a risk to groundwater
(Chapter 4). However, it should be noted that in reducing conditions nitrogen remains in
a reduced form (ammonia and nitrite) and this has been noted in groundwater underlying
several cities dependent on groundwater (Lawrence et al., 1997).
    Wet sanitation systems, especially those which serve household waste water as well
as excreta, likely contain a more complex mix of chemicals including those derived from
household use such as laundry detergents. Sewage that has centralized management, and
serves both residential and industrial users, is likely to contain a complex mixture of
organic and inorganic chemicals mainly used in manufacturing and processing. Industrial
contaminants will depend on the types of industry in the catchment of the sewerage
system, and their mixture in sewage is typically very variable and complex (see e.g.
Burston et al., 1993; Bishop et al., 1998). If released to the subsurface, their persistence
and mobility determines the potential to contaminate groundwater (Chapter 4).
    The concentrations of dissolved constituents in sewage depend both on the household
consumption of water and the relative proportion of industrial effluent in relation to
domestic sewage in municipal sewers. The average composition of organic and inorganic
substances found in domestic sewage is shown below in Table 10.3.
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 279

   Sewage composition shows diurnal patterns as domestic water use changes. It may
also change over larger time intervals due to changes in industrial effluent inputs, as can
be seen in the example of the raw sewage composition in Nottingham in Table 10.4.

280                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    This example is typical of bulk sewage from a medium-sized, moderately industrial
city and highlights the diversity and variability of substances that can potentially impair
groundwater quality, where such sewage leaks into groundwater. The greatest risk posed
to groundwater under such settings is often from leaking sewers (see Section 10.2.3).
    The prevalence of pharmaceutical chemicals and personal care products (PCPs) is
increasingly observed in water supplies (Doughton and Ternes, 1999). Sources of PCPs
and pharmaceuticals can be from manufacturers, medical facilities or personal use.
Pharmaceuticals may be excreted by patients and can reach the aquatic environment via
waste water and potentially enter groundwater (see also Chapter 4.7.1).


10.2      TYPES OF SANITATION AND THEIR POTENTIAL
          TO CONTAMINATE GROUNDWATER
This section provides an overview of widely practised methods of excreta disposal.
There are numerous excreta disposal methods, which range from low-cost options
suitable for low-income communities to expensive methods involving several stages of
collection and treatment. In general terms, excreta disposal methods fall into two broad
categories – on-site and off-site systems. On-site systems are point sources and therefore
will be expected to exert the greatest impact on the groundwater in their vicinity,
although where there are large numbers of on-site systems the overall impact may be
widespread. There are a number of references that provide detailed descriptions of
design, engineering, construction, use, and maintenance of various on-site sanitation
systems (Metcalf and Eddy, 1991; Franceys et al., 1992; Mara, 1996). Off-site systems
represent more diffuse pollution and risks to groundwater may be found along the sewer
lines, at the treatment works and from the final effluent discharged to the environment.
The discussion in this section provides a summary of the available knowledge of the
potential of these technologies to contaminate groundwater and the type of information
needed to assess this potential.

10.2.1 Open air defecation
WHO and UNICEF (2004) estimated that in 2002 more than one-third of the global
population (ca. 40 per cent) still lack access to basic sanitation facilities. The unserved
population primarily resides in lower-income countries in Africa and South Asia and
within rural areas. The lack of adequate sanitation for half of the Earth’s population
indicates that open-air defecation is practised by millions of people. Open-air defecation
is generally found in developing countries, particularly in low-income rural and peri-
urban communities (Pedley and Howard, 1997).
   The risks of groundwater contamination from open-air defecation are variable and
largely depend on local conditions, including groundwater use for drinking-water supply.
Pathogenic microorganisms in faeces may contaminate groundwater or spring
abstraction points by leaching through soils into shallow groundwater or springs, flowing
into outcropping or shallow rock fractures, seeping into pits or low areas (recharge
zones) or runoff to surface water, with secondary transport to connected aquifers. Several
studies in developing countries have shown that open-air defecation in urban areas may
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 281

actually be the primary source of faecal matter washed into poorly maintained water
sources (Gelinas et al., 1996; ARGOSS, 2002). In rural areas of developing countries,
the concentrations of microbial contamination is often seen to be highest at the onset of
the rains and then declines during the remaining wet season and into the dry season. The
build-up of faecal matter that is readily washed into groundwater sources may provide a
plausible explanation of this phenomenon. Risks of chemical contamination from open-
air defecation are generally lower (Gelinas et al., 1996). Open-air defecation is also
associated with the transmission of helminths such as hookworm, although this occurs
via contact with contaminated soils rather than groundwater (Cairncross and Feacham,
1993).
    Even where the risk is reduced by decreasing the potential for defecation near wells or
springs, open-air defecation always represents a major risk to public health and the use of
safe alternatives should be encouraged. The provision of improved sanitation would
always be preferred, although in some cases, burial of faecal material several centimetres
below the ground surface may be promoted as an interim measure. The risk to
groundwater from such burial is likely to be limited in low-density settlements, but
would potentially represent a more significant risk in urban areas.

10.2.2 On-site sanitation
    The general principles of design and operation of on-site sanitation systems are
discussed by Franceys et al. (1992) and the risk posed to groundwater has been the
subject of several major reviews and research (Lewis et al., 1982; van Ryneveld and
Fourie, 1997; ARGOSS, 2002; see Box 10.1 below).
    On-site systems are generally those in which excreta and anal cleansing materials are
deposited directly into some sort of container, most commonly a subsurface excavation
or tank.
    Common to all forms of on-site sanitation is that part of the decomposition process is
performed on-site. In some cases, the sludge will be fully decomposed within the pit,
whilst in some others periodic desludging and treatment of the waste is required. The risk
of such a contamination from the collection of waste at a single point depends largely on
the design of the facility, but has been noted as being significant (Lewis et al., 1982; van
Ryneveld and Fourie, 1997; ARGOSS, 2002). On-site wet systems also typically require
some form of soakaway to dispose of excess effluent and this may increase risks from
both pathogens and nitrate (ARGOSS, 2001).
    On-site systems may be low-cost options such as various forms of pit latrine, or high-
cost options such as septic tanks that provide a similar level of service to sewerage. They
may be ‘wet’ systems, where water is used to flush the waste into a tank or pit, or dry
systems using little or no water. Wet systems may require very limited water (for
instance a pour-flush latrine) or require large volumes of water consistent with water
piped inside the house with multiple faucets and which can receive all wastewater
produced by the household.
    Contained systems, such as vault latrines, cess pits and composting latrines are an
intermediate stage between on- and off-site options, with varying amounts of
282                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

decomposition occurring on-site, but final treatment and disposal of the excreta occurring
elsewhere. Collection is in batches rather than continuous.

        Box 10.1. Case Study: Urbanization’s Impacts in Santa Cruz, Bolivia
                              (based on BGS, 1995)
      Santa Cruz is located on the eastern plains of Bolivia about 25 km from the
      easternmost edge of the Andean Cordillera. Population growth in Santa Cruz is
      about 4 per cent per year, one of the greatest growth rates in the Americas.
      Though the city is largely urban, industrial and commercial development are
      experiencing rapid growth. The city is laid out in a radial pattern along the banks
      of the River Pirai. A surface ridge bisects Santa Cruz, effectively forming a
      surface water drainage divide.
      Groundwater provides all of the potable water supply in Santa Cruz. The aquifer
      comprises variable alluvial beds of sand, clay, sandy clay lenses and gravels.
      The alluvium in the southern part of Santa Cruz is dominated by medium to
      coarse grained gravels and sands. In the east, northeast and northern parts of the
      city, beds tend to be thicker and contain an increased proportion of clays.
      Groundwater flow has been described as southwest to northeast. Groundwater
      levels vary from essentially at the ground surface to 15 m below ground surface
      beneath the water divide ridge bisecting the city.
      The population density in Santa Cruz is relatively low, at only about 45
      persons/ha on average, and less than 30 persons per ha in outer areas. The inner
      city has densities in excess of 120 persons per ha, and the south eastern portion
      of the city has the greatest density of more than 150 persons per ha. Growth
      projections are strongest in the south eastern portions of the city.
      Water supplies in developed areas are provided by a diverse consortium of
      municipal, collaborative and private entities. In less developed areas, progress is
      being made to consolidate water supply into the formal system. However, on the
      southeast edge of the city, water supply varies in sophistication from dug wells
      to shallow hand pump fitted wells to deeper boreholes supplying local networks.
      The rapid development in Santa Cruz and the vulnerability of the aquifer which
      supplies drinking-water is cause for concern. The BGS conducted a study to
      measure the effects of urbanization on the aquifer.
      The results showed that urbanization is resulting in negative impacts to Santa
      Cruz’s groundwater. Much of the water that is used in the city is expected to be
      returned to groundwater as recharge from on-site sanitation – used over about
      85 per cent of the city’s area, and leaking sewers. While for the most part not a
      current health concern, concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms, nitrate,
      chloride and manganese are increasing in shallow groundwater and are
      beginning to leach into deeper groundwater. In fact, most of the shallow dug
      wells contained high counts of thermotolerant coliforms. Conditions are worse
      in areas of high urbanization, with nitrate and manganese currently exceeding
      WHO guideline values for drinking-water quality in shallow wells.
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 283

    In on-site systems, the solid part of the waste undergoes anaerobic decomposition
within the pit and the contaminants in the effluent are removed through attenuation, die-
off, predation and dilution as it travels through the underlying soil, or from soakaways
and drain fields. Natural attenuation processes tend to act most effectively in the upper
soil level and because so many on-site sanitation systems bypass this layer, this may
increase risks of groundwater contamination. This may be a particular problem with
designs that allow for direct infiltration of effluent through the sides and base of the pit,
particularly where hydraulic loads are high. However research suggests that within a
relatively short period of time a biologically active layer forms around the active layers
of the pit (i.e. those receiving faecal material) and forms a mat of gelatinous material of
bacteria and fungi. Previous research suggests that within three months this layer inhibits
movement of faecal bacteria and within seven months the presence of bacteria is largely
restricted to the latrine (Caldwell and Parr, 1937). Other studies point to the limited
penetration of bacteria to within a travel time equivalent to five to seven days and lateral
breakthrough generally limited to within five meters (Subrahmanyan and Bharaskan,
1980; Chidavaenzi et al., 2000).
    The biologically active layer appears to work in two key ways. Firstly, the presence of
predatory microorganisms within the biologically active layer allows for permanent
removal of some pathogens. Secondly the nature of the mat reduces the porosity of the
soil matrix – essentially clogging the soil pores – thereby allowing an increased period
for attenuation. In a properly sited, designed and operated system, the mat can also
provide a protective barrier between waste and groundwater by effectively maintaining
an unsaturated zone between the clogged pores and groundwater. This would appear to
work in dry systems but is unlikely to be as effective when wet systems are used as the
hydraulic load may be sufficient to overload the natural removal of microorganisms and
may extend the saturated zone between the pit and the water table (ARGOSS, 2001).
    It has been noted that the formation of a biologically active layer varies with
subsurface nature. Some formations allow much greater breakthrough (presumably be-
cause the nature of the pores does not allow such ready formation of biologically active
layers). Viruses in particular are not so readily retarded. Fissures in the sub-surface, hy-
draulic overloading of the system or a high groundwater table can result in system failure
and contamination of groundwater or breakthrough. For instance, a study by Pyle et al.
(1979) showed that bacteria could travel as far as 920 m where flow rates were high.
    The biologically active layer appears to have a far more limited impact on chemical
pollution, particularly nitrate. In most shallow groundwaters nitrate concentrations are
likely to increase with the use of on-site sanitation. In some groundwater environments,
this risk is mitigated because of reducing conditions that promote reduction of nitrate to
ammonia. This may lead to very limited nitrate concentrations in groundwater despite a
high density of pit latrines (ARGOSS, 2002). Oxidation reactions in shallow ground-
water where organic loading is high (as would be typically found under urban areas) may
enhance denitrification by using nitrate as further oxidizing agent after oxygen has been
consumed (Lawrence et al., 1997). However, in lower density urban settlements and in
rural areas, oxidizing conditions are more likely to be found, and denitrification does not
take place, allowing nitrate from on-site sanitation to accumulate. This potentially affects
long-term availability of groundwater as a source of drinking-water (ARGOSS, 2002).

      Box 10.2. Nitrate contamination of groundwater in areas with pit latrines in
                               Francistown, Botswana
  A study carried out on nitrate contamination of groundwater in populated areas of
  Botswana in 1976 found elevated concentrations of up to 80 mg/l in wells in
  several major villages (Hutton et al., 1976). The phenomenon was related to the
  occurrence of pit latrines and septic tanks used for sanitation. In 2000 the
  Geological Survey of Botswana in co-operation with the Federal Institute of
  Geosciences and Natural Resources, Germany, carried out a study on groundwater
  contamination in the city of Francistown.
  Francistown is located in the semi-arid region of eastern Botswana at the
  confluence of the seasonal Tati and Ntshe rivers. Rainfall averages around
  500 mm/a. Born during the late 19th century as a gold mining town, the city’s
  rapid economic development particularly since the 1970s has turned Francistown
  into the second largest city in Botswana with a population of approximately 80 000
  inhabitants.
  The water demand of the town used to be met entirely by groundwater resources
  locally available from shallow alluvial and fractured volcanic rock aquifers. The
  overlying soils are rarely thicker than 0.5 m. In the 1970s it was found that
  groundwater produced from the city’s public wells contained elevated
  concentrations of nitrate. In addition the growing water demand could no longer be
  met by the groundwater resources. For these reasons public water supply was
  shifted to surface water from the new Shashe dam in 1982, which was originally
  constructed for mining purposes 30 km from Francistown.
  The rapid population growth led to an extensive development of pit latrines, which
  also serve for domestic wastewater disposal. A centralized sewerage system
  covering approximately 50 per cent of the city area started to operate some years
  ago, now discharging to a wastewater treatment plant. Recently the sewerage
  system was extended to the remaining city area. However, connection to the
  sewerage system is voluntary, and the use of pit latrines and – to a lesser extent –
  septic tanks is currently still the main means of wastewater discharge in the newly
  connected areas.
  The recent groundwater quality survey sampled 47 public and private wells within
  and around Francistown. Analyses showed that nitrate concentrations well above
  the maximum allowable limit for drinking-water in Botswana of 45 mg/l were
  frequent within the city area, often reaching values between 100 and 300 mg/l
  (Figure 10.1). Some of these wells had already been sampled in the mid 1970s, and
  comparison with the old extremes of 80 mg/l shows that nitrate levels had
  significantly increased. Groundwater sampled in the recent survey from wells
  situated in remote areas outside the city contained considerably less nitrate, in most
  cases below 40 mg/l, which indicates that the cause of nitrate contamination is
  likely to be anthropogenic.
  To gain knowledge on the possible causes of contamination, potential point and
  non-point hazards to groundwater pollution such as areas with pit latrines, intensive
  farming, mining activity, cemeteries, abattoirs etc. were mapped. In addition flow
  directions of groundwater were inferred from the construction of a groundwater
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 285

   contour map. Combining the results of the nitrate analyses with this information
   showed that nitrate concentrations in fact maximize in areas with pit latrines. Also,
   not a single borehole lying in or close to such areas was found to have a nitrate
   concentration below 100 mg/l. This relation between the location of areas with pit
   latrines and the occurrence of nitrate contamination can be seen in Figure 10.1,
   which shows a part of the project area in the south eastern part of Francistown.
   However, nitrate concentrations seem to quickly decrease with distance from a
   contamination source, whether this occurs by denitrification or dilution. The July
   2000 nitrate contamination of groundwater might have been aggravated by
   extraordinarily high rainfall in the range of 2000 mm in February and March 2000.
   The findings support the conception that the use of pit latrines can cause serious
   nitrate contamination in groundwater. Nitrate contamination is promoted when
   households are connected to water supply but not to sewerage, as this causes an
   increase of percolation of waste water from the pit latrines to the groundwater. An
   improvement is likely when all households of Francistown are connected to the
   centralized sewerage system.

   Botswana, in July 2000

Pit and trench latrines
Pit and trench latrines are widely used for direct disposal of excreta due to the simplicity
of design, ease of construction and low cost. Examples of pit latrine designs include
simple pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pour-flush latrines, raised pit latrines,
and composting latrines (Franceys et al., 1992). Aqua privies are discussed in
conjunction with septic systems below.
    Some pit latrine designs incorporate a twin-pit design, which provides several benefits
(Pickford, 1995). Additional time is afforded for decomposition of the waste in the pit
not being used, rendering a well-composted, odourless product which is relatively easy to
handle when the pit is emptied. Where two pits are used, they are often dug to shallower
286                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

depths, thereby increasing the depth of the unsaturated soil zone and providing more time
for attenuation and, consequently, enhanced protection of groundwater. However, the use
of twin pits requires effective user operation and this cannot always be assured, leading
to overloading and risks incurred during emptying.
    The risks from pit latrines are primarily derived from the increased risk of
accumulation of faecal material in one place that may allow subsurface leaching of
contaminants. The Francistown case study given in Box 10.2 highlights the potential for
nitrate contamination from pit latrines and shows how situation assessment can
document this by mapping.
    As noted above, the presence of biologically active layers reduces the risk of
subsurface leaching caused by the accumulation of faecal material. It has been suggested
that ensuring that there are two meters of sandy or loamy soil below the base of the pit
will reduce the risk of microbial contamination of groundwater (Franceys et al., 1992).
The depth of the soil in the pit or trench in relation to the seasonal high groundwater table
will indicate the seasonal risk of contamination.
    Pits constructed into the water table are almost always a substantial cause for concern.
In general, if pit or trench latrines are constructed so that they are safe from flooding and
sufficient depth between the base of the pit and the groundwater is maintained, risks of
microbial pollution are reduced.

Septic tanks and aqua privies
Septic systems provide a similar level of service as sewers as they can be linked to water
closets located within a house. In unsewered cities, such as many in North America,
septic tanks are the main method of sewage disposal (Lerner, 1996). While some large,
community-scale septic systems are in use, most accommodate waste loads from a single
dwelling to a few dwellings. Aqua privies are essentially limited to single or a few
dwellings. The amount of space necessary for a septic system’s drainage field, described
below, can limit the number of individuals or dwellings served by septic systems.
    Septic tanks and aqua privies operate by initial deposition of excreta into an
impermeable tank with overflow of excess liquid into a soakaway or drain field. In some
cities, such as Hanoi in Vietnam, the effluent enters the surface water drainage system. In
both technologies, the sludge is retained under water and this must be maintained to
reduce offensive odours. Septic tanks are usually located at a distance from the toilet and
water is used to flush excreta into the tank. Typically water volumes required are similar
to those used in sewerage and most household wastewater may be discharged into the
septic tank. The tank in an aqua privy is located just below or adjacent to the toilet. Water
requirements are often lower than for septic tank systems, but the tank requires periodic
addition of water to ensure a water seal is maintained.
    Inside the tank of septic systems and aqua privies, solids settle out and are deposited
on the tank bottom; a scum forms a crust on the surface. As the tank fills with liquid, the
overflow is channelled out of the tank. A variety of options are available for the liquid
once it leaves the tank. Many systems connect to a lateral permeable pipe or series of
parallel permeable pipes. A method which allows for both filtering and treatment by soil
microorganisms is to disperse the liquid into a shallow soil drainage field by means of a
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 287

shallow buried permeable pipe or parallel series of pipes. Other options include piping
the overflow to a soakaway, to a sand filtration unit or pit, or to a central sewer.
    Microorganisms inhabiting the tank and drainage field of a properly operated, well
maintained septic system can degrade carbonaceous, nitrogenous, and microbial waste
constituents. Carbonaceous constituents may be completely degraded, however, organic
nitrogen and ammonia are likely to be oxidized to nitrate before leachate reaches the
groundwater in oxidizing environments. Nitrate contamination is common in areas
where septic system density is moderate to high. Where the environment is reducing (i.e.
anaerobic), microbial action may transform nitrogen to nitrogen gas.
    Pathogen destruction via predation, attenuation and thermophilic or natural die off
occurs in the tank and drainage field, but may be incomplete especially for viruses. This
may result from high flow rates reducing the period of contact for predation and
attenuation and promoting breakthrough, and from low clay content which reduces the
potential for adsorption (Scandura and Sobsey, 1997). Both aerobic and anaerobic
systems may preferentially destroy bacterial pathogens incompatible with the associated
environments, although this will have limited impact on facultative microbes such as E.
coli, which survive in both aerobic and anaerobic environments.
    Disease outbreaks associated with inadequately sited, inadequately maintained,
overloaded and malfunctioning septic tanks have been documented (Craun, 1984; 1985)
and an example is provided in Box 10.3. When assessing the risk from septic tanks and
aqua privies, it is important to bear in mind that there are two distinct components that
must be managed. The tanks containing the sludge must be impermeable and properly
maintained. They therefore require periodic inspection, which is most easily performed
immediately after emptying. Furthermore, the disposal of the sludge is important and the
benefits of good design and operation of a septic tank or aqua privy will be undermined if
subsequent disposal of the waste is poorly managed.
    In addition, is it important that the drain fields or soakaway are properly located and
designed, taking into account infiltration rates of the soil, depth to groundwater,
groundwater velocity and direction and distance to the nearest groundwater source used
for supply of drinking-water. Septic tank use is viable in areas where soils contain
relatively high concentrations of organic matter and infiltration rates are 10-50 l/m2 per
day, although this is dependent on the distance to the nearest groundwater source and
depth to water table (Franceys et al., 1992). It is important to bear in mind that the drain
field will eventually become clogged and a new site developed (Mara, 1996). There
should always be a minimum distance to the water table beneath the base of trenches or
seepage pits, for instance the US Public Health Service (1965) recommends a minimum
of four feet (i.e. 1.2 m).
288                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

         Box 10.3. A severe outbreak of waterborne disease – an on-site treatment
            system suspected of contaminating a well (based on CDC, 1999)
      The investigation by the New York State Department of Health into the 1999
      outbreak associated with attendance at the Washington County Fair indicated
      that the outbreak may have resulted from contamination of the Fair's Well 6 by
      a dormitory septic system on the fairgrounds.
      A total of 781 people were affected with either confirmed or suspected cases in
      the outbreak. Of these, 127 cases of E. coli infection and 45 cases
      Campylobacter jejuni were confirmed, with 2 deaths and 71 people
      hospitalized, of which 14 developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome, a severe
      complication of E. coli O157:H7 infection that can lead to kidney failure.
      A case-control study concluded that consumption of beverages sold by vendors
      supplied with water from Well 6 was a key risk factor for patients with culture-
      confirmed illness. E. coli O157:H7 was found in samples from Well 6, which
      supplied unchlorinated water to some vendors, and water distribution pipes
      leading from Well 6. E. coli O157:H7 was found in the septic system of the
      dormitory building. The discharge area (seepage pit) of that septic system was
      approximately 36 feet from Well 6 and tests showed a hydraulic connection, at
      the time of the tests, from the septic system to Well 6. The source of the E. coli
      O157:H7 in the dormitory septic system is unknown and tests did not identify
      Campylobacter in samples from the dormitory septic system or Well 6.
      Tests did not demonstrate a connection from the manure storage area near the
      Youth Cattle Barn or the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in samples taken from
      that area. However, because exact environmental conditions (including drought
      followed by rain) present at the time of the Fair could not be replicated and
      because manure was removed daily, it may never be known if manure-
      contaminated water percolated from the manure storage area to Well 6.

Contained systems
Contained systems, also referred to as ‘cartage systems’, are impermeable vessels used to
collect excreted wastes. Bucket latrines are contained systems in their simplest form.
Excreta in a bucket latrine, commonly referred to as night soil, must be emptied
routinely. Bucket latrines represent a major health risk, particularly to the collectors and
their use should not be promoted. WHO has developed guidelines for the safe use of
excreta in agriculture (WHO, 2005).
    The risk of groundwater contamination from bucket latrines may be limited and will
certainly be far less than occupational hazards of collectors and transmission of
pathogens via flies for users. If bucket latrines are used, the risk to groundwater sources
used for drinking-water will be reduced by disposal in lined pits or trenches, or in a sewer
if available. This should largely limit the potential for leaching of pathogens and nitrate
into groundwater. Cartage to areas far removed or downgradient from groundwater
supplies affords more options, with unlined pits or trenches as disposal options for a
lesser risk to drinking-water. Dispersed burial reduces the potential for significant
groundwater contamination and provides the opportunity for reducing health impacts due
to direct contact and insect or vermin attraction, as well as permitting soil bacteria to
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 289

degrade excreta. The presence of a confining soil layer will determine whether or not
leaching into groundwater occurs. Disposal of night soil into surface waters may not only
contaminate these waters but also groundwater if the aquifer is under the influence of
surface water.
   Impermeable tanks are an alternative system that primarily provide a holding area for
excreta. Wastes must be removed periodically, generally by hand or by pumping. Wastes
are then transported to a centralized treatment system. Such latrines are often referred to
as vault latrines or cess pits and some decomposition will occur during storage, although
nonetheless the waste must be periodically removed. If the container is intact, no risk to
groundwater exists other than that from waste which might seep into soils during
emptying or spills during transport. However, maintaining a completely impermeable
container may be difficult. Furthermore, in some settings deliberate drilling into the
container is practised, often illegally, which allows liquids to leak to the subsurface thus
reducing the amount of wastes to be collected and transported to centralized treatment
systems, and therefore saving disposal costs for the owner of the container. Though hard
to identify, this practise may pose an increased risk to groundwater pollution with
pathogens where hydrogeological conditions favour their transport.

Composting technologies
Composting utilizes bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms to degrade organic waste
materials. Composting may be performed in anaerobic or aerobic regimes. As treatment
is effected, temperatures in the degrading waste increase due to microbial activity. As the
temperature increases, a succession of microorganisms, progressing from mesophilic to
thermophilic, inhabit the compost until temperatures rise beyond the ability of organisms
to survive. When properly managed, composting temperature can be controlled to
optimize degradation, often through the introduction of air and mixing. Introduction of
air also minimizes odour production. Odour problems are more predominant in
anaerobic systems which generally require additional maintenance and collection of
methane off-gas. Control of moisture is important in any composting system to optimize
degradation rate. At the end of the composting process, temperature can be allowed to
increase to effect pathogen destruction.
    Latrines that employ composting as a treatment process are more advantageous, in
many respects, than alternative treatment or disposal processes. Modern designs
generally require minimal maintenance, destroy waste products and pathogens
biologically and produce a by-product that may be used as a soil amendment or fill
material. Some designs include the need to segregate urine from faeces (i.e. urine
diversion). Disposal of the urine can result in contamination of surface water or
groundwater, if not controlled.
    A functioning composting process will protect groundwater from contamination with
pathogens and will contribute to denitrification, thus reducing nitrate loads. The potential
for contamination arises from incomplete composting processes in conjunction with poor
attenuation in sub-surface, following the same pathways and with the same risk factors as
for other on–site systems. Equally, contamination with household chemicals and
personal care products will contaminate the compost product with those components
which are not readily biodegradable.
290                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    There is increasing interest in the use of ecological sanitation that is designed to
maximize the recycling and use of nutrients from excreta and to minimize environmental
discharges. However, such technologies are not risk free in relation to groundwater,
although the restriction on hydraulic loads can be expected to significantly reduce the
risk, and the use of sealed containers may also reduce risks. Risk assessment approaches
for urine diversion technologies should take into account the potential for accidental
leakage and spills and also consider the end-use and disposal of the treated waste.
    Although systems which incorporate composting in a centralized facility are not in
general use, the concept holds promise in light of designs more widely applied to
composting municipal sludge. They would locally focus potential risks to groundwater.
Thus as in other centralized systems, they require increased attention in situation
assessment, design and surveillance.

10.2.3 Off-site sanitation: Sewerage and centralized treatment
Off-site systems are forms of sewerage which transport excreta through sewer pipes
using water. They only transport faecal matter away from the household and do not
involve on-site decomposition to a significant degree. Conventional sewerage systems
usually transport excreta and wastewater to centralized treatment plants. They are the
norm in urban areas of most developed countries and use large diameter pipes with
significant hydraulic gradients to ensure continuous suspension of solids. Conventional
sewers usually require significant volumes of water to transport the waste and therefore
require high levels of reliable water supply service. Sewerage systems need to be
maintained regularly to prevent leakage. Leaking sewers are likely to represent a
significant risk to groundwater where centralized wastewater collection is practised.
Leaking sewers are therefore described in a separate section below.
    There are two forms of modified sewerage which use lower volumes of water and are
found in Latin American and Asia (Mara, 1996). Simplified sewers (sometimes called
condominial sewers) require typically lower quantities of water. Research in Brazil has
shown that simplified sewers can cause suspension of solids at relatively low velocities
and are more efficient than conventional sewers where flows are intermittent and solids
are moved along the sewer line through a process of repeated deposition and re-
suspension (Mara, 1996). However, to do this, sufficient numbers of people must be
connected to ensure the necessary level of flow is maintained. Small-bore sewers are
another form of modified sewerage that carry effluent and have an inceptor tank to
remove solids at the household level (Reed, 1995; Mara, 1996). They therefore work as a
mixture of both on-site and off-site sanitation, although there is usually little
decomposition in the inceptor tanks, which require periodic desludging, and disposal has
been noted to be often poorly managed (Reed, 1995).
    In some settings, sewerage systems include rainwater drainage from roads and other
paved surfaces, and these overflow periodically when water volumes from precipitation
are beyond their capacity, thus leading to an overflow of a mixture of excreta and surface
runoff that is commonly discharged to surface or marine waters with no or mechanical
treatment.
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 291

    The use of off-site methods requires treatment of wastes prior to their final disposal to
prevent health-relevant contaminants in the effluent from reaching water intended for
human use. In almost all cases, the final discharge of treated wastewaters and a
significant proportion of untreated wastewater is to surface or marine waters. Risks to
groundwater are therefore often dependent on the nature of the relationship between
ground and surface water, in particular whether groundwater is recharged by surface
water or whether groundwater provides baseflow to surface water bodies. This
relationship may not be static and seasonal changes are common (Foster and Hirata,
1988).
    Centralized wastewater treatment and storage facilities can bestow significant benefits
to communities. Processes can be combined to optimize treatment of physical, chemical,
and biological constituents in a waste stream. Pathogen removal and destruction vary
between different types of sewage treatment technology, but may be very significant.
The quality of the effluent required will not usually depend on meeting drinking-water
quality requirements in groundwater sources, but rather relate to surface water use for
abstracting drinking-water, recreation, or use of wastewater in agriculture and
aquaculture (Bartram and Rees, 2000; Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001).
    Centralized wastewater treatment produces substantial amounts of sludges –
essentially the biomass that remains after biological treatment of wastewater. These must
be disposed of or re-used as a soil amendment, fill, landfill cover, or other beneficial
uses. Application to land may represent a significant risk to groundwater where poorly
designed and operated. Composting either aerobically or anaerobically is a viable option
for treating and thermally disinfecting wastewater sludges, which may then be put to use
as soil amendments, backfill and landfill cover without inducing risks due to pathogens.
    Where wastewater includes effluent from industries and dispersed small enterprises, it
is likely to be contaminated with an array of often unknown chemical substances.
Distribution of such sludges in the environment may be a substantial non-point source of
contamination, some of which may reach groundwater. This in some cases is mitigated
where application is on the land surface, as many contaminants will be removed through
adsorption, sequestration and complexing with organic material. Situation assessments of
centralized wastewater treatment systems need to include sludge quality and disposal.

Sewage treatment
Various options are available for successfully treating waste flows at centralized
facilities. These include trickling filters, activated sludge treatment, oxidation ditches,
sequencing batch reactors, constructed wetlands, irrigation fields and sand filtration
(Dinges, 1982; Metcalf and Eddy, 1991; US EPA, 1996; Lens et al., 2001). Advanced
technologies include filtration, e.g. through membranes, for pathogen removal,
wastewater disinfection, nitrification and denitrification, as well as phosphorus removal
either biologically or by chemical precipitation using alum, iron salts and lime.
    Wastewater treatment facilities can impose inadvertent risks to groundwater. Spills,
leaks and overflows, either accidental or occurring during rain events, can enter the
ground at or nearby the facility. Raw or non-disinfected wastewater which directly enters
or migrates to soils can percolate to groundwater. Large events, or those associated with
flooding, also pose risks to groundwater via entry through recharge areas, excavations,
292                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

abandoned wells, trenches or pits, and by leaking around or into the well itself. The
location of wastewater treatment and effluent discharge in relation to a potable
groundwater source are important considerations for situation assessments.
    Where treated wastewater effluent is used for groundwater recharge, determination of
travel times for the recharged groundwater is imperative to ensure that adequate time
exists for pathogen attenuation to occur. The use of recharge basins or other techniques
of application to the soil surface has the distinct advantage of being able to utilize natural
soils above the natural groundwater table for additional treatment and natural filtering.
Retention times in basins may also be engineered to be long enough to permit significant
pathogen destruction.
    The use of waste stabilization ponds as a form of treatment has also become widely
used in many parts of the world. When designed and operated properly the use of waste
stabilization ponds has been shown to be effective in a variety of settings from arid to
humid tropics and have proved to produce effluent of high quality (Pearson et al., 1987;
WHO, 1987; Horan, 1990; Mara et al., 1992; Mara, 1996).
    There are three principal types of ponds: facultative, anaerobic and maturation. In
some cases only a single pond (usually a facultative pond) may be employed, whilst in
other as series of ponds may be used. Anaerobic ponds are often used prior to facultative
ponds to ensure adequate BOD reduction and sludge decomposition. Such ponds would
typically be used where septic tank wastes are disposed of into the treatment works.
Maturation ponds are used where good effluent quality is required and these have been
shown to produce effluent of very high quality (Mara et al., 1992).
    Whether leaching from waste stabilization ponds represents a risk to groundwater
depends on the quality of construction, the depth of the unsaturated zone, and whether
this is altered by the pond, and depth to the water table. If ponds are unlined, the
unsaturated zone below the ponds is low, or materials below the pond are highly
permeable, then the risk of leaching may increase. Some workers note that in well-
designed ponds, the risk to underlying groundwater from both chemical and microbial
contaminants will be limited (WHO, 1987; Foster and Gomes, 1989).

Leaking sewers
Leaking sewers have been shown to be a significant source of groundwater pollution in
numerous urban settings of the world though information on the full extent of the
potential hazard confronting groundwater is rather poor. Evidence of sewer-related
groundwater contamination incidents is known from Bolivia, United Kingdom,
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Sweden and the USA (BGS, 1995; Misstear and Bishop, 1997;
Bishop et al., 1998).
    A number of documented outbreaks have occurred that can be linked to leaking of
sewers and subsequent ingress into water supplies, including sources such as wells and
distribution systems (Hejkal et al., 1982; D’Antonio et al., 1985; Swerdlow et al., 1992;
Bergmire-Sweat et al., 1998). The most dramatic incident was reported from Haifa,
Israel in 1985, where leakage from a broken sewer in an adjacent village resulted in
epidemics of typhoid and dysentery, with 6000 people affected and one fatality. In the
United Kingdom a serious outbreak of disease occurred in 1980 at Bramham in
Yorkshire, resulting in 3000 cases of gastroenteritis (Short, 1988; Lerner and Barrett,
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 293

1996). In Naas, Ireland leakage from a sewer led to 4000 cases of gastroenteritis (Bishop
et al., 1998). Many studies cite groundwater quality data as evidence of sewer-related
contamination (Burston et al., 1993). These all indicate the need to address sewer
proximity to groundwater sources and condition as important in situation assessments.
    Two of the most detailed recent studies of sewer leakage in the United Kingdom have
been carried out in Coventry (Burston et al., 1993) and Nottingham (Barrett et al., 1997;
1999a). The Nottingham case study given in Box 10.4 shows the extent to which leaky
sewers can compromise groundwater quality with a range of contaminants, including
microbial indicators. Yang et al. (1999) estimated that about five per cent of recharge of
groundwater in Nottingham in the United Kingdom came from sewer leakage, although
noted that the confidence intervals on this estimation were very wide. This is in line with
estimates derived from an international review by Misstear et al. (1996), although these
authors noted that estimates of the proportion of sewers that were defective are much
higher.
    In Germany, the extent of leakage from sewers was estimated to be about 15 per cent
according to a poll which registered 17 per cent of the public sewerage system (Dyk and
Lohaus, 1998). Eiswirth and Hötzl (1997) estimated that several 100 million m3
wastewater leak every year from damaged sewers in Germany. Härig and Mull (1992)
calculated the extent of exfiltration to the aquifer below the city of Hannover, Germany
to be 6.5 million m3/year and the infiltrated water to 20 million m3/year.
    In earthquake-prone countries, loss rates are significantly higher, for example up to 60
per cent were estimated for parts of Lima, Peru (Lerner, 1996).
    There is far less available information regarding the risks posed by modified sewerage
(as discussed above in Section 10.2.2), in part because their use is limited. However,
there is significant potential for modified sewers to increase risks both through leaks and
by their mode of operation. The use of interceptor tanks in small-bore sewers causes
similar potential risks as on-site sanitation, although as contained systems this risk may
be limited. The shallow depth of most small-bore sewers increases the likelihood of
breakage particularly where these are close to roads and may therefore lead to infiltration
of contaminated effluent into the sub-surface. The design of the sewer also means
surcharging will be more frequent than with conventional sewers. Similar problems may
occur with shallow sewers.
    The quality of sewage will depend on the source. Sewers draining industrial areas will
reflect the waste being disposed of in the factories. This may vary in quality and quantity
depending on the activities. Washing down a factory floor may result in large quantities
of water with inert suspended solids, but five minutes later there may be a much smaller
volume of water from washing equipment that is contaminated with complex chemicals.
    Sewers draining residential areas will have a more consistent load, but people dispose
of a wide range of wastes down sewers. Oils, grease, household chemicals and faeces
may be expected, but chemical spills can occur anywhere. Even surface water cannot be
regarded as uncontaminated. Unless it is running off a clean surface, rainfall will pick up
dust, spilt oil, air deposits (such as particulate matter from car exhausts) and these can
lead to pollution.
294                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

      Box 10.4. Leaky sewers compromising groundwater safety in Nottingham
 Cities may dramatically change recharge pathways and quantities (see e.g. Lerner et
 al., 1982; Lerner, 1986; 1990). This is highlighted by a study of groundwater quality
 in Nottingham, UK conducted from 1994 to 2001.
 The setting. Public water supply to the Nottingham area is from several reservoirs
 fed by boreholes, only one of which is located within the city itself. Chlorination is
 carried out at the borehole sites prior to pumping to the reservoir. The borehole
 located within the city is currently used only in drought situations due to concerns
 regarding quality. Limited blending of sources is carried out before filling some
 reservoirs to ensure nitrate limits are not exceeded: As well as the mains supply,
 some industrial sites and hospitals have private boreholes. Groundwater is mainly
 found in the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group, which varies in thickness from
 zero in the west to over 150 m in the north. It is confined to the east and south by the
 Mercia Mudstone Group, and overlain in the valleys of the rivers Trent and Leen by
 alluvium. Regional groundwater flow is to the south and east, discharging into large
 boreholes and the two rivers. In much of the urban area there is little drift cover and
 the aquifer is unconfined and vulnerable to contamination.
 Study results. Analysis showed degradation of the inorganic quality of the urban
 aquifer in comparison to the surrounding unconfined rural aquifer. Nitrate concentra-
 tions frequently exceeded 50 mg/l. Within industrial sites contamination by chlori-
 nated solvents was widespread, TeCE being the most common contaminant and
 exceeding drinking-water limits in 50 per cent of samples. A survey of shallow
 groundwater in a residential district for nitrogen isotopes and TTC showed all the
 sampled shallow piezometers at the water table to be contaminated by sewage.
 Contamination is concentrated at specific horizons (preferential flow paths), but
 these exist throughout the aquifer thickness. Vertical and temporal distributions of
 microbial contaminants were found to be far more variable than those of chemical
 solutes, reflecting different source and transport characteristics.
 It is not possible to quantify the groundwater recharges of the city directly. There are
 three main sources of recharge in Nottingham (precipitation, mains and sewers).
 This study simultaneously calibrated four flux balance models for groundwater and
 three conservative chemical species (chloride, sulphate and total nitrogen). A
 groundwater flow model and three solute transport models were constructed and
 calibrated against hydrographs and all available measurements of solute
 concentrations dating back to the 19th century.
 The study area was divided into six zones, and the study period of 1850-1995 was
 divided into 13 periods to represent the spatial and temporal variations in recharge,
 pumping and solute loads. At 700 mm of rainfall per year, the average rates of
 recharge in the urban area for the most recent period were calculated to be: 211 mm
 per year total recharge, 138 mm per year mains water leakage, 64 mm per year
 precipitation, and 9 mm per year sewer leakage. There is uncertainty associated with
 these estimates due to the scarcity of hydrological data and limited historical data on
 quality. On a broad scale, sewage is found to be the major threat to the quality of
 urban Triassic Sandstone aquifers. The study highlights the vulnerability of
 sandstone aquifers to microbial contamination and the challenge to the delineation of
 wellhead protection areas.
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 295

    The variation in sewage quality (see also Table 10.4) will lead to varying impacts
from sewage leakage and may result in periodic discharges of highly contaminated
sewage into the environment. Assessing sewage quality and likely variations will help
inform control strategies to ensure that areas of particular high-risk are noted and that
actions are prioritized in these areas.
    As pollutants are transformed within sewers, it has proven useful to classify them
accordingly into primary, secondary and tertiary products. Primary pollutants include
microbes and ammonia as well as substances used in bleaching, cleansing and
disinfection. Detergents, solvents, fertilizers and salts also increase concentrations of bulk
organics reflected by parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and absorbable
organic halides. Secondary pollution effects arise from subsequent reactions, such as lack
of dissolved oxygen, formation of carbon dioxide, decrease in redox potential and
changes in electrical conductivity due to microbial degradation of wastewater
compounds (Eiswirth et al., 1995). Tertiary pollution effects are changes of specific
water constituents through biological and chemical reactions such as ammonification,
nitrification, denitrification, desulphurization and mobilization processes (Eiswirth and
Hötzl, 1997).
    In discussing interactions between groundwater and sewers, some confusion may
prevail with terminology. A sewer engineer will refer to infiltration as water coming into
the sewer. A groundwater specialist will refer to infiltration as water going into the
ground. This may be water that is exfiltrated from the sewer. The problems of infiltration
and exfiltration may occur alternately where sewers are at a level between maximum and
minimum groundwater table positions. Water table fluctuations may cause reversals of
infiltration and exfiltration with consequent potential for groundwater contamination.
    Sewer managers are normally concerned with infiltration of groundwater into sewers.
Too much water entering the sewer will result in elevated amounts of wastewater that
needs to be treated at the treatment works. This may overload the capacity of the sewers
and reduce the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (Härig and Mull, 1992). For
example, in Plittersdorf, Germany nearly 52 per cent of the total wastewater discharge is
infiltrated groundwater (Eiswirth and Hötzl, 1997). Infiltrated water can also bring silt
into the pipe blocking it. A steady stream of groundwater entering the pipe may wash
away the surrounding soil, causing settlement and damage to the pipe. An assessment of
infiltration can indicate the condition of the pipe.
    More important for groundwater quality, leaks in sewers may cause exfiltration from
the sewer into the groundwater. If sewers are situated above the zone of fluctuation of the
groundwater level, the impact of exfiltration from damaged sewers to groundwater is
controlled by aquifer vulnerability, depending on permeability of the material between a
leaking sewer and the aquifer (Misstear et al., 1996; Bishop et al., 1998). The pollution
of groundwater with exfiltrated harmful chemicals from wastewater typically results in
long-term damage that can only be rectified over very long periods of time and with
considerable technical and financial effort.
    In order to understand the mechanisms of groundwater pollution from sewers and
methods of monitoring and mitigation, some background information is required on the
construction of sewers. Sewers are the pipes that form a sewerage system that convey
sewage or wastewater. They can be made from a variety of materials such as concrete,
296                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

cast iron, plastic or, especially for older sewers, brick. The sewer pipes are laid in a
trench as shown in Figure 10.2 below.
    The trench is filled with a granular material. This bedding and surround protects and
supports the pipe, makes it easier to compact the material in the trench and thus avoid
settlement of the ground above the pipe and also makes it easier to lay the pipes so they
are in the correct position. Pipes are typically manufactured in short lengths to make it
easier to transport and lay them, but this does mean they have to be joined. Some metal
pipes are bolted together, some plastic pipes can be heated and welded to form a joint,
but many cast iron and concrete pipes have a spigot and socket joint. The end of one pipe
can be pushed into a socket of the next pipe. This allows for some movement and allows
the pipes to be laid at a slight angle to each other in a gentle curve.




Figure 10.2. Sewer design

    Infiltration and exfiltration can occur via a variety of routes as shown in Figure 10.3
below. Loose joints (1), displaced joints (2), and cracks in the structure of the pipe (3) all
allow water into and sewage out of the pipe. Other routes include poor junctions between
pipe branches (4), leaking manholes (6) and at the points where pipes enter structures (7)
or as inflow, directly along pipes (for example pipes leading to abandoned or future
connections) (5). These are shown in Figure 10.4 below.
    Physical damage is caused when pipes settle relative to other pipes or structures.
Chemical damage can occur when hydrogen sulphide from anaerobic decay of organic
matter, oxygen and bacteria combine to form sulphuric acid that can attack the soffit
(roof) of the sewer and damage materials such as concrete.
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 297




Figure 10.3. Points of leakage from sewers




Figure 10.4. Further leakage points from sewers

    Leakage from sewers and other damage also occurs due to mechanical malfunctions
such as open or displaced joints, deformation, collapse and blockage. From an extensive
survey, Bishop et al. (1998) showed a steady rise in the rate of failure as sewers age, the
most common cause of sewer failure being joint fracturing related to the practice of using
rigid joints, while deterioration of pipe material did not play an important role. Tree root
ingress, rodent activity (Battersby and Pond, 1997) and damage from subsurface work on
other utilities may also cause leaks.
    Factors that influence leakage of sewers include (Aigner et al., 1998):
    • type of subsoil;
    • height of groundwater level above sewers;
    • standard of workmanship in laying pipes;
    • type of pipe joint, number of joints and pipe size;
    • total length of sewer (including house connections);
    • number and size of manholes and inspection chambers;
    • rainfall (daily and seasonal);
    • age of system.
    Whether the water is moving into or out of the sewer will depend on the relative head
of the water. A sewer will only leak if it is below the water table or if it is overloaded or
surcharged. The pipe trench can then act as a soakaway. The sewage can flow through
the granular backfill, away from the leaking crack or joint and this can increase the rate
the wastewater can infiltrate into the ground. Where wastewater has to be pumped uphill,
pressure sewers will have a positive head, so more attention needs to paid to ensure they
do not leak.
298                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Sewers can be graded according to their structural condition (WRc, 1994). Using
methods such as close-circuit television, the pipes are examined for cracks and
deformation. Sewers graded in the most severe category may collapse. Leaking sewers
that are not necessarily in danger of structural failure will have a lower priority for action.
However, groundwater pollution can arise from both the long term diffuse leakage from
pipes as well as the sudden collapse of a sewer. Most utilities conduct structural
assessments only for important large sewers, as planned replacement of these is
preferable to having to react to a large hole opening up in a road. The collapse of smaller
sewers has less of an economic impact and so they are not routinely monitored, yet their
length can contribute significantly to diffuse pollution and their shallowness lead to
structural damage. In the United Kingdom about 75 per cent of the sewage network is
regarded as structurally non-critical (Read and Vickridge, 1997). House connections
constructed by non-specialists can also provide a source of groundwater contamination
that would not be recorded by a structural survey.
    Pollution routes do not only occur through leakage into aquifers. Blockages or
hydraulic overloading (due to storm water or increased foul flows) can cause the sewer to
become full and eventually flood. This can be through lifting manholes, backing up into
people’s houses or through specifically designed combined sewer overflows (CSOs).
Pumping stations also require emergency overflows in case of complete failure of the
pumps. The design should ensure that sewage flooding occurs in an area with minimal
social, economic and environmental impact, rather than flooding homes, public areas or
environmentally sensitive zones.

Storm water management
Current practice separates foul sewage from surface water runoff in many urban areas.
However in older urban areas or areas with poor regulation and enforcement, sewers can
carry both surface and foul water. Storm water drainage systems may collect effluent
from septic tanks, misconnections from foul sewers, excreta and other wastes washed
from the ground surface and flood water contaminated by inundated pit latrines. As
storm sewers are ‘officially’ for rainwater, they are not designed to cater for faecally
contaminated material. Open drains and lack of treatment before discharge to surface or
groundwaters can provide a route for pollutant transmission.


10.3       ASSESSING THE RISKS TO GROUNDWATER
10.3.1 Assessing risk from on-site sanitation
Understanding the hydrogeological environment and the siting of on-site sanitation is as
important as knowing the specific design of the facility, and the two interact to define the
level of risk. Of particular concern is whether the natural attenuation of pathogens will be
effective. The use of pit latrines, for instance, is often of particular concern as they by-
pass the major attenuating layer of the soil. Although the development of biologically
active layers around the pit reduces breakthrough, this cannot be wholly relied upon in all
situations and periodic overloading may occur.
      Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 299

   The assessment of risks to groundwater from on-site sanitation should take into
account the hydraulic load, the depth to the water table, the nature of the groundwater
(whether oxidizing or reducing) and the time taken for water to travel from the pollutant
source to the groundwater abstraction point. The lithology of the unsaturated zone will
also be important in relation to the potential for attenuation. For chemicals, and to a lesser
extent pathogens, the density of population may also be important in assessing whether
significant contamination will occur. Relatively simple approaches are available for
assessing such risks using only limited hydrogeological data (ARGOSS, 2001).
However, it is important to ensure that faecal material cannot enter the drinking-water
source through other means. This can be determined through targeted assessments.

10.3.2 Assessing the risks to groundwater from sewerage
Assessing risks of groundwater pollution from sewerage systems has in the past not
attracted much attention and assumptions regarding the expected attenuation of microbial
contaminants resulted in little concerted effort to define the extent and nature of
groundwater contamination (Reynolds and Barrett, 2003). Powell et al. (2003)
demonstrated that microbial contaminants (both bacterial and viral) derived from sewage
can penetrate to depths of up to 90 m in some aquifers. These included indicator
organisms and enteric viruses including Norovirus and Coxsackie B virus.
    In assessing the risks of contamination from sewerage, due consideration must be
given to the nature of sub-surface below the sewer including the depth of unsaturated
zone, the lithology (and likely attenuation potential), the depth of groundwater and the
hydraulic loading that could be derived from leaking sewers. In particular, estimating the
volume of exfiltration from sewers into groundwater will assist in determining the risk to
groundwater, although this is a complex task. Several methods have been developed to
quantify the water exchange between groundwater and sewers. Härig and Mull (1992)
used budgets of wastewater flow streams, a calibrated groundwater flow model and the
detection of sewage indicators. Yang et al. (1999) developed a model supplemented by
solute budgets of chloride, sulphate, and total nitrogen for the estimation of recharge to
groundwater in Nottingham.
    In addition, assessments can be made of the state and age of the sewer infrastructure
as a guide to the risk of sewer leakage. Older sewers will be more likely to leak as the
likelihood of breakage increases because of age and often because of construction
techniques that increase vulnerability to breaking. However, whilst more recent sewers
may be less prone to breaking, construction techniques may increase the likelihood of
leakage paths in the surrounds around the pipes. Reynolds and Barrett (2003) suggest
that assessing risks to groundwater from sewer leakage should be based on the frequency
of sewer breaks noted, age and methods of construction, grading of material surrounding
the pipe and groundwater level. Active monitoring programmes may also assist in
identifying the extent and nature of contamination from sewers.

10.4      ANALYTICAL INDICATION OF HUMAN EXCRETA
          AND SEWAGE IN GROUNDWATER
Identifying pollutant sources from sewage is often a major task due to the multitude of
potential sources and pollutants in an urban environment and detection of leaks in sewers
may be difficult. Indicator organisms such as E. coli, faecal streptococci and
bacteriophages remain useful in detecting general faecal contamination although it may
be difficult to precisely identify the source of contamination. Less robust organisms such
as sulphite-reducing bifidobacteria may be useful as species can be identified that are
unique to human faeces.
    Barrett et al. (1999a) tried to use chemical marker species which can be used to
indicate groundwater recharge from sewage. Most useful major ions are chloride,
sulphate and individual nitrogen species (Härig and Mull, 1992; Eiswirth et al., 1995),
while cation ratios can change due to ion exchange processes (Trauth and Xanthopoulos,
1997). Potential markers for sewage include ingredients of detergents like phosphate,
boron, ethylendiamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), optical brighteners and d-limonene.
Constraints on the value of these substances as markers are the variable composition of
detergents so that these compounds may not always be present. In addition, boron and
phosphate are not unique to sewage, and their occurrence and mobility in groundwater is
influenced by pH. Elevated groundwater concentrations of phosphorous may result from
overloading soil adsorption capacities from waste treatment systems (i.e. indicating
wastewater ingress), but may arise from agricultural use as fertilizer (Day, 2001).
    Stable nitrogen isotopes and microbial parameters are further tools. However due to
the die-off of microorganisms and the mixing and fractionation processes affecting the
nitrogen isotopes both parameters are not absolute indicators and may be difficult to
interpret. The study described by Barrett et al. (1999a) shows that ideal marker species
are rare because most groundwater constituents are present in more than one potential
source of recharge. There is a need for a multi-component approach rather than using
individual markers.
    The introduction of sewage to an aquifer may cause significant changes in the
chemical quality of groundwater. Observed effects may include depletion of dissolved
oxygen, lowering of pH, increases in DOC, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological
oxygen demand (BOD) and conductivity as well as decrease of redox potential (Rivers et
al., 1996; BGS, 1997; Barrett et al., 1999a). A further important effect of organic matter
is that it blocks sites for attachment on the surface of grains of the porous medium,
thereby reducing attenuation of microorganisms. Clogging will also eventually occur to
block flow paths.
    Nitrate is frequently used as a marker of sewage input, as it is derived from the
microbial oxidation of excreted ammonia in soils, and is generally conserved in
groundwater. However, nitrate may be derived from a number of other sources (e.g.
fertilizer or manure application). A more reliable tool is the ratio of nitrate to chloride.
High nitrate to chloride ratios are indicative of faecal origin, although the precise ratio
will depend upon population density and leaching to groundwater (Morris et al., 1994).
A drawback is that this ratio may vary seasonally, particularly in shallow groundwater.
Nitrate levels have been shown to decrease through dilution during the early part of the
       Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 301

rainy season and then to subsequently increase in shallow groundwater in Kampala,
Uganda (Barrett et al., 1999b; ARGOSS, 2002). Isotopic nitrogen ratios have
demonstrated promise in distinguishing between various sources of nitrogen inputs,
thereby providing a useful tool for assessing sources of nitrate pollution (Rivers et al.,
1996; Barrett et al., 1999a). Ammonia may be indicative of very recent sewage
contamination of shallow groundwater, but is likely to be rapidly oxidized to nitrate
under typical conditions in shallow, unconfined aquifers.
    A promising marker of sewage is 1-aminopropanone, which is present in human urine
and which is not produced significantly by other natural processes. Caffeine may be a
non-adsorbed, conservative indicator of sewage inputs, but it not be readily detectable in
groundwater (Stroud, 2001). Other potential chemical indicators of sewage
contamination in groundwater include trace metals, faecal sterols (e.g. coprostanol),
sodium dodecyl sulphate and sodium tripolyphosphate (Ashbolt et al., 2001; Barrett et
al., 1999a)


10.5      CHECKLIST

   NOTE X           The following checklist outlines information needed for
                    characterizing sanitation practices in the drinking-water catchment
                    area. It supports hazard analysis in the context of developing a
                    Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16). It is neither complete nor designed
                    as a template for direct use but needs to be specially adapted for
                    local conditions. The analysis of the potential of groundwater
                    pollution from human activity requires combining the checklist
                    below with information about socioeconomic conditions (Chapter
                    7), aquifer pollution vulnerability (Chapter 8) and other specific
                    polluting activities in the catchment area (Chapters 9 and 11-13).

        3 For trench or pit latrines: assess siting in relation to groundwater levels,
          vulnerability to flooding, routines for excrement removal and inspection
          of liner integrity (and access of potential disease vectors such as insects
          and rodents for differentiation between them and drinking-water as cause
          of disease)
        3 For septic tank systems: assess siting both of tanks and drainage fields in
          relation to groundwater levels, vulnerability to flooding, adequacy of
          routines of sludge removal, tank inspection

           systems), and estimate wastewater volume per capita
        3 Evaluate adequacy of design, construction, condition and maintenance of
           treatment and sewage systems in relation to aquifer vulnerability and
           physical conditions in the in the drinking-water catchment area: consider
           checklist for Chapter 8
        3 Assess siting of treatment facilities in relation to groundwater, integrity of
           containment, susceptibility of facilities to flooding
        3 Assess practices for re-use of treated wastewater irrigation, aquifer
           recharge, fish ponds or other purposes
        3 Assess practices of human excreta or sludge re-use and/or disposal, e.g.

        3 Evaluate the potential for contamination of sewage (and sludge arising
           from its treatment) with industrial chemicals, particularly persistent and
           toxic substances from an inventory of commercial activities in the
           catchment of the facility and licenses for connection to the system:
           consider checklist for Chapter 11
        3 In some settings, conduct microbiological analyses of raw sewage and
           effluent to assess treatment performance for pathogen elimination
        3 In some settings, particularly with reuse of effluent or sludge, conduct
           chemical analyses of concentrations of substances that potentially could
           contaminate groundwater in effluents and/or sludge
        3 …
Human excreta and sanitation: Potential hazards and information needs 303


  Are there sewers in the drinking-water catchment area that may leak into
  groundwater?
    Note: In many settings, assessing the risk of groundwater contamination from
    leaky sewers may be effectively combined with assessing the risk of direct
    ingress of sewage leaking out of sewers into the central drinking-water
    distribution system.

        indicate unregistered connections to the sewerage system or potential
        infiltration through leaks
    3 Compile information from laboratory analyses of groundwater samples
        taken in the vicinity of sewers (marker species, e.g. stable nitrogen
        isotopes, multi-component analyses in relation to known sewage
        constituents)
    3 Check for indication of leaks from budgets of wastewater flow streams
        and groundwater flow models
    3 …

          Are groundwater quality data available to indicate pollution from
          sanitation?
            3 Compile historic data from the area of interest, e.g. from local or regional
                surveys, research projects or previous monitoring programmes
            3 Check need and options for implementation of new or expanded
                monitoring programmes likely to detect contamination from sanitation

Many similarities exist between aspects of site characterization and facility evaluation
that are applicable for industrial and mining activities as well as military facilities, as a
result of the wide range of activities conducted there. This includes use of fuels, solvents
and other chemicals, as well as large storage volumes for some raw materials and wastes.
Many elements of planning and preventive measures can be developed based on
knowledge of site attributes, processes that are conducted, waste management procedures
and site closure activities. With the possible exception of high explosives and
ammunition, a large number of potential organic and inorganic groundwater impacts for
these types of facilities are coincident.
   As illustrations of the principles and strategies for site characterization, this chapter
provides case studies. Some of the elements of these case studies are immediately
evident, while others emphasize the need for careful collection and interpretation of the
data. While they focus on groundwater contamination by one type of human activity,

they also highlight that settings are often influenced by a more complex mixture of
multiple pollution sources to be identified in situation assessment.


   NOTE X              Industrial, mining and military activities as well as the
                       environment in which they take place vary greatly. Health hazards
                       arising from industrial, mining and military activities and their
                       potential to pollute groundwater therefore needs to be analysed
                       specifically for the conditions in a given setting. The information
                       in this chapter supports hazard analysis in the context of develop-
                       ing a Water Safety Plan for a given water supply (Chapter 16).
                       Options for controlling these risks are introduced in Chapter 23.




11.1       INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES
Industrial activities in groundwater recharge zones have significant potential to affect
large areas of local or regional groundwater as a result of normal operations (e.g. waste
disposal, materials storage) as well as short term adverse events (e.g. spills, leaks).
Activities defined as industrial may include a wide variety of large scale or small scale
commercial, public, governmental or military facilities that are engaged in
manufacturing, chemical processing, power generation or ancillary services (US EPA,
1999). In many instances, the aggregate effect of several small local industrial facilities,
or even the effects from a single small facility, have severely affected groundwater
quality, with impacts on drinking-water supplies.
   Although it is an important consideration, apparent industrial facility size may not be
the sole or even the principal determinant of risk to groundwater. The degree to which a
facility poses risks to aquifers can be related to many factors, including:
    • the specific industrial processes and chemicals in use;
    • the age and size of the facility;
    • corporate ‘housekeeping’ or environmental management practices;
    • local geological and hydrological characteristics.
   In addition to contaminant release issues, industrial activities in drinking-water
catchment areas may exert other non-chemical influences which change the vertical or
horizontal flow regime of contaminants (e.g. changes in recharge inflow quantity or
percolation rate), or which serve to reduce the overall capacity of the recharge area (e.g.
groundwater withdrawal). Thus as discussed further in Chapter 23, the most effective
preventive or management strategies for drinking-water catchments from an engineering
and cost perspective are those which seek to eliminate, minimize or carefully control
potential contaminant sources (Zektser et al., 1995; Berg et al., 1999).
       Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 311

11.1.1 Types of industrial facilities and potential impacts to
       groundwater
Many industrial facilities employ practices that historically have been associated with
groundwater contamination, such as the production, treatment or handling of metals,
petroleum, paints and coatings, rubber and plastics, electrical components,
pharmaceuticals, pesticides, non-chlorinated and chlorinated solvents, paper, inks and
dyes, fabrics, adhesives, fertilizers, wood preservatives, laundry/dry cleaning and
explosives. In addition, complex facilities may have a significant component of vehicular
traffic, power production, water withdrawal/treatment and grounds maintenance, all of
which may be associated with problems related to non-process use of fuels and
lubricants. As a result of the extreme industrial diversity in many regions of the world, it
is important to identify the types and sizes, as well as numbers of facilities, that may be
potential contributors to groundwater pollution. Table 11.1 illustrates categories of
industrial plant processes and ancillary processes that may be potential groundwater
pollution sources.

                                                pesticides

    Recognition of potential classes of groundwater contaminants for specific types of
industries serves as an aid in the development of appropriate plans for the monitoring of
ongoing activities (US EPA, 1999), as well as guiding the investigation of impacts that
may be associated with past site operations (see Chapter 23).
    Table 11.2 presents a number of examples of chemicals commonly associated with
important industrial processes that historically have caused groundwater contamination.
Substances marked bold are both toxic to humans and frequently found in groundwater.
Their behaviour and attenuation in groundwater is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
    Some of the substances listed in Table 11.2 are raw materials or production
intermediates for chemical manufacturing, while some are typical of waste streams from
the indicated industrial process. Yet others, however, may not be released from the
facility, but rather are formed as natural degradation phenomena once the release of a
parent chemical has occurred (Canter and Knox, 1987). For example, dichloroethene
(DCE) or vinyl chloride (VC) may in rare instances be released directly but, more
commonly, they are detected in groundwater as breakdown products in anaerobic
conditions related to the release of perchloroethylene/tetrachloroethene (PCE) or
trichloroethene (TCE) in the presence of specific subsurface bacterial populations.
Similar changes may be observed in the progressive, sequential reductive dehalogenation
of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which can result in the formation of lower
chlorinated homologues from the parent PCBs. Presence of the new analytes, e.g. in
312                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

groundwater samples, may create uncertainty regarding the source of the contaminants
and, hence, may complicate decisions concerning the appropriate response measures.

   In the example of both the chlorinated solvents and PCBs, the result may be that
Chemical A is disappearing, when in parallel the concentration of the corresponding
Chemical B is increasing. This seeming benefit of the reducing concentration of
Chemical A can mask marked increases in the significance of potential risk when the
degradation product (Chemical B) is more toxicologically potent than the parent
molecule (e.g. VC >> DCE).

11.1.2 Types of industrial practices potentially impacting on
       groundwater quality
Virtually any aspect of industrial operations has the potential to release chemicals,
though some processes are more likely than others to be of consequence when consider-
ing the vulnerability of groundwater. Organic and inorganic contaminants may reach
groundwater most readily as a result of discharge to the ground surface and subsequent
leaching through and from soils, or through subsurface releases from tanks, ponds,
underground pipelines, injection wells, and similar structures (Canter and Knox, 1987;
US EPA, 1999). Problems and characteristics of contamination that are related to
individual chemicals may be compounded by events such as fires or explosions which
often cause major changes in the chemical structures, chemical properties and
distribution of industrial releases.
    The withdrawal of groundwater, though not a waste-related or discharge-related
matter, may dramatically affect the subsurface movement and distribution of chemicals,
especially if the withdrawal is of large volume such as for single pass cooling water. In
many parts of the world, permits are required for such withdrawal. Therefore, permits
may represent one source of valuable information during reviews of potential industrial
impacts in a drinking-water catchment area. Similarly, discharge permits may provide a
valuable source of data on potential contamination origins.
    Releases of small or large magnitude to surface soils may occur from raw material
piles, aboveground tanks, drums and other containers, as well as from process leaks that
may occur within the plant, and which may subsequently reach the ground from
improper routing of wash waters or process overflow volumes. Industrial material
handling operations, including incoming and outgoing shipments, as well as in-house
transfers of materials, are often associated with episodic releases of chemicals over time
(Canter and Knox, 1987). While each individual event is not necessarily significant, the
cumulative effects can be severe.
    Factors such as ground cover type (e.g. paved vs. unpaved), interceptor drains, local
precipitation rate, soil types and aquifer vulnerability (see Chapter 8) as well as water
solubility, vapour pressure, soil microbial activity and the mobility of the chemicals of
interest (see Chapter 4) will influence how rapidly and in what form they move toward
groundwater through the soil column once released at the surface. Non-production
related activities on a site, such as grounds maintenance, may represent potential
groundwater impacts from use of chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides
(US EPA, 1999). Table 11.3 illustrates a number of acute and chronic release
possibilities that have the potential to contaminate groundwater.
314                           Protecting Groundwater for Health

Table 11.3. Potential release points and mechanisms

Chronic releases                                                Acute releases
Direct discharge: ground surface or surface water               Explosion
Subsurface discharge: injection wells                           Fire
Leaks: tanks, pipes or impoundments                             Catastrophic failure: storage site or
Transfer loss: pipelines, transfer points, storage facilities   transfer system
Non-process activities: herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides

    Once released, low water solubility and strong binding behaviour cause some
materials to move slowly in the subsurface environment, in comparison to substances
that are highly water soluble and that do not attach to soil particles (see Chapter 4). In
addition, high vapour pressure indicates that a chemical will favour volatilization, and
spilled materials may be lost to air from water or soils, as opposed to leaching to
groundwater. Local and regional meteorology will exert effects on whether or to what
extent these or other airborne materials may be subject to later atmospheric ‘washout’ by
precipitation, and subsequent re-deposition on the ground in complexed form, which
then is available for future soil leaching processes that may contaminate groundwater.
    Subsurface releases often represent the most direct pathway by which industrial
contaminants may reach groundwater. These occur most commonly as a result of storage
or disposal of liquids to pits, ponds, basins and underground tanks (Canter and Knox,
1987), as highlighted in Box 11.1. Such structures often are designed to act principally as
evaporation or holding structures; however, as a practical matter, those that are not lined
with clay or synthetic materials frequently exhibit a percolation component through the
floor and walls of the structure, or through cracks in theoretically impervious tank
materials (e.g. concrete, metal). The type, age, burial depth of the structure, soil type,
proximity to (or contact with) the groundwater interface, the care with which it was
constructed or installed, and the regularity of maintenance procedures, all are important
influences on the likelihood that such holding structures may serve as sources to long
term groundwater contamination potentially to be addressed in situation assessment.
    Subsurface releases also may be caused by leakage from underground pipes at
connections and valve locations, or as a result of rupture related to pressurization,
corrosion and mechanical damage. Such releases frequently go unnoticed and over time
may contribute to significant subsurface contamination. The oil refinery case study in
Box 11.1 is an example of this type of situation. The frequency, duration and volume of
such events, as well as the mobility and toxicity characteristics of the materials that are
released will determine the potential risks within drinking-water catchment areas. Some
important factors to consider with regard to storage structures are shown in Table 11.4.
   Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 315

 Box 11.1. Groundwater pollution with aromatic hydrocarbons and metals caused
                 by a petroleum refinery site in Czechowice, Poland
The process of refining hydrocarbons carries with it potential problems of raw
materials transport, handling/storage in large volumes, and chemical production
processes. These activities represent points at which chemical substances may be
lost to the environment as a result of leaks, spills or other short and long term
events. Many thousands of such facilities globally have been the source of local
or regional groundwater contamination, particularly in the case of the more water
soluble, aromatic hydrocarbon components (e.g. benzene, toluene) and of some
historically common additives (e.g. lead).
This phenomenon is well-illustrated by the case of a 100-year old refinery located
in an urban industrialized area of Poland. Capacity has more than doubled from
early production rates of 40 000 tons of paraffinic crude oil a year producing
gasoline, engine oil and fuel oil, as well as specialty oil products. Disposal from
by-products of the historical sulphuric acid-based oil refining resulted in the
deposition of more than 140 000 tons of acidic petroleum sludges in a series of
open, unlined waste lagoons.
The refinery site is underlain predominantly by silty sands, interspersed with
several thin discontinuous subsurface clay layers that do little to retard vertical
movement of contaminants. Groundwater was located at about 10 m below the
ground level in most areas on-site. There is a nearby water supply well, used for
commercial and industrial purposes, where increasing levels of petroleum
substances have been observed in recent years. Nearby residences are connected
to a public water supply system.
A comprehensive refinery site investigation was conducted to assess the extent,
degree and potential migration of site contamination, focusing on several
principal indicator chemicals, including BTEX, PAHs and heavy metals. These
were selected on the basis of their concentrations, mobilities and toxicological
properties, as well as their known linkage to historical facility operations. These
typically are ‘sentinel compounds’ for the evaluation of potential risks at facilities
such as the Polish site.
Soil and groundwater sampling data indicated broadly variable contaminant
levels at the refinery site, with a definite ‘hot spot’ within the large lagoon area.
Groundwater was found to be heavily impacted mainly by benzene and toluene,
though these substances often were at low levels in the lagoon sludges, due to
their volatility and the long residence time of sludges in the lagoon. It was
concluded from the observed distribution of contamination that the lagoons
represent at least localized long-term sources to groundwater for hydrocarbons
and some metals, largely limited by the viscosity and low water solubility of their
contents. However, more recent plumes of volatile chemicals (e.g. benzene,
toluene) are likely a result of ongoing refinery operations, probably related to
pipeline leaks, spills associated with product transfer and product losses in other
areas of the site. It was recommended that remedial action should be undertaken
at the refinery site, strategies be implemented for the prevention of releases and
that efforts be initiated to contain the expanding groundwater plume (see
Chapter 23, Box 23.1).

    As an example, some metal manufacturing and finishing processes generate large
volumes of liquid, semisolid and solid wastes that historically have required at least some
element of on-site storage and/or disposal. These same facilities often have extensive
above ground and underground piping systems that may be sources of groundwater
contaminants. The historical use of pits, ponds, lagoons and tanks to store oil or
hydrocarbon wastes, as well as solvent-contaminated washwaters and acidic (low pH) or
caustic (high pH) sludges, has resulted in many instances of broad scale aquifer
contamination. Such contamination includes water-soluble substances of health
significance (e.g. arsenic, lead, mercury, chlorinated solvents, fuel components, acidic
solutions), as well as those with minimal solubility (e.g. PAHs and PCBs). The large
facility size and long operational time frames for many smelters and metal production
plants pose specific concerns in terms of clearly identifying and characterizing releases,
as well as in terms of implementing effective containment or remedial measures to
address the problems.
    The use of injection wells for the purpose of liquid industrial waste disposal has the
capacity to introduce large volumes of chemical constituents, often of poorly understood
composition, into deep groundwater. Well type, construction and integrity, as well as
injection depth, chemical composition and duration/volume of injection events all will
influence the likelihood that an injection well serves as a source of groundwater
contamination.
    Impacted streams and rivers are often overlooked as potential sources of groundwater
contamination, though they may serve as significant contributors to local groundwater
quality if the surface water body recharges local groundwater. Thus the detailed
understanding of local and regional surface water quality and/or quantity may play a role
in assessing the impact of industrial facilities in areas where upstream discharges to or
withdrawal of river volumes affects the downstream recharge characteristics.
    Aside from the industrial releases themselves, environmental transport of
contaminants from soil to groundwater or within groundwater may be enhanced greatly
by the presence of conditions which act to mobilize otherwise recalcitrant chemicals. For
example, many organic substances may be bound well to soil if they are present alone,
but may become quite mobile if they are present concurrently with another chemical that
acts as a cosolvent (e.g. fuels mobilize organic chemical residues in soil). Similarly,
mobility of a number of metals in soils (e.g. lead) is dramatically enhanced by low pH
conditions in the soil or in local precipitation (Mather et al., 1998). Thus site-specific
geological, physicochemical, and land cover or land use considerations often are the
      Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 317

dominant features in determining the likelihood that a facility may contribute to
groundwater contamination.

      Box 11.2. Groundwater pollution with chlorinated solvents caused by leather
                      tanning industry in the United Kingdom
    As with refinery sites, large and small chlorinated solvent sites around the world
    have been associated with groundwater contamination. This is as a result of their
    historical widespread use for degreasing, metals cleaning, textile treatments and
    other applications. Although these solvents exhibit comparatively low water
    solubility, their environmental behaviour and their ability to act as dense non-
    aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) (see Chapter 4) often cause disproportionate
    problems in developing engineered remediation solutions. In addition, many
    countries have established quite restrictive water quality protection criteria for
    chlorinated solvents (e.g. TCE, PCE) or potential environmental degradation
    products (e.g. VC). A case which has elements reminiscent of many others
    involved the Cambridge Water Company and several local tanneries in the
    United Kingdom during the 1950s through to the 1990s.
    TCE and PCE are among the most common chlorinated solvents encountered,
    and were used in the leather tanning process. On-site handling practices, as well
    as spills and other releases, caused soil contamination at this industrial site. The
    complex geology in the area (multilayered Chalk composition) complicated
    several efforts to model the contaminant flow in the vertical and horizontal
    direction. However, it was concluded that the releases likely occurred in the
    early years of chlorinated solvent usage at the facility (i.e. the late 1950s).
    Discovery of contamination of a local water supply well in the early 1980s
    triggered an extensive investigation by the local Water Authority and the British
    Geological Survey (BGS), which ultimately demonstrated that significant
    contamination was broadly distributed in the area at concentrations exceeding
    1000 micrograms per litre. Despite conversion of the local water supply well to
    a pump-and-treat recovery well (which recovered over 3600 litres of PCE in 5
    years), a substantial quantity was unrecoverable, as is often the case with the
    chlorinated solvents.
    Although there is a tendency to focus on large industries as most likely to cause
    large groundwater impacts, the judicial actions surrounding this case
    emphasized the potential for contributions to local groundwater pollution by
    many small industries in an area, as well as the valuable benefits of planning
    and proper chemical handling, as opposed to attempting remedial actions
    decades after the release has occurred. Of course this observation can be made
    for other industries as well including, for example, textile operations, tanneries,
    motor vehicle fuel stations, electroplating shops, etc.

   Implementation of rigorous management practices at individual facilities may provide
an excellent organizational structure for maintaining good control of raw materials and
wastes that have the potential to contaminate groundwater. Recycling, waste
minimization and good materials balance accounting have the potential to reduce energy
318                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

requirements, transportation requirements, chemical demands, water demand and waste
disposal needs (see Chapter 23). Situation assessment therefore needs to identify the
extent to which such practices are operating.
   Furthermore while in many regions of the world practices in production, transport and
containment of hazardous chemicals has substantially improved during the past two
decades, historical contamination may be substantial. The case study in Box 11.2 shows
how discovery of contamination in drinking-water may lead to detection of large-scale
contamination of historic origin, particularly also from a high number of small-scale
enterprises.
   Effective documentation of the hazards that may be posed to groundwater by any
particular facility will be a function of the ability to show that good management
practices and responsible chemical stewardship are in place and working (Ekmekci and
Gunay, 1997). Further evaluation of the existing impacts to groundwater (or lack thereof)
can be assisted by access to historical groundwater data for the facility, adjacent facilities
or the region in which the facility is located. Based upon that information, it should be
possible to expand existing programmes of monitoring or develop new programmes to
more effectively detect industrial contamination.


11.2       MINING ACTIVITIES
A number of activities associated with mining operations have a significant potential to
pollute groundwater resources. With the exception of some deep mining areas, mines
tend to be at higher elevation in the catchment areas where rocks are closer to the surface.
Thus impacts from these mining activities may affect downgradient groundwater
resources as well.
    The broad term mining includes both open pit (surface mines) and underground
mines, as well as oil and gas mining (via wells), solution mining, in situ leaching (ISL),
heat (geothermal) mining and even gas hydrate mining or ocean dredging. Open pit
mining includes not only ore and lignite mining, but also excavation of gravel, sand and
clay for the construction industry. While the latter may be less intrusive, they can result
in severe environmental effects if not properly managed. Historically, mining was chiefly
conducted as underground mining following veins of e.g. ore and coal, whereas more
recently the availability of large machinery has promoted a tendency towards open pit
mining. Today, criteria determining which option is preferred include economic
considerations such as costs for labor (which is substantially more intensive in deep
mining) and investment into machinery (which is high for open pit mining), as well as
aspects of occupational safety (deep mining tends to be more hazardous) and the
acceptability of sacrificing large areas for devastation as open mine pits. ISL is a high-
tech option chiefly employed for mining copper and uranium.
    Impacts on groundwater quality from mining operations include but are not restricted
to:
     • mobilization of metals and metalloids due to low pH values in acid mine
         drainage;
     • leaching of substances from rock formations ISL;
        Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 319

    •   leaching from inadequately designed or operated mining waste dumps or tailing
        piles (i.e. overburden soil and rock);
    • activities directly linked to mining operations, often in their direct vicinity, such
        as inappropriate usage, handling, storage or spillage of chemicals employed in
        ore treatment, underground or surface traffic, heavy mining machinery,
        workshop or refining work operations as well as wood strut preservation in
        underground mines.
   Figure 11.1 provides a general overview of activities associated with the operation of
underground mines.
   Mining activities may directly impact on groundwater quantity. Both open pit mines
and underground mines are often associated with groundwater withdrawal which creates
a cone of depression during the operating lifetime of the mine. Thus the unsaturated zone
(zone of aeration) is significantly enlarged, leaving rocks and sediments exposed to
oxygen for a long time, which may cause the oxidation of sulphides and other minerals.
This phenomenon also may occur with ‘heaps’ or tailing piles from milling sites where
minerals can be oxidized.




Figure 11.1. Sources of groundwater contamination linked to mining activities
320                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

   Additional and different problems occur when mines are closed down, as discussed in
more detail in Sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3. Open pit mines may be left open or refilled
with waste rock, tailings, industrial by-products and/or they become landfills for
municipal waste. Cessation of groundwater withdrawal that is associated with normal
mine operations typically leads to a rise in groundwater levels, which may form a lake or
may infiltrate the backfill materials and flood former mine shafts. As underground
mining changes rock permeability significantly, it is unlikely that natural groundwater
conditions will recover to previous levels after mine closure. Mining at the West Rand
Goldfields in South Africa, for example, created links through underground penetration
of original dykes which originally had separated different groundwater reservoirs in
dolomitic areas.
   Rewatering after closure of the mines may be a very complicated process with great
uncertainty as to the eventual outcome to groundwater quality. Re-establishment of local
natural flow conditions can allow polluted waters to contaminate hitherto pollution-free
areas. To protect the aquifer against negative impacts after mine closure, a sustainable
groundwater management system in the vicinity of abandoned mines is required (see
Chapter 23.2). Thus situation assessment in settings with mine closure would address
how well such processes are controlled, which often has not been the case in the past.
   The scale of mining activities is an important factor to the potential for groundwater
pollution since small-scale mining activities are more difficult to monitor and control. On
the other hand, large-scale mining operations typically have a greater impact on local
groundwater resources. Many countries have environmental legislation to address
impacts from mining operations or to guide closure and reclamation of individual newer
mines; however old mines often are not considered. There is a lack of definition for
controls on mine water quality and mine water in excess of maximum contamination
levels being allowed to spill into groundwater or surface water in many instances.

11.2.1 Operation of mines: Chemical processes and potential
       impacts to groundwater
Of all the processes which occur during mining activities, sulphide oxidation is one of the
most severe pollution problems where sulphide minerals (e.g. pyrite) occur geologically.
It can lead to acid mine drainage that is often enriched with metals such as iron,
aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury and uranium. In this respect, the Boshan
case study given in Box 11.3 is typical for groundwater contamination through mining,
though contaminants from industrial activity more or less strongly linked to mining were
found as well.
   Sulphide oxidation happens when sulphidic minerals (e.g. pyrite) are exposed to air
and water. This process is complex because it involves chemical, microbiological, and
electrochemical reactions. The rate of oxidation is controlled by a number of parameters
including water pH, partial pressure of oxygen, mineral surfaces and the presence or
absence of bacteria.
   Geologically, sulphidic minerals (e.g. pyrite) are formed in a reducing environment
when sulphate and iron or other inorganics are supplied by water in the presence of
decomposable organic matter. Depending upon the boundary conditions and time, the
      Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 321

formation of sulphide can be quite variable resulting in different crystal structures of
sulphides and pyrite (e.g. framboid, polyframboid, conglomerates and massive
octahedron). A limited supply of organic matter in marine sediments is assumed to result
in low sulphate reducing rates, and thus formation, of framboidal pyrite (Evangelou,
1995).
    Framboidal pyrite is believed to be the major contributor to acid mine drainage due to
its large surface area and resulting rapid rates of reactivity. Pyrite in waste piles and
tailings is of finer grain and therefore much more reactive than forms that may be present
in the original bedrock (Langmuir, 1997). In the absence of buffering material, such
drainage is extremely acidic with pH values approaching zero and even negative pH
values (Nordstrom et al., 2000).

       Box 11.3. Mining and industrial contamination of groundwater in Boshan,
                             Shandong Province, China
    Boshan is located in the centre of Shandong Province in China, and is an
    important mining, industrial and manufacturing centre known particularly for
    the production of ceramics. Although Boshan only has a population of a few
    hundred thousand people, the surrounding District is densely populated and
    industrialized, close to the industrial centre of Zibo City, which has a population
    in excess of 3.5 million. Like many towns and cities in densely populated
    regions, it is difficult to distinguish a clear boundary between the urban centre of
    Boshan and the surrounding semi-rural or rural areas, which in effect form an
    extensive peri-urban region.
    The City of Boshan and the Boshan District are totally dependent on
    groundwater for water supplies, because surface streams have become seriously
    contaminated through the disposal of mine water, sewage and industrial wastes.
    Currently more than 80 000 m3 per day is pumped from the Tianjinwan well-
    field located to the east of Boshan. Another well field, the Liangzhuang well
    field, was abandoned in 1986 due to contamination.
    There is widespread contamination of the limestone aquifers near Boshan,
    which has greatly reduced the amount of groundwater that is available for
    potable supplies. Possibly the single largest source of contamination in the
    District is acid mine drainage containing high concentrations of dissolved iron
    and sulphate from nearby coal mines. Currently about 40 000 m3 per day of acid
    mine water is drained from mines, and this has caused progressive increases in
    the sulphate concentration in local groundwater, with concentrations commonly
    exceeding 500 mg/l.
    In addition to pollution from mining, a major pathway for groundwater
    pollution in Boshan is seepage from recharge basins and surface streams,
    particularly from the Xiaofu Stream that passes through urban areas of Boshan.
    These are heavily contaminated with industrial wastewater containing a variety
    of chemicals including sulphate, petroleum hydrocarbons, phenols, cyanide,
    arsenic and other metals.
322                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

   Sulphate and iron are the most common inorganic contaminants in acid mine water.
In addition, chloride, sodium and potassium are increased significantly if halite is present.
Several metals and metalloids of public health importance that are associated with
increased concentrations due to mining activities include arsenic, manganese, lead,
cadmium, nickel, copper, zinc, aluminum, mercury and uranium. For selected elements,
Table 11.5 shows ranges of typical background concentrations in relation to increased
concentration ranges induced through mining and thus helps in assessing whether
concentrations found in groundwater potentially affected by mining might indeed be
elevated through this activity.
   Uranium, radium, radon and thorium are radioactive elements which are encountered
not only in uranium mining, but also in metal ore, lignite and coal mining, where they
commonly occur in increased concentrations. In the case of ISL mining, chemicals (e.g.
acids or alkaline brines) are pumped into injection wells in large quantities and may
remain to some extent in the underground. Oil and gas exploration may be associated
with the presence of groundwater and brines with elevated concentrations of potentially
hazardous elements (e.g. boron, lithium, selenium, arsenic, bromine, barium and
thallium). Mining of evaporites (e.g. halite) is of special concern owing to the extremely
high solubility of the salt. Waste rock piles from halite mining commonly contain large
amounts of easily dissolved salt. Therefore, groundwater and surface water bodies are
commonly impacted by salty waste water during active mine operations.

   Different chemicals, some of health relevance, are used for ore treatment which is
commonly conducted close to the mine to reduce transport costs. Cyanide is used, for
example, during the extraction of gold. Another problem is the fixation of unwanted by-
products, for example in the case of uranium ore treatment where radium is fixed by
adding barium chloride to the tailing water in order to precipitate the solid solution
mineral Ba(Ra)-sulphate in the tailings. These precipitates may represent long term
concerns as potential sources of groundwater contaminants.
       Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 323

   During mining activities, precipitation of mineral phases termed secondary minerals
may occur. In addition to clay minerals being a common weathering by-product, some
minerals such as KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6 (Alunite) and KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 (Jarosite), can form
solid solution complexes with Fe3+ and Al3+ by evaporation in deep mines and at depth in
saturated tailings or in heaps under acid sulphate conditions. Their solubility is relatively
low under pH conditions greater than 3. Also, gypsum can be formed in the presence of
sulphate and calcium and melanterite (FeSO4⋅7H2O) in the presence of iron. Most
secondary minerals have low solubility which is important in the case of mine flooding
because it limits the rate of their re-solution. Thus secondary minerals may act as
temporary or permanent sinks for groundwater contaminants making their investigation
important.
   Large quantities of hydrocarbonsare used in the mining industry for trucks and heavy
mining machinery, and chlorinated hydrocarbons may be used for equipment cleaning
purposes. PCP, γ-HCH and creosote are commonly used for the preservation of wood
which may be of special concern in deep mines using wood struts. When a mine is
closed down quantities of hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons may be left in the
subsurface or in surface contaminant areas and may act as long-term sources for potential
contamination. Wood treatment agents like PCP will be leached slowly from remaining
wood struts and may contaminate the groundwater in the mine vicinity over a long
period. During open pit mining (e.g. lignite mining) spills of fuel and oil may occur
regularly. Also, pipelines from oil and gas fields often run over hundreds or thousands of
kilometres and leaks and spills can occur (see Chapter 13). Further, explosives from
mining activities were suspected to be the chief source of nitrate contamination at the
Orapa diamond mine in Botswana (Box 11.4).

      Box 11.4. Diamond mining as potential nitrate source in groundwater at the
                        Orapa diamond mine in Botswana
   Mining of the kimberlite pipe at Orapa began in 1971. This is the second largest
   kimberlite pipe in the world in terms of area, covering 117 ha. Mining operation
   is in a conventional open pit with the pit bottom now at approximately 110 m
   below surface.
   Although no contamination of the groundwater is to be expected from diamond
   mining, a study by the Debswana Diamond Company (Pty) Ltd revealed
   elevated levels of nitrate (generally >50 mg/l), in particular for wellfield 2 and 5
   (Mokokwe, 1999). In addition, the available data revealed a strong spatial and
   temporal variability of the observed nitrate levels. The latter was surprising
   since the main aquifer, the Ntane sandstone, is largely confined and features
   water of an old age. Thus one would expect nitrate levels to be rather uniform
   and of natural origin.
   A potential anthropogenic source of nitrate, even if only at a limited scale, is the
   240 t of ammonium nitrate-based explosives that are used in the pit monthly.
   Although most of the explosives will be converted to nitrogen and other gases,
   and be vaporized during the explosion, pollution of the groundwater in the
   overlying Kalahari Group sediments may occur, in particular through leachates
   from the slimes and slurry dams (Tredoux, 2000). Because high nitrate levels
324                                    Protecting Groundwater for Health

  constitute a health risk to infants, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and
  Natural Resources, Germany and the Technical University of Berlin and the
  Debswana Diamond Company (Pty) Ltd carried out a survey in Orapa in
  January 2000 of 60 boreholes and wells.
  The results of this survey again highlighted that nitrate concentrations in Orapa
  almost always exceeded the WHO guideline level (Figure 11.2). The highest
  concentration of 199 mg/l was found to the east of the old mining dumps.
  Concentrations decreased in the direction of the surrounding production
  boreholes which indicates that this very high nitrate concentration is caused by
  leachate from the old refuse dumps.
  In contrast, groundwater samples from the observation boreholes around the
  new township landfill site displayed neither significant ion concentration nor
  changes of ion ratios. Hence, this waste disposal site does not seem to be a
  source of groundwater pollution yet.
  Nitrate was also high at a borehole north of the Orapa Township, probably due
  to ingress of excreta from households that are not connected to the sewage
  system. This case highlights the complexity of potential sources of nitrogen.

11.2.2 Closure of deep mines
Deep mining is often conducted in hard rock environments with a small degree of total
porosity. In the large majority of settings, their operation requires continuous dewatering
of the mine shafts. Thus the recovery rate to refill a cone of depression caused by long
term dewatering operations can be very slow. However, if the bedrock is more porous, as
in the case of sandstone with both fracture flow and pore flow (Chapter 2), the artificial
and natural fracture cavities will refill quickly, while the pores will refill much more
slowly. This may cause entrapment of air in some parts of the mine. This entrapped air
can be removed only by diffusion over a long period of time, until the whole mine area is
saturated.
    Effective flooding of deep mines will vary according to local conditions. The simplest
way is to switch off the pumps used for dewatering. Groundwater levels will then
recover at rates dependent upon the hydrogeology of the area. However, due to the
higher permeability of adits (drainage tunnels) and shafts, water levels and flow
directions are unlikely to recover to natural pre-mining conditions (Figure 11.3). When
the cone of depression is refilled, groundwater will resume flow towards the natural
drainage and may transport potential contaminants in a downgradient direction. This
process of mine closure is referred to as uncontrolled flooding.




Figure 11.3. Changes in groundwater hydraulic heads due to increased conductivity caused by adits
and shafts in mined areas

    The rapid solution of minerals on first contact with water (‘first flush’) often results in
a maximum of inorganic contaminants during the initial flushing of the mine at closure.
Groundwater quality from a flooded mine may recover to background concentrations
after some years or concentrations may remain increased for decades or centuries if
pyrite oxidation is still taking place in the unsaturated zone. Some of the secondary
326                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

minerals that have been precipitated during the mine operational time are also dissolved
during the mine flooding process. Thus groundwater often contains significantly
increased concentrations of various contaminants at the very beginning of groundwater
recovery; however, they may decrease with time due to dissolution of secondary
minerals like gypsum or melanterite (FeSO4).
   It is quite common in mountainous areas to manage groundwater withdrawal
passively from an active mine by means of drainage tunnels known as adits.
Construction of such tunnels is expensive; however they are comparatively inexpensive
to operate (no need for pumps, no electrical power consumption). If such tunnels are not
sealed by concrete dams at or during mine closure, groundwater drainage will continue
as long as the tunnel remains open. Thus groundwater levels will not return to pre-
mining conditions. In consequence, pyrite oxidation may continue to take place until all
sulphide minerals are consumed. Low pH and elevated metal concentrations associated
with pyrite oxidation may make the water unsafe for drinking purposes both locally and
downgradient.

11.2.3 Closure of open pit mines
Closing surface mines is related to the refilling of excavations with overburden and the
recovery of groundwater levels. If other wastes (e.g. industrial wastes, municipal wastes)
are deposited together with waste rock during mine closure, additional contamination
problems may occur (Chapter 12). Waste rock which was backfilled into the open pit
mine may have a high potential to produce acid mine drainage due to oxygen contact
over long time periods and thus the formation of secondary minerals which can be easily
dissolved with the recovering water table.
    Depending on the amount of ore or coal/lignite mined, it is quite common that the
deficit volume of an open pit mine is filled largely with groundwater, forming a lake.
This lake formation may result in a deformation of local groundwater elevations. At the
in-flowing (upgradient) end of the lake the depth-to-groundwater elevation will be
increased and will be decreased at the out-flowing lakeshore. If the lake is elongated this
impact is more severe.
    Whereas during mine operation dewatering chiefly transports contaminants into
surface waters, post-mining lakes often become highly acidic and contain high
concentrations of metals. As they are integral elements of the local groundwater system,
these pollutants will be transported downgradient and impact the aquifer. This is a large-
scale quality problem in the Lausitz Region of Germany, as highlighted in Box 11.5.
    In arid and semiarid areas with low flow groundwater conditions, which are linked
with a low gradient of the groundwater table, any open pit mine lake which forms will be
subject to intensive evaporation from the open water surface. Thus the mine lake actually
may become a depression in the regional groundwater system even without
downgradient outflow. Consequently, the salinity of groundwater or concentrations of
other inorganic constituents may increase with time, making the resource unusable for
drinking-water or other purposes.
       Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 327

    Box 11.5. Consequences of the closure of open pit mines in the Lausitz region,
                                     Germany
    When groundwater withdrawal occurs over long periods, many mining areas
    suffer from the effects of the export of groundwater long after mine closure, as
    illustrated by the Lausitz lignite open pit mining district in Germany. Since the
    beginning of the 20th century lignite mining took place in an area of
    approximately 2100 km2. Groundwater withdrawal initially was conducted at a
    rate of 2 to 3 m3/s, increasing to a maximum of 33 m3/s in 1989. The water was
    largely pumped to the rivers Spree and Schwarze Elster. This dewatering
    activity accumulated to a groundwater deficit of 13 billion m3 in 1990, at which
    time lignite mining was reduced dramatically following the unification of
    western and eastern Germany. Natural recharge is not locally sufficient to
    replace these massive deficits within a short time and measures have been set in
    operation to ensure a minimum base flow in the rivers. Thus a river catchment
    and groundwater management system was implemented, which is expected to
    remain in operation for at least two to three decades, until nearly natural
    conditions have been re-established in groundwater and surface water levels.
    The process of filling the open pit lakes created by the mining activities with
    river water has the potential to result in infiltration into oxidized waste rock
    piles, thereby creating strong potential for development of acid mine drainage.
    An acidic plume can already be observed migrating downstream of these lakes.
    The concern is that even after two to three decades when the groundwater
    deficit is reversed the interconnected lakes will result in severe problems of acid
    groundwater. Further, these pH impacts, with associated toxic metals, are likely
    to affect the local lakes and rivers, rendering them also unusable for abstracting
    drinking-water for several decades at minimum.



11.2.4 Predicting post-mining groundwater quality
Mine operators and local authorities need to understand water quality both during and
after mining operations. A first step in prediction is to consider water quality at operating
or abandoned mines in similar geological and hydrogeological conditions. A second step
is the analysis of rock samples from the site to determine both alkaline-producing
potential and acid potential (Brady and Cravotta, 1992). In addition to such static tests,
kinetic leaching tests have been developed as measures of water quality effects; however,
long term field verification is lacking for these kinetic tests. In some cases, the prediction
of post-mining hydrochemical conditions can be accomplished by the use of regression
analyses.
    In order to understand complex chemical processes and/or to predict post-mining
water quality, a variety of hydrogeochemical models are available, such as PhreeqC2,
Phrqpitz or EQ3/6 (Plummer et al., 1988; Wolery, 1992; Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999).
Where acid neutralization reactions can have a strong effect on the transport of dissolved
metals, models based on the coupled solute-transport/hydrogeochemical mass-transfer
like MINTRAN (Walter et al., 1994) or TREAC are preferable. They predict pH
328                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

buffering sequences and metal attenuation mechanisms that are similar to those observed
at field sites.


11.3        MILITARY FACILITIES AND ACTIVITIES
Regional and international conflicts or military occupations, coupled with day-to-day
operations of military bases and support facilities, have resulted in environmental
degradation and long-term contamination of soil and groundwater at both former and
active military sites. An example of severe contamination from day-to-day operations is
given in the Valcunai case study in Box 11.6. For assessing impact on groundwater, a
distinction can often be drawn between direct military actions or conflicts on one hand
and the (often longer term) use history of military sites and manufactories on the other.
Depending upon the nature of the site, contamination to be addressed by situation
assessment will include non-ordnance-related chemicals that are associated with typical
ancillary military operations (e.g. fuels, pest control chemicals and municipal wastes).
Because military bases often resemble towns or small cities in their breadth of activities
(Teaf, 1995), many of the considerations that are presented in Chapters 10, 11.1 and 12
regarding municipal and industrial risks to groundwater recharge areas also are relevant
here.

      Box 11.6. Impacts on groundwater quality by a former military base in Lithuania
   The Valcunai Oil Product base, which is located 14 km south of Vilnius, was a
   site of underground storage of light oils and rocket propellants (nitrogen
   tetroxide) from 1963 until 1993. Over 33 000 m3 of storage in leaky underground
   tanks was in service (27 500 m3 for light oils and over 3000 m3 for rocket fuels).
   A three year monitoring study (Seirys and Marcinonis, 1999) determined that
   groundwater has been impacted both by pure oil product (3000 to 3500 m2 at a
   depth of 5.5-7.5 m), chlorinated solvents (e.g. TCE, PCE, carbon tetrachloride) as
   well as dissolved aqueous phase constituents from oils and other organics and
   inorganics (nitrates, metals). While a glacial till confining unit of approximately
   60 m thickness separates the shallow aquifer from the productive deeper aquifer
   beneath the oil storage areas, this confining unit is absent beneath the rocket fuel
   storage areas, rendering the deep aquifer very vulnerable. This aquifer supplies
   the Pagairai Wellfield, the largest potable water supply for the City of Vilnius.
   Subsurface ravines representing historical glacial features act as drainage
   channels for groundwater. Contamination has been observed to be mobile both
   vertically and horizontally in groundwater. The study reported contaminated
   shallow groundwater to be discharging to the Rudamina River approximately 0.8
   km distant. Thus the Valcunai site represents an example of complex subsurface
   characteristics with high levels of contamination affecting soils, groundwater and
   surface water, all of which illustrate the difficult technical aspects of remediation.
   Removal of free phase hydrocarbons is addressed with extraction wells and oil
   separation units treating very large volumes of groundwater. The estimated goal
   of recovery is in the range of 400 to 500 m3 per two years.
       Industry, mining and military sites: Potential hazards and information needs 329

    Groundwater pollution resulting from deployment of explosives in military conflict
includes the impact of damage or destruction of industry, traffic facilities and municipal
sewage that may lead to pollutant release. This is similar to spills in ‘extreme events’ as
discussed in Chapters 10, 11.1 and 12, but may additionally include combustion products
and their transformation products. Further aspects of groundwater pollution through
military conflict are physical damage to water supply infrastructure, and the direct
contamination of water by residues of many types of explosives, for most of which
health and environmental impacts as well as their behaviour in groundwater are poorly
understood. The discussion below focuses on the potential for groundwater
contamination released from warfare agents’ production and military operation sites.
    In historical review, as with many other human activities potentially polluting
groundwater, the scale of deployment and the variety of warfare agents increased
dramatically during the 20th century. The additional use of chemical warfare (CW) agents
introduced a potential for environmental damage. After conflicts, entire armament
production plants and military facilities have been dismantled or destroyed and ordnance
buried or dumped without any environmental safety precautions.
    The groundwater pollution potential from military operations became apparent and
subject of scientific research only in the early 1990s. The results disproved the often-
expressed hope that many of the military chemicals which are classified as dangerous
would quickly be degraded in soil to non-hazardous concentrations (Mulisch et al.,
1999a; 1999b).
    The specific difficulty in assessing the potential for chemical impairments to
groundwater from military sites is that substances used are often subject to secrecy, while
their identification in a historical review of site-specific activities would greatly support
situation assessment. Only if the substances to be expected are known can their hazard
potential be determined for a given site on the basis of substance-specific data.
Investigations of the complex biophysical, chemical and biochemical transfer processes
as well as of microbial metabolism of organics further supplement the basis for a
prognosis of the likely groundwater impacts in the recharge area, including contaminant
fate, distribution, bioavailability and degradation in the subsurface (Mulisch et al., 1996;
2000). Historical research to identify military chemical production sites and the areas in
which these products were used can substantially help to identify possible risks to
groundwater in a region.
    The description of potential groundwater contaminant problems, as given in the
following section, follows the basic categorization of sites into armament production
sites (manufactories) and areas/sites at which the products are used (military operation
sites). The latter may include base facilities as well as deployment areas (e.g. shooting
ranges, test sites). Potential control and remediation measures for settings in which
military sites are suspected sources of groundwater contamination are similar to those for
industrial sites and are discussed together with these in Chapter 23.
330                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

11.3.1 Potential groundwater contaminants from military
       production sites
Both active and abandoned military production and manufactory sites may comprise
explosives and powder factories, plants for the production of CW and smoke agents,
armament filling plants and munitions factories, as well sites at which munitions were
stored, disposed of or buried. For production-related reasons (e.g. need for large volumes
of groundwater), these armament complexes are often located in areas that are rich in
groundwater resources, which potentially elevates risks of large-scale pollution. In
particular, contamination has been reported from sites where loading/unloading and
filling operations took place, as well as cleaning and maintenance work on machinery or
the cleaning/refurbishment of containers and ammunition. Wastewater from cleaning
operations was generally highly contaminated by explosives, such as trinitrotoluene
(TNT) isomers. Blasting operations can result in widespread contamination by
explosives especially at large plants. Areas of suspected contamination also include, in
particular, sites at which residues of explosives and off-specification batches of
munitions were burned or buried.
     The groups of products generally referred to as military warfare agents mainly
comprise explosives and a number of chemical agents. Of the categories of explosives,
the high-brisance (very powerful) explosives are of greatest interest, largely because they
typically are safer to handle on a regular basis and have very high detonation velocities.
Major representatives are 2,4,6-TNT, 2,4 or 2,6-DNT, 1,3-DNB, hexogen
(cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) and picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol), but also nitropenta
and tetryl. To detonate the high-brisance explosives, it is necessary to ignite them with
highly sensitive initiating explosives (e.g. nitropenta and tetryl as well as lead azide,
mercury fulminate, thallium azide, and tetrazene). Other important explosives include
cyclotrimethylenetetranitramine (RDX), cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine (HMX),
ammonium picrate, ammonium nitrate, nitroguanidine, nitroglycerin and dinitrophenols.
     Several of the military explosives are of more dominant interest than others because
of the large volume of their use, their potential to migrate to groundwater, persistence and
toxicity characteristics. For example, 2,4,6-TNT has been very widely used as filling for
bombs, mines and shells, readily dissolves in water and can move to groundwater with
ease, is persistent (though microbial degradation to aminodinitrotoluolene occurs), and
has a high degree of toxicity. It also is classified by US EPA as a possible human
carcinogen. Dinitrotoluene (DNT) is mobile in groundwater, is scarcely oxidized
biochemically, and not hydrolysed under environmental conditions. Many examples of
TNT and DNT contamination have been identified in European and USA military
facilities or support industries. Tetryl slowly hydrolyses to picric acid, which does not
degrade biochemically under aerobic conditions and only slowly to picramic acid under
anaerobic conditions.
     Some military ordnance chemicals (e.g. amines, nitro compounds and nitroso
compounds) are of interest also because their degradation products (e.g. nitrates)
represent significant groundwater contamination sources. Table 11.6 identifies a number
of the most common explosive or other military substances with notes on their
environmental and health concerns.

   The human health relevance of most of these compounds is a result of the specific
metabolic transformations (mostly reductions) of their nitrogroup(s) by the intestinal
microorganisms and by hepatic metabolism. Many intermediates are strongly
electrophilic compounds. They have the potential to damage DNA either directly or by
disturbing its regulation and expression by epigenetic mechanisms up to the protein and
cellular level. High intakes of some compounds are also acutely dangerous by inhibiting
the transport of oxygen by oxidizing Hb to metHb. The in vivo toxicologic database,
especially for some environmental and microbial metabolites, is very poor.

Chemical weapons
About 70 different chemicals were used or stockpiled as CW agents during the 20th
century. Now banned worldwide, CW agents can still be found at former manufactories
or at clandestine production and storage facilities. They may be categorized according to
their main effects on the human organism, and include but are not restricted to blood
agents (e.g. hydrocyanic acid), nerve agents (e.g. sarin), skin agents (e.g. mustard gas;
HD), or respiratory agents (e.g. phosgene).
    CW agents are frequently called ‘war gases’ though this historic term is no longer
correct, since many effective CW agents are liquids or solids and only gases in
specialized circumstances. As with other chemicals, the relevance of CW agents to
potential groundwater contamination depends primarily on their water solubility and
their hydrolytic stability (see Chapter 4). Table 11.6 gives examples of warfare agents in
relation to their potential to migrate in groundwater.
332                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

11.3.2 Potential groundwater contaminants from military
       operation sites
For assessing pollution potential of military bases and operation sites, both the military-
specific substances discussed above and contaminants from other activities on the site
may be relevant. In times of peace, warfare agents are used only for training purposes,
though such activities may pose contamination risks for groundwater as well.
Abandoned sites are categorized according to their main original uses (e.g. training
grounds, barracks, facilities for maintenance of technical equipment, airfields and missile
sites). Even at locations that, based on their use history, initially are not suspected of
encompassing contaminated areas (e.g. administrative buildings, dwellings),
considerable contamination including that extending into the groundwater has been
found in many cases, and this contamination can threaten the local drinking-water supply
if it occurs in recharge areas (Teaf, 1995).
     In contrast, training grounds can be expected to exhibit widespread contamination
from munitions, as a result of non-point inputs caused directly by military activities (e.g.
bomb-dropping grounds, shooting ranges for tanks). Likewise refueling activities in the
field or at base support facilities have caused widespread contamination of soil and
groundwater by hydrocarbons. Contamination from point sources arises within
individual operational areas such as areas in which military equipment is maintained or
cleaned, burning sites, or as a result of exceptional events (hazardous release incidents).
All of these activities have resulted in groundwater contamination with metals, solvents,
hydrocarbons, explosives and other substances.
     Many substances used in the military sector are also used in the civilian sector,
including petroleum products from fuel depots for motor vehicles and aircraft. According
to results obtained from numerous exploratory investigations into contaminated military
sites, contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons ranks first, in quantitative terms. Other
contaminants found are mainly organic solvents (e.g. chlorinated hydrocarbons) such as
were used in large quantities in maintenance facilities and tank-washing installations.
Plant treatment, agricultural and pest control products were used in large quantities as
defoliants or to keep strategic or militarily sensitive areas free of vegetation or nuisance
insects. Large residential facilities (e.g. base housing and daily military operations) also
generated the equivalent of municipal waste which, if improperly disposed (see
Chapter 12), has the potential to affect groundwater (Herndon et al., 1995).
     At training grounds known as ABC facilities (training in defense against Atomic,
Biological and Chemical weapons), contamination has occurred mainly from the use of
CW agents, from decontamination activities and from the use of incendiaries and smoke
agents. Original warfare agents were used for training purposes at these facilities only in
very small quantities. Today, CW agents may be found buried on training grounds or in
disposal areas at active as well as closed military bases.
     On many military properties, illegal and/or uncharacterized waste dumps were
established, so that no information is available about the chemical composition of the
waste dumped or the length of time the dumps were in use. The special conditions that
typically govern the establishment of landfills, and the associated use restrictions (e.g.
restrictions on abstraction of drinking-water in the catchment area), tend to have been

disregarded by military forces. The variability and site-specificity of these conditions has
made chemical characterization, site investigation and groundwater pollution assessment
difficult (Herndon et al., 1995).


11.4       CHECKLIST

   NOTE X            The following checklist outlines information needed for
                     characterizing industrial, mining and military activities in the
                     drinking-water catchment area. It supports hazard analysis in the
                     context of developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16). It is neither
                     complete nor designed as a template for direct use but needs to be
                     specially adapted for local conditions. The analysis of the potential
                     of groundwater pollution from human activity requires combining
                     the checklist below with information about socioeconomic
                     conditions (Chapter 7), aquifer pollution vulnerability (Chapter 8),
                     and other specific polluting activities in the catchment area
                     (Chapters 9-10 and 12-13).

Waste disposal and landfill: Potential
hazards and information needs
R. Taylor and A. Allen




Solid wastes, the subject of this chapter, are mainly disposed of to landfill, because
landfill is the simplest, cheapest and most cost-effective method of disposing of waste
(Barrett and Lawlor, 1995). In most low to medium income developing nations, almost
100 per cent of generated waste goes to landfill. Even in many developed countries, most
solid waste is landfilled. For instance, within the European Union, although policies of
reduction, reuse and diversion from landfill are strongly promoted, more than half of the
member states send in excess of 75 per cent of their waste to landfill (e.g. Ireland 92 per
cent), and in 1999 landfill was still by far the main waste disposal option (EEA, 2003).
Furthermore, although the proportion of waste to landfill may in future decrease, the total
volume of municipal solid waste (MSW) being produced is still increasing significantly,
in excess of 3 per cent per annum for many developed nations (Douglas, 1992). Landfill
is therefore likely to remain a relevant source of groundwater contamination for the
foreseeable future (Allen, 2001).
    Solid waste composition, rate of generation and methods of treatment and disposal
vary considerably throughout the world and largely determine the potential of waste to
impair groundwater quality. The purpose of this chapter is to outline the risk that waste
disposal presents to groundwater quality and the information that is required to assess
this risk.

   NOTE X             Waste disposal and landfill activities and the environment in which
                      they are placed vary greatly. Health hazards arising from waste
                      disposal and landfill and their potential to pollute groundwater
                      therefore needs to be analysed specifically for the conditions in a
                      given setting. The information in this chapter supports hazard
                      analysis in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan for a
                      given water supply (Chapter 16).




12.1      TYPES OF SOLID WASTE
Wastes generated by the full extent of human activities range from relatively innocuous
substances such as food and paper waste to toxic substances such as paint, batteries,
asbestos, healthcare waste, sewage sludge derived from wastewater treatment and, as an
extreme example, high-level (radioactive) waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel rods.
Numerous classifications of solid wastes have been proposed (e.g. Tchobanoglous et al.,
1993; Ali et al., 1999), and the following represents a simple classification of waste into
broad categories according to its origin and risk to human and environmental health:
     • household waste;
     • MSW;
     • commercial and non-hazardous industrial wastes;
     • hazardous (toxic) industrial wastes;
     • construction and demolition (C&D) waste;
     • health care wastes – waste generated in health care facilities (e.g. hospitals,
         medical research facilities);
     • human and animal wastes;
     • incinerator wastes.
     Household waste represents waste generated in the home often collected by municipal
waste collection services. MSW includes also shop and office waste, food waste from
restaurants, etc., also collected by municipal waste collection systems, plus waste derived
from street cleaning, and green (organic) waste generated in parks and gardens.
     Storage of waste in a disposal facility serves to minimize the effects of waste on the
environment. This is achieved by restricting any effluent derived from the waste to a
single location, where emissions can be controlled. If control is lacking or inadequate,
disposal facilities may become point sources of groundwater contamination. In many
regions, centralized waste disposal has historically occurred by landfilling, wherein local
quarries and gravel pits have been filled with waste because, in many cases, they simply
constituted an appropriately sized hole in the ground. Such locations typically offered
little protection against contamination of adjacent groundwater supplies. Legislation
designed to protect usable groundwater has helped to reduce the incidence of this
practice in many high to middle income countries (e.g. US EPA, 1974; CEC, 1980;
NRA, 1992). Modern waste management practices involve disposal of waste in specially
sited and engineered sites known as sanitary landfills (see Chapter 24).
        Waste disposal and landfill: Potential hazards and information needs             341

    Waste accepted in municipal waste landfills in developed countries would normally
consist of MSWs, plus commercial and non-hazardous industrial wastes and C&D
waste. There is a tendency in many countries for C&D waste, usually regarded as inert,
to be buried on the construction site where it is generated. However, since downward
percolating rainwater may leach heavy metals from C&D waste, recent waste regulations
in some developed countries require all C&D waste to be disposed of in landfills.
    Hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are differentiated in the waste management
legislation of many countries. A range of legal definitions exist for hazardous waste, but
it can generally be thought of as waste or a combination of wastes with the capacity to
impair human health or the environment due to its quantity, concentration or physical,
chemical or infectious characteristics when improperly used, treated, stored, transported
or disposed. In many countries, hazardous (toxic) industrial wastes (both organic and
inorganic), solid incinerator residues, bottom and fly ash are disposed in special
hazardous waste landfills, and specialized disposal or incineration may also be practiced
for healthcare wastes (see Box 12.1).

                      Box 12.1. Health care and research facilities
    Health-care facilities can contaminate groundwater through wastes and
    wastewater containing infectious pathogens, e.g. from contaminated blood or
    infectious body parts. Health-care facilities may also release various
    pharmaceuticals, diagnostics (e.g. radiochemicals) and disinfectants depending
    on the kinds of medical examination being conducted and local practices for
    handling these substances. These include, but are not restricted to the following:
    - cytostatic agents applied in cancer therapy;
    - antibiotics;
    - disinfectants for surface, instrument and skin disinfection;
    - heavy metals such as platinum from excretion by patients treated with the
      cytostatic agents, mercury from preservatives, disinfectants, diuretic agents,
      amalgam separators;
    - adsorbable organic halogenes from solvents, disinfectants, cleaners and
      drugs containing chlorine, as well as iodized X-ray contrast media.
    Research institutions may use solvents and other potentially hazardous
    chemicals and radiochemicals (e.g. mutagenic substances used in molecular
    biology). Also, organisms used in production and research, especially
    pathogenic bacteria and viruses, as well as genetically modified organisms, are
    utilized.
    For health-care and research facilities, situation assessment should be based on
    an inventory of substances used or produced, and of processes, which have the
    potential to emit hazardous organisms or chemicals. Such assessments should
    necessarily cover storage (containment), handling and disposal practices (e.g.
    disinfection of wastes). Additionally, assessment should address how effectively
    these practices are being implemented and the ultimate destination of disposal
    (e.g. local dump, sewage mains), as this will determine the nature and
    magnitude of the risk to groundwater.
342                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

   In many low to medium income parts of the world, where uncontrolled open dumps
are common, all waste tends to be dumped together, regardless of its origins or its
hazardous nature. A specific characteristic of leachate from hazardous industrial waste is
that it may be toxic to the bacteria naturally present and thus delay biodegradation of
organic substances in leachate.
   Human and animal wastes are usually not disposed of in landfills, although animal
carcasses and waste from abattoirs may in some countries be disposed of in dumps and
landfills. Human corpses are not generally regarded as waste, but they degrade in a
similar way to other organic waste, and also produce leachate in significant quantities.
The majority of corpses are buried in cemeteries (see Box 12.2), although a significant
proportion are cremated (incinerated), the proportion varying from country to country
depending on the proportions of different religious groups in the population and their
funeral rites. The main health concern with human and animal wastes is the high
concentrations of pathogenic organisms associated with this type of waste, and the
potential it has to spread disease.

                                    Box 12.2. Cemeteries
      In many regions burials are concentrated into relatively small areas, such as
      municipal cemeteries, where each body introduces a heavy burden of organic,
      inorganic and biological parameters into the subsurface. Hydrogeological
      factors have historically not been taken into account when locating cemeteries
      and the potential impact of cemeteries on groundwater quality has not been
      considered.
      Animal and human remains, although not considered a waste product, represent
      a risk to local groundwater because of the proliferation of microorganisms that
      occurs during the process of corpse decomposition (Pacheco et al., 1991). There
      are more bacteria in a human body than human cells. Many of the bacteria are
      harmless saprophytes that benefit the host (e.g. by synthesizing vitamins or by
      metabolizing toxic waste products). However, some will be pathogenic or have
      the potential to be pathogenic. In addition, the human body is host to a variety of
      different viruses, fungi and protozoa that may cause disease if transmitted to a
      susceptible person. Most pathogens will remain viable for a period of time after
      the host dies. In most cases long-term survival of the pathogen is unlikely, but
      notable exceptions have generated concerns during investigations of burial sites.
      The examination of graves containing the remains of smallpox, cholera, anthrax
      and plague victims, as well as victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic, have
      been subject to rigorous controls to prevent the potential dispersal of the
      pathogen from the burial site.
      One of the main agents in decomposition (putrefaction) is Clostridium
      perfringens. These bacteria spread along blood vessels causing haemolysis,
      proteolysis and gas formation in blood and other tissues. The liquids produced
      through putrefaction contain a high density of microorganisms. Very few
      studies have been carried out on the microbiology of human putrefaction. Corry
      (1978), published a catalogue of bacterial species that have been isolated from
      human cadavers; some of the species listed are pathogenic. These liquids can
       Waste disposal and landfill: Potential hazards and information needs                343

    migrate down into the water table, particularly as coffins and caskets are not
    water tight and are liable to decay. Microbial contaminants that may result from
    the decomposition of cadavers include Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp.,
    Enterobacteriacae spp., faecal streptococci, Clostridium spp., Helicobacter
    pylori, enteroviruses, rotavirus, calicivirus, and F-specific RNA phage.
    Spongberg and Becks (2000) list potential chemicals that can be released from
    cemeteries. These include arsenic and mercury (embalming and burial
    practices), formaldehyde (embalming, varnishes, sealers and preservatives) as
    well as lead, zinc and copper (coffins). Spongberg and Becks (2000) also
    discuss investigations in Ohio where increases in zinc, copper and lead in the
    soil at a large cemetery were observed. Significant increases in arsenic were
    thought to indicate contamination from embalming fluids or wood
    preservatives.
    There are several historical accounts of pollution of water wells in the vicinity of
    cemeteries (e.g. Teale, 1881), but few recent studies of the microbial impact of
    cemeteries on groundwater (West et al., 1998). An analysis of groundwater
    quality beneath an active cemetery in the United Kingdom provided evidence
    that confirms the risk to groundwater, although no pathogens or viruses were
    isolated. The impacts on groundwater of three cemeteries in Sao Paulo and
    Santos, Brazil have been monitored by Pacheco et al. (1991), by installing
    piezometers throughout each of the cemetery sites. One cemetery is situated on
    Tertiary sediments, 4-12 m above the water table, one is on weathered granite,
    4-9 m above the water table, and the third is on Quaternary sandy marine
    sediments, 0.6-2.2 m above the water table. Contamination of the piezometers
    by faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and sulphite reducing clostridia was
    found to be widespread throughout all of the cemeteries. Thus assessing
    groundwater pollution potential clearly needs to include the potential for
    pathogens from cemeteries, particularly from large cemeteries.
    Although the above considerations are valid for long-term permanent situations,
    it is generally accepted that corpses in situations of disaster do not constitute a
    major health hazard. When a disaster strikes a community, authorities should
    prioritise their actions to attend to the injured and the displaced. The risk of
    deaths and epidemics due to unattended dead bodies is far smaller than the risk
    of deaths and diseases due to lack of sufficient food, shelter, drinking water,
    sanitation and basic medical care. Evidence obtained from emergency
    operations would indicate that in the majority of the cases the dead bodies do
    not pose an appreciable risk for public health in areas where there are no
    endemic diseases (Üçisik and Rushbrook, 1998; Western, 2004).

   The rate at which waste is generated corresponds roughly with levels of income. In
high income countries of Europe and North America between 500 and 750 kg of solid
waste are produced per person per year (OECD, 1997). In contrast, urban populations in
most low income countries, for example in Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, generate between
100 and 200 kg of solid waste per person per year (Attahi, 1999; Onibokun and Kumuyi,
1999). Despite this lower rate, rapid urbanization, particularly in low income developing
344                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

countries, has left little space for disposal of the increasing amounts of waste material
being generated in urban settings (Sangodoyin, 1993). As a result, uncontrolled disposal
(i.e. fly tipping) is rife in many countries, and is a diffuse source of groundwater
contamination.


12.2      WASTE STORAGE, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL
          SITES
The processes of storage, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of wastes all have
the potential to pollute the environment and particularly groundwater due to uncontrolled
migration of fluids (leachate) derived from the wastes. In addition to the potential for
groundwater pollution at sites where wastes are produced and stored prior to collection,
sites associated with the treatment and disposal of wastes, where leachate may be
generated include:
    • landfills (both controlled as sanitary landfill or uncontrolled as open dumps)
    • scrap-yards
    • cemeteries
    • waste collection and processing facilities
    • composting facilities.
    For situation assessment, landfills are most readily identified with the pollution of
groundwater by waste-derived liquids. However, any site where waste is concentrated,
processed (e.g. recycled) and stored even for a short period of time may be a potential
point source of groundwater contamination. Such processing facilities are often not well
regulated or licensed and frequently occur in urban or semi-urban settings, where local
water supply points may be impacted by these activities. An inventory of these locations,
the types of waste handled and management processes for waste products will aid in the
assessment of the polluting capability of such sites.
    For situation assessment, a critical criterion in estimating potential groundwater
pollution from waste disposal is the siting of all of the above mentioned waste treatment
and disposal facilities, particularly sanitary landfills and open dumps (discussed in
Sections 12.3.2 and 12.3.3). Most modern landfills in high to medium income countries
require licenses to operate (see Chapter 24.2), and must be engineered to prevent
groundwater pollution. This generally involves lining the site with an artificial lining
system, but liners leak and degrade with time (Chapter 24.3). Even if the site is well
engineered and managed with an artificial lining system installed and even if or the waste
materials are inert, leachate, which may have the potential to pollute groundwater, will be
produced. It is therefore essential to assess the capacity of the underlying geology to
protect groundwater in the event of liner failure. The likelihood of disposed wastes
polluting groundwater depends on the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the
attenuation capacity of the overburden (i.e. any loose unconsolidated material which
overlies solid bedrock) underlying the site, and also on the total and effective
precipitation at the site, since the quantity and concentration of leachate generated is a
function of the access of water to the waste. Thus the potential for pollution of
groundwater will be least at sites carefully selected to take advantage of the most
favourable geological/ hydrogeological conditions.
        Waste disposal and landfill: Potential hazards and information needs               345

    Historic landfills (dumps) were generally not subject to the regulations governing
modern landfills, and were usually sited for convenience, such as the presence of a pre-
existing hole into which the waste could be deposited. The general assumption that an
aftercare period of 30 years is adequate to allow for degradation of waste to an inert state,
is now being questioned, with recent studies (Hjelmar et al., 1995; Wall and Zeiss, 1995;
Kruempelbeck and Ehlrig, 1999; Röhrs et al., 2000; Fourie and Morris, 2003) suggesting
that waste may remain active for many decades and even hundreds of years, particularly
under moisture-deficient conditions. This includes not only landfills from regions where
evaporation exceeds precipitation, but also all lined and capped landfills employing the
concept of dry entombment of waste.
    In the past, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes were not distinguished so that
hazardous substances may be stored in all of these landfills. For situation assessment, it is
important to locate all waste disposal sites in the drinking-water catchment, including
both currently operating landfills, and historic dumps, now closed and covered over (see
Chapter 24). Assessment of all landfills, but in particular historic landfills, should include
age and type of waste, underlying geology, most importantly type and thickness of
overburden and thickness of the unsaturated zone. The state of degradation of the waste
can be ascertained by analysing the leachate and landfill gases generated, as degradation
of waste follows a distinctive pattern manifested in well-known and documented
compositional variations in liquid and gaseous emissions. All of this, together with the
proximity of all of these sites to sources of drinking-water, can determine the threat to
public health posed by waste disposal.


12.3       FACTORS GOVERNING CONTAMINATION OF
           GROUNDWATER BY DISPOSAL OF WASTE
Waste deposited in landfills or in refuse dumps immediately becomes part of the
prevailing hydrological system. Fluids derived from rainfall, snowmelt and groundwater,
together with liquids generated by the waste itself through processes of hydrolysis and
solubilization, brought about by a whole series of complex biochemical reactions during
degradation of organic wastes, percolate through the deposit and mobilize other
components within the waste. The resulting leachate, subsequently migrates from the
landfill or dump and has the potential to contaminate local groundwater either through
direct infiltration on site or by infiltration of leachate-laden runoff off-site. The risk posed
to groundwater-fed drinking-water sources by waste disposal in landfills or dumps can
be considered in terms of three controls:
    • waste composition and loading
    • leachate production
    • leachate migration – attenuation and dilution.

12.3.1 Waste composition and loading
The composition and volume of disposed wastes vary nationally and regionally in
relation to the local human activities, and the quantity and type of products that
communities consume (Table 12.1). Discarded waste in lower income areas is typically
346                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

rich in food-related waste, i.e. organic (carbon-rich) substances (Table 12.1). Although
such waste is not in itself toxic, decomposition of organic matter can alter the
physicochemical quality of groundwater and enhance the mobility of hazardous
chemicals including metals and solvents (see Section 12.3.2). The proportion of
manufactured (e.g. paper) and potentially hazardous (e.g. textiles, metals, plastics) wastes
increases in relation to income and degree of industrialization (Table 12.1), and waste
disposal leachate from highly industrialized settings may contain a wide range of
anthropogenic contaminants (see Section 12.3.2). The types of hazardous substances
likely to occur in discarded waste may be assessed from the types of industry, small-scale
enterprise and other human activity of a particular area.

    A major concern in many countries is also of waste import, particularly of hazardous
wastes. Export from industrialized countries to low-income countries circumvents strict
waste disposal regulations implemented in the country generating these wastes. Often
this is highly organized, as informal, though illegal, transactions between an exporter and
importer using false documentation (e.g. Mackenzie, 1989). Such waste export/import
practices are difficult to detect, but important for situation assessment as disposal of such
wastes is likely to pose a risk of groundwater contamination. It is therefore often
necessary to collect information on both formal and informal (i.e. illegal) waste
composition and loading.
    Landfilled refuse is rich in microorganisms. Mature sites may be compared to large
bioreactors in which the organic content of the waste is decomposed anaerobically. Most
of the organisms that carry out these processes are harmless saprophytes. An analysis of
household waste in the United Kingdom showed that over 4 per cent of the waste
comprised disposable nappies (diapers) of which about one-third may be soiled with
faeces. Domestic waste also contains bloodstained materials, such as sanitary pads,
tampons and discarded wound dressings, and animal wastes, such as dog faeces and
soiled cat litter. The potential for pathogens within this mixture of sources is extremely
high. Pathogens may also be transported to landfill sites by vermin (rats) and other
scavengers, in particular seagulls.
    The fate of pathogens in landfill sites is not understood. Although it is generally
assumed that most are rapidly inactivated by the conditions that prevail in the landfill
       Waste disposal and landfill: Potential hazards and information needs            347

environment, the potential of leachate and runoff from landfill sites to transport
pathogens into local water resources should be addressed in situation assessment.

12.3.2 Leachate production
Most waste deposited in landfills is not inert. Degradation of many components of waste
including food, paper and textiles consumes oxygen thereby changing the redox potential
of the liquid present and potentially influencing mobility of other constituents. Plastics,
glass and metal compounds tend to be less reactive and degrade more slowly. Under
some conditions, metals may, however, become rapidly mobilized (see Chapter 4).
    Percolating rainwater provides a medium in which waste, particularly organics, can
undergo degradation into simpler substances through a range of biochemical reactions
involving dissolution, hydrolysis, oxidation and reduction, processes controlled to a large
extent within landfills and dumps by microorganisms, primarily bacteria. Table 12.1
indicates that the largest fraction of disposed waste is organic matter (e.g. food, paper),
which has a well-documented degradation path. Mechanisms regulating mass transfer
from wastes to leaching water, from which leachate originates, can be divided into three
groups of processes:
     • hydrolysis of solid waste and biological degradation;
     • solubilization of soluble salts contained in the waste;
     • suspension of particulate matter.
    The first two groups of processes, which have the greatest influence on the
composition of leachate produced, are associated with the stabilization of waste.
    Initially, organic matter in the form of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, is decomposed
under aerobic conditions (i.e. oxidized), through a series of hydrolysis reactions, to form
carbon dioxide and water together with nitrates and sulphates via a number of
intermediate products such as amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol. Such oxidation
reactions are exothermic, so temperatures in the landfill become elevated. Carbon
dioxide is released as a gas or is dissolved in water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) which
subsequently dissociates to yield the bicarbonate anion (HCO3-) at near neutral pH.
    Aerobic decomposition of organic matter depletes the waste deposit of oxygen (O2) as
buried waste in the landfill or refuse dump becomes compacted and circulation of air is
inhibited. As oxygen becomes depleted, it is replaced as the oxidizing agent by, in
succession, nitrate (NO3-), manganese (as MnO2), iron (as Fe(OH)3) and sulphate (SO42-).
In general, the aerobic stage is short, no substantial volumes of leachate are produced,
and aerobic conditions are rapidly replaced by anaerobic conditions. The main stages of
anaerobic digestion are (i) acetogenic (acid) fermentation, (ii) intermediate anaerobiosis,
and (iii) methanogenic fermentation, all three of which can be operating simultaneously
in different parts of the landfill.
    Acetogenic fermentation brings about a decrease in leachate pH, high concentrations
of volatile acids and considerable concentrations of inorganic ions (e.g. Cl-, SO42-, Ca2+,
Mg2+, Na+). As the redox potential drops, sulphate is slowly reduced, generating
sulphides, which may precipitate iron, manganese and heavy metals that are dissolved by
the acid fermentation. Decrease in pH is due to production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
and to high partial pressures of carbon dioxide (CO2), whilst the increased concentrations
348                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

of anions and cations results from leaching (lixiviation) of easily soluble organic material
present in the waste mass. Breakdown of organic material reduces the redox potential to
<330mV, which allows the next stage of the process to become initiated. Leachate from
this phase is characterized by high values of biological oxygen demand (BOD)
(commonly >10 000 mg/l), high BOD5/COD ratios (commonly >0.7), acidic pH values
(typically 5-6) and ammonia (NH3) due to hydrolysis and fermentation in particular of
proteins.
    Intermediate anaerobiosis commences with a gradual increase in the methane (CH4)
concentration in the gas, coupled with a decrease in H2, CO2 and VFAs. Conversion of
the VFAs leads to an increase in pH values and to alkalinity, with a consequent decrease
in the solubility of calcium, iron manganese and the heavy metals, which are probably
precipitated as sulphides. Ammonia is released but is not converted to nitrate in such an
anaerobic environment.
    Methanogenic fermentation, the final stage in the degradation of organic wastes,
operates within the extremely limited pH range of 6-8. At this stage in the degradation
process, the composition of leachate is characterized by almost neutral pH, and low
concentrations of volatile acids and TDS, indicating that solubilization of the majority of
organic components is almost complete, although waste stabilization will continue for
several decades. The biogas being produced has a methane content of generally >50 per
cent, whilst ammonia continues to be released by the acetogenic process. Leachate
produced at this stage is characterized by relatively low BOD values, and low ratios of
BOD/COD.
    Degradation processes convert nitrogen into a reduced form (ammonium), and bring
about mobilization of manganese and iron and also liberation of hydrogen sulphide gas.
Production of methane indicates strongly reducing conditions with a redox potential in
the order -400 mV. Unlike carbon dioxide, methane is poorly soluble in water.
    Due to the decomposition of organic matter, leachate derived from landfills or dumps
comprises primarily DOC (Table 12.2), largely in the form of fulvic acids (Christensen et
al., 1998). The solubility of metals in leachate is enhanced through complexation by
dissolved organic matter. The solubility of organic contaminants in waste may also be
slightly enhanced through the presence of high levels of organic carbon in leachate. The
range of organic compounds that may be found in groundwater affected by landfill
leachate is shown in Box 12.3 and Table 12.3. Hydrophobic compounds may be
mobilized through leachate, as they adsorb to organic carbon in solution. For example,
benzene- and naphthalene-sulphonates comprise between 1-30 per cent of the DOC in
landfill-leachates analysed in Switzerland (Riediker et al., 2000).

        Box 12.3. Organic contaminants in groundwater affected by landfill
                              leachate in Germany
    A study investigating groundwater from 250 different municipal waste
    sites in Western Germany (Kerndorff et al., 1992) identified a wide range
    of organic contaminants within 10-100 m downgradient of the deposit,
    some of which occurred in a large number of samples and attained
    concentrations well into the range of mg/l (Table 12.3). Benzene and its
    alkyl derivatives (four compounds) constitute the majority of the seven
    non-halogenated contaminants. The highest mean concentration was
    obtained for volatile halogenous substances, predominantly for
    dichloromethane (DCM) (≈ 38 mg/l), cis-1,2-DCE (≈ 22 mg/l), VC (≈ 1.7
    mg/l), and trichloroethene (TCE) (≈ 1 mg/l). The high concentrations
    associated with these VOC confirm the significance of this class of
    substances as major emissions from waste disposal sites

12.3.3 Leachate migration
In unsealed landfills above an aquifer, waters percolating through landfills and refuse
dumps often accumulate or mound within or below the landfill (Figure 12.1). This is due
to production of leachate by degradation processes operating within the waste, in
addition to the rainwater percolating down through the waste. The increased hydraulic
       Waste disposal and landfill: Potential hazards and information needs          351

head developed promotes downward and outward flow of leachate from the landfill or
dump. Downward flow from the landfill threatens underlying groundwater resources
whereas outward flow can result in leachate springs yielding water of a poor, often
dangerous, quality at the periphery of the waste deposit. Observation of leachate springs
or poor water quality in adjacent wells/boreholes are indicators that leachate is being
produced and is moving. Leachate springs represent a significant risk to public health, so
their detection in situation assessment is critical in order to prevent access to such
springs.




Figure 12.1. Conceptual diagram of leachate migration from a landfill (Freeze and Cherry,
1979; reprinted by permission of Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ)

    One method used to reduce the generation of leachate and, hence, hydraulic heads
generating flow from a closed landfill is to place a capping of low permeability material
(e.g. clay or high density polyethethylene) over the waste deposit in order to reduce
infiltration of rainwater. These should be recorded in situation assessment because if a
landfill is capped to impede rainwater ingress, reducing leachate volumes, a more
concentrated leachate will be generated. Also, microbial and biochemical reactions will
be inhibited thereby prolonging the degradation process and the activity of the waste
possibly for decades or even centuries. Groundwater pollution potential from older
capped landfills may therefore be higher than from younger, open landfills.
    Leachate migration is also affected by the manner in which waste is deposited.
Compaction of waste prior to deposition reduces its permeability, whereas regular
application of a topsoil cover between the loading of waste to landfills induces layering.
These characteristics inevitably give rise to preferential flow paths through landfills.
Johnson et al. (1998) found, for instance, that residence times for rainwater entering a
landfill varied from a period of a few days to several years. This is reflected in the
frequently temporal nature of leachate springs, which can appear in wet seasons but
subsequently disappear in dry seasons to leave patches of discoloured soil (Jefferis,
1993). Inspections of potential leachate production should, therefore, focus on periods
towards the end of wet seasons or following excessive rainfall events. Further, situation
assessment needs to account for uncertainties in both the prediction and monitoring of
leachate migration from landfills and dumps, in consequence of the complex
352                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

hydrogeology of waste deposits. This is further addressed in Chapter 24 in relation to
problems of planning and management.
    Despite the complexity of leachate migration through landfills, fundamental aspects
of subsurface contaminant transport, reviewed in Section 12.4, can practically be applied
to the movement of leachate-derived contaminants from a landfill or refuse dump. These
include the thickness of the unsaturated zone, the permeability and moisture content of
the earth materials within the unsaturated zone, and the hydraulic conductivity and local
hydraulic gradient of geological units in the saturated zone. Poorly conductive units
underlying the landfill or refuse dump, e.g. clay-rich material or the presence of an
installed artificial liner inhibit leachate migration. On the other hand, discontinuities such
as fissures and joints in the subsurface or faults or holes in a liner, dramatically increase
leachate flow. For situation assessments, access to hydrogeological information (see
Chapter 8) as well as information on design and condition of potentially installed lining
system (see also Chapter 24) from both beneath and downstream of landfills, is vital.
    Equally important as understanding the magnitude and direction of leachate flow is
recognition of the significant biochemical changes that occur, as strongly reducing
leachate (redox potential <-100 mV), mixes with shallow underlying groundwater, which
is mildly to strongly oxidizing (redox potential >+100 mV). These changes, illustrated in
Figure 12.2 represent a reversal of the reducing reactions which take place in the landfill,
and give rise to a series of redox zones in the leachate plume adjacent to the landfill in the
reverse order to the sequence described in Section 12.3.2. The leachate plume thus
becomes less reducing and organic carbon in the leachate is rapidly oxidized to CO2
through contact with oxygenated groundwater.
    The leachate plume undergoes continuous transition in the direction of groundwater
flow (Figures 12.2 and 12.3) until conditions are reached where it is no longer anaerobic,
and attains redox levels identical to background levels in the aquifer. In this transition
zone, chemically reduced species such as methane and ammonia disappear, and aqueous
nitrogen and sulphur are converted into their oxidized forms of nitrate and sulphate
respectively. Iron is oxidized and precipitates as hydrous iron oxide, whereas in contrast,
manganese, which is soluble over a wider range of electrochemical (i.e. redox)
conditions, remains in solution longer (i.e. travels further with the leachate plume).
Consequently, analysis for these compounds and comparison with background levels
elsewhere in the aquifer can indicate the presence and extent of the plume. Significantly,
a number of detailed studies of leachate plumes indicate that they rarely extend more
than a few hundred metres from the landfill before all but a handful of the most persistent
contaminants are completely attenuated (e.g. Christensen et al., 1994: Robinson et al.,
1999). To determine the vertical extent of the plume often multiple depth sampling
boreholes are required as indicated in Figure 12.3.
    Migration of reactive constituents in leachate, such as microorganisms, organic
solvents and metals, is inhibited through biochemical reactions in the plume (e.g.
precipitation, volatilization), and by the interaction of these constituents with the
geological materials forming the aquifer matrix (e.g. adsorption, cation exchange), as
discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. These processes reduce contaminant concentrations in
local groundwater by removing contaminants from solution.

landfill, and the distribution of redox-sensitive species along a streamline in the plume

   Concentrations of unreactive (i.e. conservative) species in leachate can, however, only
be reduced through dispersion and dilution. The extent to which dilution can reduce the
concentrations of waste-derived contaminants in the leachate plume adjacent to the
landfill or dump, depends upon the magnitude of both groundwater and leachate flows,
together with the relative concentrations of contaminants in both the leachate and in the
natural groundwaters of the aquifer upstream of the landfill (see Section 12.4).
   As leachate migrates from a waste deposit in the direction of groundwater flow, the
plume disperses (i.e. spreads due to differing contaminant flow paths and flow
velocities), and also diffuses through the aquifer. Concentrations of both reactive and
conservative contaminants decrease with distance along the groundwater flow path
(Figure 12.3). It should, however, be recognized that exceptions to this general trend
354                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

occur when a contaminant is transformed into a more toxic compound, as occurs in the
dehalogenation of perchloroethylene/tetrachloroethene (PCE) to TCE. It should be noted
that the concentration of a pollutant at any point removed from its source may vary
throughout the year due to seasonal influences on recharge and release of the
contaminant, or reaction times governed by variations in factors such as temperature.

12.4       ASSESSING GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION
           ASSOCIATED WITH WASTE SITES
The checklist below provides guidance on how to approach assessing the likelihood of
groundwater contamination through wastes and landfills found in a given drinking-water
catchment. Much information for estimating pollution potential can be gleaned from
amounts and types of wastes deposited, site management and site location in relation to
aquifer vulnerability. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 8, this approach is not always easy,
as the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient are crucially dependent on whether
the aquifer has an intergranular or fissure permeability. Flow velocity can be several
orders of magnitude higher in the latter. Also different contaminants may migrate at
different velocities.
    A number of countries use drinking-water protection zone concepts (Chapter 17) to
delineate boundaries within which activities such as waste disposal are banned. Their
delineation faces the same problems of understanding the hydrology of the setting.
However, where protection zones exist, they are valuable for situation assessment which
would begin with checking implementation (i.e. whether waste disposal is indeed being
kept outside of the protection zone). Also, reviewing the information basis for their
        Waste disposal and landfill: Potential hazards and information needs            355

delineation will help to understand both the hydrogeological setting as well as the quality
of the information base available for determining aquifer vulnerability.
    Where hydrogeological understanding is poor and means to improve it are limited, a
default approach to assessing pollution potential from wastes is to investigate distances
between waste disposal and drinking-water abstraction, and to assess the potential hazard
on the basis of the current general body of knowledge on landfill leachate plume
attenuation and migration. A number of studies monitoring unlined landfills in operation
before the advent of containment landfills have been ongoing over the past 20 years (e.g.
Christensen et al., 1994; Blight, 1995; Robinson et al., 1999; Williams, 1999; Williams
et al., 1999; Ball and Novella, 2003; Butler et al., 2003). These show that leachate
plumes do not usually exceed a length of 1000 m, even in fast-flowing aquifers over
periods in excess of 50 years after the initial wastes were deposited, and even within
geological media with supposedly poor attenuation potential, such as sandy overburden.
The processes of degradation and attenuation operating within the plume result in the
front of the plume becoming stationary as degradation processes keep pace with. The
migration of plume, and most pollutants, even complex organic compounds, degrade
rapidly within the plume and are attenuated within a few hundred metres (Christensen et
al., 1995; Hancock et al., 1995).
    In the process of developing a GIS model for landfill site selection (Allen et al.,
2001), a survey of buffering distances used in various site selection criteria indicated that
for individual dwellings with their own water wells in rural areas, a distance of 500 m
was widely used, and except in extreme cases this would constitute a safe distance from a
landfill for a water abstraction point. This distance could be reduced considerably on the
upstream side of the landfill, if the direction of groundwater flow is known. Similarly,
studies of leachate plumes (Christensen et al., 1994) indicate that they do not tend to
exceed the width of the landfill, so the plume does not fan out from the landfill in the
direction of groundwater flow. Where hydrogeological information is available, such as
the type of aquifer, groundwater flow direction and flow velocity, considerably smaller
buffer distances of the order of 100-200 m would be adequate on the upstream and lateral
sides of the landfill. On the whole, when assessing whether a landfill is safely distant
from a water abstraction point, a distance of 500 m would in most cases be adequate,
whilst a distance of 1000 m would be extremely conservative.
    In contrast to many other human activities which cause diffuse groundwater pollution
potential, landfill concentrates this to point sources. This facilitates assessing their
pollution potential through screening and monitoring programmes which do not
necessitate sophisticated chemical analyses of the wide range of potentially occurring
pollutants, but rather select a few persistent substances, such as NH3 and Cl, to detect and
characterize leachate plume migration. Such an approach reflects the major influence that
landfill leachate can exert on the abundance and concentration of individual substances
present in groundwater. This is primarily valid for organic contaminants, which are
almost exclusively anthropogenic, their presence in groundwater often indicating the
influence of a waste site, but it is also valid for naturally occurring inorganic groundwater
constituents, the content of which is increased by landfill leachate. Leachate migration
can therefore be assessed by analysing the concentrations of common inorganic
parameters in groundwater downgradient from a landfill in relation to their
356                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

concentrations in groundwater sampled sufficiently upgradient, i.e. where it is not
influenced by the landfill-derived contamination.
    In order to rank the impact on groundwater of the leachate migrating from a landfill,
Kerndorff et al. (1992) use a cf, representing the ratio of the measured concentration in
the groundwater 10-100 m downgradient of the landfill to the concentration in the
uncontaminated groundwater upgradient of the site. If the site is not leaking, or if the
substance measured is not involved in the leakage event, the ratio should be 1.0.
However, if the substance is leaking from the site, the ratio will increase to a value
greater than 1.0. Thus the larger the leakage event, the larger the resultant cf. This
approach identifies specific inorganic substances (those with the highest mean cfs) likely
to be associated with landfill leakage events and therefore suitable for the indication of
groundwater contaminations caused by landfills. In the above example, they proved to be
the following: arsenic with a cfmean of 122, ammonium with 65.5, cadmium with 26.9,
nitrite with 25.7, boron with 21.6, chromium with cfmean of 15.8, and nickel with 14.8.
However, in using this approach it must be remembered that substances with high cfs are
not necessarily those with the highest hazard potential nor those with the highest loads.
They merely indicate the potential occurrence of groundwater contamination from a
landfill with high loads of substances which may be hazardous due to their toxicity
and/or persistency if they move through the aquifer towards a water supply.


12.5      CHECKLIST

   NOTE X           The following checklist outlines information needed for characte-
                    rizing waste disposal and landfill activities in the drinking-water
                    catchment area. It supports hazard analysis in the context of
                    developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16). It is neither complete
                    nor designed as template for direct use but needs to be specially
                    adapted for local conditions. The analysis of the potential of
                    groundwater pollution from human activity requires combining the
                    checklist below with information about socioeconomic conditions
                    (Chapter 7), aquifer pollution vulnerability (Chapter 8), and other
                    specific polluting activities in the catchment area (Chapters 9-11
                    and 13).

Traffic and transport: Potential
hazards and information needs
A. Golwer and R. Sage




Vehicles and traffic routes are a widespread potential source of groundwater
contamination. In some countries, economic development is currently swiftly leading to
rapid increase of motorization and concomitant increases in pollution. Impacts on human
health through contaminants in groundwater from traffic are generally substantially
lower than the direct health effects through, for example, injuries and deaths in accidents,
air pollution, noise and stress.


   NOTE X            Traffic and transport related activities and the environment in
                     which they take place vary greatly. Health hazards arising
                     from traffic and transport related activities and their potential
                     to pollute groundwater therefore need to be analysed
                     specifically for the conditions in a given setting. The
                     information in this chapter supports hazard analysis in the
                     context of developing a Water Safety Plan for a given water
                     supply (Chapter 16). Options for controlling these risks are
                     introduced in Chapter 25.

     Traffic associated operations and facilities to recognize in situation assessments
  include roads, airfields, railway lines, inland waterway transportation (rivers, lakes,
  canals) where surface water strongly influences groundwater, as well as pipelines for
  crude oil and oil derivatives (Figure 13.1).

  Figure 13.1. Most important groundwater contamination pathways from traffic and transport

     A range of emissions of organic and inorganic substances from traffic settings may
  reach soils, sediments from drainage systems or surface waters via both water and air.
  Some of these may partly reach groundwater. The sources of groundwater pollution from
  the four traffic sectors may be classified according to types of traffic as well as different
  aspects of activity related to traffic, as outlined in Figure 13.2.
     In addition to traffic routes as linear sources of emissions, transport installations and
  facilities, especially petrol stations, railway stations, airfields, inland harbours, car scrap
  yards and abandoned vehicles, may be substantial point sources of groundwater
  pollution. In some regions vehicle traffic, fuel storage and spills through accidents have
  been identified as important sources of traffic-related contaminants in groundwater.


  13.1               GROUNDWATER POLLUTANTS FROM TRAFFIC
  The volume of traffic obviously has a significant influence on the quantity and type of
  traffic-related pollution. Average daily traffic volume is an appropriate criterion for
  classifying roads in categories with different levels of potential pollution risk. Golwer
  (1991) proposes a classification of risk ranging from low (less than 2000 vehicles per
  day) to high (more than 15,000 vehicles per day). The traffic-related substance groups
  most frequently polluting groundwater are mineral oil products (including fuel additives
  such as methyl tertiary-butyl ether; MTBE), in many cases herbicides, and in specific
  situations heavy metals and de-icing agents.
           Traffic and transport: Potential hazards and information needs             365




        Figure 13.2. Traffic sectors and potential groundwater pollution sources

   The condition and technical design of the traffic related infrastructure are critical in
determining their pollution potential. Issues for situation assessment include assessing
whether this infrastructure was designed to prevent or minimize pollution as well as
whether or not maintenance and repair are conducted regularly. For instance, oil
separators that have become full of grit will no longer work. Porous pavement materials
may aid in minimizing direct runoff, but could carry pollutants directly to vulnerable
groundwater sources. Other issues to consider in situation assessment are whether
containment features are in use on transfer and fuelling locations, for example, how
sewerage is moved from ships and trains to a point of treatment, whether there is a
possibility of spillage and where such spillage would end up.
   The input of dissolved mineral oil hydrocarbons – and of their decomposition
products – into groundwater is dependent on the biological half-life of individual
366                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

substances as well as climate and time of year. On busy roads in winter, in areas where
the unsaturated zone provides little protection, mineral oil hydrocarbons have caused
substantial groundwater contamination. Mineral oil hydrocarbons affect groundwater not
only along roads, but particularly around petrol stations, airfields and railway stations.
Accidents involving the transport of mineral oil and leaking long-distance pipelines
(Morganwalp, 1994) have resulted in heavy local contamination, and have also affected
groundwater quality through reduction in oxygen content (Schwille, 1976). Further,
accident responses involving large volumes of water for extinguishing fires or removing
contaminants may increase contaminant transport to the aquifer. Other contaminant
sources such as abraded particles from tyres as well as exhaust gas and evaporation
losses, generally have a low impact on groundwater though they may be re-deposited on
soil surfaces and leached into the soil.
    In addition to these fuel-derived contaminants, anti-knock agents have been widely
detected in groundwater. These include lead and later MTBE and toluene which have
replaced lead since the 1970s in the USA and later also in Europe. These are highly
water-soluble and have been widely reported as pollutants related to accidental spillages
and leaks from filling stations. Their health-relevance is briefly discussed in Chapter 4.
Further, they serve as suitable tracers for traffic-related contamination.
    For traffic safety on roads and airfields at temperatures below freezing, de-icing
agents are widely employed. On roads, de-icing salts (mainly sodium chloride and lower
levels of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride) have been used widely since the
beginning of the 20th century. These are particularly found to be polluting in rural areas
where roads are drained to soakaways. Whilst chloride itself is not a health hazard, its
presence can be an indicator of other pollution from traffic. However, with greatly
increased chloride concentrations, the mobility of zinc and cadmium can be increased
through the formation of chloro-complexes (Bauske and Goetz, 1993).
    On airports, nitrogenous de-icing agents, e.g. urea, have been employed since the mid
1970s. This has led to local high nitrate concentrations in groundwater and in some cases
has required extensive remediation measures. Degradation of nitrate may produce nitrite
and also ammonium. In the 1990s, non-nitrogenous agents (sodium and potassium
acetates and formates) increasingly replaced nitrogenous de-icing agents. Propylene
glycol and diethylene glycol are used for de-icing aircraft, which if not properly
contained can also lead to pollution of both surface and groundwaters. In climates with
frost, situation assessment should include airports as areas potentially contaminated not
only with fuel, but also with de-icing agents.
    Training areas for fire fighting on airports may give rise to special cases of pollution,
especially if drainage from the area is not contained properly and not removed for
treatment. The use of chemicals to aid in fire fighting and the large volumes of water
involved can lead to contamination of the surrounding area. Even if the fire training areas
are connected to a sewer system, leakage from this system and spray drift from the area
can result in localized contamination of the soil and underlying aquifers. The associated
chemicals will depend on the type of fire extinguisher agents used. Carbon
tetrachloride/tetrachloromethane (CTC) and anionic synthetic detergents are frequent
pollutants from such operations.
           Traffic and transport: Potential hazards and information needs                367

   Railways, roads, parking lots and airports are sometimes kept clear of vegetation with
repeated herbicide application. These have been detected in groundwater in their original
form or as degradation products. The quantity of herbicide used at traffic facilities per
unit area is often higher than in agriculture, and herbicides can swiftly enter surface
waters and groundwater through drainage systems (Schweinsberg et al., 1999). This
organic substance group therefore poses a pronounced and widespread contamination
hazard for groundwater, which is frequently unrecognized due to lack of targeted
investigations. The substances used, e.g. atrazine (now banned in some European
countries), diuron and bromacile may be alternated to avoid plant resistance to the active
ingredient. In the United Kingdom, lengths of railway track crossing catchment areas for
public supply boreholes, and draining to critical stretches of rivers, have been identified
as potential sources of pollution.
   Heavy metals specifically emitted from traffic are lead, cadmium, chromium, copper,
nickel and zinc. Among these, generally even from sites with heavy traffic volume, only
zinc and copper intermittently reach groundwater in amounts causing considerably
increased concentrations, although a wider range may occur. In the groundwater
downgradient of a basin collecting and infiltrating runoff from a very busy motorway
(daily average of 125 560 vehicles in 1995) into porous soils since 1973, many
substances were found in elevated concentrations as compared to upstream (Golwer,
1999). Even if concentrations are below levels hazardous to human health, their increase
indicates a pollution pathway and the need for due regard to spillages and other releases.


13.2       TRAFFIC- AND TRANSPORT-RELATED
           ACTIVITIES POLLUTING GROUNDWATER
In addition to traffic and transport itself, construction and maintenance of transport
associated facilities may cause considerable pollution of groundwater (Figure 13.2).
Construction of transport lines and sites (including airports and harbours as well as roads,
railways and canals) can change flowpaths and percolation patterns by relocating soil. It
can lead to pollution through injuring the protective layers above the aquifer, as well as
through construction activity. Refuelling and associated spillage often cause localized
contamination and in sensitive areas construction of such refuelling points should be
assessed for leakage and spillage. In addition to accidental spillages on the route line
there may also be pollution from provisional quarters for construction workers,
particularly with human excreta. As these are often only temporary facilities, they may
not be subject to the same level of scrutiny or assessment as a permanent installation.
Siting of such construction compounds should be subject to pollution risk assessments
and adequate mitigation measures implemented.
    Maintenance measures with the potential to cause pollution may include washing of
tunnel surfaces which produces runoff with high contaminant concentrations, or
detergents used in cleaning traffic signs. Other facilities such as refuelling depots, filling
stations, car wash facilities, roadside cafes and service stations all have the potential to
pollute groundwater. In vulnerable sites, situation assessment includes checking whether
368                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

they are constructed properly, e.g. with spillage and runoff containment and adequate
treatment.
    Major pollution incidents have resulted from leakage from underground storage tanks
and pipelines. These may not be detected for some time and once detected can require a
significant amount of remedial action to clear up the pollution. In most cases, fuel
products do not move very far from the point of pollution (at low field velocities less than
100 m) unless a preferential pathway is available. However, dissolved compounds and
degradation by-products can pollute significant volumes of aquifer and be difficult to
remediate. Fuel additives such as MTBE are extremely water soluble and can be detected
in low concentrations over very wide areas.


13.3       PATHWAYS OF POLLUTANTS INTO
           GROUNDWATER
Though vehicle traffic often emits substantial amounts of airborne organic substances
which deposit on the soil surface, it has been shown that this generally results in
negligible impact on groundwater quality, since deposition rates from air are relatively
low and the protective effect of the unsaturated zone results in sufficient reduction of
concentration (Schleyer and Raffius, 2000). Nitrogen oxides from vehicle exhaust
emission, however, contribute considerably to acidification of precipitation in some
areas. Where soils have poor buffering capacity, this pollution can influence particularly
the quality of shallow groundwater by mobilizing metals such as aluminium. Thus
situation assessment may need to include vulnerability to soil acidification and mineral
mobilization in areas with heavy air pollution through traffic.
    Dispersion of traffic-borne pollutants from surfaces into water occurs intermittently
and is strongly linked to rainfall and temperature. Obviously, at temperatures below
freezing, pollutants will not be transported in water. At rainfalls of less than 0.5 mm,
runoff from impermeable traffic-area surfaces generally does not occur. However,
pollutants deposited on surfaces during dry periods or frost accumulate and the first
rainfall or snow melt flushes these into the soil or into runoff collection systems. Most
pollution from traffic routes generally occurs within 10 m of the route, and thus they can
be considered as linear sources.
    Where runoff from paved traffic surfaces is collected in retention basins, these may
themselves be significant sources of groundwater pollution through seepage or leakage.
Beneath infiltration basins percolation may occur either intermittently or continuously,
usually in a vertical direction.
    In the zone of percolation substance dispersion depends on distribution of
precipitation and soil temperature. Because of the filtration effect, particles and particle
adsorbed substances (e.g. platinum, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are largely
retained in the upper centimetres and decimetres of soils. Infiltration rates can be
considerably higher alongside permeable traffic surfaces and on the edge or bottom of
infiltration basins than in adjacent areas with soils and rocks of comparable texture, as the
larger quantity of water per unit of area often leads to increased permeability through
solution and removal of fine particles by the increased velocities. Dead leaf matter can be
           Traffic and transport: Potential hazards and information needs               369

broken up by tyre action and concentrated on the sides of roads, leading to enhanced
leaching of humic acids. Atmospheric deposition of pollutants accumulating on paved
surfaces can also be a pathway for pollutants into the groundwater system.
   Once pollutants reach groundwater, their dispersion and concentration chiefly depend
on substance loading and its characteristics, as well as on the hydrogeological
characteristics in the specific setting, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 4. Substance
characteristics (especially water-solubility, volatility, sorption, as well as biological and
photochemical degradation) are of decisive importance for retention, conversion and
dilution processes during subsoil passage.
   Climatic conditions fundamentally influence substance dispersion and, to some extent
indirectly, substance inventory, as explained above. Climate also determines rates of
degradation (which are frequently temperature-dependent and thus higher in the tropics),
patterns of substance dispersion into groundwater, patterns of dilution and human
activities, such as the extent of application of de-icing agents or herbicides.


13.4       CHECKLIST

   NOTE X            The following checklist outlines information needed for
                     characterizing traffic and transport related activities in the drinking-
                     water catchment area. It supports hazard analysis in the context of
                     developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16). It is neither complete
                     nor designed as a template for direct use but needs to be specially
                     adapted for local conditions. The analysis of the potential of
                     groundwater pollution from human activity requires combination of
                     the checklist below with information about socioeconomic
                     conditions (Chapter 7), aquifer pollution vulnerability (Chapter 8),

Assessment of groundwater pollution
potential
J. Chilton, O. Schmoll and S. Appleyard




Using the knowledge of the regional groundwater conditions and the nature of the human
activities and their possible impacts on groundwater quality provided by Sections I and
II, this chapter describes the assessment of groundwater pollution potential, and
illustrates the approach with two case studies. The intention of the chapter is to indicate
the general scope and scale of what is required to assess groundwater pollution potential,
rather than to provide detailed technical guidance on how it should be done. This more
detailed technical material, aimed more at the practising professional actually carrying
out such an assessment, can be found in, for example, Foster et al. (2002) and Zaporozec
(2002). Chapter 15 builds on this assessment to provide guidance on establishing
groundwater management priorities to reduce the impact of pollution, either by
increasing the protection measures at drinking-water sources (Section IV) or by
controlling pollution sources and the activities causing pollution (Section V).
    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential in a given drinking-water catchment
may be conducted under a wide variety of conditions and at varying spatial scales and
levels of sophistication (Foster and Hirata, 1988). As a result, the assessment can produce
a wide range of outcomes. The conditions may range from simple settings with almost
self-evident identification of one or two key hazards (e.g. high density of poorly sealed
latrines on a shallow aquifer) to highly complex urban and industrial scenarios with

diverse human activities, in which the key sources of pollution are difficult to identify.
This complexity may perhaps be coupled with small-scale variations in geology and
hydrogeological conditions, rendering vulnerability assessments equally demanding.
This broad variation means that assessments of pollution potential can require an equally
broad range of sophistication, ranging from reconnaissance surveys of the major
potential sources of groundwater pollution to detailed surveys of chemical or microbial
pollutant loads and even to simple modelling of, for example, the leaching potential of
pesticides used in the catchment. This implies that experienced professionals from the
hydrogeology and environmental engineering disciplines will normally be needed, both
to help decide on the level of sophistication required, and to undertake the assessment
itself.


   NOTE X            This chapter indicates the general scope and scale of what is
                     required to assess groundwater pollution potential, rather than
                     providing detailed technical guidance on how it should be done. In
                     the context of developing a Water Safety Plan this chapter supports
                     risk assessment for groundwater fed drinking-water supplies.




14.1      THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT PROCESS
Prior to undertaking the assessment of groundwater pollution potential, the first exercise
is to decide upon the area to be protected around the drinking-water source. This may
include the entire extent of the aquifer system in which the source occurs at one extreme,
or may involve delineating the specific catchment or zone of influence of the supply
source or sources in question. This will normally be the hydrogeologically-defined
capture zone from which the recharge is derived, as in the Barbados case study (Section
14.5), or may just be a simple radius around the source. Guidance is given in Chapter 17
on the establishment of such zones. Once the area of investigation has been defined, then
the process described below can be undertaken. However, it is important to note that
groundwater catchments do not always follow surface water catchments and may cross
both local and national administrative political boundaries. Thus selection of the correct
and appropriate area is critical. Near national borders, it may even involve international
discussions and agreements for successful implementation of groundwater protection and
the associated control measures or other management responses.
    In view of the complexity of factors affecting pollutant migration and the uniqueness
of each field situation, it would be logical to treat each activity or source on individual
merit and undertake independent field investigations to assess pollution potential (Foster
and Hirata, 1988). However, because of the high cost of such investigations, simpler but
consistent procedures for assessing pollution potential at modest cost are needed. The
reader should not, therefore, be unduly discouraged by the complexity of
hydrogeological conditions and pollutant behaviour. Using the understanding of the
former gained from Chapters 2 and 8, and of the latter from Chapters 3, 4, and 9 to 13,
                     Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                      377

useful assessments of groundwater pollution potential can be achieved on the basis of
existing information combined with some field reconnaissance.
    As shown in Figure 14.1, the potential for groundwater pollution to occur is
determined by the interaction between the microbial or chemical pollutant loading which
is being, or might be, applied to the subsurface environment as a result of one or more of
the types of human activity described in Chapters 9-13, and the aquifer vulnerability,
which depends on the intrinsic physical characteristics of the soil and strata separating
the aquifer from the land surface, as described in Chapter 8.




Figure 14.1. Groundwater pollution potential (adapted from Foster and Hirata, 1988)

   The factors that define aquifer vulnerability (Chapter 8) are summarized here for
convenience along the horizontal axis of Figure 14.1, and it is the identification and
characterization of the factors that determine pollutant loading on the vertical axis that is
the subject of this chapter.
378                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    The matrix in Figure 14.1 does not assign quantitative scores, but rather depicts a
relative classification of pollution potential, and the components of both pollutant loading
and aquifer vulnerability can have broad ranges from low to high. Thus a combination of
high pollutant loading and high aquifer vulnerability provide the most extreme pollution
potential in the top right corner of the figure. Adopting this approach, it is possible to
envisage situations in which an aquifer is highly vulnerable, but there is little or no
danger of pollution because there is no pollution load, or vice versa. Both are consistent
in practice. The former might occur on an uninhabited coral limestone island, and the
latter where an urban area with many small pollution sources is separated from an
underlying deep aquifer by a thick sequence of impermeable clays or silts.
    Whether the pollution potential derived in this way will be translated into a serious
quality impact producing problems for drinking-water supplies using groundwater will
depend on several factors. These include the mobility and persistence of the pollutants
within the groundwater flow regime and the scope for further dilution in the saturated
zone. The economic and financial scale of the impact will depend on the value of the
groundwater resources affected, including the investment and operating costs in abstract-
ting the water and delivering it to consumers, and the cost of finding alternative supplies,
as well as the broader societal and environmental value of the groundwater where, for
example, there are many small-scale community or private wells and boreholes.
    If the relationship in Figure 14.1 could be fully quantified in probability terms, it
would become a more formal indication of the likelihood that groundwater in an aquifer
would become polluted at concentrations above respective guideline values. While this
may be possible for some diffuse pollution sources such as agriculture and unsewered
sanitation, experience suggests it is much more difficult to quantify microbial and
chemical pollutant loads to groundwater for most point sources. Further, given the
uncertainties about pollutant behaviour outlined below and in Sections I and II, a
qualitative or semi-quantitative assessment of the potential for pollution of groundwater
to occur is, for many settings, the best that situation analysis can achieve. This is,
however, likely to be more than adequate as a basis for initiating consideration of actions
for protecting groundwater, and for focussing more detailed investigation or monitoring
on the activities or sources judged to be the most significant.


14.2       COMPONENTS OF ASSESSMENT OF POLLUTANT
           LOADING
The series of questions that need to be answered in an assessment of pollutant loading are
shown in Figure 14.2. The six questions and the associated components of the
assessment are presented one above the other, and linked sideways by arrows to the box
representing pollutant loading to denote that they are not necessarily part of a sequential
decision process. The information needed to answer these questions must come from a
survey or inventory of likely pollutant sources, including identification, location and
characterization of all sources, including where possible their historical evolution (see
checklists at the end of chapters of Section II). Further discussion of data collection
procedures and design and implementation of pollution inventories is provided by Foster
et al. (2002) and Zaporozec (2002).

   The information needed to answer the first question in Figure 14.2 is summarized in
Table 14.1, in which the human activities in Chapters 9-13 are listed with many of the
main types of pollutants and their category of distribution as point, line or diffuse
sources. Table 14.1 also indicates which of the activities are accompanied by significant
hydraulic loading by additional volumes of water, and for which of them the protective
soil layer is by-passed in the method of usage or disposal of the potential pollutants.

                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                       381

    A simple approach to illustrating four of the components of Figure 14.2 is shown in
Figures 14.3 to 14.5 and 14.7. These are based on diagrams originally developed by
Foster and Hirata (1988), but modified to refer to the groups of human activities
described in Chapters 9-13 and summarized in Table 14.1.
    The four diagrams presented here are intended to be used conceptually, i.e. to provide
a general and largely relative indication of which features of the selected activities
contribute most to the potential for pollution of groundwater to occur. Qualitative
interpretation of the four diagrams will help to indicate where efforts to improve the
information base should be concentrated. Experience of assessing pollutant loading
potential, including in the two case study examples, suggests that, in many situations, the
complexity of human activities, industrial processes and waste disposal practices means
that careful and detailed investigations using the checklists from Chapters 9-13 are
required.

Pollutant mobility and persistence
Figure 14.3 helps to answer the question about mobility and persistence by locating the
main classes of pollutants according to their potential for degradation and elimination or
pathogen inactivation and die-off respectively, and/or retardation by the processes
described in Chapters 3 and 4. The former include chemical reactions such as
precipitation and complexation as well biodegradation, and the latter comprise
adsorption, filtration and cation exchange. Thus mobile and persistent pollutants such as
chloride and nitrate are relatively little affected by these attenuation processes in aerobic
conditions in the aquifer and the overlying strata. For these pollutants, dilution will
usually be the main attenuation process that operates. More readily degraded and
retarded pollutants such as pesticides, bacteria and viruses can be significantly restricted
from reaching aquifers if the overlying strata have adequate attenuation capacity in terms
of clay and organic carbon content and microbial activity.
    While Figure 14.3 is helpful conceptually, it is emphasized that this general guide has
limitations. Firstly, pollutants within the simple groupings given in Figure 14.3 may
behave differently, and for hydrocarbons and pesticides the tables in Chapter 4 and the
references from which they were derived can provide more specific information.
Secondly, while the aerobic, alkaline conditions specified in the title are the most
common and widespread in groundwaters, changes in pH and Eh conditions can have
important influences on mobility and persistence (Lyngkilde and Christensen, 1992;
Christensen et al., 1996). Eh, the redox potential, is a measure (usually in millivolts) of
the intensity of oxidizing or reducing conditions within a groundwater system. Positive
potentials indicate that the system is relatively oxidizing, and negative potentials
represent reducing conditions (Hem, 1985). The influence on pollutant groups of
reductions in pH or Eh, representing more acidic and reducing conditions respectively, is
shown in Figure 14.3. Thus most metals become significantly more mobile in acidic
and/or reducing conditions, and ammonium and nitrate are mutually sensitive to the
oxidation status of the groundwater. Some pollutants, in particular arsenic and
chromium, have several forms of natural occurrence. These can have different chemical
valencies or oxidation status, and their possible behaviour in response to changes in
acidity or oxidation status is too complex to be represented simply on Figure 14.3.
382                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    A final note of caution is that the figure can be considered broadly applicable to
aquifers in which groundwater movement is intergranular or in a network of small
fractures (Chapter 2). In the very rapid groundwater flow conditions of karstic aquifers,
however, water and microbial and chemical pollutants may be moving so fast that the
processes of elimination and retardation do not have time to operate.
    Even allowing for these cautionary notes, the likelihood of reaching groundwater can
be assessed in qualitative terms for potential pollutants identified or anticipated from the
situation assessment and from Table 14.1. This likelihood increases from bottom left to
top right of Figure 14.3.

conditions (adapted from Foster and Hirata, 1988)


Mode of disposition
The next characteristic of pollutant loading potential (Figure 14.2) is the mode of
disposition, i.e. how the pollutant enters the subsurface. This is a combination of the
hydraulic loading or surcharge associated with or imposed by the pollution source, and
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                         383

the depth below the ground surface at which either effluent is discharged or leaching
from solid residues occurs, and is illustrated in Figure 14.4.
    Thus conventional, rainfed agriculture takes place at the ground surface with a
hydraulic loading only from infiltrating rainfall. Irrigated agriculture may produce
significantly higher hydraulic loading, depending on the number of crops per year and
type of crops, and the irrigation methods used. Many other potential sources of pollution
originate below the soil – including leaking sewers, unsewered sanitation, industrial
effluents and soakaway drainage from highways. Depending on the precise mode of
disposition, the pathway to groundwater may be greatly shortened for several of these, as
depicted in Figure 14.4. Unlined landfills can generate highly concentrated leachates
which may enter the subsurface at considerable depth if the waste has been disposed of
in excavations formerly used for quarries or pits. Disposal of industrial effluents into old
wells or specially constructed disposal wells transports pollutants directly to the water
table, often with significant local hydraulic loading (Figure 14.4). An accidental spill at
the land surface may have apparently limited potential to cause groundwater pollution.
However, highways, railways and airfields often drain to the subsurface by soakaways,
greatly facilitating more rapid transport of pollutants to groundwater (Figure 14.4). The
potential to cause pollutant loading, and likely scale of impact, increases from bottom left
(small loading at the ground surface) to top right (high hydraulic loading close to or at the
water table).

Pollutant quantity
Within a general assessment of potentially polluting activities, it is clearly desirable to
obtain as much information as possible about each of the components shown in Figure
14.2. Thus in answer to the question about how much of the pollutant is initially released
by or leached from the human activity in question, it would ideally be possible to
estimate the actual quantities of pollutants at the time and place of release into the
environment. For pathogens or faecal indicators these would usually be expressed in
counts of organisms per 100 millilitre, and for chemicals in units such as litres or
kilograms of, for example, D/dense/light non-aqueous phase liquid (D/LNAPLS) spilled
in an accident or leaked from a tank or pipeline, kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer applied
per ha, or cubic metres of landfill leachate and the concentrations of pollutants in the
leachate. Because of the infinite variety of scope and scale of human activities that
potentially generate pollutants (Table 14.1), a simple tabulation of quantities, estimation
methods or published sources that could be used to answer the question ‘how much
pollutant?’ is not feasible. While some indications of pollutant quantities for some
activities such as nitrogen fertilizer applications and leaching losses (Conway and Pretty,
1991), unsewered sanitation (ARGOSS, 2001) and landfill leachates (Stuart and Klinck,
1998) can be obtained from literature sources, for the most part estimates of pollutant
quantities must be attempted for the specific situation encountered.
    For a few types of individual point sources, estimating the quantity of pollutant
released may be a simple matter of site observation, for example, the volume of liquid
leaked from a ruptured road or rail tanker, or a catastrophic failure of a fuel tank, tailings
dam or similar structure of known volume. For the majority of even apparently ‘simple’
point sources, pipelines, broken sewers, landfills, lagoons, dams and tanks, leakage is
likely to have been slow, intermittent or continuous over considerable time periods, and
from storage or conveyance systems with largely unknown but probably variable
discharges and pollutant concentrations. Further, the complexity and considerable
diversity of many of the major potential pollutant sources and the fact that, especially in
urban areas, sources may be spatially distributed over a large area, such as to cause a
complex mosaic of many small pollution sources, means that the load from and
consequent impact of any individual one is very difficult to isolate. In the case of the city
of Leon in Mexico, for example, which is a centre of leather processing, some 530
tanneries of varying sizes are distributed throughout the urban and suburban areas
(Chilton et al., 1998). These use varying and largely unknown amounts of processing
chemicals including chromium salts and solvents, and discharge polluting wastes. Some
discharge their polluting wastewaters into the urban sewer network, and some directly to
the ground. Separate collection and treatment of the chromium-rich and highly saline
effluent from these dispersed, small-scale industries would be difficult and costly and
would require relocation of the tanneries to a designated industrial area. For these and
similar small-scale, dispersed industrial and commercial activities, mapping their
locations may be feasible, if time-consuming (Zaporozec, 2002). The next step of finding
out about the volumes and concentrations of effluents may, however, be much more
difficult, not least because the owners and managers may be unwilling to pass on the
information if their waste disposal practices are not environmentally sound, or even
illegal. In the Barbados case study described at the end of this chapter, it was relatively
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                      385

easy to locate the few hazardous industries, but very difficult to find out about their
actual disposal practices because most were probably discharging effluents directly into
the underlying coral limestone aquifer.
    In practice, therefore, experience shows that estimating the amounts of pollutants
released is highly problematic for all but the simplest scenarios. Nevertheless, the ideal
information requirements outlined above should still guide the pollutant source and load
surveying process. They constitute the basis for subsequent detailed investigations of the
most important pollutant sources and loads, by inspection of premises, processes and
waste disposal practices and the sampling of effluents. The checklists provided in
Chapters 9 to 13 address these information requirements.

Intensity of pollution
If the amount of pollutant released into the environment is known or can be estimated,
what are the likely pollutant concentrations or faecal indicator or pathogen numbers at
the pollutant source? This component, the intensity of pollution, is depicted in Figure
14.5, showing that pollutants from various human activities may be introduced into the
environment at a wide range of concentrations, up to many orders of magnitude greater
than those that would be acceptable for drinking-water or environmental standards.
There is in fact a whole spectrum of occurrence, from industrial spills or traffic accidents
in which a completely undiluted pollutant may be released at the surface, to the impact of
agriculture and on-site sanitation, which is likely to produce pollutant concentrations in
the same range as, or up to 10 or 100 times greater than guideline values. The former is a
point source which directly impacts only a very small proportion of the total volume of
recharge (Figure 14.5) and is potentially diluted in the larger water volume within the
groundwater flow system, whereas the latter may impact a high proportion of the total
recharge (Figure 14.5), depending on the land use distribution in the recharge area and
the proportion of land that is cultivated and fertilized. The figure also shows that
unsewered sanitation will affect an increasing proportion of the recharge as the density of
installations increases from rural to suburban and urban areas.
    While conceptually helpful, Figure 14.5 is again a simplification of what is actually a
rather more complex situation. Firstly, most of the human activity boxes as pollution
sources in the figure include several distinct pollutant groups (Table 14.1). As an
example, source concentrations of agricultural pesticides in the soil at the time of
application may be three or four orders of magnitude greater than guideline values,
whereas nitrate would rarely be more than one order of magnitude greater. Similarly for
on-site sanitation or leaky sewers, faecal indicator or pathogens at source may range up
to several orders of magnitude per 100 ml, whereas initial nitrogen concentrations would
be much less excessive. Initial concentrations are high, but subsequent attenuation
processes are very active. Secondly, the horizontal scale extends to very high
concentrations to accommodate high solubilized concentrations in groundwater adjacent
to spillages of NAPL organic compounds that have relatively low WHO guideline
values. For other sources, the range of concentrations may encompass the dissolved
solute concentration in the very localized recharge water originating from the source.
While generally indicating which activities affect only a small part of the catchment
recharge but at high or very high concentrations, and which affect more of the recharge
386                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

but at more modest concentrations, the figure may not be exactly comparing like with
like. Potential polluting activities identified in the situation analysis should be located on
Figure 14.5, and their pollution loading potential increases from bottom left to top right.




Figure 14.5. Characterization of intensity of pollution (adapted from Foster and Hirata, 1988)

   For some diffuse sources of pollution, semi-quantitative estimates of the likely
concentrations of persistent pollutants in local recharge may be possible, given many
simplifying assumptions (Foster and Hirata, 1988). Approaches to doing this have been
developed for chloride and nitrate from unsewered sanitation (Box 14.1) and for nitrate
and pesticides from cultivated land (Foster et al., 2002) (see Sections 14.5 and 14.6).

             Box 14.1. Estimation of nitrogen loading from unsewered sanitation

Estimates of the possible concentrations of nitrate in the local groundwater recharge in
areas of unsewered sanitation can be made for aerobic groundwater systems using the
following equation (Foster and Hirata, 1988):
                              1000 ⋅ a ⋅ A ⋅ f
                      C=
                           0.365 ⋅ A ⋅ U + 10 ⋅ I                               (Eqn. 14.1)
where: C is the concentration in mg/l of nitrate in the recharge (expressed as nitrate-
nitrogen), a is the amount in kilograms of nitrogen excreted per person each year, A is
the population density in persons/ha, f is the proportion of the excreted nitrogen leached
to groundwater (reflects and integrates both the condition of latrines and the vulnerability
of underground to nitrogen leaching), U is the non-consumptive portion of total water
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                          387

usage in l/person/day, i.e. the amount returned to the sanitation system, and I is the
natural rate of infiltration for the area in mm/a.
   Using this equation Figure 14.6, shows sensitivity of nitrate concentrations in
recharge to variations in I, u and f, and indicates that many urban and suburban settings
are capable of producing troublesome nitrate concentrations in the underlying
groundwater.




Figure 14.6. Estimation of the potential nitrate-nitrogen load in groundwater recharge in
areas of unsewered sanitation (adapted from Foster and Hirata, 1988)

    Overall population density and the proportion using unsewered sanitation comes from
basic demographic information obtained using the checklist in Chapter 10, and the
regional rate of natural infiltration (a proportion of the total rainfall) from the checklist at
the end of Chapter 8. The amount of nitrogen produced per person (5 kg) in excreta each
year is known from the literature (ARGOSS, 2001). Greatest uncertainty surrounds the
proportion of the excreted nitrogen that will be oxidized and leached in the local
groundwater recharge. A range of 0.2 to 0.6 is generally considered to be possible in
shallow aerobic aquifers (Kimmel, 1984), and the actual proportion depends on the type
and condition of installation, the per capita water use, the amount of volatile losses from
the nitrogen compounds, the amount of nitrogen removed in cleaning and the geological
setting and hydrochemical conditions. In some karstic limestone aquifers, almost all of
the nitrogen deposited in sanitation systems may be oxidized and leached. The
application of this approach is described in the Barbados case study (Section 14.5).
    For high population densities in urban and suburban areas, local infiltration and
recharge could be decreased by reductions in permeability in some areas due to surface
sealing by built-up areas, and increased in others where collected urban drainage is
disposed of to the subsurface, and also increased by leakage from water mains. In mixed
areas of sewered and on-site sanitation, leakage of poor quality water from the sewers
may further complicate the estimation.
388                         Protecting Groundwater for Health


   For most point sources of pollution, the best than can usually be achieved is a relative
pollution potential ranking based on the class of pollutants likely to be involved and the
possible hydraulic loading, given the major uncertainties about the concentrations of
pollutants in industrial effluents, mine waste and landfill leachate and their precise mode
of disposition in the subsurface.

Duration of pollution
The final consideration (Figure 14.2) is how long the pollution has been going on for, or
is likely to continue. Figure 14.7 provides an indication of the time over which the
pollutant load is applied and the likelihood that pollution loading will occur. Thus an
accident, spillage or catastrophic leak from a damaged tank may be of very short
duration (Figure 14.7) and not penetrate into the subsurface if emergency action to
contain the pollutant is taken quickly. If emergency action to deal with accidental
pollution is not taken quickly, then solid or liquid pollutants may remain where they were
released, either at or below the ground surface, and subsequently be subjected to leaching
to groundwater. The slow solubilization of subsurface non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL)
sources, potentially lasting decades, even centuries, is a key concern in this regard.
Delays in dealing with accidents thus tend to move such accidental pollution sources
upwards and to the right in Figure 14.7.

1988)
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                        389

   Diffuse sources of pollution may also persist for many years or decades and, as in the
case of the Perth study (Section 14.6), increase significantly with time as the city has
grown and developed. These may be highly likely to cause a pollutant load (Figure 14.7),
the magnitude of which will be determined by the characteristics of the other
components described above. Thus as for the other components, the pollution potential
increases from bottom left to top right.


14.3       OUTCOME OF ASSESSING POLLUTION
           POTENTIAL
The outcome of assessing the pollution loading potential would be a list of the pollutants
expected to reach the aquifer in combination with a semi-quantitative assessment of their
respective concentration levels. The process shown in Figure 14.2 provides the
information for positioning activities and pollutants on the Y-axis of Figure 14.1. As
indicated in Figure 14.1, these then interact in varying and complex ways with the
different intrinsic factors used to describe aquifer vulnerability in Chapter 8, and this
interaction determines the level of groundwater pollution potential.
    The six components of Figure 14.2 each contribute to the overall assessment of
pollution loading potential on the right hand side of the figure. The interaction between
these components is, however, complex. As an example, if the water table is very close
to the ground surface, then unsewered sanitation using pit latrines or septic tanks may
enter directly into groundwater, with greatly enhanced likelihood of pollution. Similarly,
discharge of highway drainage to soakaways may produce high hydraulic loadings and
direct connection to the groundwater, with consequent high pollution potential. This
complexity of interaction means that it is conceptually unwise to try to combine them
into a single index of overall subsurface pollutant load, and technically difficult to do so.
Even where the authors have combined them into a five class qualitative rating scheme
(Zaporozec, 2002), they have depicted the intermediate steps in the process so that the
dominant factors can be identified. Combined indices can have the result of producing a
similar overall ranking for activities and subsurface conditions that are very different, but
for which one dominant factor has been largely responsible for the outcome. This is also
a concern for vulnerability depiction, and one of the reasons for the debate mentioned in
Chapter 8 between those who define aquifer vulnerability in relation to a universal
pollutant, and those who would prefer to define vulnerability separately for various
classes of pollutant. Combined indices may also mask the components for which control
measures would be most effective in reducing pollution potential, i.e. replacing a highly
toxic and persistent chemical in an industrial process with a less environmentally
threatening compound, or changing the mode of disposition to lessen the potential for
pollution to occur.
    A further complicating factor is that pollution potential will itself change with time, as
human activities at the ground surface change. This is particularly important in the urban
and suburban areas illustrated in the two case studies, and it is important to have at least a
qualitative indication of both historical and future changes in likely pollution sources.
These can affect all of the groups of human activities described in Chapters 9-13;
increases in fertilizer use, development of irrigation, new pesticides, replacement of on-
390                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

site sanitation with sewerage systems, developing or declining industries, changes in
industrial processes, effluent treatment and disposal, closure of mines. Stricter
environmental legislation may require responses that in turn also reduce potential
pollutant loads. Surveys or inventories to assess the situation and provide the answers to
the questions in the checklists are likely to need regular reassessment to confirm their
continuing validity, and updating of information where there are major changes.
    Changes in pollution loading can lead to major changes in groundwater quality. As an
example, long-term increases in the application of nitrogen fertilizers to crops increase
the leaching losses, leading to accumulation of nitrogen in the soil and unsaturated zone,
and produce widespread upward trends in groundwater nitrate concentrations in many
regions of the world (Chapter 9). Abating or reversing trends is often the objective of
legislative control, and the withdrawal of the herbicide atrazine for non-agricultural weed
control in the United Kingdom in 1992 has produced a reduction in concentrations in
some of the public supply sources drawing groundwater polluted by this activity.
However, responses of observed groundwater quality to changes in pollutant load are
often delayed because of the slow movement of water and pollutants along the
groundwater pathway. Further, in the case of removal or reduction of a pollution source
at the ground surface, there may be significant amounts of pollutant accumulated in the
unsaturated zone en route to groundwater. Pollutant concentrations in groundwater may
continue to rise long after the source has been removed, and reversal of the trend may not
occur for many years. This situation is seen at other groundwater supply sources affected
by atrazine pollution from non-agricultural usage.
    Where specific pollutants can originate from more than one major human activity,
determining their origin is desirable, otherwise protection and control measures may be
directed at the wrong source and hence be apparently ineffective. The most important of
these are probably chloride and nitrate, which can be derived from leaking sewers,
landfills, unsewered sanitation, livestock farming and agricultural fertilizers. High
chloride concentrations may also indicate saline intrusion in coastal areas or the use of
salt for road de-icing in cold climates. These pollutants can thus be indicators of impact
from both rural and urban activities. Nitrate in particular can be problematic, as
unsewered sanitation and agriculture often occur in close proximity. This situation occurs
in both case studies and is common in many locations. Because of its importance for
drinking-water quality, the nitrate needs to be traced back to its source so that control
measures can be correctly targeted. A method that has been successfully applied is to use
the distinctive isotopic signatures of nitrogen from animal and human excreta and from
inorganic fertilizers to characterize the nitrate observed in the groundwater (Heaton,
1986; Aravena et al., 1993; Exner and Spalding, 1994; Rivers et al, 1996), and hence its
origin. The distinctions are not, however, always unambiguous as denitrification can also
modify the isotopic signature of the nitrate in groundwater. Alternatively, trace elements
associated with high groundwater nitrate concentrations, such as zinc and boron, or
pharmaceuticals, may be indicative of a sewage rather than an agricultural source (Lerner
and Barrett, 1996).
    Where an observed or anticipated pollutant may have originated from numerous
small sources as, for example, in a large industrialized city, especially one with a long
and complex industrial history, then it is likely to be technically difficult and
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                       391

unrealistically expensive to determine the precise origins, locations and characteristics of
pollution sources (Rivett et al., 1990; Ford and Tellam, 1994). In such circumstances
efforts are better directed at protection and control of all potentially hazardous sources
rather than trying to prove the precise origins of the pollution.


14.4       USING GROUNDWATER QUALITY MONITORING
           TO SUPPORT THE ASSESSMENT
A qualitative categorization of pollutant loading is an essential element of assessing
pollution potential and ultimately the urgency of management responses to protect public
health. Evidence of pollution from any existing groundwater quality data is highly
valuable to support, confirm or validate the assessment of pollution potential, and where
such data are available, they should always be used. In Perth, Australia, (Section 14.6)
groundwater quality monitoring data have existed for many years, and in Barbados
(Section 14.5) groundwater quality monitoring was established to complement the
assessment of pollution potential. The role of groundwater quality data in relation to
other sources of information is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
    In some circumstances, however, groundwater quality data become highly significant
or even essential for risk assessment and management decisions, i.e. where assessment of
pollution potential proves to be difficult or inconclusive. This could arise if vulnerability
is uncertain due to a lack of essential components of the data specified in Chapter 8, or if
pollutant loading is very difficult to assess because there are many, small, dispersed or
superimposed sources whose types and amounts of pollutants are unknown. The latter
situation will often be encountered in urban and periurban areas in developing countries,
where industrial and commercial activities are widely dispersed and individually small,
informal or unregistered and extremely difficult to assess, as was the experience in the
Barbados case study summarized below.
    If there are no groundwater quality data and an inventory of pollution sources proves
too difficult or inconclusive, then some selective groundwater quality sampling and
analysis from existing abstraction sources can help to provide a rapid assessment of
pollution potential. If such a preliminary reconnaissance survey shows evidence of
serious pollution, then human resources will need to be made available to start
characterizing the main pollutant sources. There is in fact a close link between assessing
pollution potential and monitoring, as preliminary surveys of groundwater quality and
pollution sources are both important to assist parameter selection in the establishment of
long-term routine groundwater quality monitoring programmes (Chapman, 1996;
UNECE, 2000).


14.5       THE BARBADOS CASE STUDY
The small but densely populated Caribbean island of Barbados is almost totally
dependent on groundwater for public water supply to the resident population and large
numbers of visiting tourists. The groundwater resources of such island communities are
often limited and of high value, the need for protection is readily apparent and
degradation of the groundwater quality would have serious implications, as alternative
392                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

supply options are limited and/or very costly. Although the study was undertaken from
1987-1992, it can still be used to illustrate both the assessment of pollution potential
outlined in this chapter, and the approaches to and results of the assessment of
information needs in Section II.

Existing groundwater protection measures and the reasons for the study
The vulnerability of the coral limestone aquifer of Barbados has long been recognized.
To protect the bacteriological and chemical quality of groundwater used for public
supply, the Barbados government established a policy of Development Control Zoning
around existing and proposed public supply sources in 1963. Five zones were delineated
(Figure 14.8) based on a simplified estimation of pollutant travel time through the
aquifer. A travel time of 300 days for Zone 1 was selected to be significantly greater than
the subsurface survival time of enteric bacteria, and a 600-day travel time was selected
for Zone 2. Controls on potential pollution sources such as soakaway pits and septic
tanks for domestic and industrial wastewater, fuel storage and industrial development are
imposed within the zones (Table 14.2). In 1963, this was an important and farsighted
piece of legislation, representing one of the earliest examples of a groundwater protection
policy. However, there had been little or no groundwater quality monitoring since its
introduction from which the effectiveness of the zoning could be evaluated, and this was
a principal objective of the study.

Drinking-water Supply
Barbados covers about 430 km2 and its population is stable at about 250 000. The overall
population density is 6/ha, but ranges from 30/ha in the urban southern and western coastal
areas to 4/ha in the rural areas (Chilton et al., 1991). At the time of the study, seventeen
large abstraction wells operated by the Barbados Water Authority supplied about 115 ml/d
and more than 95 per cent of the population were connected to mains water supply. Only a
small proportion, mostly along the southern coastal area, had mains sewerage, although the
development and extent of mains sewerage has increased since the time of the study. There
were a few private wells, but many are no longer in regular use and the remainder were
used for irrigation. The small number of public supply wells helped to facilitate the
drinking-water catchment protection policy outlined above.

Groundwater conditions
The coral limestone forms a highly productive aquifer about 100 m thick, which contains a
freshwater lens up to about 25 m thick, but thinning to 3 m close to the coast. The
permeable nature of the aquifer is demonstrated by the almost total absence of surface
drainage and the presence of karstic caves. As is typical for such coral limestones, soils are
thin and were expected to provide little protective cover. Perusal of soils data and
discussion with local agriculturalists indicated, however, that because of the frequent
volcanic activity in the Caribbean region, soils are better developed, thicker and with more
clay than might have been anticipated. As a consequence, the whole surface of the
limestone aquifer was considered to have high, but not extreme, vulnerability to pollution
(Figure 14.1). This somewhat simplified the assessment of pollution potential, as there was
no requirement for defining and mapping vulnerability within the study, which therefore
concentrated on the Y-axis of Figure 14.1 and the questions in Figure 14.2.
394                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

   Annual rainfall varies from 1200 mm/yr at the coast to 2200 mm/yr in the interior,
providing an equivalent range of some 250-650 mm/yr of recharge. The high annual
recharge is roughly equal to the total groundwater storage of this relatively small aquifer.
This is an uncommon feature, and implies short residence times and rapid groundwater
renewal. Given the lack of surface streams, defining the groundwater catchments was not
easy, and the imprecise boundaries followed the rather poorly defined surface watersheds
and the buried topography of the coral limestone aquifer.

Approach to the assessment of pollution potential
The study comprised assessments of likely pollution sources in the Belle and Hampton
drinking-water catchments, which together provided 90 per cent of the public water sup-
plies of the island, and cover 55 and 67 km2 respectively. The work was undertaken pri-
marily by the Barbados Ministry of Health’s EED, with technical support from the BGS
funded by DFID and the Caribbean Programme Office of the Pan American Health
Organization. The results of the assessment for Barbados are summarized in Table 14.3
by giving the qualitative and semi-quantitative responses to the questions in Figure 14.2.
    In such a small and intensively developed island, pollution threats could be expected
from urban, industrial and agricultural activities (Table 14.1). That these three were
likely to be important enough to warrant detailed investigation was apparent from the
first reconnaissance drive through the catchments, which indicated the range of urban,
suburban and rural population densities, the dominance of sugarcane cultivation
supplemented by horticulture and the wide variety and distribution of small-scale
industries. Using Table 14.1, pathogens, nitrate from fertilizer and sanitation, agricultural
pesticides and salinity were readily identified as potential pollutants requiring further
assessment incorporating the components outlined in Figure 14.2.
    To evaluate the likely impact of human habitations, information about population
distribution, sanitation coverage and types was obtained by the Environmental
Engineering Division (EED) project team from existing census data and from the records
of the Public Health Inspectorate. For industry, an initial survey used the yellow pages
business section of the local telephone directory to identify industrial and commercial
premises in the catchments. These were each visited by the EED team, using a
questionnaire to obtain information about the industrial chemicals and processes used
and the methods of waste disposal. A second detailed survey of the farms and estates in
both catchments also used questionnaires and follow-up site visits, to determine
cultivation practices, cropping regimes, fertilizer applications and pesticide usage.
Support in the design and interpretation of the agricultural survey was provided by staff
of the Agriculture Department and of the Government Analytical Laboratory. For both
the industrial and agricultural surveys, many additional sources of information – other
government departments, universities and the National Oil Company, for example, were
consulted, emphasizing that even in relatively small catchments such as these, complex
land use and human activity means that the inputs of many technical disciplines are
needed and a wide range of institutions are likely to have useful information. Being
relatively small catchments, there were no problems related to differences between
hydrological and administrative boundaries, and being a small island community, inter-
institutional awareness, knowledge and cooperation were fortunately good.

Potential pollution threats identified and evidence of impact
The survey results were compiled in spreadsheets and plotted in map form for both
catchments, and the map of potential pollution threats for the Belle catchment is shown
in Figure 14.9. Potential for groundwater pollution from all three major categories of
activity were identified and pollution loadings estimated for unsewered sanitation (Box
14.1) and fertilizer usage. Thus the high density of unsewered sanitation in the urban part
of the Belle catchment compared to the rural parts of both catchments presented a threat
of nitrate and microbial pollution, which was confirmed by the results of the associated
groundwater quality monitoring. Some industries, such as dry cleaning, paint distribution
and photographic processing, were identified as using hazardous chemials and disposing
of small volumes of untreated effluents directly into the coral limetone aquifer. The
mode of disposition of these small amounts of industrial effluents into soakaways or old
wells thus provided a notably high potential to pollute groundwater (Figure 14.4 and
Table 14.3). However, they were few, widely dispersed and of very small scale, and no
significant impact was detected on groundwater quality in the associated sampling
programme. The most widespread and likely threats from industrial and commercial
premises were presented by fuel stations and by small vehicle repair workshops.

    The agricultural survey highlighted a move away from traditional cultivation of
sugarcane to much more varied cropping, especially horticulture. Sugarcane is an
efficient user of nitrogen fertilizer as it grows continuously, but vegetables and flowers
have shorter growing seasons and are often less efficient users of soil nitrogen. They are
also often grown in Barbados with supplementary irrigation, and for these two reasons
higher nitrogen leaching may be expected (Figure 14.4). Groundwater nitrate
concentrations of 4-8 mg NO3-N/l were observed everywhere in the rural areas of both
catchments, indicating universal but modest impact from agriculture, but there was no
evidence of an overall increasing trend during the five years of the study or indeed when
the results of the continuing groundwater quality monitoring programme were reviewed
later by Chilton et al. (2000).
    Estimates of nitrate concentrations in recharge reflecting the nitrogen loading from
on-site sanitation were made as shown in Table 14.4, using the equation given in
Box 14.1. The annual recharge is known to be higher over the hilly rural interior than at
the more urbanized southern coastal belt, and per capita wastewater generation is
assumed to be slightly lower in the rural areas that are, nevertheless, largely connected to
the mains water system. Observed nitrate groundwater concentrations support these
estimations, remaining in the range 4-8 mg NO3-N/l in the whole of Hampton and the
northern part of Belle and only rising above 10 mg NO3-N/l in the southern, urban part of
the Belle catchment with the superimposed nitrogen loading from the more dense on-site
sanitation facilities (Chilton et al., 1991; 2000). Sampling for faecal coliforms at the
same wells supports this interpretation, with more frequent and higher counts broadly
correlating with the higher nitrate concentrations.

   Horticulture has a much greater variety of pests associated with it than sugarcane –
and hence a wider range of herbicides and insecticides are used in their cultivation. A
combination of pesticide usage data and published physicochemical properties –
solubility in water, persistence as defined by soil half-lives and mobility from partition
coefficients (Chapter 4) – was used to estimate susceptibility to leaching to groundwater
and hence to select pesticides for monitoring. Pesticide sampling in the monitoring
programme detected the almost ubiquitous presence of atrazine, but at low
concentrations. This is one of the herbicides most widely used in sugarcane cultivation,
but there was little evidence of the main insecticides used. This probably resulted from
the wider area (of sugarcane) to which atrazine is applied, compared to the more limited
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                       399

areas of horticulture, and from the mode of application. Atrazine is a soil-applied
herbicide, whereas most of the insecticides are foliar (applied to the plants themselves)
and the former is thus more likely to be leached to groundwater.
   During the assessment, additional potential pollution sources in the form of poorly
maintained oil wells, illegal dumping of solid waste and highway drainage became
apparent from visual inspection of the catchments, conversations with residents and
organizations. In particular, transport by road tanker of crude oil from the oilfield to the
port terminal presented a hazard of traffic accident, spillage and drainage directly into the
coral limestone aquifer.

Outcome of the assessment of pollution potential
The assessment successfully identified the main potential pollution sources from urban
domestic waste disposal and agricultural activities (Table 14.3). As the whole of the
aquifer outcrop is considered to have high vulnerability, the outcome of the pollution
loading assessment translates to a position on the Y-axis of Figure 14.1 and thence a
ranking of groundwater pollution potential (Table 14.3). The associated monitoring
programme established in the study has confirmed that elevated concentrations of nitrate
and pesticides do result. Although they occasionally exceed guideline concentrations in
private wells, they are lower in public supply wells. The Development Control Zone
policy appeared to have been successful in protecting the island's groundwater, which
had remained of good quality in spite of the dense population and rapid development. It
was recommended from the results of the study that the Development Control Zone
policy should not be relaxed, despite pressure from housing and industrial developers,
and that the assessment should be extended to the remaining catchments along the
island’s west coast. It was, however, difficult to evaluate the bacteriological impact from
simple monitoring because the public supply sources were equipped with in-well
chlorination that prevented collection of pre-chlorination samples. More costly purpose-
built sampling boreholes within the control zones would be needed for this.
    The Barbados case study can also be used to illustrate key features of the situation
analysis from the chapters and associated checklists in Section II (Table 14.5).
    While the development control zone policy had clearly served Barbados well, the
study identified the main threats, and highlighted the need for continuing vigilance to
protect the island’s groundwater. Management priorities identified in the study are shown
in Table 14.5. While the resident population is unlikely to grow, water demand probably
will, partly to meet the growing tourism industry, and this may bring land use changes,
such as more golf courses and increasing local demand for horticultural products. Since
the study, waterborne sewage has been extended to significant parts of the centre of
Bridgetown and the southern coast. This helps protect the coastal zone by reducing
pollutant loading to the groundwater discharging to the sea. Waterborne sewage may
also need to be targeted at areas where housing is encroaching into the development
control zones. This means that, to keep pace with changing circumstances, the situation
analysis and pollution potential assessment should be updated, probably on a five-yearly
basis. A further recommendation was that the assessment of pollution potential should be
extended to the catchments of the wells along the west coast (Figure 14.8).

14.6      THE PERTH CASE STUDY
Perth is the only large urban centre in Western Australia and is dependent on
groundwater for about 70 per cent of all water use, and about 50 per cent of its public
supply. Groundwater is pumped from both a regional unconfined aquifer and deep
confined aquifers. The latter are well protected and recent initiatives to urbanize their
recharge area have been successfully fended off, and the land has remained in govern-
ment ownership, being used only for a limited amount of forestry. To restrict future
development initiatives, discussions on establishing protection zones have been initiated.
   The shallow aquifer, however, has been affected by contamination. As the city has
expanded, the urban area has encroached on to land in the recharge area which was
previously under rural land use or completely undeveloped. The dramatic land use
changes which have accompanied the rapid growth of Perth are shown in Figure 14.10.
As this is a common situation elsewhere in the world where cities are expanding rapidly,
the experience gained in Perth is considered very appropriate as a case study to illustrate
how the risks of contamination of groundwater resources important for water supplies
can be assessed using the principles outlined in this chapter.

Socioeconomic setting
Although it has a population of only 1.3 million, Perth’s metropolitan region covers an
area equivalent to many large European cities (Figure 14.11). This is because Perth is
very much a garden city, with most of the population living in detached houses with
large gardens of lawn and exotic shrubs on 500 to 1000 m2 blocks. This makes the
overall population density (230/km2) lower than the other major cities in Australia and
much lower than equivalent cites elsewhere in the world.

Hydrogeological conditions
Fortunately, Perth overlies a very large fresh groundwater resource that forms an
important component of the city’s water supply and maintains ecosystems around
environmentally significant lakes and wetlands. Groundwater occurs in an unconfined
402                              Protecting Groundwater for Health

aquifer throughout the region, and in several confined aquifers. The groundwater in
storage represents some 500 years of current annual abstraction. Boreholes of up to
1000 m depth supply water with a salinity of only 180 mg/l total dissolved solids (TDS).

   However, the shallow groundwater beneath urban areas is highly vulnerable to
pollution owing to the sandy soil and the generally shallow water table, and in some
areas pollution has restricted groundwater use and has had an adverse impact on
wetlands. Further, the growth of the urban area has overtaken wellfields which were
previously located in areas of rural land use, and has compromised water quality.

Water supply situation
The gardens in Perth require watering for about six months of the year because of the
region’s dry Mediterranean type climate, and are responsible for up to 80 per cent of
domestic water use. The shallow water table and unconsolidated sand aquifer mean that
groundwater is easily available to most private properties. As a consequence, beside the
public water supply wells (mapped in Figure 14.11), there are about 135 000 privately
                    Assessment of groundwater pollution potential                      403

owned small diameter boreholes or dug wells with spear points, which are used for gar-
den irrigation in Perth. This has greatly reduced the demand from public water supply
schemes. The average in-house usage of water of drinking-water quality in Perth is about
120 l/capita/day. Households that do not have access to domestic bores will typically use
another 110 l/capita/day of water of drinking-water quality for watering gardens. The
application rate of water from domestic bores during summer is of the order of
12 l/day/m2/house.

Impact of urban development on groundwater quality
From Table 14.1, the principal hazards likely to cause groundwater pollution are
commercial and industrial point sources within the industrial areas of Perth
(Figure 14.11), and widespread but low levels of diffuse pollution from fertilizer use on
gardens and from septic tank leachate. The potential point sources of pollution include a
range of light industries, petrol service stations and pest control depots (Appleyard,
1995a), which have either accidentally or deliberately disposed of wastes, and about 100
former waste disposal sites (Hirschberg, 1993a; 1993b). Pollution surveys suggest there
are about 2000 known or suspected sources of groundwater pollution within the whole
region, and contaminant plumes from 100-1000 m or more in length have extended from
some of these sites through residential areas where private boreholes are used (Benker et
al., 1996). Water quality surveys have detected a wide range of contaminants in shallow
private boreholes near many of these sites, commonly at levels that exceed national
drinking-water criteria. Although this groundwater is generally not used for drinking,
other routes of exposure, such as droplet inhalation or eating irrigated produce have not
been thoroughly assessed. Groundwater contamination in at least one private borehole
was sufficiently severe to be toxic on prolonged skin contact and to kill plants irrigated
with the water (Appleyard, 1995a).
    There is also widespread leaching of nitrate from fertilizer use on gardens, and of
nitrate, ammonia and bacteria from septic tanks. Estimates of pollutant loading suggest
that about 1600 tonnes of nitrogen and 480 tonnes of phosphorus are applied annually to
lawn areas in Perth (Sharma et al., 1996). Although much of the phosphorus is bound up
in soil profiles, up to 80 per cent of the applied nitrogen may leach to the water table
(Sharma et al., 1996). About 160 tonnes of nitrogen are discharged by groundwater to
the Swan River each year, and up to 10 tonnes of nitrogen for each kilometre of coastline
is discharging annually into the marine environment (Appleyard and Powell, 1998).
    Nitrate concentrations in groundwater beneath Perth generally exceed 1 mg/l, and are
often greater than 10 mg/l NO3-N. The nitrate originates from these sources, and
concentrations generally increase with the age of urban development (Appleyard, 1995b;
Barber et al., 1996). Gerritse et al. (1990) estimated that between 80 and 260 kg/ha of
nitrogen fertilizer is applied in urban areas of Perth each year, which is comparable to
many agricultural application rates. Using these rates as a basis, from their estimate of
nitrate loading they suggested that concentrations in groundwater in these areas should
be at least 40 mg/l NO3-N. Observed concentrations are generally much lower, sugges-
ting that significant denitrification must be taking place in the aquifer. The broad scatter
of nitrate concentrations in groundwater in urban areas of Perth indicates that denitrifica-
tion is not occurring uniformly, and/or that nitrogen inputs are not uniformly distributed.
404                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Fertilizer use is particularly high in the horticultural areas located on the fringes of the
urban region, as more than one crop is grown per year. Typically, 500-1500 kg/ha of
nitrogen (mostly as poultry manure) are applied to crops each year (Lantzke, 1997), and
this exceeds the capacity of plants to take up nitrogen by a factor of 4-7 (Pionke et al.,
1990). A combination of high intensity (Figure 14.5) and high potential (Figure 14.7)
help to make horticulture an activity with high potential for polluting the underlying
groundwater (Table 14.6). This reflects the situation in Barbados, where the rapid growth
of horticulture was identified as a potential pollution hazard requiring further assessment
(Table 14.4), and the presence of intensive horticulture should always be given careful
attention in the assessment process outlined in this chapter. As a consequence in Perth
excessive nitrate leaching occurs and nitrate concentrations up to 100 mg/l NO3-N have
been observed directly beneath horticultural areas.
    Denitrification is favoured where aquifer redox potentials are less than about 300 mV,
but there is some evidence that redox potentials increase in the older urban areas in Perth
due to the sustained impact of urban recharge processes (Appleyard, 1995b). This may
mean that current nitrate concentrations in groundwater beneath urban areas are not
sustainable given current fertilizer usage, and that future nitrate concentrations beneath a
large part of the Perth metropolitan area will exceed drinking-water guidelines.
    A further source of nitrogen as well as faecal pathogen pollution of shallow
groundwater beneath Perth is the use of septic tanks. Currently about 25 per cent of the
urban area which was mainly developed in the 1950s and 1960s, is unsewered. There is a
programme to replace septic tanks with sewer connections, but existing groundwater
pollution from this source will take many years to dissipate.
    Table 14.6 illustrates how the processes outlined in this chapter can be used to assess
the relative hazards that particular pollutants in Perth’s groundwater pose to its use as a
source of drinking-water. As for Barbados, Table 14.6 provides qualitative and semi-
quantitative responses to the questions in Figure 14.2. The assessment provides an
indication of the potential magnitude of the loadings posed by a specific pollutant, and on
how abundant it is likely to be in groundwater based on land use, aquifer vulnerability
and measures of the rate at which the contaminant is discharged to groundwater.
    Based on the approach outlined in this chapter, Table 14.6 indicates that the pollutants
of most concern in shallow groundwater in Perth are pathogens discharged by septic
tanks, high concentrations of nitrate in horticultural areas and benzene concentrations
near petrol service stations. This assessment process can then be used to select
management strategies to ensure that these pollutant sources do not affect the health of
water consumers. This has been done in Perth by establishing drinking-water SPAs and
wellhead protection zones where land use can be strictly controlled to minimize the risk
of contamination. The risk of contamination from septic tanks is also being managed by
progressively installing sewers in the few remaining areas of Perth which are currently
unsewered, and the risks of contamination from service stations are being reduced with
new codes of practice that require double lined underground storage tanks for fuels with
intensive monitoring. A number of measures are also being implemented to reduce
nitrate contamination by horticulture. These include training programs for farmers,
changing land use in very sensitive areas and requiring farmers to manage their activities
according to nutrient management plans.

Establishing groundwater
management priorities
O. Schmoll, I. Chorus and S. Appleyard




Management priorities for protecting groundwater will vary widely between settings.
Once the pollution potential has been assessed for a given catchment (as discussed in
Chapter 14), the priorities for management will depend on the public health burden this
pollution is expected to cause currently and in the future. This will determine the urgency
with which preventative or rehabilitating management responses are needed.
   Management responses will also vary widely, as the feasibility of technically
appropriate interventions will depend on the social and economic context in each setting.
Also, choices can often be made among a range of responses to a problem, and
participatory approaches are likely to lead to different decisions by different
communities.
   Situation analysis and management decisions for a groundwater catchment need to be
based on sound information and on a clear, well-documented decision-making process.
Uncertainties and gaps in the information base need to be transparent. This chapter
discusses criteria for determining management interventions in relation to their urgency
for protecting public health, and in relation to their feasibility for a given catchment.

15.1      ENSURING THE SUITABILITY OF INFORMATION
Establishing a well-documented inventory of all of the available information for a
proposed groundwater management area is usually the first step in assessing the pollution
risks if groundwater is used as a source of drinking-water. Such an inventory forms the
basis of decisions about how potential water quality health risks will be managed.
Chapter 6 and the checklists at the ends of Chapters 7-13 provide guidance on what type
of information might be included in such a catchment inventory.
    Decisions about managing risks to human health usually require the following factors
to be addressed to be effective and sustainable (adapted from US Congress Commission,
1997).
    • The decision making process is iterative – in general, health-risk management
         decisions need to be periodically reviewed as further information becomes
         available. An iterative approach helps ensure that management strategies remain
         up to date with new scientific findings, technological developments, and with
         national or international best practices.
    • Decision making is participatory – broad participation with a range of interested
         or affected parties improves the quality and diversity of opinions that inform the
         decision-making process. Participation also increases the likelihood that risk
         management decisions will be accepted and implemented by the relevant parties.
    • Decision making is well-informed – risk management decisions generally need to
         be based on information from a variety of sources and on different types of
         information. Information used may include scientific data, anecdotal records,
         information about regulatory requirements and socioeconomic information for
         the region.
    • Decision making is contextual – management decisions must be appropriate to
         the social and economic realities of the specific region. Simply adopting practices
         developed in other parts of the world where there are differences in the level of
         expertise or available resources to implement management decisions generally
         does not work. Management practices developed locally are more likely to be
         sustainable.
    • Decision making is holistic – focusing management decisions on only one issue
         may not lead to better health outcomes for communities in the longer term. In
         general, protecting and managing drinking-water quality should be seen in the
         context of being one item in a package of measures to protect the health of
         communities.
    Ensuring that information gathered addresses the above factors generally helps
prevent many of the pitfalls that often affect decisions made about how drinking-water
supplies are managed, particularly the following two:
    • crucial information gaps lead to poorly informed decisions which cause resources
         to be wasted on ineffective measures or even lead to health problems as
         illustrated in Box 15.1;
    • decisions on measures urgently needed to improve public health are sometimes
         not taken or are unduly postponed because information gaps are used as an
         excuse for not allocating resources to the measures.

                       Box 15.1 Cholera Epidemic in Peru in 1991
    Andersen (1991) reports that during the 1980s a decision by local water officials
    to stop chlorinating water pumped from many of the wells in Lima, Peru
    contributed to more than 300 000 cases of cholera and over 3500 fatalities. The
    reason given for the decision against disinfection was the perception of a cancer
    threat from chlorination by-products.
    Studies indicating a small statistical lifetime risk of cancer from trihalomethanes
    and other chlorination by-products were interpreted as demonstrating a more
    significant health risk than the threat from waterborne pathogens. It is possible
    that the scale of the epidemic could have been greatly reduced had all of the
    information about the respective health risks of waterborne pathogens and
    chlorination by-products been available and understood by the relevant decision
    makers, and had the relative risk been assessed.

    In general, there will always be gaps in the information gathered, and management
decisions will often have to be made based on some degree of uncertainty. However, if
there are potentially significant risks to human health, the lack of information should not
be used as an excuse to delay reasonable and cost effective measures to protect health. If
concerns are substantial although the risk level is uncertain, consideration should be
given to short-term measures that can be implemented to protect health. This may
involve temporary provision of an alternative drinking-water source until the information
gaps have been sufficiently closed and the supply demonstrated to be safe, or appropriate
control measures have been implemented. In some cases both risks and potential
management measures may be self-evident. These generally relate to elements of good
environmental practice which can be implemented without the requirement for a detailed
pollution potential assessment.
    Detecting information gaps during the situation analysis is an iterative process
which feeds back into improving the quality of the available information, and
helps ensure the inventory is relevant to the local region and water supply.
Although obtaining additional information generally requires more investment, it
is important to recognize that this effort is usually fairly minor in relation to the
resources that may be required to implement some engineered management
measures. The additional information may also be important in determining the
most cost-effective solution. It is often crucial to be able to convince those
responsible for financing management decisions such as funding bodies,
government, or donor agencies, to fund such investigations before beginning an
activity. This may be facilitated through ongoing consultation with these bodies,
and by ensuring that both the information inventory and the criteria used in
assessing its value as a basis for selecting management options are well
documented and supported by the water consumers.

15.2       PRIORITIZING POLLUTANTS IN GROUNDWATER
           WITH RESPECT TO URGENCY OF MANAGEMENT
           RESPONSES
In supply settings where polluted groundwater may affect drinking-water quality,
adequate management responses for the protection of public health are required. The
determination of their urgency involves a site specific prioritization of individual
pollutants in relation to their sources (e.g. polluting activities) on the basis of the
following two aspects:
    • the extent of the existing groundwater pollution level (e.g. from monitoring data),
         or the current or predicted groundwater pollution potential of a contaminant in a
         given setting (as defined in Chapter 14);
    • the public health burden, i.e. severity and extent of health consequences.
    Management responses for contaminants with the greatest public health burden and
the highest pollution level or potential should receive higher priority than those whose
health impacts are mild or whose occurrence in groundwater is unlikely. This
prioritization approach is conceptually depicted in Figure 15.1.




Figure 15.1. Urgency of management responses required to protect public health
                  Establishing groundwater management priorities                      415

    The scheme in Figure 15.1 is similar to other risk ranking matrixes commonly used
for relating the consequence (e.g. severity and extent) of impacts to the likelihood of an
event occurring (WHO, 2004; SGWA, 1998; Deere et al., 2001; MOH NZ, 2001).
However, it is different with respect to the role of events causing groundwater pollution:
while in general reviewing the likelihood of hazardous events is of crucial importance for
risk assessment, groundwater pollution tends to be a more continuous process, e.g. from
leaky sewers, poorly sited or designed latrines, waste disposal sites or agricultural
activities. Although a pollution event may suddenly occur on the soil surface (e.g.
through a tank truck accident or a farmer applying manure), occurrence in the aquifer is
often more continuous, and the time pattern with which the pollutant may appear in the
aquifer depends on hydraulic loading (i.e. rainfall patterns) as well as on aquifer
vulnerability. Nitrate is an example that highlights how discrete contamination events on
the surface may lead to continuous contamination of the aquifer.
    The pollution potential, as defined in Chapter 14, encompasses both aquifer
vulnerability and pollutant loading (in terms of pollutant load and hydraulic load) and
thus already includes an assessment of the probability that polluting events on the soil
surface result in groundwater contamination. Therefore, for determining the urgency of
rehabilitating or preventative management responses, the scale in Figure 15.1 is not event
likelihood, but rather pollution potential in terms of the probability of groundwater
pollution occurring.
    Tables 15.1 and 15.2 give an example of a simple prioritization matrix which applies
the general concept of Figure 15.1. The classification scales in Tables 15.1 and 15.2 are
based on a qualitative ranking rather than having quantitative values. This reflects the
uncertainty of estimating pollution potential and public heath burden. Such a ranking
scheme therefore has a relative nature: the aim is not a quantification of risk in absolute
terms, but to identify the management responses that need to be most urgently addressed.
    The approach shown in Figure 15.1 as well as in Tables 15.1 and 15.2 can in principle
be expanded to a quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment by reducing uncertainty
through improving the knowledge base. For the pollution potential, this would require
analyses of the range of contaminants in the groundwater on a regular basis as well as
monitoring or modelling of peak concentrations during events and changes over
extended time spans to identify trends in order to calculate the dose the population would
receive from drinking-water. For the public health burden, the categories for the size of
the population affected and the severity of the effect would be calculated and expressed
by the concept of Disability Affected Life Years (DALY) as a common public health
unit which summarizes all health outcomes caused by a certain disease agent (i.e.
chemical or pathogen) and provides an estimate of the burden of disease of this agent
(Havelaar and Melse, 2003; WHO, 2004).
    For most settings, however, the management of groundwater resources will be
substantially improved by a simple approach of setting priorities based on a relative
ranking of the urgency of issues as discussed above. Guidance for estimating the
pollution potential is provided in some detail in Chapter 14 and in Section II of this
monograph. Specifically for chemicals, Thompson et al. (in prep.) also provide guidance
on deriving priorities for management from the use of chemicals and the conditions in
416                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

the catchment. The following will briefly address some general aspects of ranking the
public health burden of contaminants which frequently occur in groundwater.

Ranking of contaminants according to their public health burden
Ranking microbial and chemical contaminants in groundwater in terms of their public
health burden depends to a large extent on site-specific factors, and it is not possible to
develop an absolute ranking scale that will fit all cases. However, as a general rule the
importance of contaminants in groundwater can be ranked in the following decreasing
order:
     • waterborne pathogens (Chapter 3);
     • naturally occurring groundwater constituents such as fluoride and arsenic
         (Chapter 4.1);
     • nitrate (Chapter 4.2);
     • industrial chemicals such as chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons (Chapter 4.3),
         pesticides (Chapter 4.4) or metals (Chapter 4.5);
     • pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors (Chapter 4.6).
    This ranking is indicative only but is typical of both the observed occurrence of
contaminants in groundwater and the severity of the health burden that they cause. It can
be used as a preliminary ranking if no other site-specific information is available.
    Waterborne pathogens pose a much greater immediate threat to public health than
chemical contaminants and are generally considered to have the highest priority for a
management response before chemical contamination issues are considered. In situations
where the pollution potential for pathogens is also considered to be high, the
implementation of management measures is considered to be extremely urgent
(Figure 15.1). Conversely, in situations where the pollution potential is considered to be
low (for instance, due to the fact that groundwater is being pumped from a well-
constructed deep tubewell in a porous medium aquifer), a management response will be
considered to be much less urgent, and addressing other contaminants, such as some
accumulating chemical contaminants, might have a higher priority.
    As discussed in Chapter 4, fluoride and arsenic n groundwater supplies may have
significant effects on public health. These contaminants are generally of natural origin,
and in many situations their concentration is low in groundwater. Their presence in
health-relevant concentrations in a given groundwater supply depends on local
geological factors and on specific hydrochemical conditions (Chapter 8) being present in
the aquifer to allow these chemicals to be mobilized from sediments or bedrock into
groundwater. Therefore it is essential to specifically address the possible presence of
natural groundwater constituents in the catchment-specific situation analysis. This should
include undertaking specific sampling and chemical analysis for these constituents, and
obtaining information about the local geological conditions to determine whether there is
a risk of land use or groundwater pumping increasing the concentrations of fluoride or
arsenic in groundwater. This information will help determine where these chemical
constituents should plot on the matrix in Figure 15.1.
    In some situations, nitrate is of concern to public health because of potential health
effects on bottle-fed infants (i.e. metHb, particularly in the presence of simultaneous
microbial contamination; see Chapter 4.3), the large inputs of this chemical to
groundwater in areas with intensive agriculture and/or on-site wastewater disposal, and
its tendency to accumulate in aquifers. The potential health consequences of nitrate
contamination will vary depending on the size of the population exposed (which in turn
418                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

strongly depends on social factors, i.e. prevalence of breast feeding and parental
knowledge) and this will affect where this contaminant will plot on the scheme in
Figure 15.1.
    With the exception of localized major point sources of contamination, exposure to
chemical contaminants such as heavy metals, organic pollutants (e.g. chlorinated or
aromatic hydrocarbons), and pesticides through drinking-water is usually a less
immediate threat to public health. One aspect is that the major exposure pathways to
these substances are usually air pollution and food rather than drinking-water (WHO,
2004). For protecting public health, management of these greater sources of
contamination might be more urgent than addressing their occurrence in water. Although
implementing management measures to deal with these contaminants is usually less
urgent for most groundwater supplies, there may be circumstances in which a situation
assessment may indicate the probable presence of very high concentrations in
groundwater due to local contamination, raising the management priority of one or more
of these chemicals.
    Pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors and most pesticides rarely occur in
groundwater in concentrations that have been shown to be hazardous to human health. In
most cases the ranking following Figure 15.1 will therefore result in a rather low urgency
for management response. However, in many societies there is increasing concern over
traces of pharmaceuticals and pesticides found in groundwater used as drinking-water
sources. Such issues may be addressed in the priority setting matrix by including other
criteria, such as public perception and value judgements, in addition to public health
burden. Where public concern over pharmaceuticals or pesticides makes the headlines,
management measures may indeed be ranked as urgent. However, scientifically
substantiated assessment of the public health impact will always need to be the most
important criterion for setting priorities and for defining the urgency of management
responses in order that resources are not diverted from more pressing public health
problems.
    In summary, the simple ranking scheme presented in Figure 15.1 and in Tables 15.1
and 15.2 is based on the relative likely health burden caused by a number of
contaminants, and not their absolute magnitude, and thus simply indicates management
priorities. Waterborne pathogens may cause immediate illness and their presence in
water requires an urgent management response either in the catchment or at the water
supplier’s operational level (i.e. treatment). Chemical contaminants usually require long-
term exposure to cause health effects. Consequently, management measures for
chemicals are of less urgency in most circumstances and measures may be delayed until
management responses for the control of pathogen contamination have been
implemented.

Assessment of persistent contaminants
Unlike waterborne pathogens, which survive in groundwater for a limited period of time
(Chapter 3), some chemical contaminants may persist in groundwater over a long period
of time, with little or no attenuation. In situations where there is a continuing source of
chemical contamination and the loading rate at which the chemical is leached into
groundwater is greater than the rate at which the contaminant is removed by physical,
                  Establishing groundwater management priorities                     419

chemical or biological processes in the aquifer, concentrations of the contaminant in
groundwater may progressively accumulate with time.
    The most common example of this behaviour is nitrate contamination in groundwater
in regions where intensive agriculture is poorly managed. Nitrate concentrations in
groundwater in these regions often continue to increase over many decades if appropriate
land use management practices are not implemented. Accumulation has also been
observed for various industrial chemicals (e.g. chlorinated solvents) and some pesticides
(e.g. atrazine).
    For such contaminants rehabilitation of groundwater quality is typically difficult and
costly, and interventions may be needed before concentrations reach health-relevant
levels. The process of prioritizing management responses therefore needs to address the
issue of contaminant accumulation by estimating trends or using a prediction of the
contaminant concentration in groundwater at some future time if no management action
is taken to stop or reduce the polluting activity or practice. An outcome of such an
assessment would be to indicate whether the contaminant could become an urgent
management priority unless the source of contamination were to be removed or the
loading rate greatly reduced. Such an assessment could be used to help set priorities for
progressively changing land use within a catchment area to protect groundwater quality
in the longer term or to introduce changes such as appropriate chemical handling
practices in small or large industries.
    Specific advice on predicting long-term nitrate concentrations in groundwater in
urban and periurban environments where there is limited information can be found in
Lerner (2000) and ARGOSS (2001).


15.3      SELECTION OF MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
The last step in the situation analysis for a groundwater supply is to select possible
management options that are appropriate for the magnitude of the health risk posed by a
specific contaminant. The range of possible measures for protecting groundwater from
becoming polluted through human activities is discussed in some detail in Sections IV
and V of this monograph.
   Once the urgency of an intervention to protect public health has been determined,
apart from the technical adequacy of the measure, selecting effective management
options also needs to consider the following aspects:
    • delayed response time between management interventions (i.e. removing the
        contaminant source) and measurable reduction of aquifer pollution;
    • barriers in place in addition to groundwater protection (e.g. treatment);
    • socioeconomic feasibility of management responses.

Aquifer response time
Aquifers tend to respond only slowly to changes in contaminant loading due to retention
processes such as adsorption and desorption to soil particles (see Chapter 4). Moreover,
due to slow flow rates and long retention times of water in many aquifers, elevated
contaminant concentrations may remain present for many years. This effect has
particularly been shown for contamination with chemicals such as nitrate or some
420                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

pesticides (e.g. atrazine). For example, the response time between successfully
implemented measures targeting the reduction of nitrogen loading from agriculture in the
catchment area and measurable reduction of nitrate concentration in groundwater can
range between a few years and several decades (Behrendt et al., 2000).
    In situations where groundwater used for drinking-water supply is contaminated and
where the implementation of management measures is assessed as urgent for protecting
public health, the delay in response needs to be taken into consideration. As discussed
below, measures in addition to those protecting or rehabilitating the aquifer from
polluting activities might be needed (e.g. water treatment, change of source) in order to
provide safe drinking-water.
    The delay in response is an inherent property of the groundwater system that cannot
be changed by any management measure. It is therefore important to recognize that
control measures for reducing chemical contamination (e.g. nitrate, pesticides) in
groundwater are likely to show results in the long term only and that short-term ‘success
stories’ are rarely achievable. When planning and implementing management actions,
this issue needs to be adequately communicated both to communities using the resource
for drinking-water supply and to funding agencies and politicians in order to avoid
misplaced expectations and disappointment that may impair the political or financial
support.

Multiple barriers
Wherever possible during the process of selecting management options, it is important
not to select just one measure and rely on it for the long-term protection of public health.
In particular, relying on water treatment alone to prevent health problems from
contaminated groundwater may be a high-risk management strategy for some
contaminants, particularly microbial contaminants. This could have significant public
health consequences if the treatment system fails or mistakes are made by the operators
of the system and water treatment is ineffective (O’Connor, 2002).
    As depicted in Figure 15.2, risks to public health can generally be minimized when a
group of complementary management measures are implemented together to ensure that
there are several barriers in place between a potential source of contamination and a
water consumer, particularly when the contaminant can have a major impact on health.
The presence of several barriers means that the overall water supply is protected from a
system failure or human error at any one point in the system because there are backup
protection measures, and thus the water supply becomes a fail-safe system. This multi-
barrier principle is one of the basic principles of drinking-water hygiene (WHO, 2004).
    Typical barriers in groundwater supplies include:
    • management practices in the catchment area to reduce contaminant inputs from
        human activities into groundwater (see Chapters 21-25);
    • source-water protection through control of land use in protection zones (see
        Chapter 17);
    • adequate design, construction and maintenance of water supply wells (see
        Chapter 18);
    • treatment of pumped groundwater (LeChevalier and Au, 2004);
    • ensuring adequate disinfection residual in the water distribution system;
    • protection and maintenance of the distribution system (Ainsworth, 2004).

Figure 15.2. Reducing health risks by using multiple barriers to protect a water supply (adapted
from Hrudey, 2001)

    The extent to which these barriers are needed will depend on an assessment of the
possible health outcomes of contaminants, the size of the population relying on the water
supply, the resources available for management, and an assessment of the costs of
implementing management practices against the possible benefits in the specific
situation.
    Many low-income countries lack the resources or expertise to implement a broad
range of groundwater protection measures, and in some countries it can be difficult to
convince key political decision makers of the importance of groundwater protection for
long-term water safety. In such situations water treatment or the provision of another
source of water are important immediate health protection measures.

Socioeconomic feasibility
Groundwater protection measures do not have to be expensive, and small incremental
changes over a period of time can greatly improve the quality of groundwater or avoid
degradation of quality. Even simple inexpensive measures such as ensuring that
defecation is not carried out within 10 m of a water supply well and ensuring that surface
run-off is diverted away from the well will significantly reduce public health risks from
such a water supply (ARGOSS, 2001; Howard et al., 2003). Other groundwater
422                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

protection measures will require investments, e.g. constructing latrines, improving seals
on wellheads or improving drainage of roads. Funding for these may or may not be
available. Designating protection zones in the immediate vicinity of a wellhead or
extended further into the aquifer’s catchment may be inexpensive to the authority doing
so, but – as discussed in Chapter 5 – can disrupt the livelihoods of inhabitants of the land
above the aquifer or can have substantial economic consequences for them. In some
settings, though interventions may appear appropriate in theory, institutional capacity is
too weak to implement them.
    Unless a catchment is largely uninhabited and unused by humans, the aquifer
protection measures introduced in Sections IV and V of this monograph will often
intervene in the way people are currently doing things, and will work only if the
stakeholders in the catchment are willing to make changes. This pertains to land use in
general, but also to practices, e.g. in agriculture, sanitation or handling and storing
hazardous chemicals. Therefore, while for a given setting the urgency of mitigating or
preventing groundwater contamination is determined from an assessment of pollution
potential and public health burden (Section 15.2), selecting appropriate management
measures requires a further step, i.e. assessing their feasibility in the specific setting.
Feasibility depends on a variety of factors, such as cultural values, public perception,
education, land tenure rights, socioeconomic status, legal requirements and institutional
capacities (see Chapters 5 and 20). These factors need to be evaluated in relation to the
management responses envisaged. The result of such an evaluation may be that
socioeconomic measures are a crucial part of the management package, equally or even
more important than the actual technical measures to protect the aquifer.
    As discussed in some detail in Chapter 5, public communication and consultation is
not only an important tool for assessing the potential of aquifer pollution and the
feasibility of measures suggested by scientists and engineers. Beyond this, participation
of the population affected by groundwater protection measures is key to developing
approaches that will be supported locally and can therefore be implemented more
readily. Where people’s livelihoods are positively affected by a protection measure,
rather than the measure being perceived as only having a negative impact, particularly in
the short term, interventions are more likely to be accepted and maintained. It is
important to communicate that increasing costs arise not only from the protection of the
resource, but also from its deterioration. In this context, there may be conflicting interests
between different stakeholders in the catchment. For example, abandoning a resource
and piping in water from a more distant one in order to be able to continue a polluting
activity may be in the interest of some, but others who could not afford a more expensive
supply would prefer protection. The planning of groundwater protection measures will
need to consider how the needs of all stakeholders can best be incorporated into the
policy, and how costs can be minimized while maximizing protection.
    Figure 15.3 conceptually depicts that both urgency of an intervention and the
feasibility in a given setting will determine which type of management action can be
taken. Management responses to technically similar problems may be very different
between settings, depending on what is locally feasible.

Figure 15.3. Selection of management responses in relation to their urgency and feasibility

    The upper right-hand corner of Figure 15.3 shows that where urgent groundwater
protection measures are assessed to be feasible, the key management action is their rapid
implementation. Additional short-term measures at the point of consumption (e.g.
treatment) may be necessary until the groundwater quality shows a response to the
protection measure (see example settings A and C in Table 15.3). Where interventions
are urgent, but it is not feasible to improve groundwater in the medium term (bottom
right-hand corner of Figure 15.3), the primary response to protect public health will be
management actions other than groundwater protection, as safe groundwater is not likely
to become available in the short term (see example setting B in Table 15.3). However,
these tend to involve either use of a more distant source or treatment, both of which are
costly. In settings in which an aquifer can still be rehabilitated, an extended process of
community consultation and discussion may therefore lead to additional action for
groundwater protection or remediation in the longer term. As discussed in Chapter 5,
feasibility may be increased by socioeconomic measures such as compensation
payments for restrictions on land use, but also by e.g. improving tenure rights to make
protection attractive in the longer term.
    A different group of situations are those in which management responses against
contamination are assessed to be less urgent (see Chapter 15.1). If feasibility is also low
(e.g. for protecting an aquifer from low levels of pesticides), no action would be taken
other than improving risk communication to the public if there is a concern (bottom left-
hand corner of Figure 15.3). However, where measures to prevent such pollution are
feasible (upper left-hand corner of Figure 15.3; see example setting E in Table 15.3),
424                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

implementing such measures would be appropriate. Such a decision would follow the
precautionary principle. Precautionary action is likely to be more feasible in settings in
which the public perception values the resource and clean water is a widely accepted
goal, and particularly where the overall public health and socioeconomic conditions
enable such a priority to be set.

   Management actions for the contaminants ranked as urgent may result in
simultaneous remediation of those with a lower urgency ranking, e.g. where nitrate
loading from human excreta occurs together with faecal indicators, measures reducing
the latter are likely to also reduce the former. Such benefits need to be included in the
case for measures that are being proposed.
   Generally, where socioeconomic conditions indicate that the availability of financial
resources for advanced drinking-water treatment is low, maintaining groundwater quality
as a cheap and safe resource not requiring treatment may be particularly important.
Under these circumstances it is probable that the situation analysis would identify aquifer
and/or wellhead protection as a high priority.
   The important exception to the general scheme shown in Figure 15.3 is where
groundwater contains toxic natural constituents such as fluoride or arsenic at
concentrations that are of health concern. In these situations, groundwater protection
measures will not reduce the concentrations of these constituents and water treatment or
providing alternative sources of drinking-water are the only effective management
options. This does not mean that groundwater protection measures are abandoned in
these situations, as other possible contaminants derived from land use will still need to be
managed to prevent contamination of the water supply even if it is being treated to
remove the natural chemicals such as arsenic or fluoride.


15.4      DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING
Comprehensive and easily understood documentation of the situation assessment is
important as it enables both the decision-making process for a specific supply and the
information on which the decisions were made to be clearly communicated to water
consumers, regulatory and funding agencies and other stakeholders. In particular,
documentation is important for the following reasons:
    • Documentation of the sources of information that were used to make
       management decisions enables the quality of the information to be assessed. This
       can help identify whether there are any major gaps in the information used which
       may affect both the assessment of groundwater pollution risks and the measures
       selected to manage groundwater quality.
    • Potential water consumers and the general public have a right to know what
       potential contamination risks occur in an existing or proposed groundwater
       supply and about how these risks will be managed. Water consumers need
       assurance that their water supply will not pose a public health threat, and demand
       a high level of accountability from water suppliers and government regulatory
       agencies for decisions made about drinking-water safety (CELA, 2001).
    • A report of the results of the groundwater source assessment is a powerful tool to
       initiate discussions with a wide range of stakeholders about the need to protect
       the quality of groundwater in a region.
    • Good documentation allows decisions about water quality management to be
       easily evaluated and updated as new information becomes available.
426                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

     • Good documentation together with ongoing consultation with the community
         and key decision-makers helps secure funding and community support for
         implementing groundwater protection measures to ensure that drinking-water
         will not affect public health.
    The whole process of the situation analysis should be documented formally in a report
by the situation assessment team. As well as describing the results of the situation
analysis and the criteria for decisions made in the assessments, the report should include
the technical details such as key persons involved in conducting the situation analysis,
when the information was collected, the sources of data (e.g. from site inspection,
statistics, government bodies, universities, published/unpublished information), contact
persons for information, and the location and format of storage of the information. A key
component of this report will often be a series of maps of the catchment area showing the
aquifers and groundwater conditions, vulnerability, groundwater supplies, land use and
human activities which highlight the major potential sources of groundwater pollution. If
possible, these should be in GIS format at a common scale so that they can be easily
overlaid and updated.

Water Safety Plans: Risk management
approaches for the delivery of safe
drinking-water from groundwater
sources
G. Howard and O. Schmoll




The delivery of safe drinking-water requires actions to be taken throughout the water
cycle from the catchment to the point of consumption. The focus of any programme
designed to deliver safe drinking-water should therefore be the effective management
and operation of water sources, treatment plants and distribution systems (whether piped
or manual). This will demand action by water suppliers, environmental protection
agencies and health bodies.
   WHO (2004) outlines that the delivery of safe drinking-water is most effectively
achieved a Water Safety Framework, that encompasses three elements:
     1. Establishing health based targets for drinking-water based on evaluation of health
        concerns.
     2. Developing a management system to meet these targets that is termed Water
        Safety Plan (WSP) and consists of

         • An assessment of the water supply system to determine whether the water
            supply chain (from source through treatment to the point of consumption) as a
            whole can deliver water that meets the health based targets.
         • Identification and operational monitoring of the control measures in the
            drinking-water supply that are of particular importance in securing drinking-
            water safety.
         • Preparation of management plans documenting the system assessment and
            monitoring plans and describing actions to be taken in normal operating and
            incident conditions, including upgrading documentation and communication.
     3. A system of independent surveillance that verifies that the above are operating
         properly.
    The establishment of health-based water quality targets would typically be led by the
health sector taking into account local health burdens. These are not discussed in detail in
this text, but would include many of the considerations highlighted in Section I and
would be established in relation to a level of public health risk determined as being
tolerable. This may use epidemiological and quantitative risk assessment procedures,
which can be applied to both chemicals and microorganisms (Haas et al., 1999). More
detail is available on establishment of water quality targets in the third edition of the
WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (2004) and in Havelaar and Melse (2003).
    The surveillance component would typically be undertaken by a regulatory agency,
which in practice may be the health, environment or local government sector. This
component would incorporate many of the issues identified in Sections II, IV and V of
this monograph as means of monitoring of performance. Further descriptions of
approaches to be used are available in a variety of texts linked to the WHO Guidelines
for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 1997; 2004; Howard, 2002).
    The second activity of the Water Safety Framework is termed a Water Safety Plan
(WSP) (WHO, 2004; Davison et al., 2005) which is typically the responsibility of the
water supplier, with support from and collaboration with other sectors as discussed
below. The focus of this chapter is the application of WSPs within groundwater supplies
and catchments. This covers both supplies where the whole WSP will apply to the
groundwater, where the point of delivery is at the abstraction point (e.g. tubewell with
handpump) and those where groundwater forms only part of the overall WSP (e.g.
borehole connected to a distribution system). The principles and methods used in WSPs
draw on other risk management and quality assurance methods. In particular they are
based on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Process (HACCP) approach applied
in the food industry.
    As described by the multiple barrier principle, source protection is the first stage in the
production of safe drinking-water quality (WHO, 1993; 2004). When sources are
managed effectively, subsequent treatment costs are minimized and the risks of
exposures resulting from failures in treatment processes are reduced. Therefore, source
and resource protection is vital for efficient risk management (WHO, 2004). Protection
measures should be put in place that have been shown to be effective in improving water
safety as the first stage of a plan for managing the safety of drinking-water.

16.1      END-PRODUCT TESTING AND THE NEED FOR A
          RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH
The traditional approach to water quality management placed a great emphasis on the
routine monitoring of water quality. The results of analysis were compared against
acceptable concentrations in order to evaluate performance of the water supply and to
estimate public health risks (Helmer et al., 1999). The focus of attention was on end-
product standards rather than ensuring that the water supply was managed properly from
catchment to consumer. Although operation and maintenance of water supplies has been
recognized as important in improving and maintaining water quality, the primary aim of
water suppliers, regulators and public health professionals has been to ensure that the
quality of water finally produced met these standards.
    This reliance on end-product testing has been shown to be ineffective for microbial
quality of water, as evidence has emerged of significant health impact from the
consumption of water meeting national standards (Payment et al., 1991). In part this is
because most national standards have been set using bacterial indicators that are very
different from viral and protozoan pathogens.
    The quality of the source protection measures is an important component in
controlling whether pathogens may be present in the final drinking-water. For instance,
one study concluded that the degradation of surface water catchments was an important
factor in waterborne disease transmission (Hellard et al., 2001). The outbreak of E. coli
O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejeuni from drinking-water in Walkerton, Ontario appears
to have resulted from a combination of improper protection of the groundwater source
and a failure to maintain adequate chlorination (O'Connor, 2002). The example from
Walkerton particularly emphasizes the need for multiple barriers in water quality
management.
    End-product testing has a further weakness in that the number of samples taken is
typically very small and not statistically representative of the water produced in a
domestic supply. The focus on end-product testing has meant that action is only initiated
in response to a failure in relation to the specified water quality standard. However, this
typically means that the water has been supplied and may have been consumed before
the results of the test are known and the increased risk to health identified. As a result,
outbreaks occur and rates of endemic disease remain higher than when good practice in
relation to water quality management is emphasized. The reliance on end-product testing
is therefore not supportive of public health protection and whilst it retains a role in
assessing water safety, it should not be the sole means by which risks are managed
(WHO, 2004).


16.2      SCOPE OF WATER SAFETY PLANS
   Water quality management elements such as documented operational procedures,
monitoring process control measures and sanitary inspection have complemented end-
product testing in many water supplies for a long time. Beyond these, the need for a
comprehensive quality assurance approach based on sound scientific evidence and
understanding the risks in a given supply system has been increasingly recognised.
434                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

Quality assurance procedures are being applied more formally to water supplies,
including the use of HACCP and approaches based on the generic ISO 9000 Quality
Standard.
    The use of HACCP for water quality management was proposed by Havelaar (1994),
following international codification of the principles for the food industry (Codex
Alimentarius Commission, 1996; NACMCF, 1992). Subsequent initiatives have
addressed the application of these principles to the broader control of infectious disease
from water and wastewater exposures (Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001). The application of
HACCP principles have also been further described in relation to specific water supplies
(Barry et al., 1998; Deere and Davison, 1998; Gray and Morain, 2000; Deere et al.,
2001; Bosshart et al., 2003; Howard, 2003; Wülser and Trachsel, 2003). These
experiences were used as basis for the Water Safety Plan approach in the third edition of
the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality.
    The development and implementation of a WSP would typically be the responsibility
of a water supplier, although in many cases other stakeholders may have responsibilities
that must be fulfilled. Such plans should address all aspects of the water supply under the
direct control of the water supplier and focus on the control of water production,
treatment and distribution to deliver drinking-water. In some situations, the water
supplier will control the catchment and therefore will be able to identify and implement
control measures within the catchment. In other situations, the water supplier may not
control the catchment and therefore some aspects of control will require actions by other
stakeholders. These may still be incorporated within the WSP provided that processes are
set in place for communication of the findings of monitoring, and actions are identified in
the case of non-compliance. In these situations, the implementation of a WSP provides a
sound platform for the water supplier to take an active role in initiating and developing
stakeholder involvement for the protection of drinking-water sources (Box 16.1).
    WSPs can be defined for utility operated water supplies using mechanized boreholes,
disinfection and piped distribution; or for simple point sources of water where water is
collected by hand and transported back to the home manually (WHO, 2004). In the case
of small water supplies, the WSP may be defined by an external agency and be applied
either through a generic WSP for a technology type or be developed for an individual
supply using very structured guidance (APSU, 2005; MOH NZ, 2001; SGWA, 2003;
WHO, 2004). However, it will be expected that the activities required under the WSP
will be the responsibility of the water supply operator.
    Although this monograph deals with groundwater sources and their protection for
public health, a key value of WSPs is that they address the full water supply chain from
source to consumer. WSPs therefore demand action is taken in water sources and their
catchments (whether groundwater or surface water), in treatment steps (if any are
applied), subsequent distribution and household storage and treatment.
     WHO (2004) identifies that the development of an effective WSP requires
(Figure 16.1):
     • assembling a team that understands the system and can undertake an initial
         assessment of the system with regard to its capability to supply water meeting the
         specified targets;

    • identifying where contamination can occur and what measures can be put in
      place to prevent, reduce or eliminate contaminants (control measures);
    • validation of methods employed to control hazards;
    • putting in place a system for monitoring and corrective action to ensure that safe
      water is consistently supplied;
    • periodic verification that the WSP is being implemented correctly and is
      achieving the performance required to meet the water quality targets.


                               Assemble the team to prepare the
                                     water safety plan


                               Document and describe the system


                           Undertake a hazard assessment and risk
                        characterization to identify and understand how
                            hazards can enter into the water supply


                       Assess the existing proposed system (including a

                      Identify control measures-the means by which risks
                                       may be controlled


                           Define monitoring of control measures –
                      what limits define acceptable performance and how
                                      these are monitored


                          Establish procedures to verify that the water
                        safety plan is working effectively and will meet
                                     the health-based targets


                                 Develop supporting programmes
                      (e.g., training, hygiene practices, standard operating
                        procedures, upgrade and improvement, research
                                       and development, etc.)


                                Prepare management procedures

16.3      PRELIMINARY STEPS FOR DEVELOPING WATER
          SAFETY PLANS
16.3.1 Assembling the team
The first stage of a WSP is to assemble a team of experts who will undertake the
assessment of the water supply from catchment to consumer. This should be a multi-
disciplinary team including managers, scientists (e.g. hydrogeologists, microbiologists,
chemists) engineers (e.g. from operations, maintenance, design and capital investment)
and technical staff involved in the day-to-day operation of the supply. The latter are
essential as very often it is those members of staff who undertake work on the system
every day who have the greatest knowledge about the problems that exist. A senior
member of the team (usually the risk manager) should be appointed to help guide and
direct the team in the study and this person should be able to either make decisions
regarding investment or be able to influence others in the improvement of performance.
   The development of the WSP and supporting programmes (which will typically
involve actions by other stakeholders, such as environmental protection agencies) is
generally most effectively implemented when the skills required are drawn from a range
of stakeholders. For groundwater, this will include representatives of agencies
responsible for assessing the impact of pollution and implementing controls on land-use.
This may be particularly important when identifying control measures within catchments
where the water supplier does not own the land. Thus the WSP team can act as catalyst
for collaboration with different stakeholders and establish a sense of mutual ownership
for controlling contaminants at their source.

16.3.2 Describing the water supply
The next stage in developing a WSP is to describe the water supply. In the case of
groundwater supplies, this means providing information on aspects such as the depth to
the water table, nature of the lithology of the aquifer and unsaturated zone from drilling
logs, technologies used to abstract water, pump type and depth and the draw-down on
pumping. This stage should also clearly identify whether alternative water sources exist
in the community should there be need to take the source off-line at any time to effect
corrective action.
    The next step is to prepare a detailed flow diagram. The purpose of this stage is to
provide the basis of understanding the hydrological environment and the subsequent
distribution of drinking-water. The flow diagram should indicate the flow of water from
the recharge to the abstraction point, the nature of the aquifer and recharge areas, flow
times and vulnerability maps where available (Chapters 2 and 8 provide more detailed
information on how the hydrological environment can be characterized). This stage is
concerned with defining the hydrogeological conditions in order to understand what
natural processes may affect the quality of water. The distribution of final water (whether
piped or manual) should also be indicated on the flow diagram.
    Two examples of simple flow diagrams – one for a simple setting with a shallow
borehole and one for a more complex setting including treatment and piped distribution –
are shown below in Figures 16.2 and 16.3.
                                     Water Safety Plans                                437

   Finally, the flow diagram is verified in the field. This will involve site inspection and
for groundwater the use of conservative tracers and hydrogeological models. As
groundwater flow is often complex, the process of verifying the flow diagram may be
ongoing and it can be expected that the understanding of hydrogeological conditions will
improve over time as more information becomes available.

16.3.3 Identifying intended uses and vulnerability of the users
The intended use of the water supply should be defined to ensure that the requirements
this may place on quality are incorporated into the WSP. In some cases, there will be
more than one use for the water (i.e. domestic, industrial, irrigation) that may compete
for allocation of resources where these are scarce. The WSP and supporting programmes
should be clear in defining control in relation to drinking/domestic use. It is also
important to consider whether there are particularly vulnerable groups using the water
(i.e. immuno-compromised, elderly, infants) and to consider the socioeconomic
conditions and vulnerability of different groups using the water. This will be linked to the
development of the WSP and in particular relates to the hazard analysis and corrective
actions.

16.4       HAZARD ANALYSIS
Once the system has been described, a hazard analysis should be performed. A hazard is
a biological, chemical, physical or radiological agent that has the potential to cause harm
to health. The simplest method of undertaking a hazard analysis is to perform a sanitary
survey or catchment assessment to identify all the sources of potential hazards. Chapters
9-13 of this book provide information on the likely hazards that will be derived from
different polluting activities and sources of hazards as well as indicative checklists to
help assess their relevance in a given setting. The sanitary survey or catchment
assessment should lead to the preparation of a map that provides details on where water
sources and sources of pollutants exist within the recharge area. An example of a map in
a simple setting is shown in Figure 16.4.

point (adapted from SGWA, 2003)

   When undertaking a hazard analysis, it is often more effective to consider hazardous
events rather than the specific hazards that affect the water supply. A hazardous event is
an incident or situation that can lead to the presence of the hazard, and thus describes
how a hazard could enter the water supply. For instance, a hazardous event could be that
pathogens from human faeces enter groundwater from poorly constructed and sited
septic tanks, or that hazardous chemicals leach into groundwater when spilled by
accident at an industrial site. The advantage of using a hazardous event approach is that
the probability of the event occurring can be considered, as the presence of a source of
hazards within the drinking-water catchment area does not automatically mean that the
hazards will be found at a groundwater abstraction point.
   The probability with which hazards reach the aquifer depends on hydrogeological
conditions as described in the concept of aquifer vulnerability in Chapter 8 and on their
440                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

behaviour in the sub-surface as described in Chapters 3 and 4. By combining sanitary
survey or catchment assessment data, vulnerability and pollutant behaviour the
probability of occurrence of contaminants can be assessed (Chapter 14).
    As discussed in Section 15.2, in groundwater the occurrence of hazards may not only
be of an episodic (or event) nature but often is continuous and causes longer-term
pollutant loading and attention should be paid to times scales. They may also be related
to diffuse or multiple point sources rather than single point sources of hazards. Chemicals
that are intentionally released to land over long periods of time that have the potential to
accumulate in the aquifer, e.g. nitrate from fertilizers or manures and pesticides used in
agriculture are examples of hazards that build up over time and from a diffuse area. In
settings where the aquifer is moderately vulnerable to nitrate pollution, it is likely that
controlled use of fertilizer in line with best management practices will not cause
groundwater quality deterioration. In contrast, continuous over-fertilization in the same
setting over years or even decades can cause heavy long-term nitrate pollution. For
substances having the potential to accumulate in groundwater, the definition of
hazardous events (e.g. over-fertilization) is always also related to the protection of future
source water safety, as the present situation may not result in short term deterioration of
water quality.
    For natural chemical constituents affecting human health (e.g. arsenic and fluoride),
the hazard analysis should include an assessment of the geological setting to evaluate
whether it is likely that there will be any naturally occurring chemicals present at levels
that will pose a risk to public health. The potential impact of land use on mobilization of
chemicals should also be considered at this point. An initial comprehensive water quality
assessment remains a further essential component of the hazard assessment for
chemicals.
    The hazard analysis will direct subsequent stages of Water Safety Plan development
to ensure that control measures are managed, upgraded or put in place in such a way that
they will effectively control identified hazards. Undertaking hazard analysis and
assessing the risk posed by the hazards identified is essential: simply applying control
measures without considering which hazards are the most important will mean that risks
posed by some hazards are likely to remain high and resources will be wasted in
controlling hazards that may be irrelevant for the specific water supply.


16.5       SYSTEM ASSESSMENT
The system assessment stage of the WSP development uses the information gained in the
system description and hazard analysis in order to assess the risk of hazards occurring in
drinking-water, and the potential of the system to control them. It is a first step in
determining whether the water supply is able to meet the health based targets or other
water quality targets defined for the water supply and if not, what investment of human,
technical and financial resources would be required to improve the supply.
    System assessment is largely the subject of this book, with Section II introducing the
hazards, Sections IV and V the control measures and Section III discussing how to
combine information for assessing the risk of hazards occurring in groundwater. The
following section revisits this in terms of using these to develop a Water Safety Plan.
                                    Water Safety Plans                                    441

System assessment in the WSP-context will include further barriers such as treatment
that determine whether the risk can be controlled.
    For example, if a borehole abstracts water from a deep aquifer that has a significant
unsaturated zone, limited human development over the aquifer and the potential to use
legislation to control activities, the system is likely to be capable of meeting established
targets and control measures in the catchment can be identified. In this case, the system
assessment has not shown the need for any significant upgrade. By contrast, if a borehole
abstracts water from a karstic aquifer where there is extensive human development over
the aquifer and no disinfection, the system may not be able to meet the targets without
investment at least in a treatment step at the borehole. This example illustrates when a
systems assessment will identify that an upgrading of the system is required and the
investment needs. The system assessment, therefore, may identify immediate investment
requirements essential for meeting the targets. It is unlikely that all control measures will
require substantial infrastructure improvements and therefore even in situations where
improvements are needed, some readily implemented control measures can be identified,
monitored and managed.

Risk assessment and prioritising hazards for control
The definition of control measures should be based on a ranking of risks associated with
the occurrence of each hazard or hazardous event. Section 14.2 of this book discusses
how to assess the potential for contaminants to occur in groundwater. However, in
context of developing a Water Safety Plan, prioritising hazards will be more
comprehensive and will involve the assessment of hazards in whole supply system,
including steps after the abstraction of groundwater (such as disinfection and
distribution). A more generic approach to assessing risks and prioritising hazards is
therefore briefly introduced here.
    Risk is the likelihood of identified hazards causing harm in exposed populations in a
specified time frame, including the magnitude and consequence of that harm. Those
hazardous events with the greatest severity of consequences and highest likelihood of
occurrence should receive higher priority than those hazards whose impacts are mild or
whose occurrence is very uncommon.
    There are a variety of means by which prioritization can be undertaken, but most rely
on applying expert judgement to a greater or lesser degree. The approach discussed
below uses a semi-quantitative risk scoring matrix to rank different hazardous events.
This approach has been applied in risk assessment, and specifically for drinking-water in
Australia and Uganda (Deere et al., 2001; Godfrey et al., 2003); similar approaches have
been used in other countries, such as New Zealand and Switzerland (SGWA, 1998;
MOH NZ, 2001).
    Within this approach, severity of impact is categorized as three major types of event:
lethal (i.e. significant mortality affecting either a small or large population); harmful (i.e.
morbidity affecting either a small or large population); little or no impact. Table 16.1
shows the definition of a set of variables for likelihood/frequency of occurrence and
combined severity/extent assessment with appropriate weighting of variables. Table 16.2
indicates the final overall score of all possible combinations of the conditions. Table 16.3
gives an example of that approach for a scenario in an alluvial aquifer.

    While some approaches use a scoring method as indicated by the numbers in
Table 16.2 others prefer non-numerical classifications describing the risk (as indicated by
the shading; see also Table 15.2 in Chapter 15). It should be stressed that when using the
scoring approach it is the relative ranking based on the numerical categories rather than
the numbers themselves that is important. Furthermore, in using such approaches
common sense is important to prevent obvious discrepancies arising from applying the
risk ranking, for instance events that occur very rarely but have catastrophic effects
should also be a higher priority for control than those events that have limited impact on
health, but occur very frequently.
    The risk ranking approach allows the relative importance of different hazardous
events to be systematically evaluated. This supports decision makers to define priorities
for control within their water supply and can therefore maximize the cost-effectiveness
of the WSP.
    The outcome of system assessment is an identification of priorities for controlling
risks, of existing control measures that have been found to be of importance for
controlling risks, and of gaps in safety for which new control measures need to be
identified or existing ones upgraded.

16.6       CONTROL MEASURES
In the context of a Water Safety Plan, control measures are tightly defined as those steps
in drinking-water supply that directly affect drinking-water quality and that collectively
ensure that drinking-water consistently meets health-based targets. Therefore, they are
the basis on which control is assured and therefore they should always function reliably.
Control measures are activities and processes applied to prevent hazard occurrence
within the water supply chain or at the pollutant source, which control the risk posed by
the hazards or hazardous events identified on a continuous basis. Examples of control
measures for groundwater protection are provided in Chapter 17, for the immediate
protection at the abstraction point in Chapter 18, for hydrological management in
Chapter 19 and for specific polluting activities in Chapters 21-25.
    Control measures in groundwater sources can take one of two forms:
    • those that use natural attenuation processes to reduce or remove/inactivate
        pollutants (e.g. adsorption, filtration, predation, microbial degradation, die-off);
    • those that prevent or reduce pollution of the aquifer’s recharge area or ingress of
        pollutants into the water supply.
    Measures such as groundwater protection zones (Chapter 17) and hydrological
management (Chapter 19) combine both forms of control measure. In these cases,
release of pollution within recharge areas is controlled (although often not entirely
prohibited) within prescribed areas related to the time taken to travel to the water
abstraction point, and rely on attenuation, die-off and hydrodynamic dispersion to
achieve reductions in pollutant loads. When protection zones are used, there may be
extensive control on specific activities such as restriction on traffic, settlements,
agricultural activity and other human activity as discussed in Chapter 17.
444                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Measures such as wellhead and sanitary completion discussed in Chapter 18, and
avoidance, reduction and treatment of pollutants at their source described in Chapters 21-
25, represent the second type of control measure. These are all designed to prevent
contamination from either entering the supply or being released into the environment
rather than relying on natural processes to remove or reduce pollutants.
    The control measures should be able to influence the quality of groundwater and to be
amenable to control through action, preferably by the water supplier. For instance,
rainfall often exerts a profound influence on shallow groundwater and numerous studies
have shown that rainfall is a principal factor in water quality deterioration (Wright, 1986;
Gelinas et al., 1996; Howard et al., 2003). Rainfall cannot be translated into a control
measure because action cannot be taken directly to reduce rainfall. A series of control
measures can be defined, however, that relate to the importance of rainfall in causing
contamination. For example these would include providing diversion ditches to prevent
inundation of the abstraction point by contaminated surface water, maintaining infra-
structure integrity at the abstraction point and controlling pollutant releases through the
use of protection zones. Details of required measures are outlined in Chapters 17 and 18.
    WHO (2004) note that control measures included within the WSP should have the
following basic characteristics:
     • a monitoring system and operational limits can be defined that describe the
         performance of the control measure and which can be either directly or indirectly
         monitored;
     • corrective actions can be identified as a response to deviations in control measure
         performance that are detected by monitoring;
     • corrective action will protect water safety by ensuring that control is re-instated
         (this can be bringing the control measure back into compliance, enhancing the
         control measure or by implementing additional control measures);
     • detection of deviations and implementing corrective actions can be completed
         sufficiently rapidly to prevent the supply of unsafe water.
    Control measures should not be vague or imprecise as otherwise the management
action to be informed from the assessment of control status will be difficult to define. For
instance, control of agricultural pollution in a catchment may be a general control
measure, but would need to be translated into a set of specific actions, such as a seasonal
restriction on the application of fertilizers and manure, and restriction on feedlots within a
specified distance. An example for controlling nitrate pollution in groundwater from
agriculture by means of integrating the water supplier’s WSP and the activities of a
Regional Nitrate Committee in Switzerland is given in Box 16.1.
    Individual control measures will usually be designed for a specific hazardous event(s)
but it is unlikely a single control measure will provide assurance for all hazardous events
and situations; rather a suite of different control measures may be necessary. Table 16.4
below provides examples of likely control measures appropriate to groundwater sources.
    Many of the control measures for groundwater protection may have to be
implemented through the relevant stakeholders rather than by the water supplier. The
water supply agency, however, may take the lead as part of the WSPs supporting
programmes (see Section 16.10) in initiating specific controls in order to protect the
quality of the drinking-water source.
                              Water Safety Plans                                     445

  Box 16.1. Measures for controlling nitrate pollution from agriculture in the
                          Lenzburg water supply
The municipality of Lenzburg, Switzerland as well as the surrounding
municipalities, draw drinking-water from the same groundwater recharge area.
Each municipality operates its own abstraction wells. Part of the area upstream
of the abstraction zone is used for agriculture, and the rest of the upstream area
is covered by forest. Due to over-fertilization by agriculture, high nitrate
concentrations were measured at all abstraction wells in the recharge area.
These nitrate concentrations increased from 15 mg NO3/l in the early 1960s
towards the Swiss drinking-water standard of 40 mg NO3/l by the early 1980s.
The Nitrate Committee: On the initiative of the Lenzburg water supply (LWS),
all municipalities that were affected by increasing nitrate concentrations in
drinking-water, or that encompassed large areas with agricultural use in the
recharge area, collectively formed a Regional Nitrate Committee in 1987. Each
municipality appointed one district council representative plus one local farmer
as members of the Committee. In addition, a professional advisor from each of
the Cantonal Water Authorities and the local Agricultural Advice Centres, plus
a geologist, were co-opted to provide support to the Committee. The Nitrate
Committee is chaired by the LWS. All costs that result from the committee’s
activities are shared between all the municipalities involved according to a pre-
established formula.
N-min measurements: The Committee as its first activity organized public
advisory consultations for local farmers. In parallel, a nitrate regulation was
elaborated that did not come into force in the municipalities involved but was
set up as a target to be met by farmers on a voluntary basis. The regulation
included detailed maps at the single plot scale showing the results of soil
analyses and N-min measurements. N-min values represent the amount of plant-
available nitrogen at the beginning of the vegetation period, and therefore
provide the basis for defining an adequate amount of fertilizer to be applied. N-
min measurements are repeated every year, and the results are made available to
farmers, in conjunction with fertilization recommendations for individual crops,
through the Agricultural Advice Centre. All samples, measurements and
advisory consultations are funded through the Nitrate Committee and are
therefore free of charge for the farmers.
Subsidies for intercropping: As nitrate leaching occurs mainly between seasons
when fields lie fallow between two crops, the Committee recommended and
supported intercropping with nitrogen binding cover crops. If farmers fulfil
specific pre-conditions, such as prohibitions of tillage operations for a limited
time period, minimum duration of intercropping depending on the rotation of
crops, data recording by means of a field calendar, and use of recommended
intercropping species, then the Committee supports those activities by paying
intercropping subsidies per cultivated area unit, i.e. 400 Swiss Francs per ha in
2003. The plot-tailored fertilization together with intercropping has stopped the
trend of increasing nitrate pollution of the aquifer, e.g. nitrate concentrations
declined to 25-30 mg NO3/l in 2003.
446                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

      Municipality liaison: The role of farmer representatives in the Nitrate
      Committee is of great significance because they liaise between the farming
      community and the Committee, and thus with the LWS. On the one hand they
      represent the farmers’ interests to the Committee. On the other hand they have a
      duty to advise their farming colleagues in the municipality of the
      recommendations of the Committee. Furthermore, they have to check whether
      the statements made by farmers in their applications for intercropping subsidies
      are valid, and whether all pre-conditions have been fulfilled. If the liaison person
      approves each farmer’s application, then the Nitrate Committee will pay the
      subsidies for intercropping.
      Lenzburg’s Water Safety Plan: The WSP of the LWS identifies long-term
      nitrate accumulation in the aquifer as a priority hazard. However, the LWS
      cannot exert direct control on polluting activities by farmers, as it does not own
      the farmland in the recharge area. Therefore the WSP explicitly refers to the
      activities of the Nitrate Committee, i.e. controlling nitrate pollution (through
      fertilization recommendations and granting subsidies for intercropping),
      monitoring compliance with those control measures, and imposing sanctions to
      farmers in case of non-compliance (corrective action). Additionally to the
      integration of the Committee’s activities into the WSP, LWS carries out six-
      monthly inspections of the recharge area as means of verification that control
      system works effectively.

16.6.1 Validation of control measures
Validation is an essential component of a WSP. Validation is an investigative activity to
assess the effectiveness of individual and combinations of control measures in reducing
the risk posed by hazards or hazardous events. It therefore obtains evidence on the
performance of control measures and ensures that the information supporting the WSP is
                                   Water Safety Plans                                   447

correct. In some cases, the performance of an individual control measure may depend in
part on the performance of another previous control measure and this must be borne in
mind when defining performance criteria. This reflects the multiple barrier principle that
is advocated as part of effective risk management of drinking-water quality.
    The efficacy of each control measure in reducing or eliminating the risk of exposure
to pollutants should be measured directly against the hazard that it is designed to
mitigate. This requires a research stage where the performance of the control measures,
individually and in combination, is rigorously evaluated with regard to the hazards they
are expected to control. This stage can be undertaken in a variety of ways and in many
cases it is best to utilize all four. These are:
     • evaluation of existing literature (including Chapters 3 and 4 of this book) to
         determine recorded survival, attenuation and dilution of pollutants in the type of
         groundwater to be utilized;
     • rigorously designed field assessments of water quality and influences on quality;
     • laboratory experiments using model groundwater;
     • modelling of pollutant transport in groundwater.
    In many cases, the existing literature (including this book) provides much of the
information required to define control measures. However, as local conditions may vary
significantly from those reported in the literature, the use of well-designed field
assessments is often an effective way of gaining additional information to suit local
conditions. Such assessments should be based on intensive assessment of a
representative sample of water sources and evaluate data in order to define the
importance of different factors in causing contamination (Howard et al., 2003). Where
quality is poor, making improvements in the water sources or in reducing a pollutant
source can also provide a useful way to measure efficacy.
    The selection of parameters undertaken in such an assessment should relate to the
principal pollutants of concern. For chemicals, this process is relatively straightforward
as the substances of concern can be analysed and system performance in elimination
therefore be validated. For microbial quality, it is preferable for validation to be based on
assessments of control measures in relation to pathogens. It may be difficult to undertake
analysis of a wide range of pathogens and therefore validation may focus on a small
number of representative pathogens whose control would provide confidence that all
pathogens of a similar nature would also be controlled. However, it may be necessary to
undertake evaluations using indicator organisms as described in the example from
Uganda in Chapter 18. Wherever possible, the range of microorganisms should reflect
the range of likely pathogens. These may include E. coli and faecal streptococci as faecal
indicator bacteria, bacteriophages as index organisms for viruses and spore forming
bacteria as process indicators (Ashbolt et al., 2001). The primary purpose when using
such organisms is to assess the impact of the control measures on the levels of the
organisms and to use the resulting information on reductions as an indication of the likely
impact of the control measures on pathogens. The criterion for their choice therefore is
their similarity in retention by control measures as compared to groups of pathogensin
order to indicate system performance in pathogen removal.
    The outcome of validation is an assessment of how well the control measures in place
or envisaged for introduction are likely to meet the heath based targets. This may include
448                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

identifying the need for system upgrade as well as particular emphasis on monitoring and
maintenance of control measures identified as being key to safety of a given supply
system.

16.6.2 Establishing operational limits
For each control measure, operational limits of performance should be defined. These are
quantifiable levels of performance that provide an indication of whether the control
measure is functioning correctly (in compliance) or is not providing effective control (out
of compliance). The operational limits for each control measure should be identified
during validation, and their definition should be based on sound science but also take into
account practical considerations regarding limits of detection and ease of measurement.
Of utmost importance is ensuring that the operational limit is related to an action that can
be taken to bring the control measure back into compliance.
    Operational limits may be upper limits, lower limits or an envelope of performance
measures and are typically simple process indicators that can be interpreted at the time of
monitoring and where action can be taken in response to a deviation (WHO, 2004). For
instance, a groundwater protection zone may be defined as a control measure and within
this zone the discharge of faecal material from sanitation facilities is strictly controlled.
The operational limits in this case will be the absence of sources of faecal material (e.g.
from septic tanks or pit latrines) within the protection zone. If a new on-site sanitation
facility is constructed within the protection zone, the operational limit is exceeded and
therefore corrective action should be taken to remove the facility or ensure that the design
prevents contamination from occurring. The results of monitoring in relation to this
operational limit (e.g. presence or absence of on-site sanitation facilities) can be
interpreted immediately on observation and a clear line of action can be defined in
response to the deviation.
    Control measures may also be defined related to pumping rates if it has been shown
that the draw-down would substantially alter the protection zone above a certain level of
pumping. In this case, the operational limit will relate to the pumping regime (possibly
both in terms of allowed discharge and in terms of duration of pumping). Other
operational limits that can be defined would include stock density in relation to risks of
increased nitrate (Chapter 21) and simple measures of wellhead or sanitary completion
related to drainage (Chapter 18).
    When defining operational limits, it is important to avoid situations where exceeding
the operational limit will result in immediate health risks. It is better to establish
operational limits that are more conservative and still allow preventative actions to be
taken. If operational limits cannot be defined, it is likely that the measure identified
should be considered as being part of a supporting programme. For some control
measures, further limits may be established as ‘critical’ limits at which exceedance
represents a confidence in water safety is lost and urgent action is required. Such limits
tend to be related primarily to treatment processes, for instance disinfection, rather than
source protection measures.

16.7       OPERATIONAL MONITORING
Operational monitoring assesses the performance of control measures at appropriate time
intervals. It is essential within WSPs to ensure that the control measures employed
remain in compliance with the operational limits. An emphasis is placed on simple
techniques , which describe process controls that allow rapid, and easy measurement and
whose findings can be interpreted at the time of monitoring with actions identified in
response to non-compliance (WHO 2004; Davison et al., 2005). Examples of monitoring
parameters include turbidity control to sanitary inspection (Howard et al., 2001; Payment
and Hunter, 2001). This requirement for operational monitoring means that the analysis
of indicator organisms would not be included as monitoring parameters, although they
would be used in verification (see Chapter 16.12). By contrast, for chemical hazards it
may be appropriate to test for the substance of concern if the results is available within
sufficient time to allow for corrective action before hazard break-though, although the
analytical method may be different from that used for verification.
    Operational monitoring should be able to quantify changes in performance of the
control measure in relation to the operational limits and is therefore linked directly to
process control or management actions prior to an increase in the risk posed by a hazard.
Selection of monitoring parameters should relate to their reliability and sensitivity in
estimating performance of the control measure in relation to the operational limits. The
frequency of monitoring will depend on the nature of the control means and may in some
circumstances be continuous and on-line, whilst in others may be relatively infrequent. In
the case of groundwater sources, much of the monitoring will be based on inspection of
controlled activities in the catchment area (Box 16.1) and the integrity of sanitary
completion measures, rather than routine water quality testing.
    Monitoring may include testing for specific water quality parameters. This may be on
the source water or within the catchment area or surrounding specific pollution activities,
for instance around mine tailings or landfills. It will be important to define whether
monitoring should be of the pollutants of direct concern or whether sentinel chemicals or
other properties of water can be used as surrogates. This may in some cases include
monitoring of water levels or redox conditions if this will provide good information
about increases in contamination risks.
    Where water quality parameters are included in monitoring (for instance nitrate in
relation to agricultural pollution or inorganic chemicals derived from landfill leachate) it
is unlikely to be continuous and will be determined in relation to their adequacy for
monitoring the control measure in specific settings. In each setting, monitoring may
become more targeted during times of known elevated risk (e.g. seasonal influences on
nitrate release). In some settings however, monitoring of such parameters may be very
frequent for instance where aquifers are highly vulnerable and have rapid transit times,
thus allowing very short time periods for corrective actions.
    In summary, the indicators used in operational monitoring systems should be:
     • specific – the indicator should relate to a particular control and not to a broad set
         of interrelated factors;
     • measurable – it should be possible to translate the control status into some form
         of quantifiable assessment, even if data collection is based on semi-quantitative
         or qualitative approaches;

    • accurate – the indicator must provide an accurate reflection of the control
      measure status in relation to the operational limits and be sensitive to changes
      that are of relevance and changes that may lead to exceeding the water quality
      targets;
    • reliable – the indicator should give similar results each time it is measured;
    • transparent – the process of selection of the monitoring indicator, the method and
      frequency of measurement and the interpretation of the results should be
      transparent and accepted by all stakeholders.


16.8       CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Effective management implies definition of actions to be taken in response to variations
that occur during normal operational and incident conditions. Such corrective actions
should be defined for each control measure and documented in the WSP. Corrective
actions are those interventions that will be undertaken in immediate response to control
measures moving outside the operational limits defined. It is important that when
developing the WSP such corrective actions are identified from the outset. Identification
of corrective actions should not wait until a failure has occurred as this defeats the
objective of risk management. However, lessons learnt from incident conditions may
lead to improvement of corrective actions and thus these will not be static. Equally,
corrective actions may also be refined based on experiences from other water supplies.
    Corrective actions may be simple operational interventions, for instance if an
inspection identifies problems with the fence or deterioration in concrete protection
works around a borehole, immediate action should be taken to effect repairs. It may also
involve more complex enforcement processes, for instance if stock densities are seen to
increase in the catchment area, then action should be initiated to ensure that farmers
reduce these (for instance through legal notices). They may involve interventions that are
not possible to implement immediately or that will take some time to take effect, for
example when there has been an accidental spill of chemicals that has reached the aquifer
and which will require remediation through pumping and treating.
    Corrective actions may include longer-term action, for instance the redefinition of
groundwater protection zones as more information becomes available regarding
groundwater flow and pollutant movement. In some cases, the corrective action may be
limited to an increase in monitoring of a specific contaminant. For instance, if leaching
from mine tailings or landfills has increased but the consequences are as yet unknown, it
may be appropriate to install a monitoring network to monitor movement and behaviour
in the first instance to determine whether further action is required.
    Corrective actions may also include closing down a particular abstraction point until
the contamination has been effectively removed or has passed through the aquifer.
However, this option should only be considered when there are alternative water supplies
available. If the description of the water source concludes that there is no viable
alternative to the groundwater source, then it is essential that other corrective actions (e.g.
treatment) can be implemented immediately to prevent public health risks.
    Where a public health risk from contamination occurs despite the presence of control
measures, this implies that further control measures must be defined and implemented.
                                   Water Safety Plans                                   451

This will involve investigating the cause of the contamination leading to the public health
risk and from this data defining a set of new control measures to combat this risk. It
should be noted that it is likely that new risks will be identified over time, and these
should be assessed by periodic system validation (see Section 16.6.1). Furthermore,
levels of tolerable risk and the health-based targets established may change.


16.9       VERIFICATION
Verification is a separate process to operational monitoring. It provides a final check on
the overall safety of the drinking-water supply chain. Verification is not designed to be a
routine frequent assessment but a periodic evaluation of the performance of the WSP as a
whole. For utility supplies, verification is undertaken by the water supplier as well as
independently by the surveillance agency. For community-managed water supplies,
verification is likely to only be undertaken by the surveillance agency. Verification will
typically involve a number of actions including audit of the implementation of the WSP
and water quality analysis.
    Audits of WSPs are designed to assess whether these have been appropriately
designed, documented and implemented. As part of a typical audit, the records of
monitoring and actions taken to ensure control is maintained are reviewed by inspectors
who also inspect the infrastructure and results of monitoring to ensure that the WSP is
being adhered to. Such audits will also typically assess whether communication (both
within the supply organization and to regulators and users of the water) have been
undertaken in a timely and appropriate manner following guidelines set out in the WSP.
Audits can be equally applied to utility supplies (when internal verification will also be
assessed ) or community-managed supplies. In the latter case, the audit is likely to use
different tools but still focus on whether the monitoring is being performed appropriately,
whether control measures are functioning and whether this information is shared within
the community. Water quality analysis is also likely to be included within verification
programmes. Analysis of microbiological indicators is retained in such approaches, but
would be undertaken less frequently than in systems relying largely on end-point testing.
The range of microorganisms would be expected to increase to take account of the
diversity of pathogens being controlled, yielding information of greater value in
assessing performance of water quality management measures (Ashbolt et al., 2001).
    Careful consideration should be given to the selection of the indicator organisms used
for verification. E. coli remains the indicator organism of choice (WHO, 2004) and in
many situation thermotolerant coliforms can be used as a surrogate. However, where
possible other indicator organisms should also be considered used. Other indicators
include faecal streptococci, and bacteriophages. It may also be of value to undertake
tracer studies in order to verify whether the land use control measures will provide
adequate protection. This could also be linked to hydrogeochemical models and
contaminant propagation models where these are adequately calibrated and reliable.
    Chemical testing may be included both in monitoring and verification, but the
techniques used may vary depending on the objective of the testing. The parameters used
in verification should be evaluated at the same time as validation in order that they can be
calibrated against an acceptable risk of exposure. Verification is likely to include periodic
452                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

analysis of the presence and concentration of substances in groundwater. This may be
done at the source, within monitoring networks established around the abstraction point
or monitoring around the sources of pollution. The design of appropriate sampling
networks is critical and should provide sufficient detailed information to ensure that
preventative actions can be deployed in a timely manner.


16.10      SUPPORTING PROGRAMMES
In addition to process control measures put in place to assure safety, further activities are
required in order to ensure that safe drinking-water can be assured, including activities
which have to be undertaken by institutions and agencies other than the water supplier.
These supporting programmes are as essential to the delivery of safe drinking-water as
are the control measures and monitoring identified in the WSP.
   There are a number of types of supporting programmes, some examples are:
    • a water supplier’s documented policy and commitment to provide high-quality
         water supplies;
    • appointment of a senior member of staff as the risk or water safety manager who
         is responsible for ensuring the safety of drinking-water produced;
    • establishment of internal allocation of roles and responsibilities for assessment
         and management of risks;
    • established internal communication strategy within the utility to ensure
         information from monitoring is acted upon promptly and appropriately;
    • training provided to community operators;
    • design and construction codes of practice as well as codes of good hygiene
         practice established and enforced;
    • information exchange with regulators and other stakeholders;
    • a risk communication strategy to provide information to the public in times of
         elevated risk;
    • customer complaint procedures;
    • implementation of Good Laboratory Practice, including calibration of monitoring
         equipment;
    • staff training and awareness programmes;
    • securing stakeholder commitment to the protection of groundwater;
    • development of training and education programmes for communities whose
         activities may influence source water quality;
    • establishment of collaboration contracts with farmers or farmers’ associations
         (which may include financial incentives);
    • training of catchment inspectors;
    • mapping of catchment characteristics (e.g. land use; vulnerability; protection
         zones).
   The proper implementation of supporting programmes is essential for effective
control of public health risks from water supplies and should be accorded adequate
priority.
   In situations where the water supplier does not own the land that forms the catchment,
and thus has no direct control over activities in it, many control measures related to
                                 Water Safety Plans                               453

source protection may become part of the supporting programmes. Specific examples
may include, but are not limited to:
   • development and implementation of catchment management plans;
   • controlled density of stock in pastoral areas;
   • controlled application of fertilizers and pesticides in the catchment;
   • controlled access for the general public to pollution-sensitive areas in the
       catchment;
   • development of groundwater quality models.


16.11     DOCUMENTATION
The final part of the development of the WSP is to document the process, considerations
and criteria leading to assessments, and to ensure that people responsible for
implementing the WSP have a point of reference. Documentation is also important as
part of monitoring the effective implementation of the WSP. Therefore record keeping of
monitoring and actions taken is an essential component of the plan.
   Tables 16.5 and 16.6 provide examples of WSPs, one for a mechanized borehole and
one for a tubewell fitted with a handpump. These WSPs are generic and are designed to
provide the reader with a view of the type of material that may be developed. They are
not designed as finished plans for immediate implementation, but as a framework within
which WSPs can be developed. More detailed descriptions of WSPs may be found both
in Water Safety Plans: Managing drinking-water quality from catchment to consumer
(Davison et al., 2005) and the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, third edition
(WHO, 2004).

Groundwater protection zones
P. Chave, G. Howard, J. Schijven, S. Appleyard,

The protection of groundwater sources used for domestic supply requires actions at both
the wellhead (as described in Chapter 18) and the wider aquifer, and they should be
closely linked to form a continuum of measures. Unless the groundwater catchment area
is under the control of the water supplier, implementing the full suite of measures will
require actions by multiple stakeholders and intersectoral collaboration is essential for
success.
    Many countries have developed and implemented policies for preventing the
pollution of groundwaters. These commonly involve regulatory control of activities
which generate or use polluting materials, or control of the entry of potential pollutants
into vulnerable surface and underground waters. However, protection zones are not
applied in all countries, despite a recognition of their desirability (Bannerman, 2000).
This may be due to a number of factors, including the lack of sufficiently detailed
information regarding the hydrogeological environments (Taylor and Barrett, 1999;
Bannerman, 2000), or existing land uses that impede enforcement of such a concept.
Furthermore, poverty, uncertain tenure and limited capacity to provide compensation
packages suggests that such approaches may be difficult to implement particularly in
developing countries.

    Protection zones are particularly effective to control pollution from diffuse sources
(e.g. agriculture or traffic), while the prevention or control of point sources of pollution
may be achieved through rather straight-forward approaches such as permit systems or
other legal controls on the quantity, types of substances and places where discharges may
take place. The prevention of groundwater pollution from diffuse sources is more
problematic because the sources are less easy to identify and the impact is more difficult
to control. Thus effective regulatory control of diffuse pollution often relies upon
prohibition or restrictions of polluting activities in specific protected areas where impacts
on groundwater sources are likely to be serious.
    This chapter provides a review of the concepts of protection zones and provides
examples of different ways in which these may be applied. Simple, pragmatic
approaches are described as well as more complex approaches involving assessments of
vulnerability of the aquifer. The smaller scale approach of well-head protection and
sanitary completion in order to prevent contaminant ingress through short-circuiting is
discussed in Chapter 18.


   NOTE X            This chapter introduces options for controlling risks by
                     implementing protection zones. The information presented here
                     supports defining control measures and their management in the
                     context of developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16).
                     Water suppliers and authorities responsible for drinking-water
                     quality will usually have a key role in the definition of control
                     measures involved in the designation and delineation of protection
                     zones, but they will rarely be the only actors responsible for
                     implementation and monitoring. This rather requires close
                     collaboration of the stakeholders involved.




17.1       THE CONCEPT OF A ZONE OF PROTECTION
The concept of a zone of protection for areas containing groundwater has been
developed and adopted in a number of countries. Many have developed guidelines for
water resource managers who wish to delineate protection areas around drinking-water
abstraction points (e.g. Adams and Foster, 1992; NRA, 1992; US EPA, 1993). In
general, the degree of restriction becomes less as the distance from the abstraction point
increases, but it is common to include the area of the whole aquifer from which the water
is derived in one of the zones, and to restrict activities in such areas in order to give
general long-term protection.
   Commonly, zones are delineated to achieve the following levels of protection:
    • A zone immediately adjacent to the site of the well or borehole to prevent rapid
        ingress of contaminants or damage to the wellhead (often referred to as the
        wellhead protection zone).
                             Groundwater protection zones                              467

    • A zone based on the time expected to be needed for a reduction in pathogen
        presence to an acceptable level (often referred to as the inner protection zone).
    • A zone based on the time expected to be needed for dilution and effective
        attenuation of slowly degrading substances to an acceptable level (often referred
        to as the outer protection zone). A further consideration in the delineation of this
        zone is sometimes also the time needed to identify and implement remedial
        intervention for persistent contaminants.
    • A further, much larger zone sometimes covers the whole of the drinking-water
        catchment area of a particular abstraction where all water will eventually reach
        the abstraction point. This is designed to avoid long term degradation of quality.
    The number of zones defined to cover these function varies between countries,
usually from 2-4. By placing some form of regulatory control on activities taking place
on land which overlies vulnerable aquifers, their impact on the quality (and in some cases
quantity) of the abstracted water can be minimized. The concept can be applied to
currently utilized groundwaters and to unused aquifers which might be needed at some
time in the future. Legislation not directly related to pollution prevention, such as those
related to planning, industrial production and agriculture, may be used to adjust or limit
the extent to which activities that could impact upon the aquifer take place in the
protection zone. In order to implement such policies, there must, of course, be adequate
supporting legislation available to control these activities. As noted in Chapters 5, 7 and
20 such legislation may need to consider compensation packages to account for potential
lost earnings of land users whose activities may be controlled to protect underlying
groundwater.


17.2       DELINEATING PROTECTION ZONES
Groundwater protection zones have developed historically, using a variety of concepts
and principles. Although some include prioritization schemes for land use, all aim at
controlling polluting activities around abstraction points to reduce the potential for
contaminants to reach the groundwater that is abstracted. Criteria commonly used for
these include the following:
    • Distance: the measurement of the distance from the abstraction point to the point
        of concern such as a discharge of effluent or the establishment of a development
        site.
    • Drawdown: the extent to which pumping lowers the water table of an unconfined
        aquifer. This is effectively the zone of influence or cone of depression.
    • Time of travel: the maximum time it takes for a contaminant to reach the
        abstraction point.
    • Assimilative capacity: the degree to which attenuation may occur in the sub-
        surface to reduce the concentration of contaminants.
    • Flow boundaries: demarcation of recharge areas or other hydrological features
        which control groundwater flow.
   Approaches using such criteria range from relatively simple methods based on fixed

Figure 17.1. Approaches to delineating groundwater protection zones

   In order to address some of the fundamental weaknesses in fixed distance approaches,
more sophisticated protection zones can be defined based primarily on travel time of
water through the saturated zone. For this purpose tracers are often used to acquire
information about flow velocities and directions, and an overview of available tracer
methods is given in Box 17.1.
   Travel time approaches are more realistic in that they attempt to incorporate more
empirical evidence, usually related to expected die-off of microbes or dilution of
chemicals in defining the land area to be protected. Commonly time criteria are
established that provide confidence that the concentration of contaminants will have been
reduced to an acceptable level. Although such approaches are better able to reflect local
conditions, there remain considerable uncertainties in the degree of protection afforded.
In particular these approaches may not be the most cost-effective as they fail to take into
account removal of contaminants through attenuation.

          Box 17.1. Tracers used in defining groundwater protection zones
A key element in defining groundwater protection zones when using
quantitative approaches is to identify tools that allow identification of basic
hydrogeological parameters, such as flow rates and patterns, and to predict how
pollutants will move through the subsurface. The latter is of particular
importance as a means of quantifying the impact of attenuation and dilution.
The use of tracer tests is therefore highly recommended to acquire information
about flow velocities and directions, hydraulic connections and hydrodynamic
dispersion. Tracer substances can be divided in to two main groups: natural and
artificial tracers. Natural tracers are already present in the study area and do not
have to be added artificially to the system whereas artificial tracers have to be
injected. The most common natural tracers are environmental isotopes and
chemicals, organisms and physical effects such as temperature. Artificial tracers
are dyes (fluorescent and non-fluorescent), salts, radioactive tracers, activable
isotope tracers and particles (spores, bacteria, phages, microparticles, etc.).
Table 17.1 provides a summary of selected tracers that are commonly used.

   The most sophisticated approaches to groundwater protection zone definition are
based on calculated log-reductions in microbial concentrations or reductions in chemical
concentrations that can be achieved through attenuation and dilution as contaminants
move through the soil, unsaturated and saturated zones. These approaches require much
greater knowledge of local conditions and the expected reductions that may be achieved
through attenuation. They do, however, provide much more realistic estimates of the land
area where control should be exerted on polluting activities, and thus may be
components of quantitative risk assessments. These may involve assessment of the
hazard arising from a particular activity, examination of the vulnerability of the
underground water to pollution, and consideration of the possible consequences which
would occur as a result of contamination.
   Local conditions determine the choice of method as this depends upon the amount of
expertise and data available. Technical considerations should include ease of
applicability, extent of use, simplicity of data, suitability to the area’s hydrogeological
                            Groundwater protection zones                             471

character and accuracy required for decision-making purposes. The choice should also be
related to relevance to the protection goal, and therefore may also include approaches
that employ prioritization schemes for land use. Within each of the approaches adopted,
it is important to also bear in mind the importance of other factors such as other
sanitation provisions, economic impact and social norms.
    The following sections briefly discuss approaches to defining and characterizing
protection zones that have been adopted in different countries. Depending on the level of
technical expertise and objectives of the groundwater protection, they are based chiefly
on distance or travel time approaches (Section 17.3), or include more hydrogeological
information to assess vulnerability (Section 17.4). A recent development is to assess
contaminant loading and attenuation in order to use a risk assessment for protection zone
delineation (Section 17.5). A supplementary criterion used in some countries is to
include an assessment of current and future land use priorities in developing groundwater
protection schemes (Section 17.6).


17.3      FIXED RADIUS AND TRAVEL TIME APPROACHES
The simplest form of zoning employs fixed-distance methods where activities are
excluded within a uniformly applied specified distance around abstraction points. These
methods use expert judgement and experience and have been widely applied. There is
limited direct scientific evidence to underpin most fixed-distance approaches, as they do
not take into account local hydrogeological conditions and aquifer vulnerability or the
interaction between adjacent wells and the impact that this may have on local flow
conditions. This reduces the confidence in the degree of protection that is provided.
These approaches are often used when there is limited information on the hydrogeology
of an area and are a practical means of ensuring a measure of immediate protection.
    Fixed radius approaches are used in a number of countries for defining a protection
zone around the immediate vicinity of the wellhead, chiefly designed to protect the wells
from pollution by short cuts. For example, in Germany this zone is set at a minimum of
10 m for wells, 20 m for springs and 30 m for wells in karst aquifers. The Swiss, Danish
and Austrian protection schemes also use an innermost zone of 10 m radius. In Australia
the wellhead protection zone is a concentric area comprising the operational compound
surrounding for the well and is often, but not always, defined as a 50 m radius within
which the most stringent controls on land use and materials apply.
    Distance approaches to define protection zones targeting effective attenuation of
pathogens and/or substances to acceptable levels, often underpinned by travel time
concepts, are also used. This may follow the calculated fixed radius or variable shape
approach (see Figure 17.1). In practice travel times are not always determined for each
specific setting, and both approaches may be used together, as is the case in Ireland and
Denmark (see below).
    They may also be supplemented by analytical methods and hydrological modelling, if
sufficient scientific expertise and data is available. The delineation of protection zones
can then be based on such issues as the recorded or modelled movement of pollutants
through the groundwater area. In such cases, zones may not be simple concentric circles
around abstraction points, but their boundaries follow the calculated time of travel of
472                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

chosen parameters. This may be important in heavily developed areas where the
imposition of restrictions within a defined area may have economic repercussions.
   Examples from a number of countries are summarized in Table 17.2. These examples
highlight how fixed distance and travel time approaches are used in practice in different
countries, and selected approaches among these are discussed in the following. In some
countries, however, fixed radius and travel time approaches are supplemented by more
sophisticated methods as discussed in the following sub-sections.

Ireland
In Ireland, individual public water supply sources are identified and protection zones
established around them – termed Source Protection Areas (SPA). Two SPAs are
delineated – an inner protection area and an outer protection area (DoELG, 1999). Both
areas may be identified either on the basis of a simple zoning using an arbitrary fixed
radius where scientific and geological data is in short supply, or using hydrogeological
methods based on local data or modelling.
    Inner protection areas are intended to protect the source from the effects of an activity
that could have an immediate effect on water quality, and is defined as a 100-day time of
travel from any point below the water table. 100 days is chosen by Ireland as a
conservative limit to allow for the heterogeneous nature of Irish aquifers and to allow for
the attenuation and die-off of bacteria and viruses which may live beyond 50 days. In
some karstic areas it is not possible to identify 100-day boundaries, in which case the
whole aquifer becomes a SPA. If the arbitrary fixed radius method is used, 300 m is
taken as an equivalent distance. The outer protection areas covers the zone of the aquifer,
the recharge of which supports the long-term abstraction of the individual source (or the
complete catchment if this is the contributing area), or, using the arbitrary fixed radius
method, 1000 m.
    In this example, although travel time is used as the underlying concept for defining
the protection zone, simple practical measures based on a broad knowledge of the
groundwater system are used to define protection zones. Generally, such approaches may
                            Groundwater protection zones                              473

have particular value for small supplies where gaining access to hydrogeological
expertise may be difficult or expensive.

Ghana
In crystalline rock terrains such as that found in Ghana, the protection of boreholes
cannot be simply achieved by establishing protection zones. This is because
heterogeneous materials developed in the weathered zone and in fractures in the bedrock
provide viable flow paths for contaminants from indiscriminately located latrines, waste
dumps and other pollution sources at far away places (Bannerman, 2000). The high
groundwater velocities would result in groundwater protection areas covering the major
parts of communities’ aquifers and hence may make them impractical to achieve.
    In Ghana, a pragmatic time-of-travel approach has been adopted with which to define
protection area boundaries. Three protective zones are designated. Zone I covers an area
of radius 10-20 m around a production well and is designed to protect it against short-
circuit contamination at the well site. Zone II is situated around Zone I, and comprises
the zone between the well field and a line from which the groundwater will flow at least
50 days until it reaches the production well. The choice of this travel time for Ghana was
developed from experience elsewhere though it may not be applicable under all
conditions. Zone III is a buffer zone between the recharge area and Zone II. If the water
is produced from a spring, the zone should not be less than 20 m on the upstream (uphill
side) of the water source.

United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom decisions on protection zones are taken on the basis of assessing
the likely impact of a pollutant and the degree to which attenuation occurs in the
geological strata influencing the source. According to the national groundwater
protection policy (NRA, 1992), three distinct protection zones are recognized in the
vicinity of abstraction points:
    The Inner Source Protection Zone (Zone I) is located immediately adjacent to the
groundwater source, and is designed to protect against the effects of activities which
would have an immediate outcome on the source, in particular in relation to the release
of pathogens into groundwater. It is defined as the area within which water would take
50 days to reach the abstraction point from any point below the water table, subject to a
minimum of 50 m radius from the source.
    The Outer Source Protection Zone (Zone II) is an area defined by a 400 day travel
time to the source. It is based upon the time needed for the attenuation of slowly
degrading pollutants. In England and Wales this is further modified for aquifers of high
water storage capacity, such as sandstones, to allow for Zone II to cover either the area
corresponding to 400 days, or the whole of the recharge area, calculated on the basis of
25 per cent of the long term abstraction rate for the source.
    There is a further zone (Zone III) which covers the whole of the catchment area of the
source, based on the area needed to maintain abstraction assuming that all water will
eventually reach the abstraction point. In some cases, where the aquifer is confined, it is
possible that the protection area is remote from the site of the source.
474                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

Denmark
Denmark has used a protection system which takes account of existing abstraction wells
and utilizes two zones. The first is a 10 m fixed radius zone immediately surrounding the
abstraction point to provide for technical and hygienic protection. The second zone of 60
days travel time or 300 m radius acts as an outer protection area to take account of
contaminants which degrade more slowly.
    Problems in dealing with pesticide contamination have also led to the consideration of
a 10-20 year zone in which pesticides would be controlled. Evidence of continuing
problems with groundwater quality, particularly in respect of pesticide contamination
and rising nitrate levels, led the Danish Government to adopt a three zone system in 1998
to prioritize the expenditure of money and effort in controlling, particularly, point sources
of pollution (Stockmarr, 1998) (discussed below in Section 17.6).

Germany
In Germany guidelines on the definition of zones are available through a code of practice
(DVGW, 1995). It defines three zones. The Well Field Protection Zone (Zone I) is
designed to protect individual wells and their immediate environment against any
contamination and interference and has fixed dimensions of 10 m. A Narrow Protection
Zone (Zone II) aims to provide protection against contamination by pathogenic bacteria
and viruses and is based on a 50 day travel time. Due to the area of land required to meet
the 50-day criterion, fixing a boundary is often not possible in karst terrains, mainly for
economic reasons (for example where existing development would have to be removed).
In such cases, Zone II may be smaller, but should in any case comprise all areas from
which an increased risk to the karst aquifer may emanate.
    A Wide Protection Zone (Zone III) serves to protect wells against long-range
impairments, notably against contamination by non-degradable or less readily degradable
chemical or radioactive substances, and usually covers the entire subsurface catchment
area. If the catchment area is very large, with a boundary more than 2 km from the well,
it may be sub-divided into Zone III A and Zone III B, with different levels of land use
restrictions.
    The Code of Practice also addresses particular cases such as the definition of
protection zone boundaries for very large catchment areas or when several wells are
located in the same catchment area. In general, the size of the area to be placed under
protection is dependent upon the abstraction and recharge rates in the catchment area, the
higher the abstraction rate the larger the protection zones to be defined. The Code of
Practice also includes guidance for the definition of protection zone boundaries in the
case of water production from several (geo)hydraulic systems and in the case of artificial
recharge.

Australia
The Australian wellhead protection plan is a system of groundwater protection which
involves four components. These comprise a set of actions to ensure that the well is
properly designed and constructed (known as ‘well integrity assurance’) the setting up of
wellhead protection zones, an appropriate monitoring system, and contamination or land
use control (ANWQMS, 1995).
   The wellhead protection zones are based on the definition of concentric protection
zones around the wellhead. Zone I encompasses the operational compound surrounding
                            Groundwater protection zones                             475

the well, and is often, but not always, defined as a 50 m radius area within which the
most stringent controls on land use and materials apply. Zone II is arbitrarily defined as
the maximum distance a contaminant particle would have travelled if it took 10 years to
reach the well. Zone III corresponds to the regional protection area where greater than 10
years travel time is available. This is usually the catchment area of the contributing
aquifer.

Oman
In some countries, where water is in short supply and resources are very limited,
protection zones are used primarily to ensure that there is adequate control over
abstraction rates. This applies particularly to arid countries
    For example in Oman, because of problems of water derogation, the water resources
Council in 1983 decided that no wells should be constructed within 3.5 km of a
motherwell of a water supply system (falaj). The choice of size of the protection zone
was a pragmatic solution rather than being based on hydrogeological principles. Since
that date the protection of groundwater has been accomplished by the adoption of
National Water Development Areas – water protection zones designated for the general
protection from contamination, over-extraction, intrusion by seawater and adverse
development.
    The schemes used a colour-coded zoning system to identify specific limitations on
future developments and progressively on existing activities. Such zones were a response
to already perceived potential problems and were useful in providing guidance on future
developments within the water protection zones. However they had limited success in
dealing with existing development due to the problems of applying retrospective
controls. In response a new scheme using technically derived zones based on time-of-
travel periods has been developed to accommodate this (Government of Oman, 1991).
    The establishment of major government wellfields in urban areas to meet public water
supply needs was followed by the recognition that these needed careful protection both
as a water resource and from pollution (Government of Oman, 1991). As a further
refinement of the earlier water development area zoning system described above, a
revised water protection zone concept utilizing three distinct zones with relevant
regulation of activities within them has been adopted. The three zones use 365 days as
the time of travel to define the boundary of an innermost protection zone surrounding an
abstraction point such as a well. A second tier protection area which uses a 10 year time
of travel to define the boundary is established as a middle protection zone, whilst the
extent of the third and outermost protection zone is delineated by the catchment
boundary.

Indonesia
An integrated approach to ensure proper drinking-water quality in urban centres of
Indonesia has been developed by the Indonesian-German governmental cooperation on
drinking-water quality surveillance. This concept includes protection zones to protect and
maintain water resources in their initial function and allotment by a natural and
preventive approach. The zones are based on fixed distances for Zone I and on travel
time for Zone II, using hydrogeological mapping and a flow path model where
protection zones of different categories are defined. The following zones are applied:
476                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

   • Zone I is defined as the area surrounding the spring/well within a radius of 10-15
     m, which is fenced and where any activity that has interaction with the aquifer is
     prohibited.
   • Zone II is the boundary that is defined by 50 days travel time, to provide
     protection against bacteriological contamination. In order to determine the
     boundaries, a hydrogeological survey is conducted for each spring and well.
     Besides the restrictions mentioned under Category III, all possible activities
     causing bacteriological contamination are prohibited.
   • Zone III includes the whole catchment area based on topographical boundaries
     where the application of water hazardous pesticides, the infiltration of liquid
     waste, human settlements with unorganized discharge of the waste water within
     the catchment area and waste disposal are restricted. Clustering of several
     springs/wells in one catchment area is possible.


17.4      APPROACHES USING VULNERABILITY
          ASSESSMENTS
A number of countries (e.g. the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland) have introduced
vulnerability assessment of groundwaters into their protection policies (for a discussion
of the concept of vulnerability see Chapter 8). Such vulnerability assessments correspond
to the concept of system assessment in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan.
They can refine protection categories defined by fixed distance and/or travel time
approaches and allow a differentiated management response within a protection area.
Such systems are also useful outside of drinking-water protection zones for long term
planning of the protection of groundwater resources. Further, they provide guidance to
organizations concerned with major works activities that could cause problems of
groundwater contamination, such as the siting of new industrial or urban developments.
    The example of Ireland highlights how vulnerability assessments have been included
in protection plans. The Irish Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a
protection zone identification scheme based upon the division of the entire land surface
according to the vulnerability of the underlying groundwater to contamination (DoELG,
1999). In this system vulnerability depends upon the time of travel of contaminants
through the strata, the relative quantity of contaminants which can reach the groundwater
and the attenuation capacity of the local geology. These factors are dependant upon the
subsoil characteristics, whether the contamination source is point or diffuse source and
the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Assessing these factors results in classification of
the vulnerability of a given area as extreme, high, moderate or low. Such ratings are
based on judgement, experience and available scientific information. The resultant map
shows the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from contaminants released at 1-2 m
below the surface. Where deeper discharges are made, site-specific local conditions
would have to be taken into account. The characteristics of the contaminants are not
considered. This vulnerability classification is not only used for drinking-water
resources, but also applied to the whole land surface of the country.
    For drinking-water resources, the resultant map is then overlain with the simple map
of the inner and outer Source Protection Areas derived as discussed above in Section
                             Groundwater protection zones                               477

17.3 (Figure 17.2). This results in a map showing the vulnerability of both the inner and
the outer SPA. While the inner SPA will usually be too small to contain more than one or
two vulnerability categories, the outer zone might encompass all four. This map is the
basis for defining the level of protection to be implemented for each area ( Section 17.7)

integration of the SPA map and the vulnerability map (DoELG, 1999)



17.5       A RISK ASSESSMENT APPROACH FOR
           DELINEATING PROTECTION ZONES
From 2001, a new policy for production of safe drinking-water in The Netherlands has
been incorporated into legislation. This approach sets the health-based target of a
maximum acceptable infection risk of one per 104 persons per year associated with
drinking-water consumption. It then uses dose-response relationships for pathogens to
determine maximum allowable pathogen concentrations in drinking-water (Regli et al.,
1991). In the case of viruses, it is based on the dose response relationship of rotavirus and
poliovirus 3, as a worst-case. The maximum allowable concentration is 1.8 × 10-7 viruses
per litre. Together with data on the occurrence of virus concentrations in surface water
this implies that they need to be reduced by a factor of 5-8 log10 in order to produce
drinking-water in which maximum allowable concentrations are not exceeded. Drinking-
water companies that use surface water as a source (approximately one third of the total
drinking-water production in The Netherlands) are therefore obliged to conduct a risk
analysis to demonstrate adequate drinking-water treatment. Vulnerable groundwater sys-
tems may also be subject to this risk assessment. This raises the question whether current
478                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

protection zones of 60 days of travel time are sufficient and actually what travel times
and travel distances are needed to comply to the risk level of 10-4 per person per year.
    Therefore, and as a first step in a vulnerability analysis of Dutch groundwater well
systems to virus contamination, a hypothetical case was simulated to calculate the travel
distance and time that are required for sufficient protection against virus contamination
(Schijven and Hassanizadeh, 2002a; 2002b). The conditions assumed are given in Table
17.3 below. In this simulation a sewage pipe was continuously leaking virus. The virus
was diluted and transported with the groundwater that was abstracted by a single well
(radial flow). This hypothetical case was based on data from a field study on deep well
injection (Schijven and Hassanizadeh, 2000) and a number of conservative assumptions.

distances to adequately protect groundwater wells in unconfined shallow sandy aquifers against

    Under the anoxic conditions of the deep well injection study minimal removal of
virus was observed, i.e. there was little attachment of virus to the grains of sand and little
inactivation of virus. The same conditions were assumed to apply as well to a selection
of six unconfined sandy aquifers. The absence of confining layers together with the
shallowness of the aquifers and unfavourable conditions for attachment make it a
reasonable assumption qualifying these groundwater well systems as relatively
vulnerable.
    These and other conditions applied to calculating the required travel times and
distance are listed in Table 17.3. Concentrations of enteroviruses in raw domestic
wastewater from the leaking pipe need to be reduced by 9 log10 at the point of
groundwater abstraction. A steady state solution of a transport model incorporating
attachment and inactivation was applied to calculate travel times and distances to achieve
this.
    Virus concentration was found to be reduced by 3.1-4.0 log10 at the abstraction well
due to mixing with groundwater from all directions (radial flow). To account for an
additional 5.0-5.9 log10 removal of virus by attachment and inactivation, residence times
of about 8 to 15 times longer than the current guideline of 60 days appeared to be
needed, depending on abstraction rates, aquifer thickness and sand grain size. At a higher
transport velocity, removal with distance is less, but this is partly compensated by a
higher dilution factor.
    Although this hypothetical case was partly built on conservative assumptions, it
strongly indicates that a 60-day protection zone is insufficient by far to protect against
virus contamination from a nearby leaking sewage pipe. The situation may even be
worse. Concentrations of noroviruses in raw wastewater (Lodder et al., 1999) were
found to be 104 to 106 RNA-containing particles per litre as determined by PCR, which is
102 to 104 times higher than that of enteroviruses as determined by tissue culture.
However, it is uncertain what part of the RNA containing particles is actually infectious.
    Compared to the removal capabilities of sandy aquifers, removal of viruses in karst,
fractured bedrock and gravel aquifers may be lower. Such aquifers are identified as
sensitive to faecal contamination by the US EPA’s proposed Ground Water Rule (US
EPA, 2000). These aquifers have in common that more permeable pathways exist that
allow very high flow rates of viruses (Rossi et al., 1994; Paul et al., 1995; 1997). In such
pathways, attachment will be very low. Due to the high transport rate (short travel times),
inactivation will also be minimal. In gravel, removal of slug-injected bacteriophages T7
and H40/1 was only 2 log10 over a travel distance of 50 m (Rossi, 1994; Rossi et al.,
1994). This is about the same removal rate as for MS2 in a sandy anoxic aquifer. In fact,
T7 and H40/1 were probably removed more effectively than MS2, considering the
coarseness of gravel. Even considerable removal may be found in fractured rock, e.g.
about 6-log10 removal of MS2 over a distance of 20 m in limestone (Paul et al., 1997) or
1-log10 removal of MS2 and PRD1 over a distance of 0.5 m in a clay-rich till (Hinsby et
al., 1996). Nevertheless, it is obvious that preferred pathways, like fractures and
breaches, will contribute greatly to the uncertainty in assessing the removal capabilities
of a certain aquifer.
    As these examples highlight, using a risk assessment approach for delineating
protection zones requires an understanding of the elimination capacity of the unsaturated
480                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

zone and the pathogen levels expected to reach the well. Often this information will not
be available specifically for a given setting, and estimates can be derived from assessing
pollution potential as discussed in Chapter 14.


17.6       PRIORITIZING SCHEMES FOR GROUNDWATER
           PROTECTION
In situations where land use pressures are high – e.g. for increasing agricultural
production or where land for building is at a premium – and such land is also liable to
overly the available water resource, systems of prioritization are necessary to control
development of the land in such a way that the availability and quality of water supplies
is not jeopardized. The benefit of prioritization approaches is that they promote cost-
effective application of protection zones to take into account the need to balance
economic development and resource protection. Thus they may be used as a further
criterion in defining management responses, supplementing hydrogeological criteria
such as travel times and vulnerability assessments. This is currently practiced in some
countries, and examples are given below.

Western Australia
In Western Australia groundwater resources used for public supply are protected from
pollution by being proclaimed Underground Water Pollution Control Areas and using
by-laws to control activities which could potentially pollute such resources. Instead of
using simply an assessment of vulnerability to pollution, the Western Australian system
recognizes that water source objectives vary dependent upon the strategic importance of
the source, its vulnerability and other competing land uses. The result is a three tiered
priority-based system with management objectives for each priority area. Besides
vulnerability, these include such issues as designated beneficial uses (for example
drinking, irrigation, industrial, recreation or ecosystem protection), water quality, social,
economic and ecosystem value, and current and planned land use. This assessment
enables the areas on the vulnerability map to be classified in terms of the requirements
for protection, and allow action levels to be set to give the required protection.
   The city of Perth overlies a large fresh groundwater resource (see also Chapter 14.6
for further details). Groundwater forms an important component of the city's water
supply, providing 70 per cent of water used, and also maintaining ecosystems around
environmentally significant lakes and wetlands. The groundwater occurs as an
unconfined aquifer throughout the region, and in several confined aquifers. The shallow
groundwater in urban areas is highly susceptible to contamination owing to the sandy
soil, and in some areas this has restricted groundwater use, and has had an adverse
impact on wetlands. The growth of the urban area has overtaken well fields previously
located in areas of rural land use, and has compromised water quality. Land use in these
areas is now controlled by Priority SPAs. There are three types of protection areas:
    • Priority 1 (P1) SPAs are defined to ensure that there is no degradation of water
         quality used for public supply. P1 areas are declared over land where the
         provision of the highest quality public drinking-water is the prime beneficial land
         use. P1 areas include government owned land where there is no development, or
         use is limited to forestry or sylviculture.
                             Groundwater protection zones                               481

    • In Priority 2 (P2) SPAs previously existing land uses are regulated to ensure that
        there is no increased risk of pollution to groundwater quality. P2 areas are
        declared over land where low intensity development (such as rural) already
        exists. Provision of public water supply is a high priority in these areas, but there
        may be some degradation of water quality.
    • Priority 3 (P3) is declared over land where water supply needs co-exist with
        other land uses such as residential, commercial and light industrial developments.
        Protection of groundwater quality in P3 areas is achieved through management
        guidelines rather than restrictions on land use.
   In Western Australia a corridor plan is in operation. In this plan, urban development
takes place in northwest, southwest, southeast and eastern corridors ensuring that the
central part of the coastal plain, where the groundwater recharge areas are located, will be
essentially undeveloped, thus providing a further layer of long term protection. Future
expansion of the public water supply will take place by extending the well fields north
and south over the groundwater mounds.

Tunisia
In a further development of the protection zone concept for groundwater resource
management in Tunisia, in essence formalizing the Western Australian approach,
economic and social value factors have been introduced into the assessment of the need
to protect groundwaters (Findikakis et al., 1998). This is a useful concept where supplies
are very scarce, and where alternatives are limited, for example in arid countries. The
system uses three groups of criteria which take into account the physical nature of the
resource, its vulnerability to pollution or depletion by over-abstraction and the
socioeconomic value of the aquifer. This latter is an important factor where aquifers are
in isolated regions and where they form the main water supply source. The
socioeconomic value is based on an economic indicator that identifies the relative
economic importance of the supply taking into account the level of economic production
dependent upon the source, and the number of people dependent upon it.

Denmark
Since 1998, Denmark defines three zones in relation to value for use, the most critical of
which comprise areas of special interest for drinking-water (Stockmarr, 1998). These are
defined as areas sufficiently large to supply the population in the future, taking account
of other water uses. Such zones will be established in each administrative county and will
eventually cover about 15 to 30 per cent of the total land area. Areas of minor interest for
drinking-water are areas where groundwater is already heavily contaminated, and which
represent areas of land within which such activities as landfill operation should be
concentrated. These areas are generally expected to be a minor zone along the coastline
where abstraction is not generally practised. The third zone will comprise most of the
remaining land areas and represent land which may become important water supply
areas over the next 20 to 30 years, known as areas of interest for drinking-water.
   The areas are identified by reference to the classification of groundwater resources
taking account of precipitation and evaporation, median river water flows, run-off,
groundwater potential and catchment areas, relevant geological features, land use, and so
forth, and maps will show the groundwater resource divided into the three categories.
482                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

The resultant areas of special interest for water resources are then subject to limitations
on the use of land use for activities such as the location of industry or urban
development.

United States of America
A draft prioritization scheme was developed by the US EPA (1986). Although this was
never finalized and implemented, the approach may be of interest to readers of this
monograph. The scheme combines vulnerability, quality and the resource’s value to
society. Three classes are identified as set out in Figure 17.3 below. Different levels of
management of the overlying land are applicable to each class of groundwater under this
scheme.
   Classifying groundwaters under this system involves delineating a segment of the
groundwater body to which the classification criteria applies. This is known as the
Classification Review Area and comprises a two-mile radius from the boundaries of the
activity that may affect the particular groundwater (such as the edge of a contaminated
area or the proposed abstraction point). The review area is not necessarily a regulatory
area at this stage.




Figure 17.3. US EPA classification scheme (US EPA, 1986)

   Where important sources of water are concerned, i.e. the Class I category of
groundwaters, a ranking system (DRASTIC) is used to identify further the vulnerability
in order to enable suitable protection procedures to be applied. The method yields a
single numerical value, referred to as the DRASTIC index. The use of DRASTIC is
commensurate with the idea that groundwater vulnerability should not vary according to
the type of activity that is being evaluated. This system represents a common
methodology which may be used on an interstate basis.
   As an alternative means of assessing vulnerability, qualitative assessment may
sometimes be an option, wherein the selection of vulnerability might be based on site

setting, professional experience of the user, the availability of data, or previous
experience. However, this option does not permit the use of referred tests and methods or
other numerical criteria or decision steps.
    Most of the States in the USA also have individually developed groundwater
classification systems, as shown in Table 17.4.

17.7       MANAGING LAND USE AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES
           IN PROTECTION ZONES
The beneficial use of protection zones relies upon the ability to restrict polluting activities
in them. Commonly this is achieved through the activation of legislation which is
available under the land use planning or pollution control regimes of the country. The
designation of the zone triggers specific requirements, which are met by enacting
relevant restrictions or introducing permitting systems. Often it is not necessary to
introduce new legislation. The designation of the protection zone may require that the
484                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

body which administers planning or pollution control laws takes action to ensure that
they are applied rigorously and deal with the particular concerns brought about by
recognition of the special characteristics of the protected area. However, this may not be
trivial. Stricter application of existing legal requirements may require changes of
habitually established land uses (e.g. horticulture with intensive pesticide application),
and this may have substantial socioeconomic implications. Therefore, new designation of
protection zones may require programmes that include compensation payments or other
forms of financial support of current land users affected by the change.
    Furthermore, the implementation of measures to control activities in a drinking-water
catchment may be facilitated by integrating them into a Water Safety Plan (WSP), as this
helps communicate their importance for achieving the quality targets. Further,
developing catchment control measures in a WSP-team together with stakeholders
involved in activities in the catchment improves their understanding of these issues and
can thus improve their sense of ownership and responsibility for protecting the
catchment.
    In addition to identifying and designating the protection zones or vulnerable areas, it
is important to provide guidance on activities which are either acceptable, unacceptable
or need to be controlled in the various zones. Restrictions on land-use and other human
activities may become control measures in a WSP, and compliance can be monitored
through visual inspections in the drinking-water catchment. This is particularly feasible
in some countries where such lists are extensive and very specific. In others general
guidance is issued.
    In the following, examples will be discussed that show different concepts of
managing authorization or restrictions of land use and human activities in protection
zones.

Western Australia
In the Western Australian system where activities are planned to take place within the
P1, P2 and P3 priority zones (see Section 17.6), reference to specific guidance on
compatible, incompatible and conditional activities must be given. Activities which are
compatible may be undertaken without restriction. Those activities identified as being
incompatible with the objectives of the priority classification can only be carried out after
a formal EIA has been carried out. Conditional activities require appropriate site
management practices and referral to the Water and Rivers Commission (which is
responsible for water quality) for assessment on a case specific basis.
    As examples, Table 17.5 lists some of the commercial activities which need to be
assessed if they are to be permitted in groundwater protection areas in Western Australia.
Similar tables exist for industrial activities, agriculture, urban development, education
and research, mining and mineral processing, animal and plant processing, waste
treatment and a number of other categories.

Germany
In Germany the Code of Practice for drinking-water protection areas includes, for the
various zones, a listing of potential hazards and the resultant use prohibitions. Not all
hazards listed in this catalogue will apply to the catchment area of a given well which is
to be placed under protection and therefore local conditions are always considered in the
vulnerability assessment. Table 17.6 provides a summary of controlled activities in the
code of practice. These only constitute recommendations that need not necessarily be
followed if local conditions so warrant.

United Kingdom
The situation in the United Kingdom is handled rather differently. Whilst the
Environment Agency (EA) has its own direct powers under water pollution control
legislation to authorize industrial activities which discharge to groundwater, it has no
control over the general authorization or prohibition of other activities.
   In order to give guidance to those with responsibility for such developments, a series
of policy statements has been issued for the guidance of these organizations, primarily
local councils which issue permissions within the context of land use planning
                             Groundwater protection zones                               487

legislation. The EA, acting as a statutory consultant at the planning consultation stage,
would object to a number of activities in groundwater protection zones unless specific
precautions were applied through the planning permission granted by the local authority.
This gives a wide-ranging opportunity for the planning authority to insert specific
protective measures into any permissions which it may grant. Because the policy
statements are of a general nature, the EA is able to take account of local situations in the
advice it gives to local authorities. Where other activities may be under consideration by
governmental or similar responsible bodies (dealing with, for example, changes in
farming practice, or pesticide formulation and use) the requirements for protective
measures can be introduced at an early stage of the development. The restricted activities
include polluting industries such as:
    • waste management and landfill;
    • activities which interfere with groundwater flow such as quarrying and gravel
         extraction;
    • mining;
    • construction of highways, railway cuttings and tunnels;
    • borehole construction;
    • field drainage that intercepts recharge water and any other activity that
         interconnects naturally separate aquifers;
    • waste disposal to land;
    • disturbance or redevelopment of contaminated land as a result of former
         industrial activities;
    • the application of liquid effluents, sludges and slurries to land;
    • the discharge of sewage effluent, industrial effluent, contaminated surface water
         into underground strata;
    • other activities such as production, storage and use of chemicals, farm wastes, oil
         and petroleum.

Ireland
The Irish Groundwater Protection Scheme (DoELG, 1999) uses the vulnerability rating
discussed in Section 17.4 as a basis for determining the level of protection (response)
within the inner and outer zone. Four levels of response are defined for activities within a
protection zone: acceptable (R1); acceptable in principle though subject to specified
conditions (R2); not acceptable in principle though specified exceptions might be
allowed (R3); and not acceptable (R4). Whereas activities within drinking-water
protection zones will usually be classified as R4, an R3 rating is possible if vulnerability
is low. R1 and R2 responses may be used outside of drinking-water protection zones,
also depending on vulnerability.
    A useful element of the Irish scheme is that it explicitly addresses uncertainty of
classifications, depending on the quality of the hydrogeological and other information
available. Regulatory bodies are invited to revise zone maps as information improves,
and a bias towards ensuring protection may be addressed by a developer through
providing new information which would enable the zoning to be altered and – if that
proves adequate – the regulatory response correspondingly changed.
488                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

Indonesia
As part of the Indonesian groundwater protection approach, local regulations need to be
developed and enacted which describe both protection zone boundaries and
corresponding land use restrictions. The development of the local protection scheme
requires an evaluation of contaminant sources within each zone as well as effective
control measures for protecting the groundwater source. On the basis of a numeric
scoring system the urgency of individual control or protection measures and related costs
are ranked in order to prioritize individual activities. Based on this the head of district or
governor issues a decree for each spring or well in which protection zone boundaries are
marked and restrictions are defined in detail.
   Implementation is part of the regional development plan. A multisectoral team of
governmental and non-governmental experts is entrusted to plan and evaluate the
progress of the establishment of the water protection zones. Community participation is a
key issue in processing the protection zones. Financing comes from the local
governments.
   Currently the system is applied in three districts at Lombok Island and is under
development in three other provinces. An example of the approach is given Table 17.7.
The Indonesian Drinking Water Surveillance regulation stipulates the application of this
system on a nationwide scale.

17.8       MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF
           PROTECTION ZONES
Groundwater protection zones may be a key component of a WSP (see Chapter 16) for a
given groundwater supply, and protection zones would typically be control measures in
this context. This would subject them to operational monitoring for assessing whether or
not the required restrictions on land use and controls of human activities are in place, and
to verification for checking whether they are indeed effectively protecting groundwater at
the point of abstraction. However, monitoring implementation and verification of water
quality are equally important for supplies that are not using a WSP.


   NOTE X            The implementation of protection zones is effectively supported if the
                     stakeholders involved collaboratively develop management plans
                     that define their delineation and the activities allowed within zones,
                     and that document monitoring procedures, which corrective actions
                     should be taken both during normal and during incident conditions,
                     and responsibilities, lines of communication as well as
                     documentation procedures.
                     The implementation of control measures to enforce compliance with
                     protection zone requirements is substantially facilitated by an
                     environmental policy framework (see Chapter 20).


   Table 17.8 provides examples of control measures that may be used for protection
zones, regardless as to whether or not this is done in the context of a WSP. It also
includes suggestions for monitoring and verification of the example control measure
given. For example, adequate protection zone delineation in order to protect the
abstraction point from contamination with pathogens and/or chemicals could be
validated by using tracer studies. Protection zone monitoring would focus on checking
whether the required restrictions in land use and human activities are being adhered to.
Groundwater quality monitoring in this context would serve to verify the efficacy of the
specific protection zone concept, i.e. both its design and implementation.


   NOTE X            Options for monitoring suggested in Table 17.8 focus on the control
                     measures rather than on groundwater quality.
                     Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are a
                     supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of providing
                     verification of the overall efficacy of protection zones.

Sanitary completion of protection
works around groundwater sources
G. Howard, S. Godfrey and T. Boonyakarnkul




The proper sanitary completion of groundwater sources is of particular relevance to the
microbial quality of water. It is essential to prevent the direct contamination of
groundwater at the point of abstraction or resulting from rapid recharge pathways close
to the source. Where contamination is allowed to directly enter the groundwater source
or reach groundwater close to the point of abstraction, the travel time may be too limited
to ensure adequate die-off and the processes of attenuation may not be effective in
reducing the numbers of pathogens (Robertson and Edberg, 1997).
    Sanitary completion is also important in preventing direct chemical contamination,
but often does not provide the same degree of protection. The subsurface leaching and
transport of mobile and persistent chemical contaminants means that land use controls
will be required to limit risks. This is illustrated, for instance, by studies in a small town
in Uganda that showed little contamination by microbial contaminants, but significant
increases in nitrate derived from faecal sources (Barrett et al., 2000a). Large-scale
protection measures, such as designation of groundwater protection zones, are discussed
in Chapter 17.
    Sanitary completion refers to the protection works at the abstraction point and the
immediate surrounding areas. It is sometimes also referred to as wellhead protection,
although this would usually cover a wider area around the well than covered in this

chapter. In this chapter, sanitary completion includes the underground and above ground
construction of the abstraction facility as well as the immediate area surrounding the
abstraction point.


   NOTE X            This chapter introduces options for controlling risks through
                     sanitary completion. The information presented supports defining
                     control measures in the development of a Water Safety Plan
                     (Chapter 16).




18.1      SANITARY COMPLETION AND HEALTH
The direct contamination of groundwater sources resulting from poor sanitary
completion has been linked to both endemic disease and outbreaks. Such contamination
is present in both developed and developing countries. For instance, Olson et al. (2002)
describe an outbreak of E.coli O157:H7 in Alpine, Wyoming, including cases of
haemolytic uraemic syndrome, which was related to consumption of water from a poorly
protected spring which sanitary surveys had identified as being at risk from
contamination by surface water. Poor sanitary completion measures also appear to have
played a role in the Walkerton outbreak in Canada (O’Connor, 2002). In developing
countries, the use of poorly protected groundwater sources has been linked to acute
diarrhoeal disease (Trivedi et al., 1971; Nasinyama et al., 2000). Good sanitary
completion measures have been shown to be necessary to maintain the quality of water
and protect public health (US EPA, 1993; Pedley and Howard, 1997; Robertson and
Edberg, 1997).
    The effectiveness of sanitary completion in reducing risks of pathogens is profound as
it provides a barrier to direct contamination of the source (Robertson and Edberg, 1997).
The degree to which risks will be reduced, however, varies between pathogen types and
aquifer types and there is a need for multiple interventions to act as barriers to most
pathogen types.
    For many aquifers, good sanitary completion measures will control the majority of
risks posed by protozoa. Sanitary completion will greatly reduce the risks from bacteria
in alluvial aquifers, but significant risks will remain in fracture flow aquifers where the
enforcement of protection zones and, possibly, disinfection will be required. Sanitary
completion measures will in general provide much less protection against risks posed by
viruses, with protection zones and disinfection being required to reduce risks.
    Most sanitary completion measures do not significantly add costs onto good standard
design practice. There are cost implications, however, in ensuring that effective
maintenance is performed to prevent basic protection measures from deteriorating and
becoming ineffective. In some cases, cost considerations may be important with regard
to selecting whether improvement of sanitary completion measures or alternative
interventions will be the preferred option. For instance, where an aquifer is subjected to
       Sanitary completion of protection works around groundwater sources             495

low-level or intermittent microbial contamination, it may be more cost effective to
chlorinate the water prior to distribution than to try to deepen the borehole.


18.2      THE NEEDS FOR EFFECTIVE CONTROL MEASURES
          IN SANITARY COMPLETION
Sanitary completion typically includes a number of essential control measures to prevent
the contamination of groundwater. Failures in such control measures have been reported
from a variety of situations in both developed and developing countries (Lewis and
Chilton, 1984; Lloyd and Helmer, 1991; Platenberg and Zaki, 1993; Daly and Woods,
1995; Gelinas et al., 1996; Howard et al., 2003). In addition to the immediate protection
works at the abstraction point, the appropriate sealing of abandoned wells is also noted as
essential to protect functioning groundwater sources (Rojas et al., 1995; Robertson and
Edberg, 1997).
    Failures in sanitary completion measures may result from poor construction and in
particular lack of adherence to basic quality standards. For example poor jointing on
casings of boreholes, incorrect selection and placement of grouting, poor selection and
installation of gravel packs, poorly mixed concrete used for linings and aprons may all
result in seepage of contaminated water into groundwater sources (Howsam, 1990; US
EPA, 1993).
    Some drilling techniques lead to increased risks because they do not allow for
grouting around the casing to be used (ARGOSS, 2001). Failure to consider the pH of
the groundwater may lead to corrosion and rapid deterioration of rising mains, resulting
in loss of water and abandonment of the supply (Leake and Kamal, 1990). In addition,
methods of water lifting can present a direct route of contamination such as through the
priming of handpumps with contaminated water (MacDonald et al.,1999).
    Failures in sanitary completion may also result from poor maintenance (Lloyd and
Bartram, 1991; Lloyd and Helmer, 1991; Platenberg and Zaki, 1993; US EPA, 1993;
Daly and Woods, 1995; Howard et al., 2003). In many cases specific measures
constructed to protect a groundwater source fail because other measures, such as fences
and diversion ditches, have not been maintained. The failure to maintain ditches and
fences can result in increased access to the groundwater source, increased stress and
erosion on the other protection measures and increased likelihood of inundation by
surface water.
    Control measures as part of sanitary completion should be identified and
implemented in the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of an
abstraction facility. As the risks to groundwater sources can be described using the
source-pathway-receptor model (see Table 8.8 in Chapter 8.5.2), control measures can be
categorised as: controlling the source of hazards, e.g. faecal material from a pit latrine
overlying an aquifer and close to an abstraction point, and controlling pathways to avoid
direct or very rapid ingress of contaminated water, e.g. through cracks in the casing of
boreholes, improperly sealed apron surrounding the headwall of a dug well or borehole,
eroded backfilled area of a protected spring, abandoned dug wells and borrow pits.
Control measures both for sources and for pathways include indirect measures to
decrease the likelihood of a hazard or pathway developing, such as a fence around the
496                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

water source to prevent access of animals or humans which could be a source of hazard
(through defecation) or cause a pathway (through causing damage to the source or the
immediate surrounding area).
    In many cases, a combination of control measures addressing hazard sources and
contamination pathways is necessary. Sanitary completion provides one barrier to
contamination from such sources, but should be integrated with proper pollution
containment practices and other environment engineering interventions (such as
improved drainage) to be effective.


18.3      CONTROL MEASURES IN SANITARY COMPLETION:
          PLANNING AND DESIGN
The initial design of a groundwater abstraction facility is crucial in determining how
protected the source will be. Some background information and a number of basic
considerations should be taken into account at this stage.

Planning site and design in relation to the hydrogeological environment
The first step in sanitary completion is to understand the nature of the hydrogeological
environment – where and how many aquifers exist, what type of aquifers exist, expected
yields, depth and nature of the overburden and the degree of interconnection between
different aquifers (Chapter 8). It is also important to assess how the water will be
abstracted – are there springs or must the groundwater be abstracted through sinking a
well or borehole into the ground? This information can then be used to make basic
decisions such as the type of technology to be used, the depth of abstraction and
additional protection measures required.
    Where aquifers are deep or multiple aquifers are found, setting the intake deeper is
likely to improve the microbial quality of water. In many aquifers, in particular relatively
fine-grained aquifers, there is far less vertical movement of water (and therefore
pathogens) than horizontal movement. The increase in travel times for relatively small
increases in depth may be many tens or hundreds of days (ARGOSS, 2001). This
increases the potential for die-off of pathogens and potentially greater dispersion;
although in the latter case sophisticated models may be required to predict this. It may
also increase the potential for attenuation, although this cannot be relied upon.
    Sinking tubewells into deeper (usually older) aquifers may also be an important way
of avoiding chemical contamination in shallow groundwater, as is the case in relation to
arsenic contamination in Bangladesh (Ahmed et al., 2002). Where tubewells are
deepened it is important that shallower layers are cased off to prevent ingress. Often the
incremental cost of deepening a well is relatively low in comparison to the overall capital
investment and thus yields a significant cost-benefit. Deepening tubewells requires
ascertaining whether there is no or very limited hydraulic connection between
contaminated shallow and uncontaminated deeper aquifers. Hydraulic connection
between aquifers is relatively common in aquifers found in weathered basement rocks
and may also occur in alluvial aquifer sequences with no defined aquitard or aquiclude.
Where hydraulic connections exist, deepening a tubewell may limit the improvement of
water quality, as induced leakage from shallow aquifers may still lead to contamination.

    Planning control measures in designing abstraction may be hampered by lack of
hydrogeological information. For example in fracture aquifers it may be difficult to
determine the level of risk posed to a deep aquifer by a contaminated shallow aquifer.
Geophysical investigation and detailed assessment may provide some, but possibly not
all, the answers required during the design stage. In such cases, monitoring as part of
validation of the design chosen is particularly important.

Planning site, design and operational control measures in relation to the outcome of
hazard assessment
As discussed in Section II and Chapter 14 of this book, a critical step before embarking
on the design of a groundwater source is to evaluate what hazards exist close to the
proposed site and their potential to be attenuated or diluted. This includes determining
whether particular aquifers are contaminated and therefore whether their use as a
drinking-water supply is justified.
    Where the situation assessment identifies existing contamination of a well or spring,
or a high potential for pollution from activities and conditions too close to the abstraction
facility, control measures can either be identified towards removing the cause of the
hazard(s) (see also Section V), or towards changing the site or depth of the well. While
removing hazards would be the preferable, in practice population density and/or severity
of contamination may make relocation of wells more feasible.
     Whilst an emphasis should be placed on ensuring microbial quality of water,
attention should be paid to the chemical quality of different groundwaters. Assessing
whether particular aquifers contain toxic levels of chemicals (e.g. arsenic) or whether the
levels of chemicals will affect the acceptability of water to consumers (e.g. high iron or
manganese levels) or cause unacceptable operational problems (e.g. very hard waters) is
critical in the design process. The acceptability of water is a particular problem as this
may lead households to reject the use of an otherwise safe source and use contaminated
sources for drinking. This not only fails to meet basic health needs for low-risk drinking-
water, but also represents a significant waste of resources.
    In cases where the hazard only represents a risk under certain pumping conditions, the
pumping regime could be defined as control measure in order to reduce the influence of
the hazard. This is unlikely to be satisfactory, however, as there may be considerable
uncertainty both in the abstraction model used as basis for decisions, and in operational
monitoring and corrective action to ascertain that this pumping regime is always adhered
to.
    If the hazard cannot be removed and changes in design of the source are not possible,
post-abstraction disinfection is likely to be an effective control measure. In some cases, it
will be more effective to use a lower microbial quality of water and then apply treatment
at household or community level and/or implement a health education programme
dealing with steps available at the household level to reduce the risks. Also, a residual
risk may have to be retained if contamination is relatively low, other routes of disease
transmission are more significant than water and are therefore other interventions are a
greater public health priority where resources are insufficient to simultaneously improve
drinking-water quality.
498                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

18.3.1 Drainage and fencing
Control measures are important to protect abstraction facilities against the potential for
inundation by contaminated surface water or damage by animals or overland flows
caused by heavy rainfall by diverting surface water away from the headworks. For
protected springs this diversion should be located above the protection works and should
direct the water into a drainage ditch downstream and away from the spring. For dug
wells and boreholes, diversion ditches should circle the headworks and drain the water
away from the source. In designing the ditch, the topography and likely overland flows
should be evaluated to ensure that the depth of the ditch is adequate to remove all
stormwater.
    Diversion ditches should be located some way from the groundwater source, but not
so far that significant overland flow will be generated within the area between the ditch
and the headworks. A general rule of thumb is a minimum of 6 m and preferably 10 m
for boreholes and dug wells and up to 20 m for protected springs (Morgan, 1990).
    Restricting access by both humans and animals to the headworks is also important to
reduce risks of contamination and thus, where possible, water sources should be enclosed
by a fence. However, this needs to be balanced against cultural norms, for instance
fencing of community water sources in Bangladesh is often not practiced because this
may be interpreted as restricting the use of the source.
    The wellhead of boreholes serving a piped distribution system should be located
within a locked building which only the operation staff of the water supplier should have
access to. Where users must collect water directly at the borehole or dug well source,
fencing is still required and access should be restricted to only one or two entrances. For
springs, the whole backfilled area should be fenced and inaccessible as users will collect
water from outlets on the spring box. Where the spring feeds a gravity piped water
system, the whole spring protection works should be fenced off and access limited to the
community operator. All valve and junctions boxes should have concrete lined sides and
a lockable lid.

18.3.2 Design of boreholes
Boreholes or tubewells may be shallow (5-45 m) or deep (up to several hundred metres).
The choice of pump (hand, mechanized or electric submersible) to withdraw the water
will depend on the hydraulic (or pumping) head in the pump, with handpumps being
typically constrained to depths of 45 m or less. Where confined or semi-confined
aquifers are used, the water table may rise considerably higher than the depth of the well
and a handpump may still be used despite the well being physically relatively deep.
Where mechanized or electric submersible pumps are used, they are typically linked to a
distribution system. An example of a shallow borehole is shown in Figure 18.1. Selection
of appropriate design such as the use of geotextile stockings, telescopic screen or external
gravel packs can improve filtration and reduce potential sanitary risk (Driscoll, 1986).

Figure 18.1. Design of a shallow borehole with handpump

    For all boreholes or tubewells ensuring proper sanitary completion of the above
ground infrastructure is essential to prevent direct ingress of contaminated surface water.
Key components are to provide a casing over the unsaturated zone and over the upper
part of the aquifer which may be expected to dewater during pumping. It is important to
provide a bentonite grout seal for at least the top 1-3 m, which should be continuous with
a concrete apron surrounding the top of the borehole (Driscoll, 1986). The apron must be
in good condition with cracks and faults repaired rapidly.
    Sanitary completion of tubewells/boreholes will be dependent on the method of
drilling. For instance, MacDonald et al. (1999) note that the use of the sludger method
commonly employed in the alluvial aquifers in Bangladesh increases susceptibility to
contamination via routes close to the tubewell because it precludes sealing the annulus
between the casing and drilled tubewell. However, as the formation typically collapses
around the casing, the susceptibility can be reduced (Ahmed et al., 2002).
    Boreholes are usually fully developed prior to commissioning to ensure adequate
flow using a variety of techniques. Well development is not typically designed to
improve water quality, but care is needed when using some techniques (notably
hydrofracturing and acidization) to avoid the creation of preferential flow paths in
consolidated formations that could allow rapid transport of contaminants.

18.3.3 Design of dug wells
Most hand-dug wells are shallow (typically 20 m or less in depth) although wells as deep
as 120 m have been constructed (Watt and Wood, 1977). They are often more vulnerable
500                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

to contamination than boreholes, thus while some shallow dug wells have mechanized
pumping, the majority (particularly those in developing countries) have water abstraction
through some form of handpump, windlass or rope and bucket system. A typical design
is shown in Figure 18.2.




Figure 18.2. Design of a dug well with handpump

    Hand-dug well designs usually have some form of lining over the unsaturated zone.
In order to secure a year-round supply, caissons may be sunk below the water table to
prevent drying. The design should include an apron surrounding the top of the well
(usually of 1-3 m radius) with lining extended 30-50 cm above the top of the apron to
provide protection against direct ingress of surface water. It is preferable that a cover is
put on the well to prevent direct contamination of the water (Collins, 2000).
    Studies by Lewis and Chilton (1984) note that the design, construction, operation and
maintenance of the apron results in a direct reduction in levels of contamination. Dug
wells can be backfilled with a sanitary seal of between 1-3 m, which increases travel time
resulting in increased die off rates of pathogens. However, backfilling of wells is difficult
if deepening of the well is required during drought periods. Alternative techniques such
as curbing (attachment of section stabilizers) can be used to prevent movement of the
shaft section of well and therefore not disturb the sanitary seal (Watt and Wood, 1977).
    The means of abstraction should minimize the potential for introducing contamination
from dirty containers. This may include using a handpump or other sanitary means of
        Sanitary completion of protection works around groundwater sources               501

withdrawing water from the well such as a rope and washer pump, which have been
shown to be effective in reducing levels of contamination (Gorter et al., 1995). (See
Section 18.5.1 for more detail about risks associated with pumps.) Where a windlass,
rope and pulley system with a bucket is used, then only one bucket should enter the well
and hygiene education should emphasize the need to keep the well bucket from coming
into contact with the ground.
   Hand dug wells often represent particular problems for sustaining good quality water,
as it is difficult to ensure that very shallow water cannot enter the lining during wet
periods. There are a number of different linings that may be used, including precast
concrete, concrete cast in-situ and brick linings (Collins, 2000). Each of these methods
gives varying degrees of sanitary protection.
   Where water quality is difficult to maintain, additional improvements have been made
to dug wells. These include the addition of a small sand filter set inside a box at the base
of the well, a permeable base plate or ongoing chlorination of the water in the well
(Lloyd and Helmer, 1991; WHO, 1997; Godfrey et al., 2003). Chlorination has proven to
be effective in post-emergency situations where other technology alternatives are
unavailable but its effectiveness in terms of sustainability is questionable (Rowe et al.,
1998; Godfrey, 2003).

18.3.4 Design of protected springs
A spring is a natural groundwater source which is protected by providing a concrete
headwall or spring box around the eye of the spring (where water emerges) that prevents
direct contamination (WHO, 1997; Howard et al., 2001; Meuli and Wehrle, 2001). There
are a number of designs for protected springs, all of which utilize some form of retaining
wall or spring box with an excavated area backfilled with loose material to encourage
spring flow towards the outlet. A protective cover usually overlies the excavated area and
the area is fenced for some distance to prevent direct access by humans and animals. One
design that has been used in periurban areas is shown in Figure 18.3.




Figure 18.3. Cross-section of the backfill of a protected spring (Howard et al., 2001)
502                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

   Where protection is poor, contamination may occur at the point of emergence due to
recharge by contaminated water in the immediate area. Thus the proper protection of the
spring eye becomes vital. At most springs, the eye of the spring is excavated and the area
backfilled with loose material. The filter media should be sufficiently fine to provide
reasonable filtration of the groundwater entering from the spring eye and any surface
water percolating through the immediate area: usually gravel although finer media may
be required in more polluted areas.
   It is important that this filter is overlain by an impermeable layer, commonly clay but
can be a concrete cover, to reduce direct infiltration of surface water, and the whole area
grassed (Howard et al., 2001; Meuli and Wehrle, 2001). The filter media should be
placed in the backfill area from the base of the excavation up to the expected highest
level of wet season water table rise (only applicable in gravity springs).

18.3.5 Design of infiltration galleries
Infiltration galleries come in a variety of forms – they may run alongside rivers or other
surface water bodies or may tap a spring line. They can be used as a part of a treatment
train or may provide water directly via a shallow well or from a gravity-fed piped water
supply. Infiltration galleries have been used in many countries and often have long life
spans, for instance an infiltration gallery has been in operation in Lima, Peru for over 100
years and still provides high quality water with limited maintenance (Rojas et al., 1995).
    When using an infiltration gallery it is important to ensure that the collector pipe is
laid at an adequate depth to ensure a year-round supply. The collector pipe should be
surrounded by a gravel pack designed to reduce the velocity of water entering the drain
to ensure that suspended sediments are removed. It is preferable that the intake holes be
on the underside of the collector pipe to increase the flow path length. However, it is
recognized that in most cases inlet holes will be required on the full pipe for hydraulic
reasons and that the gravel pack must be laid properly. The interior of infiltration
galleries will be self-cleaning if the velocity is at least 1 m per second.


18.4      CONTROL MEASURES IN SANITARY COMPLETION:
          CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS
The construction process and materials used are critical in ensuring that proper sanitary
completion is achieved. Substandard work should be rejected. Poor construction quality
allows faults to develop at the abstraction point. It is essential that technicians
undertaking water source construction are properly trained and that guidelines for
construction (for instance concrete mixes, rising main materials, etc.) are provided and
followed.
    The materials used can be critical to prevent water quality deterioration. Cement
should be of good quality and within the recommended date of use. Sand and gravel
should be clean and mixed in the proportions specified in the design. Reinforcing
materials should be free of rust and dirt to ensure that a firm bond is formed with the
concrete and care should be taken in selecting the gauge of reinforcing materials.
       Sanitary completion of protection works around groundwater sources                 503

    An important part of the construction process is quality control. This requires periodic
checking and auditing of field practices to ensure that they are consistent with stated
quality goals and objectives that the construction agency has set itself. Such quality
control is necessary in all situations, whether construction is undertaken by the public or
private sector. In all cases, but particularly where work is contracted to a third party, it is
essential that there is evidence that the quality of construction is adequate. This may take
the form of inspection and signing off a contract prior to full payment, or unannounced
site visits.

18.4.1 Pumps and rising mains
For dug wells and tubewells, the selection of the rising main material is important.
Galvanized iron rising mains should be avoided where water is relatively acid water
because they are likely to corrode and lead to abandonment of the use of the handpump
or the source. Where suction pumps are used, it is important that pumps are selected
which have a non-return foot valve and do not require priming water to be added. As
priming water is often taken from surface water or other stored household water, it may
be contaminated (ARGOSS, 2001). Where priming water must be used, then it is
important that only water collected from the well and stored in a covered container is
used.

18.4.2 Cleaning of facilities prior to commissioning
For boreholes and dug-wells, good hygiene should be practiced by the team during
construction. However, as some contamination will almost always remain, the wells
should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected prior to use and after maintenance tasks
within the well.
    For dug wells, the lining and caisson walls should be scrubbed with a chlorine
solution prior to commissioning; after this washing down with chlorinated water should
be sufficient. Where a handpump is installed on a dug well, the rising main should be
filled with a chlorine solution and left to stand for at least one hour and preferably
overnight.
    Disinfection of boreholes requires filling the casing with a chlorine solution and
leaving it to stand for at least one hour and preferably overnight. In both cases, the
chlorinated water should be pumped to waste before use.


18.5       CONTROL MEASURES IN SANITARY COMPLETION:
           OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Whilst good design and construction will do much to ensure that wellhead protection is
adequate, ensuring that it remains in good condition through ongoing preventative
maintenance and repair is essential. This applies equally to springs and wells of large
utilities and to small community or household supplies. The inspection routine should be
defined in a management plan and include the recording of any deterioration detected
and the action to be taken by whom and when.
504                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    For example, where pumps are used (whether handpump or mechanized), a stock of
tools and spares should be kept by the operator so that repairs can be carried out quickly.
Inherent to this is developing an effective supply chain for spares. In South Asia this has
been successful as the small-scale private sector has been able to meet demand. In
Africa, developing adequate supply chains has been more problematic, leading to
relatively large numbers of boreholes being non-functional. In more developed countries,
operators would normally have a store of the requisite tools and spares or would be able
to source these quickly.
    Proper training of operators of a supply is of critical importance for them to have and
have the skills and knowledge to undertake at least basic preventative maintenance and
perform minor repairs. More than one operator per source should be trained to ensure
that maintenance and repairs can still be undertaken even if an operator moves away
from the area or cannot undertake work at a particular time. For utility supplies, a
number of operators may be identified who work at the supply on a rotational basis.
Operators should have access to guidance and information about maintenance and
repairs – e.g. specifying frequencies for replacement or worn parts and giving detailed
information of repair procedures.
    Where possible, the operators of water supplies should receive ongoing support from
technical or professional support staff. Very often, even limited support in terms of
regular visits to a supply to undertake an inspection and to meet with the operators of the
supply can be very effective in sustaining good operation. This is particularly important
for sustaining good quality small water supplies in both developed and developing
countries and in rural and urban areas (Bartram, 1999; Holden, 1999).
    In addition to basic maintenance and repairs of equipment, it is important that basic
cleaning tasks are routinely undertaken. This involves cleaning and repairing diversion
ditches, ensuring that wastewater ditches from springs do not become blocked and
allowed to flood the source and ensuring the fence remains in good condition. Such tasks
are best defined in management plans and usually are not onerous if done regularly. They
can make a crucial difference in water quality control. Such activities should be
supported by inspections of the site by the operator.
    Experience shows that in order to sustain operation and maintenance some form of
contribution from the users for the upkeep of the water source is very effective. In rural
areas of low-income countries this may involve the contribution of labour. Other
communities, particularly those in wealthier countries and those in urban areas of
developing countries, may rely on payment by the users for the water services supplied.
Most communities are willing to pay for water services providing the charges are
realistic and the service meets the demands of the users. Routine payment is often
preferred, as systems that operate solely on the collection of fees once a breakdown has
occurred will mean that faults take longer to repair, although the latter approach has been
found to work in some communities, for example in Eastern Uganda.
    In both cases, community organization is often key to ensuring that maintenance
procedures are supported. This may take the form of a committee that oversees the
operation of the water supply. In many low-income countries, such a committee may be
specific to the water source and it is preferable to ensure that the members are
representative of the different interest groups in the community and in particular that
       Sanitary completion of protection works around groundwater sources              505

women’s concerns are adequately addressed. In higher-income countries such a
committee may be a subcommittee from a local council or government at the local level.
For instance in Chile user committees have been set up for all water supplies constructed
by the regional water supply company using subsidies from the Government. These
committees are supported by training programmes provided by the regional water supply
companies who provide training to managers and operators of the supplies.


18.6      ASSESSMENT OF SANITARY COMPLETION AND
          ESTABLISHING PRIORITY RISK FACTORS
The state of sanitary completion can be assessed using inspection methodologies, as
described further below. These are particularly important in the context of system
assessment to determine risks and priorities for upgrading abstraction facilities as well as
for defining control measures in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan (WSP).
Sanitary inspections may also be used in verification via a surveillance programme using
standardised approaches (Howard, 2002; WHO, 1997). Examples of such forms are
commonly available, for instance in Volume 3 of the Guidelines for Drinking-water
Quality (1997). In both cases, water quality data would also typically be collected to
allow combined analysis of the effectiveness of the control measures.
    Sanitary inspection methods may also be used in the routine operational monitoring
of the water source as part of a WSP. Sanitary inspection approaches for routine
monitoring in developed countries are likely to be the same as those used in assessment.
In developing countries, other tools such as simple pictorial monitoring tools may be
more effective. Routine monitoring may include some analysis of basic water quality
parameters, particularly if chlorination is practiced, but this is dependent on the skill of
the operators and funds for supporting such analysis.

18.6.1 Sanitary inspection
Sanitary inspection provides an easy but effective means of both assessing and
monitoring sanitary completion, particularly when this employs a standardized and
quantifiable approach (Lloyd and Bartram, 1991; Lloyd and Helmer, 1991; WHO,
1997). Unless a standardized approach is adopted, problems are commonly found in
comparing the findings between different inspectors (WHO, 1997; Howard, 2002). This
leads to inaccurate and unreliable results and limits the potential for subsequent analysis
of the data. A quantified approach allows an overall risk score to be calculated in order to
assess the state of supply systems and to identify priorities for action. It also permits
comparisons between different source types once the data is converted into a percentage
risk.
    Sanitary inspections should be undertaken frequently, at least as often as samples are
analysed for verifying water quality and in some cases more often. Risks are not static,
they change over time as new development occurs in the area and are sometimes due to
poor maintenance practices. Certain risks may also be important only seasonally, for
instance the collection of surface water uphill of a groundwater source may only occur
during wet periods. Therefore inspections may be required in both wet and dry seasons.
506                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

   Most sanitary inspections involve a series of simple questions with Yes/No answers.
As the questions are usually framed in such a way that a positive answer indicates the
presence of a risk, typically a score is allocated for a positive answer and no score for a
negative answer. Adding up the positive answers provides an overall sanitary risk score.
An example of a sanitary inspection form is given in Box 18.1 below. Other examples
are available from volume 3 of the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 1997).
   In the form in Box 18.1, questions 7, 8 and 10 refer to potential sources of faeces in
the environment; questions 1, 2 and 3 refer to direct pathway factors; and, questions 4, 5,
6 and 9 refer to indirect factors. The analysis of these factors in relation to water quality
provides useful information regarding which remedial and preventative actions are
required for the specific water source. Data collected this way can further be aggregated
and evaluated across a range of abstraction facilities of a given region in order to identify
key risk factors.

18.6.2 System assessment through sanitary inspection as a
       management tool
Sanitary inspections provide a useful management tool for communities, water supply
agencies and surveillance bodies. The value of the sanitary inspection is that it provides a
longer-term perspective on the risks of contamination, gives an overview assessment of
how effective operation and maintenance has been and which system upgrade is needed.
Such information can help in directing resources for improvement of the infrastructure
and for improved training of water supply operators. Sanitary inspections also provide an
additional means of assessing the differences in water quality from different types of
water sources thus helping overall national and regional planning and policy-making
(Bartram, 1999; Howard, 2002). This type of analysis is likely to be undertaken by a
utility or surveillance body rather than an operator of a supply.
    In a number of countries, the combined analysis of sanitary risk scores and level of
contamination has proved to be an effective way of prioritizing which water supplies
receive investment (Lloyd and Helmer, 1991; WHO, 2004). In many cases there is a
broad relationship between the overall sanitary risk score and level of contamination
(Lloyd and Bartram, 1991; Lloyd and Helmer, 1991). However, such approaches do not
necessarily identify which are the most important specific factors to address as the
system of sanitary inspection provides each risk factor with equal weighting, despite
awareness that this is unlikely to be the case.
    It is often useful to be able to determine the importance of different risk factors in
order to direct investment and action on those improvements in the source that will yield
the greatest improvements in water quality. Such an approach is often particularly useful
in order to assess whether microbial contamination of groundwater derives from poorly
sited and constructed sanitation facilities or from poor maintenance of sanitary
completion measures. Leaching from on-site sanitation has been identified in some cases
to be the major cause (Boonyakarnkul and Lloyd, 1994; Rahman, 1996; Massone et al.,
1998; Melian et al., 1999). Other research from a number of countries indicates that poor
sanitary completion was more important in microbial contamination than subsurface
leaching from hazards such as pit latrines (Gelinas et al., 1996; Cronin et al., 2002;
Howard et al., 2003) as described further in Section 18.6.3 below. This is particularly the
case in situations where there are a number of sources of human faecal matter in the
environment such as refuse pits and dumps, open defecation and widespread occurrence
of animal faecal matter (Barrett et al., 2000b; Chidavaenzi et al., 2000). Furthermore, it is
often important to determine the influence of other factors such as rainfall and population
density, which may affect contamination risks (Wright, 1986; Gorter et al., 1995; Barrett
et al., 2000a; Howard, 2002).

18.6.3 Establishing the importance of different risks due to poor
       sanitary completion
There are a number of approaches that have been used to investigate the relationships
between individual risks identified through sanitary inspection and water quality
outcomes using statistical methods to analyse the data. These approaches range from the
508                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

use of simple reporting of the frequency of risks in relation to specified water quality
targets to the use of contingency tables and logistic regression. In order to undertake such
analysis, it is important that water quality data and sanitary inspection data are available
and can be paired.
    In undertaking analysis of the relationship between sanitary risk factors and water
quality outcomes, it is useful to compare risks in relation to water quality targets, as the
failure to meet specified targets would trigger action. Cronin et al. (2002) present the
analysis of data from two sites in Kenya and Mozambique, where the frequency of
reporting of individual risks identified in inspections of sanitary completion measures
were compared against samples with results above and below the median concentration
of thermotolerant coliforms. This is shown in Table 18.1 below. This analysis indicated
that poor sanitary completion of wells was more important in leading to contamination
than subsurface leaching from sources of faecal material.

    Other analyses have used concentrations of indicator organisms in water to define a
water quality target based on international guidelines or national standards. In this
approach, for each risk factor the difference in frequency of reporting of each risk factor
is compared between when the target is met and when it is exceeded with the difference
providing an indication of whether there is a relationship and the strength of relationships
found. Howard et al. (2003) describe such an analysis of water quality and sanitary risks
in shallow protected springs in Kampala, Uganda shown in Table 18.2.
    It is often useful to undertake further analysis of the data to assess the strength of the
relationships between risk factors and water quality. In studies from Thailand,
Boonyakarnkul and Lloyd (1994) developed a Sanitary Hazard Index (SHI), which
related the intensity of faecal contamination associated with individual risk factors
identified from sanitary inspection. These authors were able to identify which factors had
the highest SHI and concluded that this should provide direction in relation to the priority
accorded to reducing the presence of individual risk factors. The authors noted that there
was a difference between those factors with the highest SHI and those that were most
commonly reported.

   Combined analysis of water quality and sanitary inspection data can also be
undertaken using a range of non-parametric tests, which is common in the analysis of
water resources data (Helsel and Hirsch, 1992). The use of dedicated software packages
will assist in undertaking such analysis, but are not essential. Such analysis often
incorporates other data such as rainfall and population density that are considered
important in controlling quality.

    One example of non-parametric statistical tests is a contingency table of odds ratios.
To make this analysis, variables with continuous data (e.g. water quality, rainfall and
population density) must be converted into binomial categorical data. In the case of water
quality targets the resulting variable will be whether the target was complied with or was
exceeded (often simply expressed as either Yes or No). For rainfall data, a new variable
may be whether rain was recorded within a specified time period or whether a certain
depth of rainfall occurred.
    An example of a contingency table is given below in Table 18.3 taken from analysis
performed by Howard et al. (2003), which combines analysis of sanitary risks and water
quality objectives for faecal streptococci and thermotolerant coliforms in protected
springs in Uganda.
    In the example of Table 18.3, two water quality objectives have been selected to
allow the data to be analysed: the absence of faecal streptococci and less than 10 cfu/100
ml thermotolerant coliforms, the latter being a more realistic target for non-chlorinated
community-managed water supplies. Odds ratios exceeding 1 show a positive
relationship between the risk factor and exceeding the water quality target.
    For both water quality targets the analysis demonstrates that localised pathways
combined to sources of pollution and rainfall lead to contamination. Furthermore, in
this setting thermotolerant coliform contamination appears to result from a more
complex set of factors than faecal streptococci but is still primarily linked to poor
sanitary completion.
    This data can be further analysed through logistical regression (Howard et al., 2003).
Using the same data shown in Table 18.3, logistic regression models were developed and
are shown in Table 18.4. The regression models included all co-variates where odds
ratios showed relationships significant at least to the 95 per cent level. Although not
510                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

significant at least to the 95 per cent level for faecal streptococci, latrine proximity within
30 m was forced into the model as this was still deemed a plausible route of
contamination.

   Both regression models indicate contamination resulting from rapid recharge close to
the springs and suggest that it is poor sanitary conditions at the spring itself that represent
the greatest problems for the microbial quality of water. It is likely that this occurs
through both direct inundation and very rapid recharge through preferential flow paths.
In both cases, the principal sources appear to be waste dumps and surface water rather

than latrines. This agrees with other studies that point to the importance of refuse dumps
for the presence of indicator organisms (Chidavaenzi et al., 2000). In a study of wells in
rural Mozambique, Godfrey et al., (2005) found that there was a pulse response of
microbial contamination to rainfall events. Soil and engineering studies indicated that
localised pathways were likely to be the primary cause of contamination rather than
contamination due to aquifer pathways (Godfrey et al., 2005).
   The findings of Howard et al., (2003) and Godfrey et al., (2005) are in agreement
with other studies into the causes of microbial contamination of shallow groundwater
supplies, which have tended to emphasize direct ingress rather than subsurface leaching
of contaminants in causing contamination (Rojas et al., 1995; Gelinas et al., 1996).
These findings emphasise the importance of sanitary completion of groundwater sources.
   The influence of sanitary completion on controlling quality may vary with different
technologies and areas. For instance, studies in Thailand by Boonyakarnkul and Lloyd
(1994) concluded that on-site sanitation factors led to the greatest Sanitary Hazard Index
and were therefore priority risks to resolve. In Uganda, the major control on quality in
tubewells appeared to be the proximity and location of on-site sanitation rather than
wellhead completion (Howard et al., 2003). By contrast, studies in Bangladesh reported
that wellhead completion was more important than subsurface leaching from on-site
sanitation (MacDonald et al., 1999; Ahmed et al., 2002).
   The results of these studies support the validation of control measures, an essential
step within a WSP (see Chapter 16). The performance of a WSP may be assessed by
repeating the above analysis after upgrading sanitary completion to address faults.
identified.


18.7      CONTROL MEASURES FOR SANITARY
          COMPLETION OF GROUNDWATER SOURCES
The design, construction, operation and maintenance requirements for groundwater
sources can be translated into a series of control measures or points at the wellhead or
spring protection works. Key control measures for different types of groundwater source
are shown in Table 18.5 below. Planning measures to control the presence of hazards in
the catchment area or immediate vicinity of a well or spring are discussed in more detail
in Chapters 18-25.


   NOTE X           In water supplies developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16),
                    system assessment would identify which control measures exist, their
                    effectiveness and which need to be upgraded or newly introduced.
                    Management plans would document why specific control measures
                    were chosen, how their performance is monitored and which
                    corrective action should be taken both during normal operations
                    and during incident conditions when monitoring indicates loss of
                    control.

    Table 18.5 focuses on control measures for the design and construction of wells and
springs which are specific to sanitary completion. For the operation of abstraction
facilities, maintenance and repairs are crucial control measures for keeping
contaminants out, and management plans to define the scope and timescales of such
activities are important to support that they are regularly carried out.
    Regardless of whether or not any of these control measures are part of a WSP, their
monitoring and verification is crucial to ensure that they are in place and are effective.
Table 18.5 therefore includes options for surveillance and monitoring of the control
measure examples given. As most of the control measures for sanitary completion
involve issues of design and maintenance, many of them are most effectively monitored
by regular inspections and through reviewing inspection and maintenance reports. The
periodic analysis of microbiological indicator organisms is also crucial to the verification
and validation of protection measures. In this context, management plans are an
important tool to ascertain that inspection and maintenance activities are regularly carried
out. This aspect of monitoring focuses on checking whether the controls are operating as
intended, rather than on contaminant concentrations in groundwater.


    NOTE X             Options for monitoring suggested in Table 18.5 focus on the control
                       measures rather than on groundwater quality.
                       Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are a
                       supplementary aspect of verification of the efficacy of sanitary
                       completion.

Hydrological management
J. Chilton and W. Alley




The management of groundwater resources is a broad and complex subject. Basic
elements of hydrological management include water conservation measures to keep
abstraction at a sustainable level or economic analysis of over-exploitation impacts. The
lack of water suitable for domestic uses can have serious public health consequences, and
the health sector may need to ensure that domestic water requirements are taken account
of in overall water resources management. This may include, for example, participating
in the negotiation of groundwater allocations with competing users, such as the
agricultural sector.
    The overall sustainable management of water resources, i.e. the quantity of water
available for use, is largely outside the scope of this monograph. However, there is often
a relationship between groundwater quantity and quality, and there are some situations
and circumstances in which poor management of groundwater resources can have
consequences for groundwater quality that, as pointed out in Chapter 8, can be severe
and sometimes difficult and costly to reverse. This chapter briefly discusses management
approaches to dealing with the types of groundwater resources degradation outlined in
Chapter 8.
    Effective management of groundwater resources requires integration of the most
important hydrogeological and socioeconomic elements that determine the interactions
between land and water use and groundwater systems. The functions required for
management need to be identified, and if they are not already enabled through existing

institutions, these may need to be strengthened or new institutional arrangements
developed to allow appropriate combinations of legal, social and financial instruments to
be used to manage groundwater resources. A more detailed discussion of the institutional
issues related to groundwater resource management can be found in Chapters 5 and 7 as
well as in Feitelson and Haddad (1998), Salman (1999) and Foster et al. (2000).


   NOTE X            This chapter introduces options for controlling risks potentially
                     caused by abstraction through hydrological management. The
                     information presented here supports defining control measures and
                     their management in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan
                     (Chapter 16).
                     Water suppliers and authorities responsible for drinking-water
                     quality often have a key role in hydrological management, but in
                     many settings, other stakeholders also abstract groundwater. In
                     such settings, the definition of control measures for hydrological
                     management will require close collaboration of the stakeholders
                     involved, including public authorities.




19.1      MANAGING ABSTRACTION TO PREVENT SALINE
          INTRUSION
A major quality issue caused by poor groundwater management is saline intrusion (see
Chapter 8.6.2). There are numerous examples of saline intrusion where heavy
groundwater abstraction from productive coastal limestone or alluvial aquifers for urban,
industrial or agricultural usage has produced serious intrusion of saline water into these
aquifers, often stretching far inland, and one example is given in Box 19.1.
    The widespread prevalence and costly economic consequences of severe saline
intrusion have led to the development of sophisticated approaches to its investigation,
particularly by means of geophysics and numerical modelling, and to its management
and control. The most obvious and technically easiest approach to managing saline
intrusion is to restrict pumping to allow natural recharge from the hinterland to help
maintain or re-establish natural conditions. If urban, commercial and agricultural activity
in the coastal zone has become dependent on groundwater then this is economically and
practically difficult to do. Reducing groundwater abstraction may require a combination
of regulatory and fiscal measures (Salman, 1999), including licensing and charging for
abstraction, raising energy prices or reducing subsidies, licensing and controlling new
borehole construction and managing crop prices, imports and exports. A useful
introduction to these options is provided by Foster et al. (2000).

              Box 19.1. Saline intrusion in the Greater Jakarta area
The population of Greater Jakarta has risen from 1.5 million in 1950 to an
estimated 11-12 million in 2004. This rate of increase is typical of cities in the
region and, in this situation, water supply provision is a continuous challenge
with respect to both quantity and quality. In 1985 the total water demand of the
city was 450 million m3 and was met by surface water from rivers and
reservoirs and from groundwater. Some 200 million m3 were drawn by
innumerable shallow wells and 50 million m3 from deep wells. The latter is
estimated to have risen to 70 million m3 by 2000.
Hydrogeological setting: The base of the aquifer system in the Greater Jakarta
area is formed by consolidated Miocene sediments, which outcrop at the
southern boundary of the basin (Figure 19.1). The material filling the basin
consists of marine Pliocene and Quaternary fan and delta sediments that are up
to 300 m thick. Thin sandy layers, only 1-5 m thick, interbedded within the
predominantly silty and clayey sediments form the productive parts of the
aquifer system (Djaeni et al., 1986). On the basis of the vertical variation in
hydraulic conductivity in these sediments, the overall system can be divided into
a shallow unconfined aquifer zone down to 40 m, a middle zone from 40 m to
140 m and a deep, strongly confined aquifer zone below 140 m.

520                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

      Impacts of abstraction on groundwater levels: In 1900 the groundwater
      pressure head in the deep aquifer was at 5-15 m above sea level in the northern
      and central districts of Jakarta, and the few existing wells were generally
      overflowing. From 1900 to 1970, piezometric heads dropped at 0.1-0.2 m/a,
      increasing to more than 1 m/a in some areas of the city by the 1980s, and had
      dropped to 10-40 m below sea level by 1997 (Figure 19.1).
      Groundwater in the deep aquifer moves from the recharge area in the south
      which has an average annual rainfall of 2900 mm, to the discharge area of the
      coastal plain with an average rainfall of about 1700 mm/a. This rainfall is more
      than enough to replenish the shallow aquifer in normal rainy seasons, although
      in dry years the combination of increased abstraction and lack of recharge
      causes some water table decline in the shallow aquifer. However, the lateral
      inflow of about 15 million m3/a does not balance the abstraction referred to
      above, and the continuous drop in piezometric head indicates that downward
      leakage cannot balance the abstraction either because the vertical hydraulic
      conductivity of the confining layers is only 0.001 m/d. The area of groundwater
      depletion continues expanding laterally and vertically, and land subsidence is
      beginning to occur as a result (CCOP, 1999).
      Impacts on groundwater quality: The groundwater chloride content ranges from
      200 mg/l in the south to 600 mg/l further north (CCOP, 1999). The shallow
      aquifer suffers from saline intrusion extending 3-6 km inland from the coast,
      and is also affected by the infiltration of polluted recharge water, especially in
      the industrial areas and the most densely populated parts of the city. The deeper
      aquifer is less severely affected and in the coastal zone there appears to be
      quality stratification, with saline water in the upper aquifer (less than 100 m
      below ground), relatively fresh water from 100 m to 200 m and increasing
      salinity again below this depth.
      Managing the impacts of abstraction: The seawater encroachment would be
      more pronounced if the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments was greater.
      The aquifer system has been modelled to help define management and
      monitoring requirements. Further increases in groundwater abstraction would
      have major negative impacts on an already serious situation. Management
      recommendations include moving the centres of groundwater abstraction
      southwards further from the coast, and gradually closing down production wells
      in the area endangered by saline intrusion.

    A variant of controlled abstraction was introduced in the Chalk aquifer on the south
coast of England in 1957, following the very dry summers of 1949 and 1956 in which
water levels declined dramatically and saline intrusion threatened, especially around
Brighton (Headworth and Fox, 1986). In winter, when there is recharge and the most
active groundwater flow is towards the sea, pumping takes place from boreholes close to
the coast to intercept this flow without causing saline intrusion. In summer, at times of
lower groundwater levels and less active flow, the coastal wells are rested to reduce the
danger of saline intrusion and pumping takes place further inland, exploiting the storage
in the aquifer. As a result, average groundwater levels close to the coast have recovered
                               Hydrological management                                  521

by 4-5 m. Although there are significant additional costs for pumping and distribution,
which are taken account of in the abstraction scheduling, the overall policy has worked
well because service reservoirs in the distribution system have been closely controlled to
optimize pumping, the new supply sources added have allowed the abstraction to be
better distributed and the general lack of private supply boreholes helps to permit
comprehensive management by the water utility (Jones and Robins, 1999).
    As an alternative to reducing abstraction, methods of increasing local recharge close
to the coast have been developed. Novel methods include the use of seepage barriers by
placing recharge basins or lines of recharge wells between the coast and the areas of
groundwater abstraction. These help to restore groundwater levels by creating an
artificial recharge mound, which increases heads and pushes the saline interface down
and back towards the coast.
    Another method involves the use of abstraction barriers, by pumping from a line of
defence wells to form a cone of depression in the water table between the coast and the
valuable freshwater abstraction sources further inland, to intercept the saline water.
    All of these control measures require regular monitoring to check that they are in
place and functioning. They also require validation to check their effectiveness through
groundwater quality monitoring. As this can usually be done simply by measuring
electrical conductivity, monitoring is relatively inexpensive, either from regular field
measurements of discharged groundwater or by observing the movement of the saline
interface in suitably located observation boreholes. To support adequate monitoring
being carried out, monitoring regimes are best explicitly defined in management plans.


19.2       MANAGING ABSTRACTION TO CONTROL INDUCED
           POLLUTION
The widespread occurrence in thick aquifer sequences of downward leakage of shallow
polluted groundwater to deeper horizons providing public supply is also mentioned in
Chapter 8.6.2. This leakage may be induced or accelerated by heavy and prolonged
pumping from depth, such that polluted groundwater penetrates to depth more quickly
than anticipated. In the case of Santa Cruz illustrated in Chapter 8.6.2, however, using
chloride and nitrate as indicators of the polluted water, the pollution front does not appear
to have penetrated below about 90 m depth (Morris et al., 2003) despite the heavy
pumping from the deep public supply boreholes. This is probably because the continuing
abstraction from the shallow aquifer for private water supplies intercepts, abstracts and
recycles a proportion of the shallow, polluted water. Though in this case the situation
developed coincidentally, this is what good management of this aquifer system would
require and, provided that the shallow groundwater is not used for potable supply, both
the shallow and deep groundwater abstraction are able to continue.
   In such situations, controlling abstraction will be only one option in a range of
possible approaches to managing groundwater quality. In the Santa Cruz case, other
management activities that would improve the situation would be directed at reducing
the pollutant loading. Measures would include, for example, extending mains sewerage
to the most vulnerable and permeable strata underlying the urban area to reduce the
loading from unsewered sanitation, locating polluting industries away from these areas
522                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

and/or improving their practice of handling pollutants and disposing of effluents, as well
as using the planning process to encourage new city expansion over less vulnerable, clay-
covered areas. Hydrological management may include encouraging the use of the
shallow water for non-potable uses, lining wastewater or drainage canals or installing
mains sewerage, and possibly the development of new wellfields beyond the urban
boundaries to meet increasing demand.
   Pollution of the upper part of an aquifer sequence threatening deeper potable supply
boreholes can also occur in areas of intensive agriculture. In the United Kingdom, the
impact of rising nitrate concentrations in groundwater has been felt first in the uppermost
parts of the aquifers. When the problem was first observed, engineering solutions such as
deepening the abstraction boreholes or increasing the length of casing to shut out shallow
groundwater were advocated and tried. Because the impact of pollution on groundwater
quality is such a long-term process, such engineering measures are at best temporary
solutions, and reduced abstraction and blending with lower-nitrate water has become
more common.


19.3      MANAGEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE AND
          WASTEWATER USE
The main purposes of artificial recharge of groundwater are to store surface water and
reclaimed municipal wastewater or storm water for future use and to reduce, stop or
reverse declines of groundwater levels, in order to prevent eventual exhaustion of the
groundwater resource in the long term (Asano and Cotruvo, 2004). An aquifer can be
used to store surface water in times of excess, which is recovered in times of shortage,
particularly where the supply of water varies greatly over the year. Evaporation losses
from underground storage are much less than from surface storage reservoirs, and
environmental impact is likely to be lower. Artificial recharge can also be used to prevent
saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers and for oxygenation of an aquifer to change the
quality of groundwater.
    Recharge is also incidentally achieved, for example in irrigation and land treatment.
Rivers and canals are often used to carry uncontrolled and untreated domestic and
industrial effluents in and close to cities, and recharge from them, via unplanned
percolation or infiltration, has a major impact on the underlying groundwater quality
(Gooddy et al., 1997; Morris et al., 2003; Asano and Cotruvo, 2004). Recharge with
wastewater – both designed and unintentional – may be an important element of the
management of water quantity in an aquifer.
    A broad range of technologies and methods is used to recharge the water into the
ground. Artificial recharge is becoming increasingly important, and is a large and
growing subject with an extensive literature (NRC, 1994; Asano, 1998; Dillon, 2002;
Aertgeerts and Angelakis, 2003; Asano and Cotruvo, 2004).

19.3.1 Source water for recharge
Artificial recharge requires a sufficient and reliable source of water, and its choice is
related to the anticipated usage of the additional groundwater resources. Source waters
                               Hydrological management                                 523

used in practice include rivers, collected rainwater, water previously used for cooling or
heating purposes in production, water previously used for other purposes in production,
or untreated or treated wastewater. In a review of 45 case studies of aquifer recharge,
Pavelic and Dillon (1997) found that 71 per cent used natural source waters from rivers,
lakes or groundwater, 20 per cent used treated sewage effluent and 9 per cent used urban
storm water run-off.
    Where there is a large variation through the year in the amount of available water for
recharge, large storage volumes to cope with peak discharges may be required before
recharge occurs. As wastewater is often predictably available irrespective of the seasons
and climatic variations, it has great attraction as a source (NRC, 1994).
    Surface water, storm water and particularly wastewater used for aquifer recharge
usually contain a wide range of pathogens and chemical contaminants. Infiltration
through the soil and unsaturated zone can greatly improve the quality (Bouwer and Rice,
1984; Idelovitch and Michail, 1984), and where artificial recharge is undertaken with
poor quality water, the recharge process itself usually provides an element of water
treatment. On the other hand, contaminants introduced through recharge may lead to
long-term degradation of aquifer quality. The use of aquifer recharge therefore requires a
careful assessment of the risk of degrading the groundwater quality, particularly if it is a
source for drinking (see also Chapter 14). The nature and concentrations of pathogens
and chemical contaminants (Chapters 3 and 4) present in the water used for recharge,
aquifer vulnerability of the setting (Chapter 8), as well as recharge methods employed,
determine the need and level of pre-treatment and the residence time necessary in the
unsaturated zone for removal to be sufficiently effective so that the water can be used as
drinking-water without a health risk. With some types of recharge techniques or
installations, there may also be a health hazard at the surface, for example farmers
irrigating with wastewater, animals and children playing at infiltration lagoons that are
not fenced.
    Particularly in those instances where disposal of wastewater is the primary objective
and aquifer recharge is only an incidental or unintentional side-effect, little or no
consideration may have been given to the possibility that infiltration of water and
pollutants can have a major impact on the underlying groundwater. Improving the
management of these for the objective of sustainable use of an aquifer as drinking-water
resource will also require an assessment of current contamination as well as of aquifer
vulnerability (see Chapters 8 and 14), and introducing or upgrading wastewater treatment
prior to infiltration may prove necessary (see Section 19.3.2).
    For wastewater, Table 19.1 shows a range of recharge techniques, proposes a level of
treatment necessary to avoid aquifer degradation, and shows that, in many cases, the
actual level of treatment falls short of that required to prepare the wastewater.

19.3.2 Recharge techniques
For recharge to be sustainable and safe, systems need to be suitable for the water types
available and the underlying hydrogeological conditions, and the choice of site and
system are important control measures (see Chapter 19.6). Techniques for applying
water for infiltration include well injection, sprinkling onto the land surface and
infiltration basins
    Well injection does not retain contaminants through soil filtration. This technique is
often used where groundwater is deep or where the topography or the existing land use
makes surface application impractical or too expensive; or when direct injection is
particularly effective in creating freshwater barriers in coastal aquifers against intrusion
of saltwater (Asano and Cotruvo, 2004). Traditionally it consists of at least two wells,
one for injection of the water and one for recovery of the recharged water. Recently, well
injection that uses the same well for injection and recovery of recharged water, a
technology known as aquifer storage and recovery, has become more commonplace. For
conducting deep well injection safely, detailed hydrogeological information (e.g. extent
of the aquifer, water quality in the aquifer, regional groundwater flow) are necessary and
need to be carefully related to the quality of the water to be injected, particularly if the
aquifer is used for drinking-water supply.
    Sprinkling recharge water onto the land surface and allowing it to infiltrate downward
into the unsaturated zone may effectively remove contaminants by the treatment effect of
soils. This is a simple method suitable for water with a low suspended solid load, which
only requires sprinkling equipment, a pump and pipes and hoses to deliver the water. The
sprinkling system can be located at a fixed point, and water is sprinkled from that point
by rotating the sprinkler around it. Another method is by moving the sprinkling point on
a wagon/truck. By using a wagon or truck the water can be distributed more evenly at the
surface than when sprinkling is limited to single points.

   In basin infiltration the water is recharged from a basin created at the surface. Water is
pumped into the basin from which it infiltrates slowly into the unsaturated zone. This is
also a simple system where the only requirements are a pump and pipes/tubes to deliver
the water, and an excavator to create the basin. One advantage of using a basin instead of
the sprinkling system is that as long as the basin is filled with water the infiltration will
continue at the maximum infiltration rate, provided the basin is maintained to avoid
clogging.

19.3.3 Management of recharge to reduce pollution risk
A further requirement for artificial recharge to be effective is an adequate volume of
permanent or seasonal groundwater storage to be able to accept the recharging water.
The unsaturated zone requires a certain thickness so that slow infiltration allows
sufficient residence time to achieve sufficient removal of the possible pollutants. The
likelihood of pollution occurring depends on the scale and mode of infiltration, the
quality of the water and the hydrogeological conditions, and it is necessary to understand
the relationship between these to establish approaches to management that reduce the
risk of groundwater pollution (see also Chapter 14).

Selection of scale and mode of infiltration
The selection of methods for recharge depends on many factors, including land
availability, soil type, hydrogeological conditions, available finances and level of
technology and the need for subsequent recovery of the water (Asano, 1998). The nature
and hydraulic conductivity of the soil or subsoil and the required loading exercise major
control over the method used. Wright and Rovey (1979) determined that for wastewater
loading rates greater than 20 mm/d, basin or lagoon infiltration is applicable on sandy
soils. Below this loading, over-irrigation and overland flow methods should be used, and
can be applied on more silty or clayey soils. The former involves the application of
excess irrigation loads and the latter implies allowing the applied water to flow over the
irrigated land. The best soils for infiltration have hydraulic conductivities in the range 0.1
to 2 m/d. Below this range, very fine-grained soils will limit the rate of percolation and
above this, coarse-grained soils permit rapid infiltration but the residence times may not
be optimum for pollutant removal. The relationship between infiltration capacity of the
soils and infiltration method (Foster et al., 1994) and the availability of suitable land for
the construction of facilities is thus a key factor in the planning process.

Quality of the infiltrating water
The quality of the water will also influence the effectiveness of recharge, and highly
treated wastewater effluents or source water will infiltrate at the highest rates. As already
mentioned above, pre-treatment may be necessary to remove particles (e.g. bacteria,
algae or inorganic particles) or compounds that cause clogging of the injection wells,
sprinkler systems or the upper part of the unsaturated zone. The purpose of such pre-
treatment is to prolong the time a plant can function properly. Another pre-treatment
process is the addition of oxygen if the water contains very high concentrations of
organic material which have to be biodegraded, and the water does not contain sufficient
oxygen for the removal process.
526                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

   In some countries (e.g. the USA) aquifer recharge systems are legally required to use
only treated wastewater effluents, even if contaminants from primary effluents would
potentially be equally attenuated by infiltration and soil aquifer treatment (Lance et al.,
1980; Carlson, 1982).

Processes affecting water quality
During infiltration of recharge water, quality can undergo changes from the following:
    • microbial constituents can be attenuated by filtration and sedimentation, and can
        grow or decay;
    • organic compounds in the source water can be adsorbed onto, or ion exchange
        with, the soil particles, volatilize to the air phase, be subjected to biodegradation,
        and be chemically transformed;
    • inorganic compounds can also be adsorbed to, or ion exchange with, the soil,
        volatilize to the air phase, be transformed by redox processes, precipitated or
        dissolved, and participate in biodegradation of the organic compounds;
    • solids in the source water can be attenuated by filtration and sedimentation.
    Chemical transformations are not generally important processes in these situations
because the rates are usually very low compared to the residence time in an artificial
recharge system. In contrast, growth and decay of bacteria always occur, and some of the
most important pollutant attenuation processes in recharge (biodegradation of organic
compounds) are enhanced by the presence of suitable bacteria. Provision of suitable
organic substrate for bacterial activity may be one reason why the quality of primary
effluent is as effectively improved as that of secondary effluent, and why there is a
dilemma as to whether disinfection by chlorination before recharge is desirable, as it may
destroy soil microbial populations that take part in the elimination processes. Some of the
processes interact with each other: for example, carbon dioxide produced by
biodegradation is an acid and consequently changes the pH of the system, which in turn
affects microbial activity.
    The use of soil aquifer treatment has been shown to greatly reduce bacteria and
viruses, suspended solids, organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus (Bouwer and
Rice, 1984; Idelovitch and Michail, 1984; Jimenez and Chávez, 2004). Even when
untreated wastewater is used primarily for irrigation, but with incidental recharge
(Table 19.1), infiltration through the soil and unsaturated zone removes many or even
most of the pollutants. In the case of the very extensive irrigation with collected but
untreated wastewater in Mexico (Jimenez and Chávez, 2004), metals, organic carbon,
nutrients and pathogens are at least partially removed in the distribution system, the soil
and the aquifer. In detailed field investigations at Leon, salinity, the most unaffected and
conservative of pollutants in the wastewater, was observed to have penetrated deep into
the aquifer and affected the quality at 300-400 m deep public supply boreholes within the
wastewater irrigated area (Chilton et al., 1998).
    Agricultural or amenity irrigation with wastewater makes maximum use of the
attenuation properties of the soil. However, in many of the types of facilities listed in
Table 19.1, the soil is disturbed or removed, and this will reduce the capacity for
pollutant attenuation by the processes outlined above and described in more detail in
                               Hydrological management                                   527

Chapter 4. This is why there is a clear relationship between type of facility used and level
of treatment required.

Operational considerations in artificial recharge and wastewater use
Operational management of artificial recharge should be based on sound scientific
understanding and follow a general multiple barrier approach. These barriers would
include ensuring that the design level of treatment is adequate for the particular setting, is
secure, verification that the expected improvement in quality in the subsurface does in
fact occur, and that post-abstraction treatment in the case of potable supply use is also
properly maintained. Among the most important aspects of the management of artificial
recharge facilities is to ensure that the anticipated attenuation processes do indeed occur,
and that nothing happens to lessen their effectiveness. In fact, management usually has
three main objectives, which have to be balanced to optimize the operation of the
scheme:
    • maintain the efficiency of infiltration close to the rates envisaged in the design of
         the system;
    • maximize quality improvement by the physical, chemical and biological
         processes outlined above;
    • ensure avoidance of aquifer contamination.
    These objectives can often be in conflict, as rapid infiltration may mean insufficient
residence time for these renovating processes to operate. Thus if clogging of recharge
basins is a problem which is managed by periodic removal of the clogged layer, then
care has to be taken as the organic mat formed on the floor of the basin is a key
component in the attenuation processes. Algal and bacterial growth in basins or in the
water source used can also rapidly reduce infiltration rates, and may also encourage the
precipitation of calcium carbonate or iron salts, which can seal lagoons or injection wells.
Usually, this is limited to a zone a few centimetres thick. For injection wells, this is dealt
with by conventional well rehabilitation methods and chlorination, and the precipitates
may be removed from the well screens by introducing acids, agitating the mixture within
the well and pumping out the residue.
    For basins, clogging can be addressed by periodic drying out, or by removing the
uppermost soil layer. In an empty basin or in a sprinkling plant the clogged soil can be
taken away and discarded or the infiltration capacity can be regained by harrowing or
ploughing. If the basin is full of water the clogged soil can be excavated by use of
specially designed machinery or equipment. This has the advantage that the clogged soil
can be taken away without disturbing the operation of the plant. Where specific organic
compounds are removed from the recharge water by sorption to the soil of the basin
rather than by biodegradation, attention is needed to potential saturation of the soil: if the
soil’s capacity for removing such contaminants is exceeded and cannot be regained, it
can no longer be used for artificial recharge, and the topmost layer may need to be
removed.
    Management of the periodic flooding and drying of basins is a key factor in the
success of wastewater recharge projects, as this controls the alternation of oxidizing and
reducing conditions which are so essential to the biochemical processes involved in
attenuating nitrogen from the recharge water (Bouwer and Rice, 1984). Schemes should
528                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

be large enough and have sufficient separate basins to allow this to occur. In practice, the
inflow volume often increases beyond the design capacity as growing urban areas
generate more wastewater, and this compromises correct operation. The wetting and
drying cycles themselves have to be carefully managed as, especially in very hot and arid
climates, prolonged drying of the soil may damage the bacterial populations and decrease
the efficiency of bacterial attenuation processes until they have a chance to re-establish
themselves.
    As these operational considerations are of critical importance for the safety of aquifer
recharge schemes, the specific control measures identified for a given setting should be
documented in a management plan together with the operational monitoring system that
is to be used to ascertain that they continuously operate as specified (see also
Chapter 19.6).


19.4       BANK INFILTRATION
    Riverbank infiltration is a long-established method of obtaining drinking-water
supplies by using the attenuation capacity of the subsurface close to a riverbed as a
natural filter through which river water is drawn. In Europe, over 100 years of experience
of bank filtration has accumulated since the first such installations at Düsseldorf on the
Rhine and Nijmegen on the Waal in the 1870s. The review by Grischek et al. (2002)
indicates the scale and importance of bank filtration. In the Rhine basin, some 20 million
people receive their drinking-water supplies from bank filtration, and such facilities
provide 45 per cent of drinking-water in Hungary, 50 per cent in Slovakia, 16 per cent in
Germany and 5per cent in the Netherlands. Berlin is 75 per cent dependent on bank
filtration of lake water, and the cities of Düsseldorf and Budapest are totally dependent
on bank filtration. A useful summary of the features of selected bank filtration systems is
given by Grischek et al. (2002).Bank filtration schemes usually consist of a gallery or
line of wells or boreholes located parallel to and a short distance from a surface water
body. Pumping lowers the groundwater level adjacent to the surface water body,
inducing river water to move through the aquifer to the wells or boreholes. Current
understanding of the processes of pollutant attenuation processes in bank filtration
schemes is largely based on empirical knowledge. There are no common guidelines on
the conditions necessary for the optimization and adequate protection of bank filtration
schemes. As a rough approximation, minimum travel time approaches have often been
used, i.e. that the wells or boreholes should be located at a sufficient distance from the
river to allow 50 days flow time from riverbed to abstraction point (Grischek et al.,
2002), or 30-60 days as suggested by Huisman and Olsthoorn (1983). This has
traditionally been considered sufficient for pathogen removal. The distance from the river
bed to the abstraction wells is not directly reflected in the travel time, which also depends
on the aquifer thickness, abstraction rates and the nature of the riverbed material. In
practice, travel times range from a few days to more than ten years, and separation
distances from a few tens of metres to several hundred metres (Grischek et al., 2002).
More recent risk assessment approaches differentiate between groups of pathogens and
chemicals, and they measure or model the likely retention of contaminants in the
underground of the respective setting in relation to the given conditions (see also
                               Hydrological management                                   529

Chapters 3 and 4). As with other measures to reduce contaminant concentrations to safe
levels it is important to validate the individual system’s performance against the quality
targets given.
    The factors which determine the success of bank filtration schemes are a reliable
source of water in the river, acceptable river water quality, as well as sufficient
permeability of the river bed deposits and the adjacent alluvial formations. Provided that
the permeability of the stream bed and aquifer are high and the aquifer is of reasonable
thickness, then large amounts of water can be abstracted from the wells without serious
adverse affects on the groundwater levels on the inland side of the wells (Huisman and
Olsthoorn, 1983).
    It is possible to distinguish river water from groundwater at many such installations
by the use of isotopic or chemical tracers. Investigators have used chloride, boron, 18O
and, more recently, organic and pharmaceutical compounds as tracers of the treated
sewage component of major rivers. The proportion of water drawn from the river varies
from 10 per cent to nearly 100 per cent, and is often more than 50 per cent. At least some
of the water in a bank filtration well is inevitably drawn from the aquifer independently
of the bank filtrate. It may then be necessary to protect the groundwater from pollution
by imposing suitable source protection zones around the wells or line of wells. If the
aquifer material is sufficiently permeable to permit large volumes of water to move
through it from the river, it is probably also permeable enough to be vulnerable from
pollution at the ground surface. It may be necessary, therefore, to impose controls on
river water quality and, as in the case of the river bank filtration wells which provide part
of Budapest's municipal supply, groundwater protection measures which impose some
controls on urban and agricultural activities within their capture zones.
    River waters often carry considerable amounts of suspended matter, which can be left
on the river bed and cause clogging. To help prevent rapid clogging, the rate at which the
surface water enters the aquifer should be kept low, which is why multiple abstraction
points are normally used. Sometimes the banks and bed of the river are scraped or
dredged clean during periods of low flow to remove accumulated silt, clay and organic
matter, in much the same way as for artificial recharge basins mentioned above. As with
infiltration basins for artificial recharge, this has to be done with care, as the filter skin
formed on the bed of the river plays a key role in restricting pollutant transport, and its
careless total removal might allow breakthrough of previously attenuated pollutants.
    Bank filtration installations close to large rivers usually need to be well protected from
the danger of flooding to prevent short-circuiting or direct ingress of polluted
floodwaters. In many cases, this is achieved by bringing the well casing or caisson some
distance above the permanent ground level, so that access is raised above likely flood
levels.


19.5       VALIDATION OF ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE AND
           BANK INFILTRATION SCHEMES
Approaches to recharging aquifers with potentially contaminated surface water – and
particularly those schemes involving wastewater use – require validation of the
management approach to ensure that the water quality targets are met. Monitoring
530                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

programmes for validation need to be tailored to the specific problems identified in a
situation assessment for the given setting. For bank filtration, validation of the hazard
analysis requires repeated sampling and analyses of surface water quality and of
groundwater between the river and the abstraction boreholes or wells to investigate
which pollutants may enter the groundwater flow pathway and how well they are
attenuated before the water reaches the abstraction wells. For designed wastewater
recharge schemes, validation would usually include analyses of the quality of the
incoming wastewater, stages of the treatment process and the final water before use. The
monitoring of the quality of recharge water and groundwater at established recharge
schemes such as those in Arizona, USA (Bouwer and Rice, 1984) and the Dan region in
Israel (Idelovitch and Michail, 1984) have provided much of the evidence for the long-
term ability of soil-aquifer treatment to remove a range of pollutants, and these data are
also valuable for validation of the design of the systems.
    Depending on contaminants expected from the water used for recharge and/or
infiltration, parameters for validation may include:
     • microorganisms (e.g. faecal indicators or individual pathogens such as bacteria,
          viruses or protozoa);
     • specific organic compounds expected to be present in water used for recharge;
     • organic matter (TOC, BOD, etc.) especially if the recharge water is sewage;
     • regular drinking-water parameters (pH, conductivity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium,
          sulphate, iron, etc.);
     • if present in high density in the surface water used, algae and cyanobacteria (cell
          counts);
     • if cyanobacteria are present in high densities, the potential for breakthrough of
          their toxins should be assessed (e.g. through periodic screening following heavy
          blooms);
     • suspended solids;
     • in climates with seasonal change, water temperature as an indicator of the water’s
          travel time.


19.6      MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF CONTROL
          MEASURES FOR HYDROLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
Table 19.2 summarizes selected examples of the measures proposed above for ensuring
sustainable groundwater supply without compromising its quality. These begin with
planning the choice of sites for groundwater abstraction and determining permissible
amounts in relation to natural recharge. Where artificial recharge or bank filtration
schemes are intended, they should be planned and operated in relation to aquifer
vulnerability. Checking that design and construction are conducted adequately –
following the plans – is important because many of the structures for abstraction or
artificial recharge are installed underground, where they will rarely be accessible for
inspection later. Further, operational controls are critical to ensure that amounts
abstracted are in compliance with plans and permits. Likewise, operational controls for
artificial recharge or bank filtration address water volumes infiltrated as well as regimes
for removing clogging layers.

   Regardless of whether or not any of these control measures are part of a WSP, their
monitoring and verification is crucial to ensure that they are in place and are effective.
Table 19.2 therefore includes options for surveillance and monitoring of the control
measure examples given. Most of these focus on checking whether the controls are
operating as intended, rather than on contaminant concentrations in groundwater.


   NOTE X            The implementation of control measures in hydrological
                     management such as the examples suggested in Table 19.2 is
                     effectively supported if the stakeholders involved collaboratively
                     develop management plans that define the control measures and
                     how compliance is monitored, which corrective action should be
                     taken both during normal and during incident conditions,
                     responsibilities, lines of communication as well as documentation
                     procedures.
                     The implementation of control measures to protect drinking-water
                     aquifers from quality impairments caused by abstraction is
                     substantially facilitated by an environmental policy framework (see
                     Chapter 20).


    In addition to monitoring of the functioning of control measures, overall monitoring
programmes are important to verify comprehensively that groundwater abstraction is not
mobilizing contaminants or inducing saline intrusion. For artificial recharge or bank
filtration schemes, groundwater monitoring is particularly important to verify that these
are not introducing pollutants into aquifers used for drinking-water abstraction, i.e. that
the management concept is adequate and safe. This would typically include faecal
indicators and potentially pathogens of particular concern in the water infiltrated. Where
surface water used for infiltration is contaminated by chemicals from industry, household
use or small-scale enterprises, occasional validation of the efficacy of their removal
would be part of a monitoring programme to ensure overall groundwater safety.


   NOTE X            Options for monitoring suggested in Table 19.2 focus on the control
                     measures rather than on groundwater quality. Analysis of selected
                     parameters in groundwater which indicate drawdown of the water
                     table or migration of contaminants is suggested where this is the
                     most effective operational control.
                     Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are a
                     supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of providing
                     verification of the efficacy of overall drinking-water catchment
                     management.

Policy and legal systems to protect
groundwater
P. Chave, G. Howard, P. Bakir, S. Appleyard and
B. Hoque




This chapter deals with the policy and legal environment within which groundwater
protection and management should operate. Effective policies for groundwater protection
must take account of the institutional and cultural environment in the country, the
interrelationship of quantity and quality of groundwater, financial viability of any
proposed measures for protection and acceptability of the measures to society. Policies
that are considered reasonable in some countries may not be acceptable in others.
Therefore, where proposed policy builds on experience elsewhere, it is important that
local values of the society are taken into account. For this reason, it is essential that
effective policy development includes the public, government agencies and other
stakeholders potentially affected at the earliest possible stage.
    The overall process of developing and implementing policies and strategic
management for groundwater protection may follow the route shown in Figure 20.1.
    While step 3 of this process is discussed in some detail in Chapters 5 and 7 and
criteria for developing specific protection concepts are discussed in Chapter 17, this
chapter reviews the overall framework of governmental policy and institutions that
facilitates their implementation. Such a framework provides an important context in

which fragmental local initiatives and actions can be amalgamated in to a comprehensive
national or regional policy.

20.1       GROUNDWATER PROTECTION POLICIES
Policies need to be applied in a properly understood and constituted framework so that
their application is clear and their effectiveness is assured. OECD (1989) developed the
DPSIR causality framework (shown in Figure 20.2) to enable the basic issues in policy
development to be identified and possible impacts of proposed solutions to be tested. The
DPSIR framework involves five principal steps. The Driving forces describe the human
activities, such as the intensification of farming and chemical industry production or
development of land for housing, which may lead to significant threats to the
groundwater quality or quantity (as described in Section II ). The Pressures describe the
stresses that the developments place on a particular aquifer in terms of its possible uses.
The State of the aquifer is described in terms of its quality and hydraulic condition and
the Impact shows the outcome of loss of the source, for example the need to find
alternative drinking-water sources if an aquifer becomes unusable. Responses describe
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                    539

the policies that have been or are being developed to deal with the problem. By using the
DPSIR cycle it is possible to decide which of several alternative policies might be the
optimum solution. Although not directly included within the DPSIR framework,
processes to review effectiveness of responses are also critical (see Chapters 15 and 16).




Figure 20.2. DPSIR framework (EEA, 1998)

   UNECE (2000) has described how this approach is incorporated in the policy
development as being a set of seven key steps:
    1. Identify the functions or uses of the groundwater.
    2. Identify the issues and problems (particularly health related problems).
    3. Establish a function-issues table to see whether the issues are in conflict with the
       functions of the groundwater systems.
    4. Establish management objectives using the function-issue table for priority
       setting based upon urgency and technical/financial means (see also Chapter 15).
    5. Ensure that suitable information is collected on place and time dependent factors
       (on the groundwater body, the stages of the management programme, etc.), as
       discussed in Chapter 6.
    6. Use the DPSIR concept to examine the detailed relationships and causalities.
    7. Make a checklist with criteria that have to be met linked to the measurable factors
       identified above.
   The European Union’s Framework Directive for Water as one example of policy for
groundwater protection – in this case not primarily targeting its use as drinking-water
source – is described in Box 20.1.
540                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

          Box 20.1. Example of policy for groundwater protection – European Union
                              Framework Directive for Water
      The European Union (EU) water policy has been based on six basic principles:
      -    a high level of protection;
      -    application of the precautionary principle;
      -    the prevention of pollution;
      -    the rectification of pollution at source;
      -    adoption of the polluter pays principle;
      -    the integration of environmental protection into other policies such as
           agriculture, transport and energy.
      In the context of the application of these principles to the protection of
      groundwater, in 1992 the Council of Ministers (Resolution 92/C 59/02, OJ
      C59/2 6.3.92) recognized the dangers of falling groundwater levels and long-
      term problems associated with the pollution of certain aquifers, e.g. for
      providing drinking-water. As a result the Commission revised the Groundwater
      Directive by incorporating it into a general freshwater management policy.
      Consequently, the EU has adopted a new approach to water policy. The Water
      Framework Directive (EU, 2000) expands the scope of water protection to all
      waters, surface waters and groundwater and requires the achievement of ‘good
      status’ for all waters by a certain deadline. The regime will require the overall
      management of water based on river basins, with a combined approach of using
      emission limit values for the control of discharges and water quality standards
      applicable to the natural waters. The Directive also concerns water pricing and
      ensuring that the citizen is more involved in decision taking.
      The main features of this policy, which Member States of the EU will be
      obliged to transpose into their domestic legislation, include the recognition that
      underground water, as part of the whole water cycle, plays a part in maintaining
      a sustainable ecosystem and drinking-water supply and that water quantity and
      quality are inextricably linked. The policy will take account of the natural flow
      within the hydrological and hydrogeological cycles when determining action
      which is aimed at improving or maintaining the water’s good status.
      The polluter pays principle will be incorporated through the use of appropriate
      economic instruments with which to control water usage and pollution levels,
      and the whole system must be managed on a river basin basis – incorporating
      the requirements of groundwater and surface water as an integrated whole. The
      policy demands forward planning, through the development and publishing of
      river basin management plans with a significant degree of public involvement in
      such processes.
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                     541

20.1.1 Institutional issues for policy development
An effective first step for developing a groundwater protection policy is to establish a
policy task force that draws together the key institutions with an interest in the use and
management of groundwater resources. This taskforce would include e.g. Environment,
Health, Agriculture, Industry, Local Government and (where there are cross-border
aquifers) Foreign Affairs. Such an intersectoral task force requires representatives from
senior levels of Government who are able to develop and define policy, thus it may be
composed of the most senior civil servants who report directly to the Ministerial level.
    A lead agency would be identified to coordinate the definition of a policy and strategy
for groundwater protection and management. This agency should be mandated by the
inter-ministerial body, would typically fall under a Ministry of Environment or Water,
and may take the form of a Commission.
    Once the institutional environment has been reviewed, rationalization can be
considered as a means to develop a flexible and effective approach. This rationalization
will involve identifying which organization should take lead responsibility for
groundwater protection and consideration of how this should be structured, and
relationships between local and national components of the organization.
    Rationalization may result in the removal of responsibilities or power from some
organization, which is often a difficult process. It is essential that before major changes
are implemented, there is proper consideration of how this will be undertaken, what the
implications will be for staff and for the organization as a whole and how this will be
managed in the most effective manner.
    The relationships between the organization responsible for groundwater protection
and other organizations that either use or potentially pollute groundwater will need to be
defined. This will include not only the Government environment, but also NGOs and the
general public. The means of reporting will have to be transparent and accountable and
multiple reporting mechanisms may well be required.
    This institution will need to be supported by appropriate legislation and provided with
adequate powers to develop and enforce regulations and laws. Such powers may include
aspects such as issuing permits and abstraction licences, control of land use, defining
protecting areas and establishing minimum construction requirements. The groundwater
protection body must have adequate numbers of staff and resources in order to be able to
monitor groundwater resources, collect essential data and ensure that they can undertake
inspections and serve enforcement notices. The performance of the protection agency is
highly dependent on the staff it contains and without proper training and support, it will
be difficult to recruit and retain motivated staff of high calibre.
    The importance of resolving institutional arrangements from the outset of developing
groundwater protection should not be underestimated. Effective institutional frameworks
and clear and accountable systems of responsibilities greatly facilitate achieving the
objectives of groundwater protection.

20.1.2 Capacity-building to support institutional delivery
To support an intersectoral approach, interdisciplinary training is often required to ensure
that staff has the necessary competence and skills to resolve groundwater issues and to
542                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

work with other disciplines and sectors. Capacity-building ensures that staff is fully
aware of current policies for groundwater, understand the issues related to groundwater
management and have the expertise to provide advice and implement protection
measures. It is also critical that they understand what other disciplines and sectors need to
contribute to groundwater management. This is particularly important where water
suppliers do not own groundwater catchments and activities are required by a number of
sectors to ensure groundwater that is acceptable for use in drinking-water supplies (see
also Chapter 16). Box 20.2 highlights an example from India where the training of staff
was recognized as a critical aspect of improving institutional capacity to protect
groundwater.

               Box 20.2. Capacity-building in India (based on OECD, 1989)
      Between 1990 and 1997, a series of training events on groundwater
      management was run for senior engineers and scientists aimed at improving the
      sustainability of drinking-water supplies. Each year, up to 18 candidates were
      drawn from a variety of backgrounds and locations across India. For formal
      training they were first sent to the United Kingdom, followed by a period of
      fieldwork in a selected catchment within India to observe local conditions and
      apply the lessons learnt to identify polluting activities as well as potential
      solutions. The formal training considered all aspects of groundwater
      development from drilling techniques to groundwater modelling and included
      source protection and pollution prevention modules. As the course material was
      developed, trainers were coached in the context and presentation of this course
      material to allow transfer of the training element to India. The intensive course
      helped promote interchange between the different disciplines and requirements
      and expanded understanding of the interdependence of the different work
      streams.
      The fieldwork was undertaken over a period of five to eight weeks each year
      within a different State to allow a number of geological environments and levels
      of development to be covered. In all areas, the catchments were under stress
      from competing demands for limited resources or at risk from actual or
      threatening pollution. In the short time available the aim was for the delegates to
      gather sufficient information to allow an assessment of the catchment, describe
      the geological and hydrogeological environment, identify issues and promote
      solutions to aid management of the system.
      The most important solution identified by the candidates was to treat the
      catchment as an integrated unit for both planning and management purposes.
      Bringing the different users and departments together was seen as a major step
      to sustainable development and the appropriate allocation of scarce water
      resources. Education of local people in both aspects of hygiene and availability
      of water featured highly in improving public health. It was also recognized that
      further training and motivation of Government staff was required, and that
      improvements in agricultural practices could help to conserve water and make
      its application more effective.
                  Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                      543


    Overall groundwater availability was a major topic. Understanding its location
    and movement was key to successful development. The need for appropriate
    monitoring and sampling programmes was recognized. The provision of new,
    and maintenance of existing, water harvesting and retention structures to
    increase recharge and groundwater storage came high on the list of priorities.
    Often, existing structures were located in inappropriate positions or were
    installed for another purpose. With more integrated planning these could have
    been built to serve a number of purposes more effectively. Many could be
    modified at relatively minor costs to achieve these ends. Identification of
    optimum drilling locations using more modern techniques was encouraged, as
    in many villages some hand pumps ran dry early in the dry season due to
    inappropriate locations.
    Recognition of the value of water and its declaration as a National Asset were
    also seen as important issues. This helps avoid wastage and misuse, as well as
    promoting better utilization of existing resources. Aspects of the ownership of
    water and the infrastructure to capture and distribute it were considered to be
    important, as were pollution prevention matters. These ranged from simple
    wellhead protection to management of discharges from industry. At the end of
    the fieldwork period, the candidates prepared and presented their findings to an
    invited audience of local (as well as National) government representatives,
    village heads, NGOs and others contacted as part of the study. They then
    returned to their previous posts, often to be promoted, and have used their
    training to encourage better communication and awareness in their local areas.



20.1.3 International groundwaters
The UN Convention on the Protection and use of Transboundary Watercourses and
International Lakes, signed in Helsinki in 1992 (UN, 1992) recognizes the difficulties of
protecting water bodies, including groundwaters, which cross international borders. The
Convention requires all signatory countries to:
    • prevent, control and reduce pollution of waters which may have a transboundary
        impact;
    • to ensure that these waters are used with the aim of ecologically sound and
        rational water management;
    • to use such waters in a reasonable and equitable way;
    • to ensure that conservation of ecosystems is achieved.
   The Convention requires the adoption of prevention, control and reduction
programmes for water pollution, and the establishment of monitoring systems. Bilateral
and multilateral cooperation is essential to the successful protection of such waters and
riparian countries are expected to enter into agreements over such issues as joint
monitoring programmes and conduct joint programmes for the prevention, control and
reduction of transboundary impacts. Warning and alarm systems are required to inform
countries of any critical situations that have a cross-border impact.
544                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

    A Protocol on Water and Health to this Convention was agreed by an interministerial
conference in London in 1999. This Protocol links the issues of human health, water
resources and sustainable development and targets ‘the promotion, at all appropriate
levels, of human health and well-being within a framework of sustainable development,
including the protection of water ecosystems and through preventing, controlling and
reducing water-related diseases’. It emphasises the need to create legal, administrative
and economic frameworks to reach these targets, including the development of water
management plans, and explicitly
    • includes groundwater among other water environments;
    • includes WHO Guidelines as translated into national and international legislation;
    • addresses the protection of water used as source for drinking-water and the
         development of effective water management systems including controlling
         pollution;
    • includes promoting understanding of public health aspects by those responsible
         for water management and vice versa promoting the understanding of basic
         principles of water management, supply and sanitation among those responsible
         for public health;
    • requires the development of effective networks to monitor and assess water-
         related services (WHO and UNECE, 2001).
    The Protocol also explicitly includes a number of principles, including the
precautionary principle, particularly towards preventing outbreaks and incidents of
water-related diseases, using water resources in such a way that the needs of future
generations are not compromised, the polluter pays principle and access to information.
    UNECE has issued further guidance concerning groundwater management (UNECE,
2000). The development and implementation of cross-border policies for groundwater
depends upon institutional aspects, which include the arrangements and responsibilities
for cooperation. The convention requires that socioeconomic conditions in riparian
countries should be taken into account in deciding upon institutional arrangements.
    As discussed in Section II, to support management of transboundary groundwaters, it
is often useful that action plans, which include quantified targets and arrangements for
mutual assistance, are drawn up by riparian states taking into account items such as:
    • land and groundwater uses, including the possibility that restrictions or bans on
         certain activities may be imposed;
    • zoning criteria, including the concept of protection zones;
    • economic activities, paying attention to their impact on groundwater;
    • pollution and abstraction of groundwater, to include the necessity of monitoring
         and the sustainability of abstractions.
    To deal with transboundary groundwaters, the Convention requires the establishment
of Joint Bodies to take on the task of monitoring and assessment of the effectiveness of
the agreed measures as shown in the Box 20.3.
                  Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                    545

               Box 20.3. Tasks of Joint Bodies (based on UNECE, 2000)
    -   Collect, compile and evaluate data to identify pollution sources;
    -   develop joint monitoring programmes;
    -   draw up inventories and exchange information;
    -   establish emission limits for waste water and evaluate effectiveness of
        controls;
    -   elaborate joint water quality objectives and criteria for preventing,
        controlling and reducing cross boundary impacts;
    -   develop action programmes for pollution reduction from point and diffuse
        sources;
    -   establish early warning systems;
    -   serve as a forum for exchange of information;
    -   promote cooperation and exchange of information on BAT;
    -   participate in EIAs;
    -   coordinate activities of others.

The Merske Brook Case Study: An example of international cooperation
An example of the problems relating to international groundwater bodies and steps taken
to overcome these is found in the Merske catchment area of which 3185 ha are located in
Belgium and 2792 ha in the Netherlands. The Merske Brook is fed by deep groundwater
and infiltration from an agricultural area. The regional groundwater flow is from
Belgium into the Netherlands, but there are separate local systems where groundwater
from Belgium flows into the Netherlands over longer timescales. The catchment can be
subdivided into an area of deep groundwater exfiltration in the brook valley, a strongly
dehydrating area on which agriculture is practiced and a high infiltration area used for
forestry and agriculture. Deteriorating water quality and lowering of water tables
represent the problems. In order to help in resolving these problems, cross-border
catchment area committees have been established with the aim of bringing about a cross-
border water policy. Known as ‘Markcomite’ the Merske Committee was established in
1994 and has set up a number of research projects to aid water improvements. However,
the problems of setting up and running such cooperation should not be underestimated.
In this example it was found that clear differences existed between the two countries in
their internal water management regimes which needed to be resolved. Belgium
manages its groundwater at national level, whereas the Netherlands utilizes three levels –
national, provincial and local water board levels. In terms of water management the
Netherlands had various measurement networks already installed, supplying data to all
its administrative levels, whereas in Belgium there were fewer measurement systems.
However, the Dutch data were not generally mutually compatible. The availability of
data was not consistent, some being digital others not. Tackling differences in
institutional structures and data organization is frequently among the first tasks of
transboundary water committees and major harmonization of surveillance programmes
may be an important step of their work.

20.2      LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR GROUNDWATER
          PROTECTION
The availability of appropriate instruments to enable the implementation of groundwater
protection policies is essential. The important issue of groundwater ownership must be
dealt with and revisions to water rights may be an initial stage in the implementation of
policies.

20.2.1 Environmental legislation
The risk of groundwater pollution from commercial or industrial activities or urban
development can be reduced through incorporating groundwater protection strategies in
environmental legislation (Patrick et al., 1987). Equally, individual development
proposals can be assessed either through a formal EIA process and/or by systems of
licensing. Both EIAs and licensing can help ensure that potentially polluting activities are
located in areas where the risk of groundwater pollution is minimal. Licensing can also
ensure that activities conform to best management practices (BMPs). BMPs generally
define a set of standard operating procedures and design standards for a particular land
use to ensure that the risk of pollution from accidental spillage or over-application and
misuse of chemicals is minimized. Environmental licensing may also prescribe ongoing
groundwater monitoring and may require industries to undertake groundwater
remediation. Such measures need to be accompanied by enforcement with meaningful
penalties, which has proven successful in many countries.
    Environmental legislation can also help manage pollution from past land uses. Many
jurisdictions have provisions for surveying and managing contaminated sites.
Information on contaminated sites is maintained in publicly accessible databases, for
example various databases have been established by the US EPA. Owners of
contaminated sites in the USA (irrespective of whether they were the polluter or not) are
usually required to clean up contaminated soil and groundwater before land is sold and
redeveloped.
    Some jurisdictions have closely aligned environmental and planning legislation in
two important ways. Some environmental legislation allows entire planning schemes to
be subject to EIA, and there are formal links between different pieces of legislation to
allow this to happen. It is also possible in some jurisdictions to create regional
environmental protection policies that can support groundwater quality and thus
drinking-water quality protection. These policies will generally set out beneficial uses to
be protected and protection objectives, one of which may be protecting groundwater as
drinking-water resource. Such planning schemes may establish water quality standards
and set prescriptive controls on land uses.

20.2.2 Legislative reform
In many countries, much of the existing planning and environmental protection
legislation was drawn up before groundwater protection was a significant issue. In some
jurisdictions management of groundwater pollution has been compromised because there
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                      547

were many government agencies with overlapping responsibilities whose decisions
about particular development proposals were poorly coordinated. The management of
groundwater quality issues has been improved by either reforming the way that
government agencies work together using existing legislation, or by reforming legislation
and restructuring government agencies. The New Zealand Resource Management Act
(1991) is a good example of a piece of legislation where planning, environmental and
natural resource management issues are all coordinated through a single piece of
legislation.
    Legislative reform alone may not improve groundwater quality protection unless
there is the political will to effectively implement it (Foster et al., 1992). For political
action to occur, for example attaining strong support for allocating more finance to
groundwater protection measures, will require that the public perceives the benefits. This
poses special problems for groundwater. Frequently, the benefits of groundwater
protection measures are not obvious until well into the future, whereas any controls may
affect some people immediately. Communities may be tempted to postpone protection
measures until the degradation of groundwater quality used for drinking-water supply
becomes so severe that widespread concern amongst the general public or specific
interest groups prompts them into action. However, postponing groundwater protection
measures often leads to more costly and intractable problems in the long run. Educating
the general community about the importance of groundwater protection is one of the
most effective ways of influencing the political process to implement protection
measures.

20.2.3 The law relating to groundwater ownership and abstraction
       rights
A fundamental legal issue, which invariably needs attention, is the question of ownership
of underground water. This is because the introduction of protection measures by the
State usually involves the enactment of controls that apply to groundwater or to activities
on the ground above the aquifer. These controls may infringe existing rights and customs
and it may be necessary to modify or withdraw the existing rights of individuals in order
to enact the necessary changes. Ownership varies from country to country. In many
countries common law recognizes a link between water and land ownership (Howarth,
1992), however, in others ownership of water resources lies with the State.
   Where there is a link between land ownership and water, rights typically relate to the
right to abstract and use water, including drinking-water abstraction, rather than rights of
ownership of the water itself. In order to allow full control through a planned protection
regime it is often necessary to alter the legal status of such water rights. Where plans are
being developed to use water resources to their full extent, for example by the
conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, existing restrictions on the general
availability of groundwater caused by the imposition of individual water rights may be
unacceptable. Such rights may have to be extinguished so that access to all the available
water in a territory is guaranteed.
   Abstraction rates may have a fundamental influence on water quality. The control of
abstraction, often seen as a matter of the protection of quantity, is also an important issue
548                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

relating to quality (see Chapters 8 and 19). Control of abstraction requires a sound legal
basis and good enforcement. The different legal systems in different countries are very
varied, but for all approaches it is essential that the law is clear as to whom regulations
apply.
    As a general worldwide trend, there is a realization that individual rights need to be
subordinate to the protection of quantity and quality of groundwater resources, and
‘rights’ are being cancelled in favour of ‘permissions’ to undertake activities such as the
abstraction and use of groundwater.
    In the United Kingdom for example, where there are no established rights to riparian
ownership of underground water, but there are long-standing common law rights for its
abstraction and use, Section 24 of the Water Resources Act 1991 requires abstractors to
obtain a licence from the EA to drill a borehole and abstract underground water. Once
granted, this gives an indefinite right to withdraw water. The use of the water may be
specified as for drinking, irrigation, and so forth. However, under new proposals to
ensure the long-term sustainability of aquifers, these rights will be modified by central
government and time limits will be placed on the permit. The government originally
proposed a limit of 15 years when new authorizations are granted but, following
extensive consultation, the time limit may be varied to reflect an individual catchment
situation depending upon the local availability of water.
    Time limits on licences to abstract are imposed in some other countries. In South
Africa, individual ownership has been extinguished by decree under the Water Act
(1998), which takes the view that underground water is a common resource. Whilst
individual ownership rights to water are withdrawn, rights to abstract and use water are
granted through a licensing procedure. Licences are issued on a five-year cycle and for a
maximum time of 40 years, determined by the use to which the water is put. A reserved
quantity of 25 litres per person per day is retained before other uses are authorized to
ensure that people have access to sufficient water.
    In Arizona, a dry state of the USA, Active Management Areas are established where
groundwater is under threat. The use of groundwater is generally subjected only to rules
on reasonable usage, but where it is in short supply, water management rules are applied
and new abstractions of groundwater are subjected to a permitting procedure.


20.3      CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
The general public can only participate in decision-making on environmental health
issues if it has access to information. Often what is needed first in programmes to protect
groundwater is to ensure that all staff has the understanding and the tools to establish a
dialogue and atmosphere of trust with stakeholders. A Canadian expert on participation
has stated:
   ‘The level and quality of participation by the public will be no better than that
   of the staff in the proponent’s organization… The development of a relevant
   public participation policy is often part of the pre-work needed before
   launching a pro-active program with the organization’s external publics.’
   (O’Connor, 1993).
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                      549

    The general manager of the Montgomery, Alabama, Waterworks, emphasizes the
point of ensuring all staff know how to listen:
    ‘A key aspect of our program involved sitting back, getting out of the driver’s
    seat and becoming a one-vote stakeholder during the decision process, even
    though our agency was providing funding for the program… All of this
    inspired openness, trust and full buy-in among the 25 different stakeholder
    groups involved in the Catoma Creek Watershed.’ (Water and Wastewater
    International, 1999).
    Understanding the needs of the community, whether it be an entire nation or a small
village, is a prerequisite and part of the process of establishing a dialogue. Professionals
in public and private agencies developing policies must understand what the public
wants from them and be clear about what they want from the public. From that
knowledge, they can then begin to develop mutual trust, common goals and plans. This
requires that the breadth of views are represented. Continuous information gathering, and
reconfirmation with the stakeholders of conclusions on knowledge, attitudes and practice
is important for ensuring accuracy of assessments, monitoring of progress and change,
and establishing trust among stakeholders. Transparency of information dissemination is
extremely important and requires the development of communication plans. In
Bangladesh for example, communities had limited information with which to make
decisions, and it was recognized that improving their access to information would
strengthen their ability to fight for their rights (see Box 20.4).

     Box 20.4. Bangladesh – community initiative in regulating industrial pollution
    A detailed study of various publicly owned fertilizer and pulp plants showed
    that ‘even very poor people in Bangladesh can negotiate pollution reduction
    and compensation when the damage is evident and they have economic
    alternatives.’ The survey revealed ‘a pattern of informal regulation which has
    remarkably similar characteristics. Fish kills, paddy crop damage and poisoned
    drinking-water provide a straightforward, but limited, basis for damage
    estimation by downstream communities. Plant staff members live and work near
    these communities, and are therefore potentially subject to social pressures
    ranging from harassment through ostracism to outright violence.’ However,
    community pressure was only effective in areas where community members
    had alternative employment. In addition, ‘the affected communities are
    hampered by poor information. In some cases they cannot identify the offending
    polluter; they have little basis for assessing pollutant risk; and they generally
    know little about the cleanup options faced by polluting firms.’ In these cases,
    the communities need outside help from an NGO, government agency or
    concerned business in order to obtain more accurate information to support their
    claims (Huq and Wheeler, 1993).

   Similarly, a fundamental tenet of integrated water cycle management (including all
waters) that is being developed in NSW, Australia is the inclusion of all identified
stakeholders at the outset of the process. Agency staff develop and disseminate
information initially with the local water utility and then with the government agencies
550                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

and local interest groups. This process has ensured ownership of the process by all
involved as it is possible for everyone to understand how they impact on the water cycle.
Information is then used to refine the process and the adopted control measures that are
decided on by the local water utility and the community it serves.
   Community participation is an ongoing process of information gathering, dialogue
and negotiation. In the United Kingdom for example, where water and wastewater
services have been privatized, this was accompanied by creating the Ofwat National
Customer Council and Service Committees. Their mandate is to ensure that companies
continue to supply good quality drinking-water, look after the environment, keep average
prices low, improve customer service, and particularly to ensure this dialogue between
customers and providers (OFWAT, 1998).
   In developing countries, community participation in the provision of water supplies
and sanitation has been shown to be effective in rural areas and is increasingly noted as
successful in urban areas (World Bank, 1993; IRC, 1995; Satterthwaite, 1997; WHO and
UNICEF, 2000). Community participation in water resource management has been less
widely applied but is increasingly noted as successful, particularly within local
communities. Experience is far more limited with processes of dialogue with
communities about national and international water resource management despite the
urgent need in many parts of the world to ensure that this occurs.

Cultural values of groundwater
In some countries, groundwater has specific cultural meanings for part or all of the
population. It is important that these values are included in public participation
programmes on groundwater quality issues involving and/or affecting indigenous
communities. Some of these concepts are illustrated below with the example of
participation programmes involving aboriginal communities in Western Australia.
    Under Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage legislation, it is an offence to disturb
sites of special cultural significance to aboriginal communities, which generally include
land near springs, groundwater-dependent wetlands and waterways. It is a requirement
for all major development proposals to ensure that adequate consultation has taken place
with relevant aboriginal communities, including local custodians who are able to ‘speak
for the land’. Consultation has to take place in a culturally sensitive manner and is
usually mediated by anthropologists.
    In developments that utilize large amounts of groundwater and can cause
groundwater contamination such as large irrigation projects, it is important that
aboriginal communities are involved at an early stage in the planning stage to ensure the
protection of cultural values (Macintyre and Dobson, 1998; Yu, 1999). Allocation plans
for groundwater resources can then be developed ensuring that sufficient water is
allocated for the maintenance of cultural and environmental values before divertible
resources are determined. Cultural values (often the maintenance of specific water levels
in wetlands) have to be determined by consultation with relevant communities, and
sufficient research and site-specific investigations have to be undertaken to convince
these communities that groundwater quality will not be affected by the development (Yu,
1999).
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                      551

    Consultation is also needed when assessing and remediating existing groundwater
problems. One example is the metropolitan region of Perth, the largest urban centre in
Western Australia with a population of 1.3 million. There are a large number of heritage
sites in this area, particularly near rivers and wetlands. Consultation is required to ensure
that the location of monitoring boreholes to assess groundwater contamination and that
remediation using in-ground structures will not disturb sites of cultural importance.


20.4       LAND USE PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
There is a long recognized relationship between land use and pollution of groundwater,
although this may take decades to be noticed. Once pollution of an aquifer has occurred,
it is extremely difficult to clean up and it is rarely possible to return an aquifer to a
pristine condition. For this reason, the best practice is prevention through the regulation
of land use in areas that overlie groundwater flow systems.
    This section discusses both the advantages and the limitations of land use
management for protecting groundwater resources and provides an introduction to the
mechanisms and approaches commonly used to control land use. Land use management
to protect groundwater quality usually involves a combination of approaches and the
particular mix used will vary considerably.

20.4.1 Regulatory approaches to controlling land use in sensitive
       areas
Land uses and economic activities in sensitive areas, particularly in drinking-water
catchments, need to be subject to some form of government regulatory control, and
require approvals to proceed. Land use can be managed through a variety of tools
including national or regional planning regulations, environmental legislation and local
government by-laws.
    Although planning legislation varies considerably from country to country, it is
commonly organized in a hierarchical manner. Broad policies and principles are set at
the national level (or at an international level, where there is international grouping, such
as the European Union). Local regulations are established at a state or regional
government level, and local government is responsible for town planning and regulating
local zoning and the subdivision of land. Most planning controls to protect groundwater
quality are implemented by local governments, but groundwater protection issues can be
incorporated into national planning policies and regional planning regulations, as they are
in many states in the USA. The Statement of Planning Policy for the Jandakot region in
Perth, Western Australia shown in Box 20.5, provides an example of a regional policy
that recognizes the importance of groundwater protection.
    Controls on land zoning and subdivision imposed by local governments can be very
effective tools for protecting groundwater. Zoning consists in dividing a locality into
areas where the allowed land uses are specified and can be used both to define the kind
of land uses permitted and to regulate the permitted uses. Zoning can be used, therefore,
to direct future development towards defined objectives (groundwater protection usually
being only one of many reasons for controlling land use). Typical zoning requirements
552                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

for groundwater protection generally limit permitted uses, for example to low density
residential development with limited use of septic systems, or leaving land as public
open space. Such controls require continued monitoring to ensure that the requirements
are maintained through time. The protection zone concept for drinking-water catchments
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 17.

            Box 20.5. The Jandakot regional groundwater protection regulations
                              (based on Boyd et al., 1999)
      The protection of groundwater quality is recognized as an important element in
      land use management in the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme, the planning
      framework for the city of Perth. The Jandakot mound is one of the recharge
      areas for the region and includes land currently reserved for the protection of
      groundwater quality. Here, the purpose of the regional policy is to:ensure: that
      development in the area is compatible with the long-term use of groundwater
      for public water supply and ecosystem maintenance; ensure that land uses with
      potential detrimental effects on groundwater resources are brought under
      planning control; provide guidance on planning requirements for development
      proposals; guide local governments in amending their town planning schemes;
      acquaint affected landholders with the proposed changes in planning controls.
      Regional plans like that for Perth can help protect groundwater by ensuring the
      appropriate location and density of specific types of development, and by
      ensuring that waste disposal sites are located appropriately. Regional plans can
      also help guard against inconsistent decisions being made at a local government
      level when individual development proposals are viewed in isolation.

    Controls on land zoning and subdivision imposed by local governments can be very
effective tools for protecting groundwater. Zoning consists of dividing a locality into
areas where the allowed land uses are specified and can be used both to define the kind
of land uses permitted and to regulate the permitted uses. Zoning can be used, therefore,
to direct future development towards defined objectives (groundwater protection usually
being only one of many reasons for controlling land use). Typical zoning requirements
for groundwater protection generally limit permitted uses, for example to low density
residential development with limited use of septic systems, or leaving land as public
open space. Such controls require continued monitoring to ensure that the requirements
are maintained through time. The protection zone concept for drinking-water catchments
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 17.
    Where they are successfully applied both zoning and subdivision regulations are most
useful for controlling future development. However, they have little effect for
groundwater protection purposes in areas with previous development that led to
pollution. Some countries do, however, use such methods to control further degradation
of protected areas. For example, Chilean environmental legislation includes the concept
of saturated zones where no further development is permitted when one or more
environmental standards have already been surpassed (Government of Chile, 1994). In
Perth, Australia, there are programmes to replace septic tanks with sewer connections,
but existing groundwater contamination will take many years to dissipate. There are also
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                        553

media campaigns promoting the wise use of water and fertilizer, and of the benefits of
using local native plants in gardens, which do not need fertilizer (Appleyard and Powell,
1999). A number of community action groups are also becoming interested in the issue.

20.4.2 Other land use measures for pollution control
Governments are often reluctant to impose new controls and regulations on existing
activities to or impose retrospective legislation because of the potential for economic
disruption. Other forms of intervention are often required to protect groundwater quality,
usually taking the form of financial incentives or penalties.
    In particularly sensitive areas, governments may decide to purchase activities
considered to be potential sources of pollution, or offer significant financial incentives for
industries to relocate. Practices that cause groundwater pollution may be given incentives
for change. For example, tax incentives to use a specific type of fertilizer or pesticide that
is less susceptible to leaching or degrades in the soil more quickly, can be an effective
tool. Imposing penalties for any pollution above a certain standard also has a role to play.
    Market based approaches seek to relate the cost of contamination to the cause so that
the price mechanism can be used to restrict the amount of contamination that reaches
groundwater. Stringent application of the polluter pays principle should also lead to
polluting activities paying for the monitoring and reporting of contamination levels in
groundwater. Other market mechanisms such as insurance bonds may provide added
incentives for avoiding the pollution of groundwater in the longer term.


20.5       TOOLS FOR POLLUTION CONTROL
There are a number of specific tools and incentives that may be employed to maximize
the impact on groundwater protection policies and regulations. This may include the
setting of specific end-of-pipe control, establishing integrated pollution control measures,
use of prohibitions and the use of codes of practice. Some of the tools are discussed more
specifically in Chapters 21-25. Water quality objectives may also be determined to
provide a mechanism to reduce pollution of groundwater.
    Within all these approaches, the use of incentives is often as effective as the use of
prohibitions or controls. By providing evidence of benefits derived from reduced
pollution, many industries will be interested in changing practices. However, the use of
regulations remains important, but will only be as effective as the degree to which these
are enforced. Regulations and standards, without the back-up of inspection and
enforcement regimes are largely worthless. Similarly, regulations that are applied
discriminately may send the wrong message. For instance, towns and sewage services
are seen as an easy target for regulators when in fact it is often the agricultural sector that
is the major polluter. In some countries, the agricultural sector may be politically
powerful and may seem to be immune from regulatory enforcement in part because of
difficulties in enforcing regulations relating to diffuse sources. Tools for pollution control
thus need to be equitable and uniformly enforced.
    Legislation developed for general environmental protection and pollution control can
be employed to deal with activities which affect the quality of groundwater used as
554                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

drinking-water source. For example, laws which are used to regulate the quality of
discharges to watercourses so that the quality of water is not impaired can be extended to
groundwater. Permitting procedures for the discharge of materials from factories and
wastewater treatment plants are commonly used to control point source pollution and
these procedures can be applied specifically to protect groundwater. Control measures
for diffuse sources of pollution are more difficult to implement but the use of land use
planning procedures, codes of practice, and general attention to the pollution risks from
activities may help to reduce the risks of groundwater pollution. Pollution from road
construction, quarrying, landfill and oil installations, for example, can be tackled by
agreeing to necessary precautionary measures with the developers and operators of the
systems. Agricultural policies can also be developed that control the release of pollutants,
through for instance control of fertilizer and pesticide applications, as noted in
Chapter 21.

20.5.1 End of pipe controls
Legal remedies to groundwater pollution from point sources generally operate in one of
two ways – control of the discharge or control of the process from which the discharge
originates. In situations where it is possible to identify a discrete discharge from a pipe or
other such structure a ‘permitting’ regime may be established to control discharges of
polluting materials into watercourses or into the ground. In other cases, point source
pollution (for instance from pit latrines) may be controlled in sensitive areas by
establishing specific design and construction criteria.
    It may be considered necessary for an industrial or commercial organization to
dispose of its liquid effluents into or over the ground above an aquifer. In such cases the
permitting system may give adequate control over the quantity and content of the effluent
so that the groundwater is protected. Commonly used as end-of-pipe controls, such
permits are issued under legislation by the pollution control authorities following an
application for permission to discharge. The law usually requires an application to be
made by the discharger, stating the likely rate and constituents of the discharge, and the
authorizing body must take steps to consult interested parties and examine the likely
effect on the water before the permit is granted.
    In the United Kingdom for example, Section 85 of the Water Resources Act 1991
makes it an offence to allow the entry of poisonous, noxious or polluting material into
controlled waters (that is, most naturally occurring surface and underground waters), but
a discharge may be made following the issue of a permit under Section 88 of the Act. A
permit is granted after receipt of an application, local and national advertising of the
proposal, consultation with affected persons and statutory bodies and after consideration
of the likely effects of the discharge on the relevant water. A permit so granted may place
strict limits on the constituents of any discharge and the manner in which it is discharged
to prevent any deterioration in the receiving water.
    If the effluent contains particularly toxic or dangerous substances the issue of a permit
may have to be refused, as the risk of contaminating the groundwater to such an extent
that it could not be used for drinking purposes would be too high. This situation has been
dealt with in the European Union through the adoption of a specific directive, the
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                       555

Groundwater Directive (80/68/EEC) (EU, 1980), which prohibits the direct discharge of
dangerous substances into these waters, requires permits for indirect discharges (i.e.
discharges which percolate through the unsaturated zones), and which also limits the
discharge of other substances which may lead to pollution. This directive is reflected in
the local legislation in each of the Member States through a process of legal
transposition.

20.5.2 Integrated pollution control approach for industry
Although the use of permitting is an effective way of controlling known effluent
discharges, groundwater is easily contaminated by other routes. There are many
examples where spillage of materials or poorly designed storage facilities at industrial
sites (Chapter 11) have caused pollution and the careful control of discharge points has
not given adequate protection from activities on the site. Such problems extend to the
pollution caused by the disposal of solid wastes. To overcome such lack of control of
potentially polluting activities an alternative approach has been developed (see also
Chapter 23). In this concept, rather than limiting legislative control to the permitting of
individual discharges, the overall process itself is the subject of a permitting regime. The
approach uses the principle that all possible environmental impacts of all activities on the
site should be considered, taking account of the effects of the installation and its
discharges to air, land and water. Prior authorization must be obtained before the
installation is allowed to operate, and where a permit is granted and there are discharges
to the environment, the principle of using the best available techniques is applied to
prevent or minimize the extent of the discharges. This system has now been adopted in
the European Union, for example, through the Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control Directive (EU, 1996).
    Experience of using this manner of control has been gained in a number of countries.
For example, in the United Kingdom the Environmental Protection Act 1990 introduced
Integrated Pollution Control to a specified range of the most polluting industries; in
France the Law on Classified Installations of 19 July 1976 defines discharge thresholds
for air and water and the technical conditions which must be fulfilled in order to be
granted permission to undertake the activity; and in Sweden the Environmental
Protection Act of 1969 covers emissions to air and water and noise emissions and is
based on integrated pollution prevention principles. At present this regime is used for
larger installations because of the amount of work involved in assessing the pollution
potential and in enforcing the conditions of the resulting rather complex permit, but the
principle is capable of adoption for any size or type of plant, and could be used to limit
the construction of undesirable installations where groundwater is particularly at risk.
    Such an approach is particularly valuable for groundwater protection because the
procedure of assessing the impact of the process on the environment enables the
identification of risks of pollution from diffuse inputs as a result of spillages from storage
facilities or operations within the plant and also allows an assessment of the impact on
groundwater of such activities as ground disturbance during construction. The approach
requires attention to be given to the possible risks from closure of the site and any clean-
up measures required at this stage. This approach has central principles in common with
556                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

the WSP approach (see Chapter 16), such as system assessment for identifying risks and
process control. It is therefore a good basis for developing a WSP to include aquifer
protection.

20.5.3 Prohibitions
In some cases it is not possible to provide adequate protection of groundwater by means
of a permitting regime. This is because either the activity is regarded as too unpredictable
to enable enforceable conditions to be added to the permit, or because the activities are
intrinsically too dangerous to public health to permit them to be carried out in an area
used for water supply. In such cases the use of a prohibition notice may be required. The
legal basis of this must be clear, however, and the law needs to be clear on precisely what
is prohibited, and there must be suitable penalties to encourage people to obey the
prohibitions together with adequate enforcement.
    Some countries use prohibitions as a precursor to the issue of a permit, so that the
legal position is that the activity is prohibited unless a permit is in force, or unless specific
standards are met. For example, the Nigerian National Environmental Protection Act of
1991 prohibits the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water or land
unless limits set by the national Agency are met.
    In the United Kingdom prohibition notices may be issued at any time by virtue of the
Environment Act 1995 in respect of activities that are considered likely to cause
pollution. Such notices are short-term prohibitions requiring the person on whom they
are served to take action to deal with a problem.

20.5.4 Prevention of diffuse pollution of groundwater through
       Codes of Practice
In some cases, the issue of specific legal direction to avoid pollution is not possible. This
is particularly the case for non-point source pollution. For example, it would be very
difficult to control agricultural activities (Chapter 21), any of which might cause
contamination of groundwater, by the issue of laws covering all the possible activities
involved. In such cases the issue of codes of good practice offer an alternative. However,
approaches may be developed to consider the point of drainage of a sub-catchment into
other catchments, in which case the point of drainage can be seen as the point source.
Under this approach, targets may be set for sub-catchments and the activities within that
sub-catchment regulated or required to operate within BMPs accordingly.
    In the United Kingdom a Code of Good Agricultural Practice has been issued
(MAFF, 1991), and this has been given statutory status which means that if a farmer
causes pollution and is taken to court, the question of whether or not he has obeyed the
Code may be used as a material fact when deciding upon his penalty.
    Codes of Practice can be devised and successfully operate in a wide variety of
situations which could affect groundwater quality and quantity, including such diverse
areas as road building, mineral excavation, fuel storage and use and many more. The
codes should identify best practice in the context of the prevention of groundwater
pollution. This is an important commercial reality for water suppliers since guidelines,
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                       557

BMPs and codes of practice generally represent the current accepted body of knowledge
of their profession, making their application essential to demonstrate all reasonable
precautions and due diligence (Davison et al., 1999).

20.5.5 Prevention of diffuse pollution of groundwater through
       regulations
Although many activities are difficult to control through a legal permitting regime, it is
possible to identify some situations in which it is possible to be more precise about the
methods used to control them and to issue legally binding regulations or decrees. These
usually apply to particularly discrete issues. For example the problem of slurry storage
and slurry use on farms is a major problem to groundwater quality but the problems and
their solution can be readily identified. They relate to the design and use of storage
facilities, and how and when farm slurry can safely be spread on land in such a way that
water pollution is avoided. The Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel
Oil Regulations) 1991 of the United Kingdom is an example of a legally binding
regulation that sets out detailed guidance on storage and usage requirements. Such a
regulation would also have to be obeyed if the farmer was abiding by the Code of Good
Agricultural Practice but is a legally binding obligation in its own right. Similar issues for
which governments implement such regulations include specific requirements for the
storage and transport of hazardous chemicals or for car-washing facilities (see Chapters
23 and 25).

20.5.6 Water quality objectives
It is also possible to establish statutory water quality objectives for the water body, with
the compliance of such objectives a legal obligation. Water quality objectives define a
quality of water that must be met continuously for the whole water body taking into
account the range of needs (suitability for water supply, irrigation, industry and
ecological needs). Permits for waste discharge and disposal are then issued on the basis
of whether the discharge will cause deterioration in water quality so that the objectives
are no longer met. The advantage of setting such objectives is that it allows an overall
framework for water quality management across the water body and places individual
controls within a broader framework. Thus the nature of individual discharge permits
within water quality objectives requires that not only the impact on the immediate area is
considered, but also wider impacts on the water body as a whole.
    In the groundwater context applying such objectives may be more problematic, as the
effect of individual discharges on the mass of groundwater in an aquifer is very difficult
to predict and the proportion of the total amount of a contaminant found in an aquifer that
can be reasonably allocated to individual polluters is often difficult. The use of statutory
water quality objectives is therefore little used for groundwater, although the new Water
Framework directive of the EU proposes to establish objectives related to groundwater
status, including quality and quantity.
558                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

20.5.7 Controls on product specifications
For some pollutants, for instance pesticides, controls on production and use may be
effective in reducing the risk of groundwater contamination.
   This approach is being taken in a number of cases. In Canada, for example the Pest
Control Products Act 2002 regulates the distribution of those pesticides which are likely
to influence groundwater quality in a non-specific way, and the Pest Management
Regulatory System controls the production of pesticides. Such a system, although remote
from the point of influence, is believed to provide a holistic preventative measure against
groundwater pollution from pesticides. A rather similar indirect control on pesticides has
been introduced in the EU through the so-called Uniform Principles Directive
(91/414/EEC) in which a uniform authorization process is used to approve the active
ingredients in pesticide formulations before they are placed on the market.


20.6      ENFORCEMENT
The value of regulations is dependent on the degree to which they are enforced. An
essential prerequisite for groundwater protection regulation, therefore, is that the
organization responsible for protecting groundwater has a clear legal mandate, including
the powers to take action against organizations or individuals who breach the regulations.
This applies whether this organization operates at a national or local level and whether
groundwater is dealt with on a catchment, region or whole country basis.
    Once the legal basis on which groundwaters are to be protected has been established
and the policy has been implemented, there must be means of ensuring that those
affected continue to comply with the provisions. The regulatory organization needs to be
granted powers to inspect and to take action against non-compliance. The organization
may be the same as that which grants permits or controls pollution. Alternatively it can
be a separate enforcement agency or, as in some countries (e.g. Italy), it could be a
branch of the civil police. The organization will require legal powers to:
    • enter property and land
    • inspect and collect data
    • prosecute or levy fines.
    A key issue to be resolved is the determination of what constitutes a breach of
compliance of the legal requirements. The enforcement agency has a duty to determine
whether this has occurred. A decision must be taken as to when such a breach warrants
enforcement action, and the agency requires legal powers to proceed. Legal powers may
consist of verbal or written warnings, formal notices, administrative acts and fines,
invoking criminal sanctions. In some cases civil law may be used against a polluter. The
enforcement regime should contain a practical mechanism for ensuring that compliance
is improved. Enforcement is itself part of a cycle as shown in Figure 20.3.
    Permits and licences have to be drawn up in such a way that their conditions are
achievable. Compliance control of discharges and abstraction must be enacted by
suitable protocols, inspection visits, sampling, and other means of verification. An
important aspect of enforcement is promotion of the concept that licence holders should
take responsibility for meeting their conditions. The need to use enforcement action
                    Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                   559

through the courts or by other means should be a last resort. The possible need to review
and change legislation as a result of experience is also an integral part of this cycle.

20.7       MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR DISASTERS AND
           INCIDENTS
Disasters and major incidents affect all countries and the development of management
and preparedness plans for such situations is important in protecting public health.
Extreme conditions often place both the use and the management of groundwater under
considerable stress, as the quality and quantity of water from groundwater sources may
be affected. They may also become more important in the supply of water during
disasters as other sources become heavily contaminated and therefore good management
of groundwater where it is used for drinking purposes is essential. It is important to
develop intersectoral plans to protect groundwater during these events and to ensure that
different institutions have clearly defined roles and understand their responsibilities in
responding to disasters.
    The management challenges in extreme conditions will vary depending on the nature
and extent (both spatial and temporal) of the condition, local factors, available resources
and available information about appropriate technologies. Without the development of
management plans that can be quickly and effectively implemented, extreme events may
cause great suffering to the affected populations and may compromise the viability of
groundwater resources in the longer term.
560                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Disasters can be natural, including geological (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
landslides, tsunamis) and meteorological (tropical cyclones, floods, droughts), or man-
made (social disruption, war, industrial accidents, ecological mismanagement). Globally,
tropical cyclones, floods and earthquakes are shown to be the most frequent types of
disasters with earthquakes and tropical cyclones the most deadly regarding human life.
    The severity of a disaster depends on the magnitude of the event and the vulnerability
of the population and infrastructure. The people affected by a disaster are often faced by
increasing health risks and are often more vulnerable to water related diseases. For
instance, post-disaster diarrhoea epidemics frequently occur due to lack of access to safe
and adequate volume of domestic water. The causes of this reduced access are varied and
include damage to shallow groundwater sources and pollution of shallow aquifers. The
consequences of poor preparedness may be very significant for public health as shown in
Box 20.6.
    Good disaster preparedness and mitigation plans have important implications for
groundwater protection and health. Ensuring that appropriate measures are put in place to
reduce the likelihood of large-scale disruption or pollution of supply and developing
rapid response plans – for instance emergency chlorination programmes – will reduce the
impact of the disaster on water supply and public health.
    Controlling widespread contamination of the shallow aquifer may not be easy.
However, remediation is sometimes not as difficult as assumed. For instance in
Bangladesh it was found that the quality of water from flooded hand pumps usually
became better after it is pumped over several hours.

Disaster preparedness
Effective disaster preparedness involves a range of stakeholders, including Government
departments responsible for health, social services, water and local Government as well
as communities, the private sector and NGOs. It is usually most effective when a lead
agency is identified that takes responsibility for coordinating and planning the emergency
response and for ensuring that different agencies are aware of the support available and
the different roles they are expected to play.
   Emergency actions are usually looked upon as being short-term measures. However,
proper disaster management has immediate to long-term implications for appropriate
protection, utilization and sustainable development of the groundwater resources. A
properly developed disaster preparedness programme is an essential first step in this
management.
   The prorgramme should begin with a survey and mapping of all water facilities. It
may be of value to utilize GIS as a means of storing and presenting data in order to
define vulnerable areas and priority interventions. This will allow proper planning for the
disaster response to be undertaken and should indicate special needs for groundwater
protection and identification of points where resources must be available.
   Based on field surveys and assessed needs, the activities and procurement of the
materials possible within the available resources should be managed in consultation with
the stakeholders. Proper utilization of the disaster information and warning centres
should be part of the groundwater protection preparedness initiatives. Attempts should be
made to integrate the preparedness and response to disaster into the national planning and
                   Policy and legal systems to protect groundwater                        561

policy framework. Developing a strategy for community awareness-raising is essential to
support disaster preparedness.

         Box 20.6. Flooding and groundwater contamination in Bangladesh after
                                      cyclones
    During the cyclones in 1991 and flood in 1998 in Bangladesh, many tubewells
    were damaged and remained under water over several days and this led to
    deterioration in the physiochemical and microbial quality of the water. This
    probably occurred due both to direct ingress at the tubewells themselves as a
    result of inundation and a much wider gross contamination of the shallow
    aquifer. As the majority of the Bangladeshi population drinks water from
    tubewells, the damage and contamination of the tubewells represented a major
    public health crisis (Siddique et al., 1991). The numbers of people using the
    non-flooded tubewells increased significantly leading to long queues and long
    distances to tubewells. The reduced access to safe/usable tubewells affected the
    availability of water and consequently hindered personal and kitchen hygiene
    practices. As a result, diarrhoea epidemics were observed.
    One of the problems that Bangladesh faced was poor preparation for the effects
    of such a disaster, despite the regular occurrence of such events. The limited
    knowledge of groundwater management meant that little protection was
    provided to prevent damage to the infrastructure and remediation of widespread
    contamination of the shallow aquifer. Water was transported from other areas to
    the affected areas even though the water from non-flooded handpumps was
    safe. This created panic and unnecessary water shortage among the local people
    as they abandoned the local groundwater for the transported water. Moreover,
    the bacteriological quality of transported water was worse than the local
    handpump water and therefore represented a higher risk to public health.

Agriculture: Control and protection
S. Appleyard




Agricultural activities can contaminate vulnerable aquifers with a range of pathogens and
hazardous substances. The scale of their groundwater pollution potential is different from
other human activities, as animal manure, agrochemicals, sewage sludge or wastewater
are intentionally applied to land, often to large areas. Contaminants relevant to human
health include a range of pathogens carried by farm animals but also infectious to
humans, nitrate and a wide range of pesticides. Land clearing and irrigation practices also
impact aquifer vulnerability and hydraulic loading and thus affect pollution potential.
    There are a wide range of measures that can be implemented to reduce the impacts of
agricultural production on groundwater quality. These include structural measures such
as the construction of treatment facilities for wastewater from intensive animal feeding
operations or adequately sized, sealed and bounded sites for pesticide mixing and
cleaning of equipment; and operational measures such as applying the correct amount of
fertilizer at times of the year when plant uptake occurs, or matching irrigation to crop
needs. Control measures in planning address the type of agricultural land use in relation
to aquifer vulnerability and use. Examples include restricting or limiting stock density
and type of crop. In general agricultural management practices are aimed at reducing the
pollution of groundwater by either minimizing the availability of pollutants (source
reduction), by retarding the transport of water, pathogens and nutrients through the soil
profile, or by chemically or biologically transforming chemical pollutants (e.g.
pesticides) into less toxic materials within the soil profile.

    These management practices are often referred to as good management practices.
However, the term “good” is often a highly subjective and site-specific label: what is
adequate in one area may not work in a different location due to differences in physical
conditions, or to cultural factors which may restrict the adoption of a particular measure
by local farmers.
    Management practices generally cannot solve water quality problems in isolation, but
are used in combinations to build management practice systems (US EPA, 2000). For
example, soil testing is a good practice for nutrient management but, to be fully effective,
it also requires estimates of realistic yield, good water management, appropriate planting
techniques, proper nutrient selection, rates and placement. A set of practices does not
constitute an effective management system unless the practices are selected and designed
to function together to achieve specific water quality objectives reliably and efficiently.
Their documentation in a management plan is important to define routines of monitoring
whether practices are being adhered to and are functioning as intended.
    In general, changes in agricultural practices will only occur if there is some incentive
for new techniques to be adopted. This usually means that the measures are affordable
for farmers, and that they can either see cost savings in implementing the measures, or
that financial incentives are offered by government agencies, water suppliers or
consumers for implementing the measures. The provision of a system of branding goods
as environmentally responsible products may also be of benefit to the growing market for
organic and green produce.
 The implementation of good management practices and control measures to protect
drinking-water catchments from contamination through agricultural activities is
substantially facilitated by an agricultural policy targeting sustainable use of resources.
Many measures for this broader environmental target will encompass the protection of
groundwater used for drinking-water. They may include but are not restricted to:
      • training and education programmes to increase local awareness of agricultural
         impacts on groundwater and drinking-water quality;
      • establishment of catchment management groups with involvement of local
         community, relevant government agencies and local politicians;
      • conversion programmes of arable land to unfertilized grassland.
    Vice versa, the development of control measures for agriculture in drinking-water
protection zones in some countries has pioneered the development of approaches to
environmentally sound agricultural practices.
    This chapter presents information on management practices that have proven to be
effective in controlling groundwater pollution, and looks at how they can be
implemented both at the farm scale and at the catchment or watershed scale. It is not
intended to be a comprehensive account of all agricultural pollution control measures,
but sufficient information is provided for local authorities to develop practices suited to
their local conditions, usually in collaboration between the sectors responsible for public
health, water management, agriculture and environment.
                         Agriculture: Control and protection                           565


   NOTE X           In developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16), system assessment
                    would review the efficacy of control measures and management
                    plans for protecting groundwater in the drinking-water catchment
                    from agriculture. Chapter 9 provides the background information
                    about the potential impact of agriculture on groundwater and
                    provides guidance on the information needed to analyse these
                    hazards.
                    This chapter introduces options for controlling risks from
                    agriculture. As the responsibility for agriculture usually falls outside
                    that of drinking-water suppliers, close collaboration of the
                    stakeholders involved, including the authorities responsible for
                    agriculture, is important to implement, upgrade and monitor these
                    control measures. This may be initiated by the drinking-water
                    sector, e.g. in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan or of
                    designating protection zones (see Chapter 17).




21.1      PATHOGEN MANAGEMENT ON AGRICULTURAL
          LAND
As discussed in Chapter 9, a number of pathogens occurring in animal manure may also
cause illness in humans. These include bacteria (e.g. E. coli O157:H7, Leptospira,
Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter spp., Listeria moncytogenes, Salmonella spp.,
Clostridium perfringens), viruses (e.g. hepatitis E) and protozoa (e.g. Cryptosporidium
parvum, Giardia lamblia). Pathogens may further be introduced through wastewater
irrigation or use of sewage sludge on agricultural land. Although filtration through the
subsoil may attenuate them more readily than nitrate or agrochemicals, where they do
break through into drinking-water aquifers, pathogenic microorganisms are likely to
present the most immediate and serious threat to public health. Consequently in such
settings, implementing management measures to deal with this issue often has a high
priority in relation to contamination from agrochemicals. Many of the management
measures that are implemented for controlling groundwater contamination by pathogens,
however, will also prevent contamination by chemicals derived from agricultural land
use.
    In general, there are four specific points in a farm management system where targeted
control measures will help prevent the transport and proliferation of microorganisms that
may be carried by stock but can cause disease in humans. These points are:
      • Avoiding the import of pathogens into farms to prevent a specific disease from
         becoming established and proliferating in a farm setting. The main sources of
         pathogen import include new stock, the purchase of contaminated feeds,
         importing contaminated drinking-water, infected farm workers, contaminated
566                          Protecting Groundwater for Health

        soil and manure carried between farms on farm machinery or tools, and the
        introduction of diseases by pests and wildlife.
     • Interrupting the cycle of pathogen amplification and proliferation on a farm.
        Pathogens can be circulated on a farm through poor storage and handling
        practices for feeds, drinking-water, and animal wastes.
     • Safe waste management. Poor waste management practices can contribute to
        animal re-infection and can greatly increase the risk of groundwater becoming
        contaminated with pathogens. The risk of waterborne disease is particularly high
        in areas where fresh human excrement is applied as a fertilizer and for soil
        amendment.
     • Preventing pathogen export or transport from a farm. Without careful
        management, pathogens can be exported from a farm to initiate a cycle of
        infection and drinking-water contamination in other areas.
   Management measures that are effective in minimizing pathogen proliferation at one
or more of these points are outlined in Table 21.1, and are described in more detail
below. A more detailed overview on zoonotic waterborne pathogens in animal reservoirs
and their control on farm level is given by Gannon (2004). In general, management
measures to reduce pathogen levels on farms should not be implemented in isolation, but
rather an integrated pathogen management system should be established where linked
management measures that target one or more of these control points work together to
break the infection cycle that can indirectly lead to the contamination of drinking-water.

xxx = direct control of pathogens; x = indirect control of pathogens

Although the above control measures will greatly reduce the numbers of animal-borne
pathogens on a farm, it is unlikely that specific pathogens will be totally eliminated from
an agricultural environment. Consequently, additional management measures are
generally required to protect groundwater supplies from microbial contamination in
                          Agriculture: Control and protection                           567

agricultural areas to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. Measures include
structural features and land use practices that are applied at all scales from the immediate
vicinity of wells and springs used for water supply, to the entire groundwater recharge
area. In regions where implementation is difficult (e.g. due to lack of financial resources),
it is recommended that control measures in drinking-water catchment areas are
implemented as a matter of priority before general catchment-wide measures are
implemented.
A number of control measures are given below, in order of increasing distance from
water supply wells. :
       • Wellhead construction: microbial contamination of water in wells can be
           minimized by ensuring that dug wells are surrounded by an impermeable apron
           (concrete or other material) constructed above ground level to prevent the
           ingress of surface runoff. Contamination of tubewells can be minimized by
           ensuring that casing is constructed above groundwater level and has no cracks
           that will allow water to enter. The annular space surrounding the casing should
           be sealed with cement to prevent water ingress (for details see Chapter 18).
       • Wellhead inspections and maintenance: regular, systematic inspection of the
           structural condition of wells and of activities in the immediate vicinity of water
           supply wells will help reduce the risk of pathogen contamination caused by
           construction problems (for details see Chapter 18).
       • Drainage management: drains and bunds can help ensure that contaminated
           surface runoff is diverted away from water supply wells and springs (for details
           see Chapter 18).
       • Backflow prevention: the use of check valves or other devices on pipe
           connections to wells can help prevent potentially contaminated water siphoning
           back into a well.
       • Stock access and waste storage: stock should be excluded from areas where
           wells have been constructed by the use of fences. Manure or other waste
           materials should not be stored or applied within the stock exclusion zone.
       • Water table access: karstic features (such as dolines and caves) or abandoned
           mine shafts where there is a direct connection between the land surface and the
           water table can be fenced-off and drainage diverted to prevent contaminated
           runoff flowing directly to the water table without being filtered in the soil
           profile.
       • Storage of manure and other waste materials: storage areas should have
           sufficient capacity to accommodate livestock manure during the rainy season
           or winter months when land application is not possible. The risk of
           groundwater contamination can be minimized by ensuring these materials are
           stored on a bounded impermeable surface (preferably covered with a roof).
           Liquid manure can be stored in covered storage tanks or in appropriately sized
           and lined wastewater treatment ponds. Covered storage facilities reduce
           nutrient losses (e.g. ammonia) (EA, 2001).
       • Animal waste treatment: there are several treatment techniques that can be
           employed by farmers to ensure that pathogen levels are reduced before animal
           manures and sewage sludges are applied to agricultural land. They include
           composting, air drying, lagoon storage, aerobic digestion and lime stabilization.
568                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

          Composting is one of the most effective techniques (using within-vessel, static
          aerated pile or windrow composting methods). If the composting process is
          well managed, pathogen levels can be reduced by more than 4 logs (Sobsey et
          al., 2003; Gannon et al., 2004). To ensure that pathogens are killed,
          temperatures within the compost pile should be between 45 ºC and 55 ºC (with
          short periods exceeding 45 ºC) (EA, 2001). If the compost pile is not covered
          during the composting process, up to 50 per cent of the carbon and 20-30 per
          cent of the nitrogen may be lost from the material, reducing the effectiveness of
          the composted waste as a fertilizer (Goss et al., 2001).
       • Another effective option for treating animal wastes to remove pathogens is to
          process them in an anaerobic digester to generate biogas that can be used for
          household use. Once again, the temperature inside the biogas generator should
          exceed 55 oC to ensure pathogens are eliminated from the wastes. Depending
          on design and operating conditions, pathogen reduction typically is more than 4
          logs (Sobsey et al., 2003; Gannon et al., 2004). Aerobic and anaerobic
          biological treatment processes (including composting and anaerobic digestion)
          that operate at mesophilic conditions (i.e. below 35-45 ºC) are unlikely to
          reduce pathogen levels by more than 1-2 logs (Sobsey et al., 2003).
       • Lime treatment is another option for treating animal wastes. Pathogen levels in
          animal wastes can be reduced by a factor of 1000 to 10 000 if sufficient lime is
          added to raise the pH of the material to 12 for at least a 2-hour period (Sobsey
          et al., 2003). Long-term storage of manure for several months can also reduce
          pathogen levels in wastes. Desiccation or air drying to very low moisture levels
          (<1 per cent) will typically result in more than 4 log reductions. At moisture
          levels of 5 per cent however, pathogen reduction will typically be less than a
          factor of 10 only (Sobsey et al., 2003; Gannon et al., 2004). Protozoa such as
          Cryptosporidium and Giardia may persist in cyst form.
       • Manure application – ensuring that manure is not applied immediately upslope
          of water supply wells or when there is a high risk of rainfall will reduce the risk
          of groundwater contamination by microbes and nitrate. Incorporation of
          manure into soil rather than simply applying the material on the soil surface
          will also greatly reduce the risk of microbes being transported in surface runoff
          and being washed into poorly constructed wells or through bedrock fractures or
          karstic features in areas where the soil cover is thin or absent.
       • Pasture maintenance – ensuring that pasture is maintained in good condition
          by controlling stock density and through appropriate rotation periods will
          reduce the mobility of microbes in surface runoff and water percolating into the
          soil during rainfall events. This may include fences to protect particularly
          vulnerable features from stock and excreta.
   Depending on the size and type of agricultural enterprise, management plans may be
useful to define these control measures, their operational monitoring, critical limits and
corrective actions (e.g. in animal waste treatment, duration, temperature or pH effectively
inactivating pathogens), maintenance of facilities, responsibilities and documentation.

21.2       NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT ON AGRICULTURAL
           LAND
In the context of groundwater protection for health, nitrate is the only relevant nutrient,
and the following discussion will therefore focus on control measures for managing
nitrate application. However, nutrient management will often also include phosphorus in
order to protect surface waters from eutrophication and its consequences for water
quality. Effective nutrient management restricts the movement of nitrogen and
phosphorus compounds through soil profiles by minimizing the amount of nutrients that
can be leached below crop root zones (source control). This is usually achieved by
developing a nutrient budget for the crop, applying nutrients at the correct time using
appropriate application methods, applying only sufficient nutrients to produce the crop,
and considering specific environmental risks that may be posed by a specific site (e.g. the
presence of karst features, etc.). The focus of nutrient management is to increase the
efficiency by which applied nutrients are used by crops and thereby reducing the risk of
leaching. In many cases, the implementation of nutrient management measures results in
less fertilizer or manure being used on crops, reducing overall crop production costs and
thus often creating a benefit for the farmer.
    The main principles that should apply in nutrient management on crops to protect
groundwater quality are:
      • determine realistic yields for crops under local soil and climatic conditions
         (preferably accounting for soil variations on a field-by-field basis) – i.e. not trying
         to force crops with excessive fertilizer application;
      • account for nutrients available to crops from all sources before applying
         additional fertilizer or manure (i.e. ensuring that only sufficient nutrients are
         available for crop growth);
      • synchronize nutrient applications (particularly nitrogen) with crop needs: nitrogen
         is most needed during active crop growth, and nitrogen applied at other times is
         easily leached from soils.
    Management practices that address these principles are addressed below.

Preparation of nutrient management plans
Nutrient management plans are often required by local authorities to ensure farmers are
using nutrients in an efficient way at the farm scale that prevents groundwater pollution.
A plan should contain information about the nature and distribution of soils on the farm,
their nutrient status, nutrient leachability and soil erodability, and a description of the
proposed and past agricultural practices on the farm, and the proposed measures to
prevent groundwater pollution and the erosion of soils from the property. If crops are
irrigated, then sufficient rainfall, evaporation and irrigation information should be
provided to determine the soil-water balance and assess the risk of nutrient leaching.
    Nutrients need to be applied with fertilizers and manures in adequate amounts for a
particular crop and close to the time when they are needed for crop growth to minimize
the potential for leaching of excess soluble nutrients. Determining an appropriate
fertilizing regime for nitrogen, as part of the nutrient management plan, requires
application of only the amount of nitrogen that is needed by the crop minus any available
570                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

nitrogen pools in the soil or from crop residues: The optimum nitrogen fertilizing rate for
field crops, applied as chemical fertilizer or manure, can be roughly estimated as follows
(modified from Feldwisch and Schultheiß, 1998):

        Nitrogen uptake by harvested crop in kg N/dt (see Table 21.2 for examples)
    • Realistic estimate of expected yields of a particular crop variety under local soil
      and climate conditions (dt/ha)
    + Surcharge for non-harvestable residues, i.e. roots, stubble, leaf fall: depending on
      the crop, this rate ranges between 20-50 kg N/ha
    − Mineral nitrogen pool in the soil at the beginning of the growing season: the
      nutrient status of soil is best determined from soil analyses, or is estimated from
      previous experience or long-term records
    − Nitrogen delivery from preceding or residual crops remaining in fields (e.g.
      straw, leaves, herbage) (see Table 21.3 for examples)
    − Nitrogen delivery from intercrops/catch-crops: depending on the crop, this rate
      ranges between 0-40 kg N/ha
    − Nitrogen delivery from soils, i.e. from mineralization processes of organic
      nitrogen during the vegetation period (see Table 21.4 for examples).

    In general, less fertilizer should be applied to lighter, sandy soils than clay-rich soils.
As a general guide, nitrogen applications in excess of 140 kg/ha on sandy soils and
200 kg/ha on loamy soils in any 12 months commonly lead to nitrate concentrations in
groundwater exceeding drinking-water guidelines. An effective approach to avoid excess
nitrate leaching into groundwater is to apply manures only at rates necessary to meet crop
phosphorus needs, with any additional nitrogen requirements being met with the
application of chemical fertilizers or the use of legumes in crop rotations. The amount of
fertilizer required to provide 100 kg of nitrogen to soils for a variety of types of fertilizers
commonly used in agriculture is summarized in Table 21.5. The use of Global
Positioning Systems on agricultural equipment can help optimize application rates to suit
variations in soil type across a field.
    In addition to determining the appropriate rate, the following measures should be
taken when developing a fertilizing regime for a particular crop:
      • selecting the appropriate type of fertilizer for a particular crop type and suited for
         the expected growth rate;
      • selecting the appropriate method of applying fertilizer for a specific crop type
         which ensures maximum nutrient uptake (for example, row fertilizing, top
         fertilizing, foliar fertilizing);
      • ensuring that only crops adapted for local conditions are grown;
      • ensuring that the nutrient content of manure and crop residues are properly
         evaluated to allow a comprehensive nutrient budget to be determined.
    In groundwater recharge areas, it is often necessary to reduce fertilizer application
rates to protect groundwater quality, and the total nutrient demand of the crop should be
considered.

Use of soil surveys
Soil surveys are often carried out to identify variations in soils across the farm, determine
likely variations in crop productivity, and identify environmentally sensitive sites. This
allows management plans to be developed that take into account local variations. Aerial
photographs and existing soil maps are often used to undertake the survey. If the farm is
located in a catchment where agriculture is known to have caused nutrient
contamination, a nutrient management plan is usually required to help prevent further
deterioration of water quality. This will again allow for more responsive management
plans to be developed that reflect local variations and conditions.

Appropriate timing of fertilizer application
Fertilizers or manures should be applied during growing seasons when plant uptake is at
a maximum. They should not be applied at times when heavy rainfall or melting snow
can leach nutrients below plant root zones, making the nutrients unavailable for crops.
                          Agriculture: Control and protection                           573

Fertilizer or manure applications can be matched to crop uptake rates by splitting the
nutrient budget over several applications, use of slow release fertilizers, fertigation (i.e.
including small amounts of nutrients in irrigation water) or by applying denitrifying
inhibiters to reduce nitrogen loss in soils. Manures should be applied uniformly in
accordance with crop needs, and surface applications to no-till cropland should be
avoided.

Maintenance of buffers or protection zones around sensitive areas
Protection of drinking-water supplies and sensitive environmental features in agricultural
regions may require appropriate buffers to be established to allow nutrient and other
contaminant levels to be attenuated. Land in such buffer or protection zones should not
be a source of nutrient pollution. Possible land uses include reserves of native vegetation,
tree lots or parks used for passive recreation (see also Chapter 17).Their protection and
maintenance may be designated in a management plan in order to avoid degradation and
loss of function.

Use of crop sequences to minimize nitrogen leaching
Nitrogen leaching to groundwater can be minimized by maintaining a permanent crop
cover on fields comparable with permanent grassland. This requires detailed planning of
crop sequences. Crops that are especially effective in removing and therefore preserving
excessive nitrogen from soils (catch-crops) can be incorporated into the crop sequence.
Effective catch-crops include rape, mustard, sunflowers and different grasses that can all
bind between 75 and 160 kg N/ha. Optimum nitrogen removal rates can be achieved if
catch-crops are sown soon after main crops are harvested and by maintaining a dense
vegetation cover (Feldwisch and Schultheiß, 1998).


21.3       MANAGEMENT OF WASTEWATER AND HUMAN
           EXCRETA USED ON LAND AND IN AQUACULTURE
Although human excreta has been used to enhance soil fertility for several thousand
years wastewater has only been widely used as a source of water and nutrients in
agriculture over the last few decades. Wastewater from reticulated sewerage or domestic
systems is being increasingly used in many countries due to the increasing scarcity of
water resources and the high cost of chemical fertilizers. When well managed, the use of
wastewater in agriculture will have a minimal impact on groundwater quality. Important
control measures for the use of wastewater are set out below.
Nutrient management
Wastewater is a significant source of nutrients, and the set-back distances to sensitive
features, rate and timing of application of effluent should be in accordance with
management measures for fertilizers and manures set out in Section 21.1. Although
wastewater may not contain a sufficient amount of all the nutrients essential for crop
growth, care must be taken to ensure that the use of fertilizer supplements does not
exceed crop requirements and lead to leaching of chemical contaminants into
groundwater. Depending on its source, the composition of wastewater may vary
574                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

considerably, and frequent monitoring is required to ensure that its nitrogen content in
particular continues to be matched to crop uptake rates.

Application of wastewater and excreta
Wherever possible, wastewater should not be applied to crops by flood irrigation as this
irrigation method increases the risk of chemical contaminants and pathogens being
leached through the soil profile into groundwater. Preferred irrigation methods to protect
groundwater quality are:
      • controlled irrigation through furrows
      • irrigation by sprinklers
      • localized irrigation through drippers
    Untreated wastewater and raw excrement should not be applied to crops because of
the risk to health of agricultural workers from potential contact with pathogens on crops,
and guidelines for the quality of wastewater should always be followed (WHO, 1989;
Havelaar et al., 2001). Pathogen levels in wastewater can be greatly reduced by holding
effluent in stabilization ponds that allow a retention time of 12-18 days, or by
chlorination after secondary treatment and filtration (Horan, 1991). Pathogen levels in
excreta can also be reduced by storage, or through composting with other organic
material (Franceys et al., 1992). Details on the requirements for sewage sludge quality
are discussed further in Chapter 22. Care should be taken when using treated wastewater
to consider aquifer vulnerability, e.g. where soils are thin or locally absent, where there
are open wells, sinkholes or other voids that provide a direct conduit to the water table, or
where there is a shallow water table because of the risk of contaminating groundwater by
pathogens. Determining an acceptable depth to groundwater should take into account
hydraulic load and soil conditions as well as depth of the water table (see Chapter 14).

Controlling the source of wastewater
Sewage effluent from catchments with a large component of industrial waste may
contain high concentrations of arsenic, heavy metals, pesticides, solvents or
hydrocarbons that have the potential to cause groundwater contamination if the
wastewater is used for irrigation. Wherever possible, industrial wastewater should not be
used on land with crops for human consumption, where soils are thin or locally absent,
where there are open wells, sinkholes or other voids that provide a direct conduit to the
water table, or where the water table is shallow because of the increased risk of
contaminating groundwater. Most regulations for sludge disposal include requirements to
assess local conditions before site approval and application of sludge to land (US EPA,
1995; Pedley and Howard, 1997). Controlling the source and quality of sewage effluent,
and restricting its use on certain crop types or in certain areas can be more readily
accomplished when:
     • there are appropriate waste disposal laws and the society is law abiding;
     • a public body controls the management of wastes;
     • an irrigation project has strong central management;
     • there is adequate demand for the crops allowed under crop restriction and where
        they fetch a reasonable price;
                          Agriculture: Control and protection                          575

    • there is little market pressure in favour of crops not permitted for irrigation by
      wastewater of a particular quality.

Setback distances for fish ponds
Only treated wastewater should be used in aquaculture and guidelines have been
established for these requirements based on overall exposure (WHO, 1989; Havelaar et
al., 2001).
    Where nonetheless such practices are reality, set back distances can be defined to
protect groundwater wells constructed near fish ponds filled with untreated wastewater
and fertilized with raw excrement. Consequently, fish ponds should be treated as sources
of microbiological contamination that are comparable with sanitation systems.
Groundwater supplies can be protected from pathogens from these sources by ensuring
that the distances between fish ponds and water supply wells (setback distances) are set
using the principles discussed in Chapters 17 and Chapter 22. The latter also provides
details of appropriate treatment of wastewater and sludge prior to reuse in aquaculture.
    In general, setback distances for fish ponds will be greater than for sanitation systems
as the hydraulic loads from leaking ponds is likely to be substantial. This may lead to a
localized up-coning of groundwater mound and substantially increasing the local
hydraulic gradient and groundwater flow rates. Groundwater is also likely to flow
laterally from fish ponds, so wells thought to be upgradient of the ponds may also be
susceptible to microbial contamination where there is a significant cone of depression
caused by pumping regimes. The risk of pathogen contamination of groundwater can be
reduced by slowing the leakage rate of water from ponds through the use of low
permeability liners in the ponds (compacted clay or synthetic materials). In densely
populated areas establishing adequate setback distances may not be achievable and fish
ponds continue to receive wastewater. In such settings, potential health risks should
either be managed by treating water pumped from wells near fish ponds, or providing the
local population with alternative water sources.


21.4      NUTRIENT AND PATHOGEN MANAGEMENT ON
          GRAZING LAND
The effects of livestock grazing on groundwater quality can be very variable, and are
dependent on site specific conditions such as climate, vegetation density, grazing density
and the duration of grazing. The risk of nutrient enrichment of groundwater quality is
generally low in semi-arid or arid areas where livestock and animal wastes are uniformly
distributed at low densities in the landscape. The risks of groundwater contamination
may also be low in humid areas if grazing land is managed correctly. For any grazing
measure to work, it must be tailored to fit the needs of the local vegetation and terrain,
type of livestock and the culture of the local farming community. However, the
following control measures are generally effective in reducing nutrient and pathogen
contamination from grazing.
576                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

Maintaining vegetation cover on rangeland
Maintaining good quality pasture on rangeland is essential to help hold nutrients in soils,
to prevent the erosion of soil and to prevent livestock congregating in small areas of good
pasture thereby increasing the risk of localized groundwater contamination problems.
This requires maintaining appropriate stocking densities to preserve a uniform cover of
native pasture and trees (particularly in semi-arid or arid areas) or planting perennial
pasture species adapted for local conditions. In areas with seasonal high temperatures, the
preservation of native trees or the establishment of shade trees is important to provide
sufficient shade cover to stop livestock congregating in small areas. Maintaining a well
distributed water supply for livestock also helps prevent overgrazing in small areas as
well as the formation of concentrated urine patches, which on grazed pasture are often
the most significant source of nitrate contamination of groundwater.

Use of fencing to exclude livestock from sensitive areas
Livestock should be excluded from riparian vegetation around watercourses, particularly
in semi-arid areas where periodic flows in watercourses are often the main source of
groundwater recharge. Riparian vegetation plays an important role in minimizing the
movement of animal wastes and eroded soil in overland flow into watercourses. Other
sensitive areas like sinkholes in karstic areas should be fenced to prevent animal access.

Limit stocking rates in groundwater recharge areas
In drinking-water catchments where the protection of groundwater quality is a high
priority, animal stocking rates should be restricted to minimize the risk of groundwater
contamination by nutrients and pathogens. A stocking rate of less than two horses or
cows per ha has been found to be an effective protection measure in particularly sensitive
areas with very sandy soils (WRc, 1998). In Germany, recommended stocking rates are
1.3 to 1.4 large animal units per ha (where an animal unit is equivalent to an animal of
about 500 kg). Optimizing livestock diets also help to minimize the quantity and nitrogen
content of manures.

Use of grazing management plans
The development of farm-specific grazing management plans is an effective control
measure for protecting groundwater quality from this land use while maintaining or
increasing the economic viability of the grazing operation. The steps to developing an
effective grazing management plan are to (US EPA, 2000):
     • undertake an inventory of existing resources and pasture condition;
     • determine management goals and objectives;
     • map out grazing management units;
     • develop and implement a grazing schedule;
     • develop and implement a monitoring and evaluation strategy.

21.5       MANAGEMENT OF ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS
           AND DAIRIES
The often severe water quality problems associated with animal feeding operations and
dairies are due to the high concentrations of animals and their accumulated wastes, and
the large amount of wastewater that can be generated from stormwater runoff and the
washdown of the facilities. The risk of groundwater pollution occurring can be
minimized by the proper siting of the facilities, by waste and water management
practices and by reducing the amount of nutrients excreted in wastes through a well
managed feeding regime.

Siting animal feeding operations and dairies
One of the major considerations in preventing groundwater pollution from an animal
feeding operation or dairy is the location of the facility. For new facilities and expansions
to existing facilities, consideration should be given to siting the facility away from
surface waters, areas with a high leaching potential, sinkholes or other environmentally
sensitive areas, and in areas where sufficient land is available to apply wastes to soils at
rates which will not affect groundwater resources.
    The US EPA (2000) indicates that there are eight critical factors to be considered
when siting and operating a feedlot. These are:
     1. Divert clean water: siting or management practices should ensure that clean
        runoff does not touch stock holding pens or manure storage areas.
     2. Prevent seepage: buildings and storage facilities should be designed and
        maintained to prevent contaminated water seeping into groundwater.
     3. Provide adequate storage: liquid manure storage systems should be designed to
        safely store the quantity of wastewater produced in the feedlot plus additional
        runoff from intense storms (often designed for a 25 year, 24 hour storm). Dry
        manure should be stored under cover wherever possible to prevent the generation
        of additional contaminated runoff.
     4. Apply manure in accordance with a nutrient management plan: it is important
        that manure use is seen as part of an overall nutrient management strategy for a
        farm (see above).
     5. Manage land where manure spreading is taking place: land being used for
        manure disposal should be well managed to prevent erosion that can cause
        nutrients to be moved offsite. Management measures include proper stock
        control and the use of vegetated buffers and filter strips.
     6. Record keeping: records should be kept of the amount of manure generated and
        the disposal method used. This will help assess the effectiveness of a nutrient
        management plan, and allow it to be revised if necessary.
     7. Mortality management: dead animals should be managed in a way that
        minimizes impacts on groundwater. The British Columbia government in
        Canada recommends that animal disposal in pits is not within 120 m of wells
        used for water supply or within 30 m of a surface water feature. The guidelines
        (BC MAF, 2000) recommend that the base of disposal pits is at least 1.2 m above
        the seasonally highest water table, and that disposal pits have at least 1 m of earth
        cover.
578                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

      8. Consider the full range of environmental constraints: when expanding an
         existing facility or siting a new feedlot, consideration should be given to the
         distance of the facility from surface water features, from areas where
         groundwater is highly vulnerable to contamination, and from sinkholes or other
         features that allow surface runoff direct access to the water table.

Solid waste management practices
Manure should be removed from animal pens at frequent intervals. It is recommended
that it is stockpiled in a roofed facility on an impervious floor to prevent leaching by
rainfall. Manure can be stored for an extended period until it is used on the farm or is
moved offsite for use elsewhere. Maintaining low moisture content in the manure will
minimize odour problems and the generation of leachate. If sufficient space is available,
manure can be aerobically composted in turned piles or rows to improve its performance
as a soil amending agent and to reduce pathogen levels.
   As discussed in Section 21.2 above, manure must be applied to soils at rates which
will minimize groundwater contamination by nitrate, and the appropriate application rate
should be determined by carrying out tests on local soils.

Water and liquid waste management practices
Stormwater runoff from roofs and paved areas should be channelled away from feedlots
or dairy pens using bunds and drains to ensure it does not become contaminated with
animal wastes. It is recommended that stormwater is collected in a lined settling pond
and can be disposed of by irrigation under suitable weather conditions.
    Runoff from areas contaminated with animal wastes should be channelled to a series
of ponds for storage and treatment to reduce the BOD and nutrient content before
disposal by irrigation or other means. At least two fully lined ponds are required to
adequately treat the wastewater. The first pond allows solid organic material to settle out
and be degraded under anaerobic conditions by microorganisms. Water from this pond is
decanted in a shallower pond which is aerated by wind action, and which allows the
penetration of sunlight to help reduce levels of microorganisms before water is disposed
of by irrigation under suitable weather conditions.
    The storage and treatment ponds should have sufficient capacity to store water over
winter or the wettest period of the year, and should be able to store water from intense
rainfall events. Regulations for the design and capacity of storage ponds vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A general guide given by BC MAF (2000) recommends that
the volume of storage of ponds can be estimated by the following formulas:
    Runoff from paved feedlots:
                V = A x (0.48 Pm + 0.65 Ps)                                    (Eqn. 21.1)
   Runoff from unpaved feedlots:
                V = A x (0.22 Pm + 0.45 Ps)                                    (Eqn. 21.2)
   Runoff from manure storage areas:
                V = A x (0.25 Pm + 0.65 Ps)                                    (Eqn. 21.3)
                          Agriculture: Control and protection                          579

where V is the volume of storage, A the area contributing to runoff, Pm the sum of six-
monthly winter precipitation (rainfall plus an equivalent water depth of snowfall), and Ps
the 24-hour precipitation from a storm expected once in 25 years.
    Wastewater treated as outlined above will in most cases not be of a suitable quality to
discharge to waterways, but may be disposed of by irrigation under suitable conditions.
As discussed above, wastewater should not be applied to land unless the soil nutrient
status has been determined, and its use is consistent with the nutrient management plan
developed for the farm. Sufficient land area should be available for a 10 to 14 day rest
period between applications on a given part of the farm, the objective being to alternate
between anaerobic and aerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil (shorter periods
may be possible under dry summer conditions). Crops or pasture should be maintained to
take up as much nitrogen and phosphorus as possible to minimize the risk of
groundwater pollution occurring.


21.6       PESTICIDE MANAGEMENT
As some pesticides in current use are toxic at low concentrations and can cause
groundwater contamination if used incorrectly, these chemicals need to be stored, used
and disposed of with great care to minimize groundwater contamination problems. In
general, pesticides should be applied to soils at the lowest possible rate which controls
the pest problem to reduce the potential for leaching. Control measures that reduce the
risk of groundwater contamination by pesticides include the following:

Undertake an inventory of current and historical pest problems
Adequate pest control requires a good understanding of what insect pests and weeds are
a problem in each field so that pesticide spraying can be well targeted at appropriate
application rates. Agricultural extension officers, universities or specific consultants can
help identify the distribution of weeds and insect pests on individual farms. The costs
entailed in compiling pest inventories are usually rapidly recovered by reductions in the
amount of pesticides applied to crops.

Assess the potential for the leaching and runoff of pesticides from farms
Pesticides should not be applied near features that allow direct access to the water table
such as karst features, abandoned wells or drainage wells. Adequate buffers should be
maintained from water supply wells, surface water bodies and other sensitive
environmental features. Pesticide application rates may need to be reduced in areas with
light, sandy soils and a shallow water table to reduce the risk of groundwater
contamination. Application rates may also need to be reduced on heavy soils with steep
slopes to prevent surface runoff that could infiltrate into soils further downslope.
Cropping practices such as no-till methods can greatly reduce the risk of runoff from
steep slopes on heavy soils.

Increase organic matter in soils
Increasing the organic content of soils by the application of composts or manures can
greatly increase the binding capacity of soils and reduce the risk of pesticide leaching.
580                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

Proper construction of pesticide storing and mixing areas
The risk of groundwater contamination taking place is often greatest at sites that are used
for storing and mixing pesticides before application to fields. The construction of
dedicated storage and mixing areas can greatly reduce the risk of contamination
occurring through spills. These should have an impermeable (concrete) floor and be
surrounded by curbing to contain any spills, and the area should be large enough to
confine at least 125 per cent of the displaced volume of liquids housed in the storage
area. Runoff from the mixing area should be stored in tanks or sealed ponds to allow
water to be removed for treatment or to be applied to fields.
   Pesticides in small containers should be stored inside a shed on wooden palettes or
shelves to keep the containers off the floor to minimize corrosion of containers. Large
bulk storage tanks containing pesticides should be elevated so that leaks are easily seen.
Regular monitoring and maintenance of the integrity of structures to contain pesticides
are important and would be included in a management plan.
   Special care needs to be taken with the handling and transfer of pesticides to the
distribution containers and subsequent washing down of vehicles and equipment. It has
been estimated that over 50 per cent of observed contamination can occur from these
practices if executed poorly.

Use of cropping measures and biological controls to reduce pesticide use
There are a variety of cropping measures that can be used to reduce the use of pesticides
on crops. There are also an increasing number of new crop varieties which only require
low applications of pesticides to achieve a high resistance to fungal diseases and to
damage by insects and nematodes.
   Crop rotations can interrupt pest build-up by eliminating the host plant or by changing
the physical conditions that allow the use of smaller amounts of pesticides. An example
of this is corn-soybean rotation in which broadleaf weeds are more easily controlled in
the corn crop and grass weeds are more easily controlled in soybean crop. Some plant
species have allelopathic properties when used in rotations; that is, they can reduce pest
populations in subsequent crops. For example, a rye cover crop may reduce weed
populations in subsequent crops.
   The use of trap crops can also greatly reduce the use of pesticides. These are plant
species which are more attractive to particular pest species that the main crop, so
pesticide applications can specifically target these plants. Trap crops can either be planted
adjacent to main commercial crops, or planted at an earlier time to ensure pest control
before the main crop is harvested.
   Increasing the biological diversity on farms by retaining remnant vegetation or
maintaining hedgerows can also indirectly reduce the need for pesticides by increasing
the number of predator species. In general, agricultural monocultures create simple
environments where pests have little or no competition from other species or predators.
Having a broad array of plant species on farms diversifies the habitat and helps reduce
pest populations. Insect predator species may be introduced into fields and the use of
specific pesticides to target only pest species can enhance the effectiveness of predators.
                          Agriculture: Control and protection                          581

Use of low-toxicity or biological pesticides
Highly toxic or environmentally persistent pesticides can often be replaced with less
toxic or persistent equivalents. The use of less harmful pesticides can be increased by
management measures such as the use of financial incentives, specific training Biological
pesticides include microorganisms which are pathogens to specific insect pests, and the
use of pheromones to lure or trap insects. They are very specific to a target species, are
effective at low concentrations and generally pose little or no threat to human health or
other species. Pheromones can also be used to disrupt the reproduction of insect pests or
attract predators and parasites.


21.7       IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT AND
           DRAINAGE
Most of the groundwater quality problems associated with irrigated agriculture are due to
the inefficient use of water which increases leaching of water and soluble salts through
the soil profile. Poorly managed crop irrigation and drainage schemes, including poor
maintenance of irrigation structures, can be a major cause of health and environmental
problems.

Irrigation scheduling practices
Proper scheduling of the application of water is a key element in the management of
irrigated agriculture. Scheduling should be based on knowing the daily water use of the
crop, the water-holding capacity of the soil, the lower limit of soil moisture for each crop
and soil, and measuring the amount of water applied to crops. Natural precipitation
should also be considered and adjustments made in irrigation schedules. Practices that
help manage irrigation scheduling are:
      • metering of water flow rates;
      • using soil and crop water use data to determine the timing of water applications;
      • reducing hydraulic load by using efficient irrigation systems.

Practices for the efficient application of irrigation water
Irrigation water should be applied in a manner that ensures an even distribution of water
and efficient use by crops and minimizes runoff or deep percolation. The method of
irrigation varies considerably with the type of crop grown, topography, soils and local
cultural factors. However, there are several practices that are particularly effective for
applying and controlling the distribution of irrigation water. These include:
      • drip or trickle irrigation systems: water is applied at low pressure to crops with
         minimal evaporative losses;
      • sprinkler systems: there are a large variety of sprinkler systems for applying water
         under pressure to crops;
      • water control structures: the use of furrows, contour levees or contour ditches
         can help control the spread of water applied in an irrigation area;
      • irrigation field ditches: permanent structures used to convey water from the
         source of supply to a field or fields in a farm distribution system;
582                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

      • land levelling: reshaping the surface of the land to planned grades to ensure that
        water does not pool in certain areas causing excessive infiltration or salinization,
        or else runoff at high velocities causing erosion.

Efficient use of runoff water
Runoff from precipitation or excess irrigation can be captured, stored and used as part of
an irrigation system to improve the overall efficiency of the system and minimize the
potential for leachate infiltration.

Drainage water management
Drainage water from an irrigation system should be managed to reduce the potential for
leachate to contaminate groundwater and reduce erosion. A well planned and maintained
drainage system should be an integral part of the design of an irrigation system. Practices
that can be incorporated into a drainage system include the use of:
     • filter strips: an area of vegetation for removing particulate matter from runoff
        and wastewater;
      • surface drainage field ditches: a graded ditch for collecting excess water in a
        field;
      • sub-surface drains: a conduit such as a perforated pipe installed beneath the
        ground surface to collect and convey excess irrigation water.
   Drainage is also commonly used in areas with a naturally shallow water table to make
land suitable for agriculture. Where soils naturally contain high concentrations of
sulphide minerals, wide, shallow drains should be constructed rather than conventional
deep drains. This minimizes the disturbance of sulphides and reduces the risk of forming
acid sulphate conditions.


21.8       MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF MEASURES
           CONTROLLING AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES
Table 21.6 summarizes selected examples of the measures proposed above to control
groundwater contamination from agricultural activities. These include planning, physical
structures to prevent leachate and operational controls to ascertain implementation of
management plans. In some settings, some of these control measures may be suitable for
integration into the WSP (see Chapter 16) of a drinking-water supply and become
subject to operational monitoring in the context of such a plan.
    Regardless of whether or not any of these control measures are part of a WSP, their
monitoring and verification is crucial to ensure that they are in place and effective. Table
21.6 therefore includes options for surveillance and monitoring of the control measure
examples given. Most of these monitoring options focus on checking whether controls
are operating as intended, rather than on contaminant concentrations in groundwater:
     • For control measures in the context of planning, surveillance will review how
        well land use is taking aquifer vulnerability into account, e.g. with respect to
        siting of animal feedlots and treatment of their runoff, or whether management
        plans for nutrient and pesticide application exist and are adequate. Monitoring
        will include site inspection to assess whether plans are being implemented.
                          Agriculture: Control and protection                          583

    • For control measures addressing design and construction, monitoring is largely
      through site inspection to ascertain their adequacy and integrity, e.g. whether a
      feed-lot is properly drained, whether the storage tank for liquid manure is
      covered, whether irrigation systems are constructed as indicated in the
      management plan or permit, and whether maintenance of structures is adequate.
    • For control measures addressing day-to-day routine operations, monitoring
      focuses on assessing whether the specific restrictions, limitations or management
      plans imposed to protect the drinking-water aquifer are being followed, e.g. by
      inspecting farm records on agrochemical use, counting heads of stock, or
      sampling the nutrient content of soils.


   NOTE X            The implementation of control measures such as those suggested in
                     Table 21.6 is effectively supported if the stakeholders involved
                     collaboratively develop management plans that define the control
                     measures and how their performance is monitored, which corrective
                     action should be taken both during normal operations and during
                     incident conditions, responsibilities, lines of communication as well
                     as documentation procedures.
                     The implementation of control measures protecting drinking-water
                     aquifers from agriculture is substantially facilitated by an
                     environmental policy framework (see Chapter 20).


    In addition to the operational monitoring of the functioning of control measures, over-
all groundwater monitoring is important to verify comprehensively that agrochemicals
and manure are not contaminating aquifers used for drinking-water abstraction, i.e. that
the management concept for the catchment is adequate and safe. With respect to
fertilizers and manure this would typically include nitrate and potentially, for the latter,
also indicators for pathogen occurrence or even pathogens of particular concern in the
respective setting. With respect to pesticides, chemical analyses for monitoring may be
facilitated by information on the range of substances typically applied in the region.


   NOTE X            Options for monitoring suggested in Table 21.6 focus on control
                     measures rather than on groundwater quality. Analysis of selected
                     parameters in groundwater which indicate leaks of containments for
                     agrochemicals or manure is suggested where this is the most
                     effective operational control.
                     Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are a
                     supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of providing
                     verification of the efficacy of the overall drinking-water catchment
                     management.

Human excreta and sanitation:
Control and protection
G. Howard, B. Reed, D. McChesney and R. Taylor




The safe disposal of human excreta is essential for public health protection. The
unsafe disposal of excreta is a principal cause of the transmission of pathogens
within the environment and improvements in excreta management provide
significant reductions in diarrhoeal disease (Esrey et al., 1991; Esrey, 1996;
Hutton and Haller, 2004). Access to improved sanitation lags behind access to
water supply throughout much of the world and in particular within developing
countries. It is estimated that over twice the number of people lack access to
improved sanitation than lack access to an improved water supply (WHO and
UNICEF, 2004).
   Excreta disposal technologies may represent a risk to groundwater and
inappropriate design, siting and maintenance of sanitation facilities can
contaminate groundwater and thus lead to public health risks from drinking-water.
Chapter 10 provides an overview of these risks and how these may be assessed.
However, the health risks from the absence of improved excreta disposal are likely
to exceed those posed by contamination of groundwater from sanitation alone, and
this must be borne in mind when planning improvements in sanitation and
groundwater protection. Furthermore, the lack of excreta disposal may be a direct
cause of contamination of groundwater sources and improvements in sanitation

may also deliver improvements in microbial quality in groundwater (Howard et
al., 2003).
    This chapter provides an overview of some of the options for managing
groundwater pollution risks derived from sanitation, both for on-site and off-site
methods. These include planning, design and construction of facilities, as well as
monitoring and managing their safe operation. Important aspects discussed in the
context of planning are siting decisions and infrastructure changes that will help
reduce risks, and balancing the sometimes competing needs for better sanitation
and groundwater protection. The end of the chapter summarizes some major
control measures that can be used to provide protection of groundwater through
effective management of sanitation.


   NOTE X          In developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16), system
                   assessment would review the efficacy of control measures and
                   management plans for protecting groundwater in the drinking-
                   water catchment from human excreta and sanitation.
                   Chapter 10 provides the background information about the
                   potential impact of wastes on groundwater and provides
                   guidance on the information needed to analyse these hazards.
                   This chapter introduces options for controlling risks from
                   human excreta and sanitation. In some settings, water utilities
                   or communities hold the responsibility both for drinking-water
                   supply and for sanitation and in these, measures to control
                   risks from human excreta may readily become part of a Water
                   Safety Plan. Where the responsibility for sanitation falls
                   outside that of drinking-water supplier, close collaboration of
                   the stakeholders involved is important to implement, upgrade
                   and monitor these control measures. This may be initiated by
                   water suppliers and supported by the health authority which is
                   usually responsible for the surveillance of both the drinking-
                   water supply and sanitation facilities.




22.1     BALANCING INVESTMENT DECISIONS
Both drinking-water source and sanitation improvements are important to protect
public health but, as noted in Chapter 10, excreta disposal systems may lead to
groundwater contamination and therefore potentially lead to a risk to public health
derived from use of this water for drinking. This has led to a debate among water
and sanitation professionals regarding the need to balance risks derived from the
contamination of drinking-water from sanitation systems with the health risks
posed by an absence of effective excreta disposal.
              Human excreta and sanitation: Control and protection              589

   All decisions about technology and interventions will have cost implications
for the users and decisions may be required to balance competing risks. Very good
technical solutions that users cannot afford will not deliver significant
improvements in health. The evidence suggests that the nature of the competing
risks and priorities for investment are different between different communities and
may change over time.
   The issues are often different in rural and urban areas. In urban areas, although
contamination of groundwater may be greater, alternative water sources are often
available within easy reach or more distant sources can be developed and water
delivered to urban populations in a cost-effective manner. In rural areas, although
contamination risks may be lower from reduced discharge or leaching of
contaminants, alternative sources may be limited or their development to provide
water to rural households may be very expensive. Therefore control of risks from
sanitation design, construction and maintenance may be more critical. These
issues apply equally in developed and developing countries.
   In communities in developing countries where improved sanitation facilities do
not exist, setting stringent requirements for sanitation facility design and
construction to meet criteria to prevent groundwater pollution may be counter-
productive, unless the risk is very significant. Such criteria may make sanitation
improvements too expensive for many households resulting in continued lack of
sanitation and ongoing disease transmission (Mara, 1996). Where the construction
of sanitation will represent a very significant risk of groundwater contamination,
decisions will be required as to whether changes in water supply or sanitation are
more cost-effective (Franceys et al., 1992).
   Although microbial contamination of groundwater from excreta disposal
should be minimized, some groundwater pollution may have to be accepted in
order to reduce a greater health risk from a lack of excreta disposal (Cairncross
and Feacham, 1993; ARGOSS, 2001). Where a groundwater source is linked to a
piped water supply, public health risks derived from microbial contamination of
groundwater from on-site sanitation may be controlled by treatment of the water
prior to distribution. Where water is collected by hand, it may be more cost-
effective to provide an alternative (piped) water supply bringing in
uncontaminated water than to change sanitation designs (Franceys et al., 1992). If
this approach is followed then action may be required to close the previously used
groundwater source, as evidence from several developing countries indicates that
use of untreated groundwater sources is common even when better quality
alternatives are available (Ahmed and Hossain, 1997; Howard et al., 2002).
   In more developed countries, water source substitution may not be more cost-
effective than changing the sanitation facility and the public health demands for
groundwater protection may be greater than those associated with sanitation. As a
result, investments in upgrading sewer systems, installing sewers into previously
unsewered areas or introducing on-site sanitation systems that have a lower impact
may all be preferred solutions. Experience suggests that decisions should be based
on each individual case and blanket solutions are rarely applicable.
590                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

   The contamination of groundwater from chemicals derived from human excreta
and sewage may be more difficult to control and the treatment of drinking-water
less certain to remove or reduce concentrations to an acceptable level. Thus source
protection will become more important. For instance, the removal of nitrate
through treatment is unlikely to be feasible in most situations and removal of
pesticides and organic chemicals may be difficult and expensive. Where there is
extensive nitrate contamination, blending with other low-nitrate waters may be
required to reduce nitrate levels in final waters, although this is only feasible for
piped water supplies where alternative sources of sufficient quantity exist. For
other chemicals, blending or use of granular activated carbon may be needed to
reduce concentrations to acceptable levels.
   In such cases there may be greater need for source protection, particularly in
those countries where disease burdens from microbial hazards from drinking-
water are low. Thus in developed countries, it may be cost-effective to increase
groundwater protection as the potential threats of chemical contamination of
groundwater sources are relatively significant.
   In developing countries, the microbial health risks posed by inadequate
sanitation often so greatly outweigh the risks to health associated with possible
groundwater contamination by chemicals that rising levels of contamination may
be acceptable if this allows improved sanitation. However, in making these
decisions, it is important to take into account long-term usage of water resources.
For instance, because nitrate is conservative in many groundwaters controlling
nitrate pollution is important for securing the long-term viability of the aquifer.
Controlling nitrate risks for this reason is best justified where groundwater
represents the long-term option as a source for domestic supply.


22.2      SELECTING THE RIGHT SANITATION
          TECHNOLOGY
The first stage in the management of sanitation in order to protect against
groundwater contamination is to select the right technology for the local
environment. This requires that data is collected on the local hydrogeological
conditions (Chapter 8) and the role of groundwater in water supplies within a
region or the country. Sanitation technology selection will not be based solely on
concerns regarding risks of groundwater contamination. Community preferences,
usual methods of anal cleansing, available resources and costs of technology
options should all be considered in this process (Franceys et al., 1992; Cotton and
Saywell, 1998). In many cases these concerns will take priority over groundwater
quality concerns, but it is important that attention is also paid to groundwater
pollution risks in the decision-making process.
   The links between water supply service and sanitation options cannot be
ignored. As water supply service levels increase, so will water consumption, thus
increasing the volume of wastewater that must be disposed of. Using sanitation
technologies that are not designed to take large volumes of wastewater will not be
appropriate and water-based systems or sanitation systems that separate effluent

and solid material should be considered. Equally, the use of flush toilets and other
water-based systems will not be appropriate where the water supply service is only
a public tap, dug well or other form of communal supply. Intermediate levels of
service (single on-plot tap) may be suitable for some forms of modified sewerage,
but will not allow the use of conventional sewerage.
   It should be noted that sewerage systems do not necessarily confer additional
benefits to health or groundwater protection over those offered by on-site
sanitation. As noted in Chapter 10, sewers often leak and there is significant
evidence of their role in causing pollution of groundwater. Decisions on whether
on-site or off-site sanitation systems will be used will also depend on cost-benefit
analyses of the options, including costs for sewer maintenance, which are beyond
the scope of this text. In rural areas of many developed countries, on-site
sanitation options remain the most viable solution, e.g. the use of septic tanks is
common in the USA (Lerner, 1996). Provided such facilities are properly sited,
designed, constructed and maintained they provide a level of service equivalent to
a connection to a sewer and represent only a limited risk to groundwater. Some
forms of ecological sanitation are also designed for use in developed countries
where water consumption is high. Therefore on-site sanitation solutions should not
be viewed as limited only to developing countries.
   Maintenance of sanitation facilities is an important issue for any technology
chosen, and the implementation of routines for inspection and maintenance may
be supported by their documentation in management plans of the stakeholders
responsible for these facilities.


22.3      MEASURES FOR CONTROLLING RISKS FROM ON-
          SITE SANITATION
In many developing countries access to water supply and sanitation remains low
and there is an urgent need to provide both improved water supply and a safe
means of excreta disposal (WHO and UNICEF, 2000). In many rural and peri-
urban communities (including poor marginalized communities within urban
centres) it is likely that improved access to sanitation facilities will be in the form
of on-site sanitation (Mara, 1996; Cotton and Saywell, 1998; ARGOSS, 2001).
   In this section some key issues relating to the risks posed to groundwater
quality from on-site sanitation and the potential means by which this may be
reduced through design (including siting), construction and maintenance are
reviewed. It is not intended to provide a detailed description of how to design and
construct such facilities, but rather the specific measures that can be used to
protect groundwater. For details on design, construction and operation criteria,
readers are referred in particular Franceys et al. (1992) and in relation to urban
areas, Mara (1996).
592                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

22.3.1 Siting of on-site sanitation facilities
A key strategy for the control of risks from sanitation systems and human excreta
is to ensure that they are sited so that the risk posed to sources of groundwater
used for drinking-water supplies is minimized. As a significant source of
pathogens, the control of sanitation systems in relation to groundwater sources is a
key consideration when defining groundwater protection zones for microbial
quality (as discussed in Chapter 18). Sanitation systems should not, by preference,
be located within the zone of protection for microbial quality and definitely not in
close vicinity to a wellhead or spring (Chapter 17). However, in more densely
populated areas it may not be feasible or cost-effective to remove the sources of
pollution and therefore engineering improvements to the sanitation facilities may
be required.
    Site selection of sanitation facilities is an important control measure to protect
groundwater from human excreta. In many developing countries,
recommendations are often made regarding siting of latrines with respect to
groundwater sources. These are often developed separately from (and usually
before) groundwater protection zones.
    Set-back distance recommendations range from simplistic to more
sophisticated approaches based on hydrogeological conditions. Pickford (1995)
notes recommendations from India for pit latrines to be located some six m
downhill of the nearest water source. Such recommendations should always be
treated with some caution. Although the hydraulic gradient of shallow
groundwater typically follows the ground surface, it should be borne in mind that
where the well is equipped with an electric submersible or other form of pump,
there will be a substantial draw-down. Therefore contaminants can be drawn into
the well from areas downhill and physical location may not always provide
adequate protection.
    In many countries, single-distance criteria are used. A distance of 15 m is a
commonly used criterion, based on suggestions by Wagner and Lanoix (1958).
The weaknesses in using these approaches were highlighted by Lewis et al. (1982)
who noted that this distance may be overly conservative in some hydrogeological
environments (thus limiting health gains from sanitation) and insufficient in other
environments with rapid flow rates. Lewis et al. (1982) suggested that set-back
distances should be established based on local hydrogeological conditions (such as
water table depth, nature of unsaturated zone) and the hydraulic load from the
latrine.
    In South Africa, for example, DWAF (1997) developed a framework for
selecting separation distances using contaminant risk assessment based on:
     • whether the site for sanitation development overlies a major aquifer;
     • the proposed use of groundwater;
     • the depth to the water table;
     • the type of aquifer;
     • presence of existing latrines within 50 m and upgradient;
     • evidence of contamination.
              Human excreta and sanitation: Control and protection               593

    Other work in South Africa has recommended an approach that takes into
account estimation of pollution risk based on travel time for microbes, mass
balance for nitrate and using a probabilistic approach for contamination exceeding
specified targets (van Ryneveld and Fourie, 1997).
    One problem noted with the definition of set-back distances is that these do not
always take into account that different types of technology are likely to have
different levels of pollution potential. Pit latrines commonly are significantly
deeper than septic tanks and tend to rely on infiltration of leachate through the
surrounding soil. Pour-flush latrines have a much higher hydraulic load than dry
latrines and as a result have a greater pollution potential. Septic tanks typically
receive relatively large volumes of wastewater and therefore if not constructed
properly, may lead to a significant hydraulic load and increased pollution
potential. This is reduced through ensuring that the tank is watertight and that
effluent is discharged into drain-fields and soakaways at a much shallower level.
    In addition to set-back distances, hydrogeological data are often used to
identify areas where groundwater-fed sources are particularly susceptible to
contamination. A widely used method, for example, is known as DRASTIC (Aller
et al., 1987; US EPA, 1992) which employs several hydrogeological factors in
order to develop an index of the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination
(for more detail see Chapter 8.1.4). The method is, however, data intensive and
does not include factors that relate specifically to the risk to groundwater posed by
sewage and sewage-derived microorganisms. DRASTIC also does not provide any
site-specific guidance. The index may, however, provide a worthwhile framework
for assigning set-back distances based on different levels of risk. A framework
similar to DRASTIC, designed specifically to assess the vulnerability of
groundwater to contamination by sewage-derived Cryptosporidium parvum, has
been developed in the United Kingdom by Boak and Packman (2001).
    Recent research in developing countries has attempted to develop guidance
without requiring detailed hydrogeological information in order to determine set-
back distances for pit latrines (ARGOSS, 2001). Risk assessments are defined for
three scenarios (localized microbial contamination; widespread microbial
contamination; and widespread nitrate contamination). For separation distances
related to microbial quality, decisions are based on a time of travel estimation that
includes hydraulic and pollutant loading as well as the attenuation potential and
survival of microbes. Set-back distances are estimated from a set of standard
tables and figures that have been calibrated with data from field studies and analy-
sis of published works. This approach uses a three-tier approach to risk as shown
in Table 22.1 below. Figure 22.1 provides an example of the flow-chart for
decision-making; Box 22.1 provides a case study of applying this methodology.
    More qualitative approaches to defining separation distances using available
data can be used based on statistical analysis of water quality and sanitary
inspection data (ARGOSS, 2001; Howard et al., 2003). These have been shown to
be robust in supporting water and sanitation planning and offer an effective way to
determine siting requirements based on local conditions when there is limited
hydrogeological data available.

    Box 22.1. Calculating the separation distance between latrines and
              protected springs in Wakiso District, Uganda
A study to determine acceptable separation distances between latrines and
water points was undertaken in Nabweru sub-county in the District of
Wakiso, Uganda, a rural area with a population density ranging from 9-12
people per ha. The population relies on non-piped sources of water
(boreholes, dug wells and springs) and pit latrines for sanitation. The area
is hilly with swamps in low-lying areas and most springs are found on the
lower slopes.
The soil is a fine sandy silt, with clayey soils found in the swampy areas.
The area receives about 1600 mm of rainfall a year in two principal wet
seasons (March to June; August/September to November). The depth to
water table across the area ranges from 30 m in higher areas (where
boreholes and dug wells are found) to 5-8 m close to the protected
springs. Pit latrine depths typically range from 6-10 m in depth.
The assessment used the ARGOSS methodology and took into account
the different technology types and the geological setting. It was concluded
that as dry pit latrines were used, the hydraulic load would be less than 50
mm/day and therefore there was potential for unsaturated zone
attenuation. As the depth to water table in higher levels was 20 m below
the base of the deepest pits, it was concluded that unsaturated zone
attenuation would limit all microbial risks in these areas and a nominal
horizontal separation between latrines and water sources would be
adequate.
In lower-lying areas, the depth to the water table beneath the base of the
pits was only 1-2 m and therefore it was concluded that the desired
horizontal separation distance should be calculated.
The horizontal separation distance d was calculated using:
     d = v*t
where v is velocity and t is time. The velocity was calculated by using:
     v = Ki/φ
where K is the hydraulic conductivity (permeability), i is the hydraulic
gradient, and φ is porosity.
For this area, the permeability and porosity were estimated using the
lithology as a guide. A permeability of 5 m/d was selected and a typical
porosity for this type of formation would be 0.1. The hydraulic gradient
was assumed to be 1/100. The velocity was therefore: (5*0.01)/0.1 =
0.5m/d.
The team used the low-risk travel time (exceeds 25 days) and therefore
the required horizontal distance was: 0.5*25 = 12.5 m. Subsequent
analysis of the water combined with sanitary inspection confirmed that
these distances were effective.

Numerical tools to support siting decisions
Numerical approaches have been developed to determine set-back distances using
contaminant transport and groundwater flow models (Bear et al., 1992).
Commercial software including numerical codes such as MODFLOW (McDonald
and Harbaugh, 1988) and FLOWPATH (Franz and Guiguer, 1990) have received
widespread application under a variety of hydrogeological conditions (Cleary and
Cleary, 1991; Bair and Roadcap, 1992; Taylor and Howard, 1995). A distinct
advantage of numerical models is that the impact of varying different factors such
as slope (topography) and pumping (abstraction) rate on time of travel can be
evaluated thereby enabling estimation of generic set-back distances.
   Apart from the necessary expertise, a key detraction to the use of numerical
models is that they require a significant range and input of data including many
parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity for which there are often
significant uncertainties. Furthermore, most models are run under steady-state
conditions that assume uniform hydrogeological conditions even for highly
dynamic parameters such as recharge and discharge (pumping). Estimation of set-
back distances typically presumes that sewage-derived pathogens move at the
same rate as groundwater flow and survive for similar lengths of time in
groundwater (e.g. 50 days) regardless of water temperature and chemistry.
Approaches based solely on travel time do not take into account that distance may
also be important in determining microbial removal. Such gross assumptions are,
however, common to all methods of estimating set-back distances, which are
largely justified on the basis that this will provide protection against gross
contamination and may be applied even where data is limited. As noted in Chapter
18, however, the use of single travel times may not be fully protective and leads to
a significant residual risk to public health (Schijven et al., 2002a; 2002b).
Developing more complex models taking into account all the factors influencing
microbial removal may increase the certainty with which set-back distances are
defined at a local level, but will require significant data on local hydrogeological
conditions. In some situations the limitations of available data may make
collection of additional information valuable or even essential in establishing
guidelines for siting of on-site sanitation and water sources. There are a number of
ways of acquiring this information, including tracer tests, soil percolation tests and
targeted water quality studies.
   Tracer studies often provide invaluable information regarding specific
characteristics of a particular site to aid siting conditions. They may also be used
to develop an understanding of aquifer types and can provide useful data regarding
regional groundwater flow rates and the likelihood of preferential pathways. When
the principal concern is to understand groundwater flow, conservative, non-
hazardous chemical tracers can be used (for instance chloride or non-hazardous
dyes). Chemical tracers may be of little value when determining whether local
conditions will lead to breakthrough of pathogens. If this is of interest, microbial
tracers (e.g. bacteriophages; see also Box 17.1 in Chapter 17) will provide a better
indication of whether there is likely to be significant attenuation within the
environment being studied and thus provide greater information for the siting of
               Human excreta and sanitation: Control and protection               597

on-site sanitation. This may be important when determining whether a significant
risk exists from latrines located close to a water source.
    Drangert (2000) refers to tracer studies in Kenya that showed where latrine pits
reached the saturated zones bacteria travelled 20-30 m within a week and in areas
of pronounced topography bacteria could travel distances of up to 100 m within a
day. This suggests that in this case, either the water source or sanitation
technology should have been changed. By contrast, in tracer studies in Uganda,
breakthrough by conservative chemical tracers occurred within 24 hours, whilst no
phage tracers were detected over the 120 hour sampling period, suggesting that
there was greater protection against microbial contaminants than would be
suggested from groundwater flow rates (Taylor et al., 2004). Soil percolation tests
may also provide some information regarding how rapidly effluent may infiltrate
into the soil and this may be used to aid planning of siting and sizing of drainfields
and soakaways. These tests will, however, provide very limited information for pit
latrines, unless the test is performed at the likely depth of the latrine.
    Where there is limited hydrogeological data, the use of well-designed water
quality studies can provide information regarding appropriate set-back distances.
This may be done by selecting a representative sample of water supplies and
undertaking an assessment of water quality over a period of time, combined with
detailed assessments of latrine proximity. The assessment should ensure that all
seasonal differences will be covered and consideration may need to be given for
more frequent sampling during the onset of the rains when water quality often
shows greatest deterioration (Howard et al., 2002). The best way to analyse this
data is to compare latrine distance against water quality targets to determine at
which distance the latrines start to exert an influence.

22.3.2 Engineering design to control pollution in high-risk
       areas
Where pit latrines must be used and risks of aquifer contamination are high,
control measures addressing design and construction of the sanitation facilities are
important to reduce risk. High-risk areas will include those areas where the water
table is high or where there are very rapid groundwater flow rates (for instance
fracture aquifers, gravel and aquifers with preferential flow paths).
   Where there is limited space between the base of the pit and the water table, the
use of sand envelopes around the base and sides of the pit are often recommended
as this will help encourage an active biological community to reduce breakthrough
of pathogens (Franceys et al., 1992). These recommendations are based on
original field and laboratory experimentation by Coldwell and Parr (1937) and
later by Ziebell et al. (1975). The former found that a 0.25 m envelope of sand
provided an effective barrier to thermotolerant coliform movement. However,
although this provides confidence in control of bacterial contamination,
confidence in control of viral pathogens is more limited. Ziebell et al. (1975)
found that development of biological communities within sand envelopes took up
598                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

to 100 days, suggesting an initial period of elevated risk during the first use of the
latrine.
    Whether the use of sand envelopes is economically feasible is questionable, for
instance Pickford (1995), commenting on recommendations for a 0.5 m sand
envelope in India, notes that this would lead to a four-fold increase in the volume
of the excavation of a 1 m diameter pit. In such circumstances using an alternative
source of water, treating the water or using an alternative sanitation design may be
more cost-effective.
    Where water tables are high, the use of dry latrines may be more appropriate
than wet latrines, as the latter have significantly greater hydraulic loads which
may exceed attenuation potential even when enhanced by the addition of sand
envelopes. If wet latrines will be used because of cultural practices or preferences,
then siting will be critical and consideration should be given to the use of
alternative water supplies or treating existing supplies.

Vault latrines
The risks from on-site sanitation in high water table areas can also be reduced by
using vault latrines (also known as cesspits). A vault latrine has a watertight lining
on the pit that does not allow significant infiltration into the surrounding soil and
which requires periodic emptying (Franceys et al., 1992). An example of a vault
latrine is shown in Figure 22.2 below.

                             toilet

              Sealed tank




Figure 22.2. Vault latrine

   Most designs retain excreta for a short period of time. Because of the volume of
liquid collected in the tank, emptying is typically required every two to three
weeks. Experience reported from Japan and Korea suggest that vault and vacuum
              Human excreta and sanitation: Control and protection               599

systems are cost-effective and wastes can be managed properly (Pickford, 1995;
Ahmed and Rahman, 2000). The use of vault latrines remains limited in many
developing countries, primarily because of the high operating costs associated
with emptying. Some authors suggest that they are not appropriate as construction
and operation are often poor resulting in significant health risks to users and the
wider community (Franceys et al., 1992). However, designs continue to be
developed and tested successfully (Dadie-Amoah and Komba, 2000). Proper
construction can be supported by establishing and enforcing construction
standards to ensure that vault latrines do not still represent a risk to groundwater.
Proper operation, emptying and maintenance at adequate intervals can be
supported by a management plan that describes these activities and the
responsibilities for them.
   A variety of low and high-cost emptiers are available and have been tested. For
instance, a programme in the Kibera slum in Nairobi has shown that a small
pedestrian-operated tanker (the vacutug) provided an effective service (Wegelin-
Schuringa and Coffey, 2000). Similar equipment (the MAPET) was used in Dar-
es-Salaam, Tanzania (Howard and Bartram, 1993; Wegelin-Schuringa and Coffey,
2000) and other equipment has been used for pit latrines in Zimbabwe (Jere et al.,
1995).
   The final disposal of sludge should be properly managed. In Kibera, disposal of
the sludge is into sewers or direct to sewage treatment works. However,
enforcement is often important as previous experience in Dar-es-Salaam showed
that there were concerns about burying of the sludge on-site or close to homes,
with consequent risks of soil and water contamination and vector breeding
problems (Howard and Bartram, 1993).
   The lining of the vault pits is often susceptible to damage during the emptying
process and it is important to ensure that the power of the suction pump used to
empty the pit contents will not cause damage to the linings. Inspections of lining
integrity are an important control measure but are difficult to enforce in many
settings. They require trained inspectors with appropriate safety procedures,
protective clothing and masks.
   In some areas of very high water tables, pit latrines are raised to about ground
level (Mara, 1996). These are typically expensive to construct and require regular
maintenance and, as noted by Franceys et al. (1992), care should be taken to avoid
seepage of effluent at or above ground level. In some situations mound latrines are
constructed with a hole and bung inserted into the pit to allow rapid emptying
without the need for suction. This is acceptable if this is designed and operated
correctly and has fittings to allow a pipe to be connected to a tanker. In many
cases the hole and bung are poorly designed or emptying is done by households
simply by opening the bung during in periods of rainfall with the pit contents
discharged to the nearest storm water drain. This has been noted to occur, for
instance, in low-lying areas of Kampala, Uganda. Such practices represent a
significant risk to health, may cause groundwater contamination and should be
avoided.
600                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

Ecological sanitation
There is increasing interest among some workers in the sanitation and
groundwater sector in the use of ecologically sustainable sanitation that promotes
the re-cycling of nutrients for use as fertilizers in agriculture or gardening and to
avoid water pollution with nitrate and phosphorus. Ecological sanitation as it is
commonly known can cover a wide range of technical options from very high to
comparatively low cost. The designs can either involve separation of urine or
composting and in all cases the reuse of wastes is promoted as a means of
ensuring nutrients are recycled in the environment (Drangert, 2000; Winblad,
2000; Esrey, 2001).
   The use of on-site methods of eco-san are likely to beneficial in relation to
preventing groundwater contamination because they have a low hydraulic load.
Although there are many ardent advocates of ecological sanitation, this is not a
technology with zero groundwater pollution potential nor does it provide overall
greater benefits than alternative options. The final disposal of wastes may still lead
to problems if it is not managed properly; and the use of organic fertilizers does
not mean, for instance, an immediate removal of problems with nitrate
contamination. The disposal of wastes may be more problematic in urban areas
where there may be more limited local demand for use in agriculture, leading to
poor disposal methods and public health risks.
   There is also concern regarding the safety of handling the matter and ensuring
that there has been inactivation of pathogens. Of particular importance is not
whether recommended practices limit such risks, but actual practice by the users
in relation to their exposure to raw or poorly treated faecal material.


22.4      MEASURES FOR CONTROLLING RISKS FROM
          SEPTIC TANKS AND AQUAPRIVIES
A key element in both septic tanks and aquaprivies is that the tanks should be
watertight to prevent subsurface leaching of contaminants into groundwater.
Groundwater contamination tends to result from infiltration of effluent through
drainfields, trenches and pits, the density of septic tanks in an area or poor siting
in relation to vulnerable groundwater sources (Payne and Butler, 1993).
   The control of the location and density of septic tanks involves ensuring that
planning and development legislation takes due account of the groundwater
protection needs. Payne and Butler (1993) provide a series of simple flow charts to
aid planners in the United Kingdom decide whether applications for septic tank
construction should be approved.
   As septic tanks and aquaprivies must be emptied periodically, control of the
final sludge is essential. Uncontrolled, illegal emptying or dumping of sludge into
the environment may represent a significant risk to groundwater. One form of
control is through the licensing of de-sludging companies and enforcing codes of
practice. Management plans defining these operations, responsibilities and
documentation of emptying may support good practice and surveillance.
                Human excreta and sanitation: Control and protection                         601

Legislation should also include penalties for households that illegally empty their
tank, although the monitoring of this may present some difficulties.
   Effluents are most often disposed of through a soakaway or drainfield
containing infiltration trenches (Franceys et al., 1992). Soakaways require less
space but infiltration trenches have several advantages, such as increased area for
infiltration (through the sides of the trench), the potential for shallower
construction (increasing the travel path to any underlying aquifer) and the ability
to distribute flows along the trench, providing alternative infiltration routes, unlike
small soakaways which may eventually become clogged. Soakaways may be
either underground chambers with openings in the base and sides to allow
infiltration to the soil or an underground pit filled with coarse granular material,
often lined with a geotextile to prevent ingress of silt. Where underground
chambers are used, surrounding the structure with sand may provide additional
potential for the removal of pathogens.
   Infiltration trenches are normally filled with coarse granular material with a
perforated pipe in the base of the trench to distribute the effluent along it, avoiding
overloading the soil at any one particular point. Designs for drain trenches should
take into account infiltration rates, which should preferably be calculated on-site,
but the values in Table 22.2 can be used as a general guide.
Table 22.2. Infiltration capacity of different soil types (based on Franceys et al., 1992)

   The performance of the drainage trenches depends on the efficiency of the tank
and soil conditions and some workers suggest separating sullage from toilet
wastes and treating this separately (Franceys et al., 1992). Alternatively the
performance of the septic tank or aqua privy can be enhanced by extending the
treatment process through increasing the size of the tank and introducing baffles to
promote sedimentation.


22.5      MEASURES FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF
          SEWER LEAKAGE
The easiest, cheapest, most straightforward way to manage pollution from sewers
is to not let it happen in the first place. Misstear et al. (1996) note that leaks from
sewers arise from a combination of:
602                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

     • cracked and fractured pipes
     • opened or displaced pipe joints
     • root intrusion
     • pipe deformation
     • sewer collapse
     • reverse gradients
     • siltation
     • blockages
     • poorly constructed connections
     • abandoned laterals left unsealed.
    These may be due to ground loss, ground movement, material deterioration or
poor system management. Control measures to protect groundwater from sewer
leakage therefore include planning, design and construction as well as
maintenance and operational controls.
    The design of the sewerage system can reduce risks of leakage. Good
workmanship, careful inspection of the pipes while they are being laid, the use of
good quality pipe and bedding materials and careful compaction all improve the
life and physical condition of the pipe. Testing the pipes after they have been laid
can identify poor construction practices. Using shorter ‘rocker’ pipes in areas
where there might be settlement allows the pipes to move rather than crack.
    Pipes and pipe bridges on or above the ground need to be protected against
physical damage, e.g. from accidental collisions. Burying the pipe gives a degree
of protection and support. A compromise has to be made between giving the pipe
sufficient cover to protect it from surface loading and burying it deeply which
makes the sewer more difficult to monitor and replace, and which reduces the
travel time of any leaks to the aquifer. In areas where a shallow buried pipe may
be subject to damage because of heavy loads passing over the sewer route, the
bedding can be replaced with concrete (either just below the pipe or completely
encasing it). Routing the pipes in areas where they will not be subject to heavy
loads will also increase their robustness.
    If the surrounding ground is relatively impermeable, the bedding material in the
pipe trench itself can become a drainage route for any leakage, especially if the
pipes are laid on a slope. Placing a clay collar around the pipe can prevent the
flow of wastewater along the pipe route, as shown in Figure 22.3.

22.5.1 Sewer management
Ensuring that sewers do not become surcharged (i.e. flow full) reduces the
possibility of sewage leaking out of the pipe. This can be achieved by ensuring the
pipe is large enough for future flows, having separate pipes for surface water
drainage, periodically cleaning pipes, monitoring pipes for blockages and
removing them promptly, and public education, to prevent unsuitable objects
being introduced into the sewer.
   Ensuring that connections are made to the pipe either at manholes or using
specific lateral connection pipes is preferable to using pipe saddles to connect to
existing pipes, as these are more prone to leakage. Where connections are no
longer required, these need to be plugged to prevent leakage.
   Action can also be taken on what goes down the sewer. Charging for industrial
waste can encourage users to reduce the amount of wastewater they produce or
cause them to pre-treat the effluent before it enters the sewer. Some substances
can be banned from being disposed of into sewers. This action will depend on a
working regulatory system.
   Hydrogen sulphide formation can represent a significant problem for sewers,
leading to conversion to sulphuric acid which can cause corrosion of sewer pipes.
Hydrogen sulphide can also lead to odour problems. Metcalf and Eddy (1991)
note that hydrogen sulphide attack can be controlled by:
    • controlling organic and sulphur inputs at source
    • aerating the sewage
    • adding chemicals
    • periodic cleaning
    • ventilation
    • good design.
   Routines for sewer management, such as monitoring for leaks and blockages,
cleaning and maintenance, responsibilities and documentation are best laid down
in management plans.

22.5.2 Controlling exfiltration
If exfiltration is suspected, temporary or permanent sumps can be dug into the
pipe bedding to collect any leakage and monitor changes in flows. Trying to
monitor flows at the end of the pipe would necessitate careful planning, as the
complex and changing relationship between sewer inflows, infiltration, exfiltration
and overflows can make firm conclusions difficult to arrive at. Large rises in flows
during wet weather can indicate infiltration to a foul sewer or misconnections
from storm water sewers, as can high night-time flows that do not correspond to
water consumption.
   Visual surface inspections of the sewer route may reveal major leaks
(especially in a dry season) whilst a CCTV survey can give a more detailed
analysis. New developments are bringing in lasers and ultrasound to improve
inspection, especially below the water flowing in a live sewer (Makar, 1999).
Such inspection techniques however are expensive and only provide a snapshot of
604                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

the state of the sewer. CCTV and other such methods are not suitable for the small
diameter pipes used in condominal sewerage systems. Flow measurements can be
made at successive points along a sewer line. Assuming no inflows, an assessment
can be made of leakage from the sewer. This may vary with seasons.
   For public sewers possible strategies are the adoption of a double skin
construction technique (although this may not prove cost effective) and the
adoption of higher testing pressures. It is also important to include private sewers
in a regular schedule of sewer testing especially in areas of high groundwater
vulnerability. Misstear et al. (1996) recommend installation of shallow monitoring
boreholes in environmentally vulnerable areas perceived to be at risk, as well as
improved monitoring of the water supply boreholes themselves, measuring
microbial indicators, nitrogen species, boron and phosphate.

22.5.3 Control of sewer leakage
If sewers are found to be leaking, but the pipes are still structurally sound, there
are alternatives to replacing large amounts of the system. These include relining
the pipes – either through spraying a cement coating onto the inside of the pipe or
by inserting a flexible plastic liner into the pipe that can then be fixed to the walls.
Localized leaks (from cracks or failed joints) can be grouted remotely to seal the
hole. Where pipes are no longer structurally sound, the existing pipes can be burst
and replaced with a new plastic pipe without having to dig a new trench.

22.5.4 Open drains
Sewers are not just limited to pipes below ground. Open channels may also be
used. These may be unlined, pitched with stone or lined with concrete. Where the
lining is not water tight, the channel can act as an infiltration trench. This may be
acceptable for surface run-off, but is not recommended for conveyance of foul
sewage. Surface run-off can flood the channel, causing pollution, which is a
greater risk to health than the indirect route of infiltration to groundwater. Where
open channels are used for foul sewage and no alternative is possible, they should
be routed away from populated areas and have raised sides to limit the ingress of
rainwater.

22.5.5 Surface water management
Whilst rainwater is perceived as being clean it can rapidly become polluted and
transport contaminants, for example washing poorly disposed faeces into the water
cycle. Flooding can cause sewer surcharge and inundate pit latrines. Therefore
attention needs to be paid to the management and disposal of stormwater, as
soakaways and ponds may provide a path for contaminants to the aquifer. CIRIA
(2000) provides an indication of methods used to manage storm water run-off
depending on the land use of the catchment and the status of the groundwater.

22.6      CONTROL MEASURES FOR SEWAGE TREATMENT
Where sewerage systems exist they need to be connected to some form of sewage
treatment and disposal which protects public health from exposure both directly
and through contaminating groundwater. Options range from conventional plants
over alternative systems such as waste stabilization ponds and wetland systems.
The use of excreta and wastewater may be a desirable option, but may also
represent both a direct risk to health and a risk of groundwater contamination
(WHO, 1989; Foster et al., 1994; Mara, 1997). Planning and designing wastewater
and excreta use should therefore relate to aquifer vulnerability. One control
measure is banning or restricting wastewater irrigation within drinking-water
protection zones, unless the quality of the treated wastewater is sufficient as to
represent little or no risk. Controls in application and means of irrigation and use
of fish ponds are discussed in Chapter 21.

22.6.1 Conventional treatment works
Sewage treatment plant outfalls chiefly pollute surface waters. Risks to
groundwater will derive from the final disposal of the sludge and its location with
regard to groundwater, as well as from hydraulic connections between
groundwater and surface waters affected by sewage. Leaking sewage pipes can
also contaminate groundwater sources.
   Sludge disposal to land or landfill is widely practised and in many countries is
subject to specific regulations governing acceptable practice. These will usually
govern the conditions under which different types of sludge (untreated, partially
treated, treated) can be disposed of and set allowable concentrations of
contaminants in sludge quality guidelines and water quality objectives (WRc,
1992; US EPA, 1995a; 1995b). The risk to groundwater from land application of
sludge is generally related to aquifer vulnerability and is considered to be
particularly relevant to applications close to a groundwater abstraction point
(Wolstenholme et al., 1992) (see also Chapter 21).
   Various tools have been developed to aid decision-making based on
regulations. For instance in South Africa, an expert system for use in sewage
sludge has been developed called Sludge Land Application Decision Support
which aids decision-makers in establishing sludge disposal guidelines
(Anonymous, 1997). This requires significant amounts of data on contaminant
loads as well as soil and groundwater conditions. Similar guidance has been
developed by the US EPA (1995a; 1995b) which provide detailed discussion of
the site conditions with respect to sludge type and quality, soil and hydrogeology.
   The development of site-specific plans is essential for effective management of
sludge. In general, sludge disposal to land should not occur within an area where
groundwater is (or needs to be) protected against microbial contaminants, and
sludge disposal to land in areas protected against nitrate contamination should also
be restricted.
   For effluents, quality control will be achieved through application of
appropriate discharge consents and water quality objectives for receiving waters,
606                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

which will typically be set taking into account uses of the water (including
environmental/ecological demands). This should also take into account the nature
of surface water-groundwater relationships and in particular to ensure that in
situations where surface water recharges groundwater, the potential for
groundwater pollution is addressed.
    Sewage discharges into surface waters that recharge groundwater should be
controlled and discharge consents applied that will be consistent with the
protection of groundwater quality. This often results in the extension of
groundwater protection zones for significant distances along rivers upstream of
abstraction points.

22.6.2 Waste stabilization ponds and reedbeds
Waste stabilization ponds are widely used in developing countries, but are also
used in industrialized countries where there is sufficient land available (Horan,
1990; Mara, 1997). Waste stabilization pond systems are usually composed of a
series of ponds with sludge treatment carried out in the first pond (which may be
anaerobic or facultative), subsequent treatment through secondary facultative
ponds (taking settled sewage) and a series of maturation ponds. Well-operated
waste stabilization ponds produce very high quality effluent that should represent
limited risk to health when discharged and often represent significantly lower
operating costs than alternatives (Mara, 1997).
   The risks to groundwater from waste stabilization ponds arise primarily from
the risks of leaching of wastewater from the base of the ponds leading to microbial
or chemical (particularly nitrate) contamination of underlying groundwater. The
base of waste stabilization ponds are normally compacted to provide an aquitard
layer to ensure the pond will fill with water and to prevent leakage into the
subsurface. A specific lining is often also installed; conventional approaches use a
puddled clay layer of 5-10 cm thickness, although polyethylene and vinyl sheeting
have been used in smaller ponds (WHO-EMRO, 1987).
   Although some experts believe the risk to groundwater is be restricted solely to
those situations when ponds are located close to abstraction points, infiltration of
up to 20 mm per day from ponds has been noted to occur in Latin America and the
Caribbean (Foster et al., 1993). In Lima, Peru, penetration of indicator bacteria
beneath waste stabilization ponds of over 15 m has been noted, although the
majority of microorganisms were removed in the top 3 m of the unsaturated zone
(Geake et al., 1986). This indicates the need for proper site investigations and
ensuring that ponds are not located over significant aquifers used for domestic
water supply.
   Reedbeds are also used to treat effluent prior to discharge and can provide
significant improvements in wastewater quality. The major problem for
groundwater will be leaching of contaminants into the sub-surface, and studies on
this issue are limited. Contamination may be significant when the wetland is
influent to groundwater, but limited when the groundwater is influent to the
              Human excreta and sanitation: Control and protection             607

wetland. The risk to groundwater can be controlled by locating reedbeds with
sufficient distance to abstraction points.


22.7     MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF MEASURES
         CONTROLLING SANITATION SYSTEMS
Measures for controlling human excreta disposal and sewerage in drinking-water
catchments proposed above range from planning the choice of site and sanitation
technology in relation to aquifer vulnerability and socioeconomic criteria to
specific design and construction criteria for sanitation facilities and operational
controls. Selected examples are summarized below in Table 22.3. Where drinking-
water supply and sanitation are a joint responsibility of a utility or community,
such measures may readily be integrated into a WSP.


   NOTE X          The implementation of control measures such as those
                   suggested in Table 22.3 is effectively supported if the
                   stakeholders involved collaboratively develop management
                   plans that define the control measures and how their
                   performance is monitored, which corrective action should be
                   taken both during normal operations and during incident
                   conditions, responsibilities, lines of communication as well as
                   documentation procedures.
                   The implementation of control measures protecting drinking-
                   water aquifers from industry, mining and military activities is
                   substantially facilitated by an environmental policy framework
                   (see Chapter 20).


Supporting programmes specifically for protecting groundwater from human
excreta may include but are not restricted to the development of guidance on
sanitation technology selection, ensuring that construction quality standards are
developed and enforced, and community education regarding items and substances
disposed of in sewers and latrines.
   Monitoring and verification of the control measures implemented is crucial to
ensure that they are in place and are effective. Table 22.3 therefore includes
options for surveillance and monitoring of the control measure examples given.
Most of these focus on checking whether the controls are operating as intended,
rather than on contaminant concentrations in groundwater. In the context of
planning, surveillance will address whether plans exist and how they took criteria
for siting and set-back distances in relationship to aquifer vulnerability into
account. Verification will address whether these criteria are being adhered to and
plans are being implemented, e.g. by site inspection to check the location of
sanitary facilities and the depths of pits and sewers during their construction.
608                     Protecting Groundwater for Health

   Once the planning stage has determined safe site selection and sanitation
facilities, monitoring their design and construction is important to ascertain their
integrity, e.g. whether latrine pits are fitted with liners or sewer pipes with clay
collars. For the day-to-day routine operation of control measures, monitoring
focuses on assessing whether they are functioning as they should, e.g. whether
sewers or pits are leaking, whether latrines are in a condition to be used and
whether sewage sludge is disposed of as approved by the permit (see Table 23.1).
This can in part be achieved through inspection, and defining inspection routines
in management plans is useful to support that they are regularly performed.
Monitoring for leaks often requires analysing a selected parameter in groundwater
near the respective sanitation facility (e.g. latrine pit or sewer) which will most
effectively indicate leaks. This may be achieved with indicator organisms (e.g.
faecal streptococci, E. coli, bacteriophages) or substances typically present in the
sewage. Where sewerage is contaminated by a range of chemicals from household
use and connected enterprises, monitoring overall groundwater safety would
occasionally address these contaminants. This also applies to sludge contaminants
of specific concern where it is applied on land.
   Management plans will define monitoring systems, corrective action to be
taken if leaks are detected as well as regular maintenance operations. To be
effective, they include responsibilities and routines for documentation of these
activities, their findings and any corrective action taken.


   NOTE X          Options for monitoring suggested in Table 22.3 focus on the
                   control measures rather than on groundwater quality. Analysis
                   of selected parameters in groundwater which indicate leaks of
                   on-site or sewer systems is suggested where this is the most
                   effective operational control.
                   Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes
                   are a supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of
                   providing verification of the efficacy of the overall drinking-
                   water catchment management.

Industry, mining and military sites:
Control and protection

A range of hazardous substances may be released to the environment from industrial
sites, depending on specific industrial processes (see Table 11.2). Among these, the
mobile compounds reach groundwater (see Chapter 4). Less mobile compounds may
also contaminate groundwater where process wastewaters are discharged through
soakage pits. The most common contaminants to reach groundwater in significant
quantities from industrial sites are the chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethene (TCE)
and perchloroethylene/tetrachloroethene (PCE) but, in specific circumstances,
concentrations of many others such as chromium and petroleum constituents may be
elevated. Mining can give rise to a range of inorganic contaminants and acid waters, in
particular, can result in the accelerated leaching of metals into groundwater. Stored,
disposed and deteriorating explosives have been found in some groundwaters below
military sites. In Germany and in the USA, perchlorate used in rocket fuel has given rise
to major problems. However, the most common contaminant for both military and
industrial sites is probably oil from machinery and vehicles, particularly in the case of
military sites.

    In contrast to groundwater contamination from agriculture and off-site sanitation,
larger industrial operations tend to be localized point sources of pollution. This is not the
case for small-scale enterprises, particularly where these are not connected to centralized
sewerage. Nevertheless, the control and protection measures proposed in this chapter for
industry can in principle be applied to small-scale enterprises as well.
    Military bases often resemble both industrial facilities and small cities regarding the
use, storage, and disposal of a variety of chemicals, heavy metals and waste materials.
Many planning and operational control measures to prevent the contamination of
groundwater by chemicals used in routine military operation are the same as those for
industrial sites, and they are therefore discussed together in this chapter.
    A variety of effective control measures can be implemented to minimize the
likelihood and the magnitude of groundwater impacts from industrial, mining and
military activities in groundwater recharge zones. These measures fall into broad
categories of: (i) planning, including principal site selection; (ii) engineering approaches
which can be implemented in the phase of planning and designing of facilities; and (iii)
operational/procedural controls which can be administrated for both new and existing
facilities. Some control measures may have both engineering implications (process
design) and administrative elements (modification of employee practices), e.g. efforts to
substitute with less hazardous process chemicals or development of a corporate recycling
plan to reduce waste volumes. Operational monitoring of control measures is important
to ensure the ongoing safe storage, handling and disposal of process chemicals,
maintenance supplies and waste materials (see Table 23.1). Good practice to support this
includes training of personnel in proper safety and handling of these materials under
routine conditions as well as in the case of spills or leaks.
    All of these measures are typically directed at preventing or limiting the quantity and
significance of releases. They include monitoring for early detection of releases and
improvement of available containment or remedial capabilities in the event that
accidental or intentional contaminant releases occur. In terms of resource allocation,
there is a clear benefit to avoidance of releases or accidents. Plans and procedures for
avoidance of releases are usually less costly in terms of time and money than remedial
measures (i.e. the cleanup of contaminated media such as soils and groundwater) once
contamination has spread over a broader area, perhaps even throughout a watershed or
aquifer.
    Implementing control measures for industry, mining and military sites in drinking-
water catchments can be triggered by water suppliers and/or the public authority
responsible for drinking-water safety, e.g. in the context of designating protection zones
(see Chapter 17), or in the context of developing a WSP (see Chapter 16).
             Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection                615


   NOTE X            In developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16), system assessment
                     would review the efficacy of control measures and management
                     plans for protecting groundwater in the drinking-water catchment
                     from contamination by industrial, mining and military activities.
                     Chapter 11 provides the background information about the
                     potential impact of these activities on groundwater and provides
                     guidance on the information needed to analyse these hazards.
                     This chapter introduces options for controlling risks from these
                     activities. As the responsibility for them usually falls outside that of
                     drinking-water suppliers, close collaboration of the stakeholders
                     involved, including the authorities responsible for the surveillance of
                     industry, mining and military activities, is important to implement,
                     upgrade and monitor these control measures. This may be initiated
                     by the drinking-water sector, e.g. in the context of developing a
                     Water Safety Plan or of designating protection zones (see
                     Chapter 17).




23.1       INDUSTRIAL AND MILITARY SITES
As discussed in Chapter 11, the main concern at industrial facilities as well as at smaller
enterprises typically is the improper containment and handling, management or disposal
of chemicals, which can lead to soil, surface water and groundwater contamination. This
may be the result of active contamination routes, such as intentional dumping or
inappropriate disposal activities, or may occur via passive contamination routes such as
leaking tanks or broken transfer pipes. Both for industrial and for military sites,
groundwater protection usually involves improvement of design and construction of
facilities, modification of current practices, as well as remediation of past contamination.

23.1.1 Strategies for pollution prevention and environmental
       management
The protection of groundwater from industrial and military contaminants is facilitated if
this can be managed within general environmental controls, i.e. in environmental
management systems such the international ISO 14001 standard or pursuant to EU
Regulation 761/2001. One example of a comprehensive strategy to address site-specific
control measures at industrial facilities is embodied in the 1991 Integrated Pollution
Prevention and Control approach of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development in Europe (Recommendation on Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control; C/90/164/Final/ 1991). This approach recommends means by which to
anticipate and manage chemical handling and process-related activities that may
potentially contaminate the environment, including groundwater. Recommendations
616                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

include those of an engineering nature, as well as an administrative or institutional nature.
The approach calls for:
    • identification of existing contamination;
    • design of mechanisms to detect potential future releases;
    • development of plans to minimize the impacts of such releases.
    Various cradle-to-grave or catchment-to-consumer management strategies similar to
the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development approach for chemicals,
especially directed at protection of groundwater resources, have been implemented in a
number of countries. Such management systems help to achieve the objective of
establishing environmentally safe and groundwater-conserving practices in dealing with
industrial chemicals through policy and administrative measures as well as through an
appropriate management of material flows based on life cycle analysis. Active military
installations, for example, are well suited for such management systems due to the
controlled nature of site personnel and activities. Environmental management systems
can, in the long term, replace some monitoring and control tasks, resulting in cost saving.
    Audits and evaluations of products are one way in which manufacturers, distributors
and users of chemicals can contribute to production and use of substances with less
pollution potential (HERA, 2002). Environmental and regulatory compliance audits have
been common practice in industrial and commercial settings for a decade or more under
international programs of environmental management and consumer product safety such
as ISO 14000 (Fredericks and McCallum, 1995; ISO, 2001). In addition, responsible and
detailed labelling of consumer products is a method for linking information from the
manufacturers with consumers and users to optimize environmentally sound disposal
practices (US EPA, 2002b).
    Similarly, the encouragement or institution of procedures for re-using waste materials
can be an economically and technically sound means to reduce waste volumes and limit
potential contamination by process wastes. The use of internal process modifications, or
business contacts with an external waste exchange programme which converts one
plant’s waste output into another plant’s resources are proven methods for achieving
these goals. Industrial waste treatment and recovery strategies to convert or to process
wastes into profitable materials have been effective in worldwide applications since at
least the 1970s. These strategies are most effective where large volume wastes of specific
types (e.g. spent solvents with low residual contaminants) are available from a plant, and
low cost transportation is available to a plant with distillation or purification facilities.
    Waste exchange, defined as the use of discarded, surplus or off-specification materials
for beneficial purposes, represents one potential component of waste management
options. While some materials are easily amenable to such exchanges (e.g. solvents for
reclamation, metals dusts for refining), other waste sources require innovative
approaches to identify users. Examples such as the oil refinery in Poland discussed in
Box 23.1 illustrate the double benefit associated with the waste exchange concept. This
growing trend in waste management benefits both parties and is typically facilitated by a
non-profit intermediary.
             Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection                  617

     Box 23.1. Waste exchange at a petroleum refinery site in Czechowice, Poland
    The oil refinery case example described in Chapter 11 (Box 11.1) illustrates the
    potential for waste exchange as an avoidance strategy: Final disposition of the
    acidic petroleum sludges currently stored in the refinery’s waste lagoons is an
    issue of concern for the refinery as it seeks to modernize its operations. With
    advice and guidance from an American waste exchange, the refinery sought to
    find a potential user for these sludges. A nearby cement manufacturer was
    identified as having the capabilities to co-fire the sludge in their cement
    curing/drying kilns, strictly for its energy value. Negotiations between the two
    parties led to a series of test burns using varying amounts of refinery sludge. The
    process was proven to be feasible and negotiations began for full-scale
    implementation. Successful consummation of this arrangement provided a low-
    or no-cost source of supplemental fuel to the cement manufacturer while
    providing a disposal mechanism and, potentially, income to the oil refinery.
    Existing waste materials will be removed from the urban area in which the
    refinery is located, reducing the potential for groundwater contamination, and
    the cement manufacturer will reduce their use of external fuel.

    A further important strategy to avoid contaminating groundwater is transition to
production processes that substantially reduce or totally replace the use of hazardous
chemicals and/or the use of water. Such developments have been successful in many
branches of production and include effluent-free steel industry, mercury free chlor-alkali
electrolysis, AOX-free propendioxide production, or wastewaterless flue gas washers
and cooling systems. Instalment of such production technologies often proves cost-
effective for the enterprise within fairly short time spans, particularly in settings where
water prices are an issue, or where the enforcement of pollution restriction legislation
renders polluting practices costly.
    Avoidance strategies are also important for a wide variety of substances used in
industry and with the potential to adversely affect groundwater which are also are present
in common household products (e.g. alcohols, petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated
solvents, soaps/surfactants, ammonia, phthalates, paints, batteries, pesticides, adhesives).
While individual quantities per household may seem small in comparison to those
generated by industrial facilities, a large number of households disposing such products
in landfills and/or septic systems may represent an equal or greater potential hazard (EC,
2002; Health Canada, 2002; US EPA, 2002a). In some areas, incentives encourage the
production, marketing and use of less toxic and less environmentally hazardous
alternatives. However, the costs and time necessary to effect changes in established
behaviours can be large (EC, 2002).

23.1.2 Choice of site
A fundamental element of any strategy for prevention or avoidance of adverse impacts in
groundwater recharge areas is appropriate choice of the site for a facility, including the
option of relocating existing facilities. Consideration of groundwater vulnerability is
invaluable in assessing the suitability of locations for new operations, and may be used in
618                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

conjunction with site development plans and engineering precautions to design a facility
with minimum potential aquifer impacts. An important measure in planning and choice
of site is to require permits for construction and operation which specify activities, pro-
duction processes and management plans. Legislation and local land use controls or zon-
ing requirements can be effective tools to guide industrial development for achievement
of minimum impact in drinking-water catchment areas. Limitations on siting in flood
prone or low areas, areas of karstic terrain, close proximity to water bodies or within
current or potential future drinking-water protection zones recognize that accidental
releases or ongoing industrial operations in these areas rapidly affect groundwater.
    Where facilities already exist in vulnerable drinking-water catchments and relocation
is not an option, control measures to prevent releases of hazardous substances become
particularly important, and specific controls may be required in permits for their
operation to limit their hazard potential. Such requirements may include use of
environmentally improved technology and products, more intensive monitoring systems,
emergency response plans and prohibiting the use of specifically identified hazardous
substances in their processes.
    Issues of site-specific relevance include: surface topography and features; soil type
and local variability; aquifer vulnerability (see Chapter 8); proximity to rivers and other
water bodies; chemical type, physical form and quantity of materials handled; degree to
which plant construction will require major changes to existing conditions and thus
impact on aquifer vulnerability (e.g. extensive excavation, backfilling or soil relocation,
pipeline installation, well construction, paving or building cover for substantial areas).

23.1.3 Design and construction for prevention of spills and leakage
A wide range of engineering measures can be applied in the design and construction of a
facility as an effective defence to prevent or avoid releases of hazardous substances.
These include approaches such as impermeable surfaces and secondary containment
structures around tanks, double-walled pipes, alarm devices indicating overfilling of
tanks or other vessels, and knock-down barriers to protect tanks or pipes from damage by
vehicles (see also Box 23.2 for examples). They also include using natural (e.g. clay) or
synthetic (e.g. geotextile) liners to prevent percolation from ponds or storage areas, and
capturing in-plant process residues or surface run-off in properly designed and
constructed holding areas prior to treatment. Often, structures to retain spilled and/or
leaking fluids are important particularly for unloading stations where hazardous fluids are
transferred from railway or truck tanks to on-site containers (see Figure 23.4 in
Box 23.2). Prevention and mitigation of releases can also be accomplished by
neutralizing, encapsulating, stabilizing or solidifying materials (e.g. process wastes, soils,
sludges) to prevent or control mobility.
    Canopies over stored materials, coupled with capping options designed to isolate
materials or to protect them from precipitation and to prevent leaching, can also be site-
specific source control measures (Figure 23.3 in Box 23.2). The appropriate degree of
complexity for a capping option is related to factors including size and configuration of
the capped area, toxicity and potential mobility of the materials to be addressed, duration
of required isolation, and whether the surface of the capped area is to be used for
             Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection              619

secondary activities. As indicated in Table 23.1 at the end of this chapter, capping
typically will be accompanied by an operational monitoring requirement to ensure that
the cap (and/or companion liner system) continues to be effective at isolating the
materials. Available capping options vary widely in cost, durability and effectiveness for
particular applications. Such options may best be viewed as temporary, albeit long-term,
solutions for which subsequent, permanent solutions are desirable.
    Levels of sophistication – and thus of costs – can vary for design and construction
control measures. Often, fairly simple low-cost measures effectively provide substantial
protection against soil and groundwater contamination, and are valuable first steps upon
which incremental improvements can build later. In the study shown in Box 23.2, short-
term, medium-term and long-term measures were proposed for many of the problems
identified. For example, while the long-term measure for protecting tanks against
overflow of hazardous chemicals through overfilling would be to fit them with approved
devices, overflow can already be quite effectively prevented by installing a simple
indicator of filling level and a routine for its regular monitoring. An immediate measure
would be to ensure that special care is taken when filling the tank by requiring two staff
members to fill the tank together. Likewise, while double bottoms for tanks may be
installed in the long run, intensified internal checks and determination of the wall
thickness of the tank may improve safety in the meantime.
    For all containment structures, regular maintenance and monitoring of their integrity
is critical for keeping them functional. Management plans for a facility should include
these activities and responsibilities for their regular performance and documentation.

23.1.4 Operational controls
For protecting groundwater from industrial contamination, controlling operations that
may lead to spills and leaching is often equally important as safe containment.
Operational controls address procedures for handling, using, transferring and storing
substances such as properly unloading trucks or railway tankers, using safety couplings
and valves, using mobile drip trays, avoiding overfilling containers and providing
materials to absorb hazardous chemicals in case of spills. An important aspect is
preventing joint storage of substances that may undergo chemical reactions with each
other and taking properties such as auto-ignition, combustibility or corrosiveness into
account. Also, labelling of tanks, containers and facilities with hazardous chemicals is
necessary to allow appropriate emergency responses. A further important operational
control is the implementation of emergency response plans which are regularly rehearsed
by the staff of the facility.
    Operational controls are best developed with operational staff and fixed in writing as
standard operating procedures in a facility’s management plans. Implementation is
supported by checklists and forms to sign after conducting specific routines. Adequate
training and qualification of staff, including the aspects of groundwater protection, as
well as clear assignment of tasks and responsibilities, are prerequisites to making them
work. Often the target of avoiding spills for the sake of groundwater protection is closely
linked to the target of avoiding exposure for the sake of occupational health and safety,
and both may be addressed within the same control measure.
620                    Protecting Groundwater for Health

    Box 23.2. Technology transfer for plant-related water protection in Moldavia,
                       Rumania and Ukraine (based on FEA, 2002)
  Within the framework of the Environmental Action Program for Central and
  Eastern Europe which was agreed by the Ministers for Environment of the
  UNECE, a Technical Assistance Programme launched by the German Ministry of
  Environment developed a methodology for assessing water pollution hazards by
  industries with high water pollution potential. This used the recommendations of
  the International Commissions for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR) as well as of
  the Elbe (ICPE) as a basis. From this assessment, short, medium, and long-term
  measures were identified with which the ICPR and ICPE recommendations can be
  met. The majority of these measures are equally relevant to the protection of
  groundwater and surface water. Measures relating to design and structure of
  facilities include the following:
  Short-term measures:
  - Repair and seal cracks and damage in existing sealed surfaces
  - Perform internal examinations of tanks and containers
  - Fill tanks and containers under the supervision of two operating persons
  - Examine and prepare a concept for joint storage of hazardous substances (with
      the potential to react)
  - Use mobile collecting basins and detachable connections for plants with
      transhipment (tank wagon – plant connections)
  Medium-term measures:
  - Provide a stop valve for open-air collecting basins connected to the wastewater
    system
  - Demonstrate that wastewater pipelines are not leaking (Figure 23.2)
  - Renovate sealed surfaces in plants for transhipment and/or storage

  Long-term measures:
  - Install overfill safety systems for storage containers
  - Provide collecting basins for retaining water-polluting substances and fire-
     fighting water
  - Create sealed surfaces and retaining volume for railway tank-car stations
     (Figure 23.4)
  - Establish wastewater treatment facilities that meet quality requirements

  Operational control measures include requiring the plant operator to:
  - define in-plant responsibilities for taking and checking safety measures which
     include functional safety, impermeability of containment structures, function-
     ning of safety equipment, documentation (in writing) of regular checks
     undertaken
  - provide detailed reports on accidents and incidents, including causes,
     consequences and future preventive measures
  - report releases of hazardous substances to competent authority
  - define equipment for plant monitoring and related instructions for action,
     including prevention of accidents, water hazard potential, potential for
     substance release, precautionary measures and protection requirements
                 Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection                             621

   -   use internal monitoring wherever there is a need to prevent releases of
       substances hazardous to water, to allow detection on time to implement
       contingency measures
  Checklists were developed for setting up internal alarm and hazard control plans
  defining actions and responsibilities for types of incidents (e.g. leakage, overfilling
  of vessels, failures of receptacles, containers, pipelines, fires and fire-fighting
  water, accidents during transport of hazardous goods) as well as for different plants.
  This includes exercises to train accident responses at regular intervals.

23.1.5 Decommissioning of contaminated sites
When industrial and military sites are abandoned, hazardous chemicals that may leak
into groundwater may unintentionally be left behind. An important control measure in
drinking-water catchments therefore is proper decommissioning – potentially involving
clean-up – of such sites. Issues of decontamination and remediation of sites formerly
622                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

used for industrial or military purposes are often complex due to the difficulties of
identifying those responsible for the pollution in order to implement the polluter pays
principle. This is particularly difficult in the context of abandoned sites. Teaf (1995) and
Herndon et al. (1995) have described the former military facilities in central and eastern
Europe as a large scale example of this and reported that the technical and financial
responsibility for mitigation became the burden of the host country. Similar problems
occur on abandoned industrial sites. An important control measure to prevent this type of
situation is to include the responsibility for decommissioning and potentially necessary
remediation in plans and permits for establishing such operations.

23.1.6 Clean-up and remediation of contamination
Once a decision has been made to clean up a given site, an initial site characterization
must be performed to determine the type and extent of contamination, it may be possible
to use available data for preliminary decision-making. For example, after-care measures
in the form of exploratory investigations, containment techniques and remedial actions
(Teaf, 1995) were carried out in particular in the early 1990s in Germany for military-
contaminated sites located in the vicinity of drinking-water abstraction. This included the
toxicological assessment of individual constituents and groups of military chemicals, as
well as assessment of their migration behaviour and biochemical, chemical and hydro-
lytic degradability in subsoil (e.g. to evaluate their potential to leach into groundwater).
    The characterization process prior to mitigation of industrial and military sites must
consider a cardinal rule: that which is not sought is never found. Although the highest
concentrations of contaminant generally will be focused at the source area, the
characterization and clean up efforts also must identify and evaluate the extent and
continued migration of contaminant plumes in soils, groundwater or surface water. This
is critical because degradation often occurs in the areas of lower concentration associated
with plume fringe, which may be far from the source.
    A variety of technologies exist for the remediation of soil, surface water and
groundwater at industrial facilities (e.g. thermal and chemical treatments, biological
remediation technologies, soil washing and filtration; see Soesilo and Wilson, 1997;
Nyer, 1998; Hyman and Dupont, 2001). Depending on the type of contamination and the
threat to drinking-water aquifers, natural attenuation may also be an option (see also
Chapter 24). When selecting a remedial technology, the decision will be influenced by
potential effectiveness, reliability, implementability, cost and time constraints. Each
technology has intrinsic advantages and disadvantages that can be optimized by carefully
matching site-specific conditions with a remedial technology or suite of technologies. For
example, many organic contaminants (e.g. petroleum hydrocarbons) are readily degraded
by microbial communities under appropriate environmental conditions (see Chapter 4).
Bioremediation seeks to optimize those conditions through a variety of in situ or
constructed on-site mechanisms. Biological technologies such as these take advantage of
and facilitate natural processes and, as such, are often favoured and are potentially less
expensive, in comparison with more technologically complex approaches. The increased
time frames associated with some biological remediation technologies may be more
easily accommodated at sites controlled by government entities (e.g. military instal-
             Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection                623

lations) than at those associated with commercial or industrial enterprises. Contaminants
such as petroleum products or chlorinated solvents are amenable to such efforts.
    Once a release to soils, waterbody sediments or other elements of a groundwater
recharge area has occurred, there are many established and new methods to prevent or
limit contaminant migration in soils and to control or reverse plume expansion in
groundwater. These methods include physical controls (e.g. sheet piling, trenches/slurry
walls/grouting, recovery wells, air sparging), physical separation (to reduce reactions)
and chemical methods for contaminant control (e.g. oxidation/aeration, reduction,
permeable reactive barrier, dual phase extraction), as well as in situ or ex situ degradation
by physical or biological processes. Recent advances in phytoremediation, for example,
have resulted in deployments of certain tree species known as phreatophytes (e.g. poplar,
willow) to intercept contaminant groundwater plumes (Quinn et al., 2001). Such biologi-
cal control also may enhance degradation of some organic contaminants. Maintenance
and operation costs of such a system are lower than for typical engineered systems (e.g.
pump and treat) over the relative lives of the systems. Depending on local and regional
hydraulic effects exerted by water bodies, surface water control may be an important
element of a comprehensive strategy to prevent industrial impacts in recharge areas.
    The most straightforward mechanism for addressing contaminated soil, generally
above the saturated zone, involves excavation and off-site disposal. However, the
quantity and character of soils, as well as the associated removal, transportation and dis-
posal costs, may limit the utility of this option. In addition, the transport of contaminated
materials to another location may not relieve the original landowner of legal liability.


23.2       MINING
As with industrial activities, control measures for mining activities involve prevention as
well as remediation and monitoring whether process controls are being implemented.
Due to the large scale of many mining activities and milling sites, retrospective
mitigation of their environmental impact is often substantially more difficult than
prevention. Further, groundwater protection strategies are needed for both the active
mining period and the post-mining period, and have to include the mine itself as well as
mine waste, milling facilities and atmospheric emissions. Control measures may be
equally necessary for small mining sites, particularly where they are numerous and
potentially lead to considerable contamination of groundwater (see Chapter 11).
   As for industry, choice of site is the first and often most important measure to protect
groundwater. Many countries require an environmental assessment study for new mining
activities exceeding a certain size (number of employees, amount of ore excavated).
Ideally, intersectional collaboration in this planning phase should involve public health
authorities and water suppliers to help recognize the potential impact on groundwater
resources. Numerical modelling of groundwater flow, hydraulic situation before, during,
and after mining activities and the impact of mining on groundwater quality is a state of
the art technique and often successfully performed. Groundwater modelling is also an
important tool to determine appropriate locations for monitoring wells to be drilled in the
region of interest for mining, in order to record groundwater flow and quality parameters.
Moreover, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA, Chapter 20) should be performed
624                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

taking into account the vulnerability of the groundwater, the type of ore mined and
processed, and other environmental threats in the region. This will lead to a more
sustainable mining activity by introducing appropriate treatment and processing
techniques. The EIA should cover the entire time frame, i.e. the exploration of an ore
body, the mining activity, the remediation measures taken and the post-mining land use.

23.2.1 Deep mines
Constructing and operating a deep mine usually requires groundwater withdrawal. A
necessary control measure to prevent water pollution in some cases is water treatment if
the water contains toxic elements above a critical level. Monitoring would address on a
regular basis whether treatment is in place and properly operating.
     A further measure for preventing contamination is limiting the use of hazardous
chemicals in ore processing and, where use is inevitable, application and handling with
special care. Control measures may involve limiting, budgeting and recording the
amounts of such chemicals used. Areas where heaps and tailing ponds will be
constructed have to be investigated carefully including geological and hydrogeological
aspects; in many cases liners (e.g. geotextile; see also Chapter 24) are useful as additional
protection against contaminant leakages.
     Before closing a deep mine, potential contaminants (e.g. fuel, oil, machinery) should
be removed. In numerous cases where this was not done, considerable amounts of
contaminants and waste in the mine have led to groundwater contamination.
     Refilling of tunnels and shafts with waste rock or fly ash is a common technique to
avoid land subsidence. However, it may also help in establishing lower permeability in
the flooded mine and act as reactive material. The chemical nature of such fill materials
should also be considered. These materials may be a potential source of contaminants
(e.g. metals) in addition to mined materials. On the other hand, they may also be selected
to bind contaminants: calcite may buffer low pH values, while iron (Fe0) acts as a
reducing agent, and fly ash or brown coal seem to be effective in sorption. However,
little is known about long term behaviour of reactive material in underground mines.
Thus the choice of adequate refilling materials is an important groundwater protection
measure but long-term surveillance will often be necessary to ensure that contaminants
are not released in concentrations above critical levels. Controls to ensure that adequate
measures are taken for closure may include the requirement of approval of plans for such
measures by government authorities or a catchment protection body.
     During controlled flooding of a mine, contaminated groundwater is pumped and
treated until the contamination level has decreased to acceptable concentrations. In many
cases, this may require an extended period of time, and alternative passive treatment
techniques might be preferable. In some cases, hydraulic isolation of the mine area might
solve the problem, but this can be expensive as well. Tracer experiments are common
tools to investigate the hydraulic flow pattern in a deep mine. Constructed wetlands can
be used as effective and inexpensive measures to treat surface water after the first flush
has reached an acceptable value of contaminants (Younger, 2000). As long as the
contaminated groundwater flows at shallow depths, reactive walls (i.e. subsurface perme-
able barriers built with reactive materials to degrade or immobilize water-borne contami-
             Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection                625

nants) may be considered as a low cost measure (Blowes et al., 2000). Reactive walls or
permeable reactive barriers are passive treatment systems: a ditch is excavated in an
aquifer downstream of the contaminant source and refilled with permeable and reactive
material (e.g. mixture of sand with iron). Since iron in its elemental form is a very strong-
ly reducing agent, metal ions (e.g. uranium, chromium) will be transferred in their
reduced redox state and in consequence precipitate. Thus groundwater leaving the
permeable reactive barriers is purified by certain metals and organic contaminants
efficiently and at low costs. All approaches to treating water from mines will require ade-
quate surveillance of treatment efficacy which would be defined in a management plan.

23.2.2 Open pit mines
Since open pit mining usually destroys aquifer structure, this type of mining often has the
most severe impact on groundwater on a regional scale. Legislation and governmental
controls on surface mining in relation to groundwater use have been implemented
successfully. To control sulphides, waste rock should be covered as soon as possible (see
below). Carbonate as alkalinity buffer may be added as additional measure to
compensate the pH value due to pyrite oxidation. Calcium phosphate also has been used
to control acid generation (Evangelou, 1995).
    The design of open pit mining activities must also account for the final shape of a
mine lake. Rapid recovery of groundwater to the final level in such a lake is often
targeted to minimize erosion and stability problems with the embankment. As discussed
in Chapter 11, acid mine drainage may flow from the oxidized zones of aquifers and
heaps towards the pit lake resulting in extremely low pH-values in the lake water. If
surface water is available to fill the lake, water quality will be no problem in the very
beginning as this is usually well buffered. However, hydraulic equilibrium between
groundwater and the lake will establish itself with time and water quality may decline
when the groundwater in contact with rock is contaminated due to the solution of
secondary minerals and/or waste deposits. Therefore management action to protect
groundwater from post-mining lakes and vice versa requires both consideration of these
processes already in the planning phase for the activity and surveillance for the post-
mining phase until new hydrological equilibrium between ground- and surface water, as
well as chemical equilibrium between solids and water, have been reached. Acid mine
lakes can be treated by means of liming with dolomite quicklime. The pH will rise to
about six and high sulphate concentrations will decrease by the formation of gypsum.
Time intervals of monitoring should relate to rates of change and may decrease as
processes slow down.

23.2.3 Acid mine leachate
As pointed out in Chapter 11, acid mine leachate is one of the most severe potential
groundwater impacts from this human activity. Approaches to controlling this involve
keeping the oxygen supply to sulphide minerals as low as possible to avoid reactions
producing sulphuric acid. This requires careful investigation of the distribution of
sulphides in the mine area and its vicinity. Also, minimizing the dewatering cone of
depression will reduce leachate. Refilling shafts and adits with material of fine grain size
626                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

reduces the permeability in these artificial cavities and helps establish more natural
groundwater levels during the post-mine period. This material also may act as reactive
material, lowering the outflow of contaminants from the mine site (see Section 23.2.1).
Where these measures are chosen – alone or in combination – monitoring their proper
operation is needed on a regular basis to ensure their implementation. Depending on the
setting, monitoring could include regular checks on pH and sulphate concentrations in
order to control whether sulphide oxidation is still ongoing; on the depression cone; and
on the amounts as well as type of refilling material actually used.

23.2.4 Heaps, piles, mills and tailings
Major sources of pollution from mining often are heaps, piles and tailing ponds. Waste
rock and residues from ore milling and ore processing (‘tailings’) at new or operational
mining facilities need to be handled with the same care as municipal or industrial wastes.
Control measures to mitigate their impact therefore include many state-of-the-art
techniques used for waste deposits, such as drainage and treatment of drainage water to
meet the targeted water quality criteria, or placement of spoil heaps and tailings over
areas of impermeable sediments such as clay or bedrock that will not allow leachate to
reach groundwater. Alternatively a clay lining or a geo-textile fabric can be used to line
the site intended for disposal of spoil and tailings, or a foundation pad can be constructed
which is impermeable or has reduced permeability. In both cases care must be taken to
contain or treat leachate that runs off from the site. Corresponding control measures
address the function of such containments and whether they are intact. Control measures
for sustainable mining may also include the addition of buffering minerals to heaps, e.g. a
certain amount of lime stone or fly ash according to the amount of sulphide in the waste
rock. This buffers the formation of acid mine drainage in situ.
    Control measures for such approaches involve periodic assessment of whether seals
are tight, and monitoring systems for groundwater quality up- and downstream will assist
in verifying whether the approach taken is sufficient.
    In many settings, earlier construction of heaps, piles and tailings without conside-
ration of their impact on groundwater quality has led to problems now requiring remedia-
tion. For example, remediation of the uranium mining and milling sites which were in
operation from 1946-1990 in the eastern part of Germany is costing the German Govern-
ment about US$ 6.5 billion. Treatment of contaminated groundwater as well as surface
water from deep mines during ongoing operation may be accomplished by means of
classical treatment techniques, though this may be prolonged and costly. Thus alternative
treatment techniques such as reactive walls, carbonate drains, and constructed wetlands
are increasingly being used. Constructed wetlands have proved to be a promising tool for
natural attenuation of mine-related contaminants (Hedin et al., 1994; Younger, 2001).
    Physical shaping and capping of heaps and tailings is necessary to avoid erosion, dust
transport and reduction of the amount of infiltration. If radioactive ores or waste rock
with radioactive components occur on-site, this must be taken into account in designing
covers or caps that can act as a radon barrier as well (Merkel et al., 2002). Tailings may
be covered with wet or dry caps, the latter being most common. Again, control measures
should ascertain that caps are in place and functioning.
             Industry, mining and military sites: Control and protection                627

   Rehabilitation of old heaps and tailings requires a careful investigation of boundary
conditions and impact on groundwater. This will show to what extent reshaping and
capping of these heaps and tailings may be necessary to achieve slope stability, erosion
protection and surface or groundwater protection. Passive water treatment techniques
may be applicable for long-term protection of groundwater resources.

23.2.5 In situ leaching
Mining by in situ leaching (ISL) presents special concerns to groundwater quality since
hazardous chemicals are used for the in situ extraction of ore by leaching (see
Chapter 11). Approval of ISL mining by regulators should therefore require management
plans which define control measures with operational monitoring systems as well as
maintenance of all installations to ensure that groundwater clean up can be performed at
the specific site. Monitoring is critical to ensure that no process chemicals leave the ISL
mining site during operation. When ISL mining is terminated, the site should be cleaned
until pre-mining or otherwise acceptable conditions have been established.


23.3      MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF MEASURES
          CONTROLLING INDUSTRY, MINING AND
          MILITARY SITES
The control measures for industry, military sites and mining in drinking-water
catchments proposed above range from planning tools in the context of broader
environmental policy to specific technical measures such as structures, containments and
operational controls. Selected examples are summarized in Table 23.1.


   NOTE X            The implementation of control measures such as those suggested in
                     Table 23.1 is effectively supported if the stakeholders involved
                     collaboratively develop management plans that define the control
                     measures and how their performance is monitored, which corrective
                     action should be taken both during normal operations and during
                     incident conditions, responsibilities, lines of communication as well
                     as documentation procedures.
                     The implementation of control measures protecting drinking-water
                     aquifers from industry, mining and military activities is substantially
                     facilitated by an environmental policy framework (see Chapter 20).


   Monitoring of the measures implemented is crucial to ensure that they are in place
and effective. Table 23.1 therefore includes options for monitoring and verification of the
control measure examples given. Most of these focus on checking whether the controls
are functioning as intended, rather than on contaminant concentrations in groundwater.
For planning, reviewing will address whether plans exist, are appropriate and are being
implemented, particularly in the context of issuing permits for new or extended
628                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

operations. Periodic auditing of plans is an effective tool for such surveillance. Likewise,
reviewing of emergency response plans would assess whether they are appropriate and
whether they are occasionally being used for appropriate facility training exercises.
   Similarly, for control measures in design and construction, the first step is to assess
whether or not they are adequate for achieving the protection target, and whether or not
they are in place as indicated in the construction plan. For the day-to-day routine
operation of controls, monitoring focuses on assessing whether they are functioning as
they should, e.g. whether containments are sealed, mine drainage is being treated or
waste management plans are being implemented.
   Monitoring of controls for day-to-day operations is particularly important as these
tend to slip if not taken seriously. Examples given in Table 23.1 include maintenance
routines, specifications on amounts and types of chemicals to be used, safety rules for
handling, transferring and storing hazardous chemicals and routines for pumping
hazardous leachate from mines. Such rules will be specified in management plans and
standard operating procedures. Their implementation can be monitored by checking
records, e.g. of maintenance measures taken or amounts of chemicals used in process
steps, as well as by occasional inspection of process steps, such as unloading tankers with
hazardous chemicals or integrity of storage structures, and by interviewing technical staff
on how these steps are normally performed.


   NOTE X            Options for monitoring suggested in Table 23.1 rarely include
                     regular groundwater quality monitoring. Where control measures
                     such as structures are poorly accessible, however, monitoring of
                     selected indicator parameters in groundwater is suggested.
                     Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are a
                     supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of providing
                     verification of the efficacy of the overall drinking-water catchment
                     management.


    Where spills and releases are suspected or where the risk that this may happen is
elevated, monitoring to provide for early detection is important. Careful evaluation of
both the hydrogeology and the facility operations will allow prediction of likely locations
and flow patterns of initial releases. Monitoring for key parameters that would readily
indicate a leak at these locations can provide early warnings. This may include
groundwater sampling and analysis of selected indicator parameters that would readily
reflect leakage and potential contamination. Contaminant analyses will also be an
important control measure after decommissioning of industrial and military sites and in
particular after clean-up and remediation of contamination. Generally, resources
expended in monitoring result in reduced remedial costs (and potential enforcement) in
the event of a release. In the context of monitoring for overall verification of the
catchment management concept, it is often effective to include contaminants anticipated
or known to occur from industry, mining and military activities in the catchment,
particularly at the sites of these activities, but also at groundwater intakes.

Waste disposal and landfill: Control
and protection
A. Allen and R. Taylor




Waste disposal by landfill has led to the pollution of groundwater resources under a wide
range of conditions around the globe (e.g. Sangodoyin, 1993; Ahel et al., 1998;
Christensen et al., 1998; Afzal et al., 2000). In the USA, Lee and Jones (1991) assert that
approximately 75 per cent of the estimated 75 000 sanitary landfills pollute adjacent
groundwater with leachate. Leachate derived from waste deposits (landfills, refuse
dumps) includes a wide range of contaminants, depending on the types of wastes
deposited (see Chapter 12). There is consequently a strong need, supported by legislation
in many regions, to protect groundwater from the effects of waste disposal. This chapter
provides an overview of current approaches towards this aim and explains their scientific
rationale.


24.1       WASTE CONTROL
Control of the type and amount of waste placed in landfills is a basic measure to protect
groundwater. In many countries legislation regulates the type of wastes deposited at
MSW landfills: waste that is considered hazardous due to its ignitability, corrosivity,
reactivity, toxicity and carcinogenicity (Sharma and Lewis, 1994) is not accepted at

MSW landfills, but is separated and removed for specialized disposal. Industrial wastes
classified as hazardous include solvents and metal-rich materials. At the household level,
hazardous wastes include refrigerators, paint, a range of cleaning products, batteries and
such automotive products as lubricants (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993).


   NOTE X            In developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16), system assessment
                     would review the efficacy of control measures and management
                     plans for protecting groundwater in the drinking-water catchment
                     from waste disposal and landfill. Chapter 12 provides the
                     background information about the potential impact of wastes on
                     groundwater and provides guidance on the information needed to
                     analyse these hazards.
                     This chapter introduces options for controlling risks from wastes. As
                     the responsibility for waste disposal usually falls outside that of
                     drinking-water suppliers, close collaboration of the stakeholders
                     involved, including the authorities responsible for landfill, is
                     important to implement, upgrade and monitor these control
                     measures. This may be initiated by the drinking-water sector, e.g. in
                     the context of developing a Water Safety Plan or of designating
                     protection zones (see Chapter 17)..


    Legislation to gradually divert most organic waste from landfills has been introduced
by several countries. It is designed to reduce overall waste quantities disposed by landfill
and thus also the quantity of leachate produced in landfills, since biodegradation of
organic wastes is the dominant source of leachate production. Separate treatment of
diverted organic waste by aerobic or anaerobic digestion will lead to the production of
considerable quantities of compost. To protect the underlying groundwater, the control of
run-off from larger (i.e. commercial outdoor non-reactor) compost piles is necessary.
    Separation or sorting of waste for reuse or recycling (e.g. paper, bottles, cans) is
another key measure in controlling and reducing waste going to landfill. Waste
separation and sorting, which should preferably take place at source, provide an
opportunity to reuse or recycle waste materials and to compost organics. This not only
reduces the amount of refuse disposed by landfill but also leachate production. In many
countries, semi-automated waste separation and sorting takes place after collection at
centralized materials recovery facilities. Runoff from such facilities needs to be
controlled to avoid groundwater contamination. However, recycling and reuse initiatives
generally require government support as recycled items are commonly more expensive
to produce than the items they replace. Government support of recycling can be financial
through creation of markets or through government purchasing policy.
    Open refuse dumps, where waste disposal is unsorted and unregulated, are
characteristic of many countries of the developing world and represent an increased risk
to groundwater quality. In such settings, waste separation and sorting for reuse and
recycling is often conducted on an informal basis either at points of collection or at the
                 Waste disposal and landfill: Control and protection                   633

dump itself. Although some of these operations are officially sanctioned, most are
unofficial. They represent an important function as an informal recycling system
contributing to reduction of waste to landfill. Direct exposure to waste materials may,
however, present a health hazard.
    A waste reduction strategy successfully used in a number of countries has been the
imposition of a deposit fee refunded upon return of, for example, bottles, cans, tins, paper
and other items. Taxes specifically on packaging materials have been implemented in
Germany, for example, to reduce unnecessary waste volume. Household composting can
be promoted for further waste reduction by subsidized sale of home composting bins.
    Waste reduction strategies may also include landfill taxes. These provide an econo-
mic incentive and generate revenue. The downside to consider in planning policy is that
they may also promote illegal (uncontrolled) disposal practices. For instance, imposition
of a charge for acceptance of construction and demolition waste at one landfill in Ireland
led to a rapid drop in the quantity of such waste delivered to the landfill.
    Waste incineration can be an effective strategy to substantially reduce the amount of
waste that is landfilled. Adequately engineered systems can effectively control air
pollution and toxic residues, including those from flue gas cleaning systems, can be
encapsulated for safe disposal. A major drawback of this strategy is its high costs, which
tend to distract from investments into other options such as recycling.
    Industrial wastes are often more hazardous than municipal solid waste (MSW).
Unregulated disposal, often on site, was commonplace in the past and remains a problem
in some regions. Major contamination of groundwater resources can be avoided through
specifically designed and managed disposal of wastes from such industries as smelting,
electroplating and tanning industries. A case study showing planning steps taken to
remedy unregulated disposal of industrial wastes is described in Box 24.1.

    Box 24.1. Planning priorities for the remediation of contaminated groundwater in
               the metallurgical centre of Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan
   Metallurgical plants produce fluid and solid waste that is hazardous due to high
   (toxic) metal concentrations. Disposal of this waste without pretreatment and in
   locations with limited capacity to attenuate these metal contaminants can lead to
   groundwater pollution. Ust-Kamenogorsk is a city in northeastern Kazakhstan
   with a population of 290 000 that was a centre for metallurgy and heavy industry
   in the former USSR. As a result of uncontrolled dumping of industrial wastes
   over more than 50 years, 300 000 tons of toxic arsenic mud, 6000 tons of PCB-
   contaminated mud and 19 million tons of slag, clinker and sludge from metallur-
   gical processes containing mobile metal compounds were stored on permeable
   ground. Another eight million tons of fly ash from coal-fired heat and power
   plants, containing fluoride and boron have been deposited within the city area.
   The alluvial aquifer underlying the city is the sole water resource for the city
   water supply but was heavily polluted by arsenic, boron, fluoride, cadmium,
   copper, lead, manganese, selenium and zinc. High chloride, nitrate and sulphate
   contents are encountered in the contamination plumes. Contamination plumes in
   the groundwater clearly relate to dumps of metallurgical sludges and to seepage
   of process water from leaking pipe work and cracked factory floors (von Hoyer
   and Muff, 2001).
634                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

  Comprehensive remediation of contaminated lands in Ust-Kamenogorsk is not
  currently feasible due not only to limited resources with which to execute the
  clean-up but also because of the magnitude of the problem that features a large
  number of pollution centres, complex nature of the contaminants and the large
  area of the polluted land. In the interim, an approach was necessary that seeks to
  improve the environment and the living conditions in the city but recognizes the
  need for continued industrial activity that provides jobs and tax revenue. The
  approach also had to be integrated into the legal framework and taxation system
  of the public sector, waste management and city planning, recognizing explicitly
  that groundwater pollution by hazardous waste is related to the production
  methods applied by the industry. Several social and economic sectors need to be
  involved in this task: the central government, the regional administration and the
  industrial sector. The following actions were recommended:
  Political actions:
  - Separation of responsibilities for hazardous waste. Government: hazardous
      waste inherited from the USSR era; industry: hazardous waste generated after
      independence
  - Adaptation of an environmental fee system, with the aim to financially
      support the development of cleaner production technology from the fees
      collected from pollution
  - Allocation of State Environmental Fund for the construction of
      environmentally safe disposal sites for hazardous waste
  Technical measures (level of priority):
  - Safe central drinking-water supply to all city areas from unpolluted wellfields;
     closure of polluted household wells (high)
  - City development planning: protection of operative and potential city
     wellfields, concentration of industrial activities in existing industrial areas and
     relocation of residential areas to unpolluted areas (high)
  - Capping of abandoned hazardous waste deposits with multibarrier cover in
     order to reduce leakage of contaminants, recultivation (high)
  - Retrofitting of the zinc and lead plant in order to reduce leakage of process
     water (high)
  - Optimization of the hydraulic containment for contaminated groundwater in
     the zinc and lead plant area (high)
  - Solidification of PCB mud, deposition and capping with multibarrier cover,
     recultivation (high)
  - Modernization of water quality laboratory in the East Kazakhstan Ecology
     Administration (high)
  - Establishment of a surface and groundwater data bank and development of a
     groundwater flow and contaminant transport model in order to monitor the
     impact of remediation measures and industrial activities and to protect the city
     water supply (high)
  - Capping of closed fly ash dumps with multibarrier cover, recultivation (low)
  - Upgrading of existing groundwater monitoring network (low)

   Legislation on handling, containment and disposal of hazardous wastes is in place in
many countries and chiefly addresses industrial and medical waste. Pretreatment
(physical, chemical, thermal or biological) of some of these is an option to reduce their
hazardous impact. Separate approaches may be needed for different types of hazardous
wastes, depending on the health hazards they impose, and their source. Box 24.2 uses the
example of wastes from health care facilities to highlight management approaches for
such specific waste sources.

                  Box 24.2. Managing wastes from health-care facilities
    Many wastes from health-care facilities (e.g. hospitals) require pretreatment
    before these waste streams can be unified with other similar waste and disposed
    of as household waste. For example, microbiologically contaminated waste
    should be disinfected or sterilized before it is handled in any other way, and
    wastes containing cytotoxic compounds should be incinerated. Radioactive
    waste and associated waste waters require separate collection, as well as storage
    until their radioactivity have declined. For the disposal or discharge of wastes
    containing pharmaceutically active substances, diagnostic agents and active
    disinfecting substances into the environment risk, assessment is – for most
    compounds – similar to that for other chemicals (in particular pesticides and
    other biocides). Some substances require special management strategies, e.g.
    antibiotics and disinfectants due to their ability to foster resistance, and cytotoxic
    compounds of which some show mutagenic, carcinogenic and fetotoxic
    properties (Eitel et al., 2000).
    One option to reduce the environmental impact of hospital wastes on a local
    scale is to implement an environmental management system, e.g. according to
    the ISO 14000 standard which defines targets for use of specific substances and
    their emission. This can be combined with the introduction of health and safety
    management procedures (Kümmerer et al., 2001). Often the process of
    improving the safety of medical staff can be addressed together with the
    reduction of environmental impacts including impacts on groundwater used as
    drinking-water resource.
    Avoidance strategies have proven successful in health care facilities. For
    example, because of their low biodegradability, Freiburg University Hospital,
    Germany has largely eliminated products containing benzalkonium chloride or
    other quaternary ammonium compounds, and alcohols or aldehydes are used
    instead. This has considerably reduced quaternary ammonium compound
    concentrations in the hospital’s effluent. Another important element of
    avoidance strategies is information for users about the potential impact of drugs,
    diagnostic agents and disinfectants on water quality, if they are not properly
    disposed of or returned to the pharmacy (e.g. safety data sheets, package inserts,
    specialist information for pharmacists/dispensing chemists).

24.2       SITING AND PLANNING OF LANDFILLS
As discussed in Chapter 12.1, little attention was historically paid to the siting of
landfills. Rock quarries and open gravel pits were often exploited as they avoided the
effort and expense of excavation. Landfills, nevertheless, tend to be located close to
urban areas where significant volumes of municipal and industrial wastes are produced.
Whether the intention is to store waste in containment landfills or employ a strategy of
NA (see Sections 24.3.1 and 24.3.2), it is safest to position landfills in areas removed
from groundwater drinking-water supply sources and on sites where the underlying
geology is able to attenuate to some degree the leachate that is generated from the stored
wastes (see also aquifer vulnerability in Chapter 8). Clay- and organic-rich materials
(overburden or mudstone bedrock) are suitable as they both retard groundwater flow and
interact with reactive contaminants in leachate. Unfortunately, it is commonly difficult to
choose such ideal locations strictly on the basis of hydrogeological considerations as
socioeconomic considerations, including the ‘not in my back yard’ syndrome, tend to
dominate the process of selection of landfill sites. Onibokun (1999) notes that landfills
and dumps in Africa commonly occur in poorer areas, where residents are often less able
to prevent landfill in their own backyard, are unlikely to benefit from waste collection
services, and invariably depend upon local, often poorly protected sources of water.
    In many countries, a tool for commissioning a site for landfill is Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA; see also Chapter 20). These include licensing applications,
public hearings, appeals and sometimes court cases. The site selection process can be
assisted by a GIS approach that is integrated with rigorous geotechnical site
investigations (Allen et al., 2001). Areas underlain by aquifers used for drinking-water
supply and their catchments would normally be identified and rejected for waste disposal
during an initial exclusion step, whilst areas with favourable geological conditions would
gain high positive weightings in the ensuing assessment of the residual areas remaining
after the initial assessment step. A second stage to narrow down potential sites, involving
considerations such as cost/distance analyses and visual impact assessments, is then
followed by the geotechnical investigation, which can also fulfil the requirements of the
EIA. A major requirement of an EIA at any proposed landfill site will be a detailed
hydrogeological investigation to assess aquifer vulnerability and potential impacts to
groundwater. Determination of the attenuation capacities of the subsurface materials
underlying the site, which should also be undertaken, can enable assessment of the
capacity of the site to attenuate leachate migrating from the landfill.
    In many countries, applications for licenses are also required for existing landfills and
dumps. Where these are unsuitably located relative to drinking-water resources or to
aquifer recharge areas, and where the underlying geology gives inadequate groundwater
protection, a license may be revoked or refused and the landfill forced to close. Licenses,
whether granted to existing landfills or to new landfills, usually come with stipulations in
the form of requirements and restrictions. Stipulations for new landfills usually include
design and operational requirements based on site conditions established in an EIA,
whereas for existing landfills, upgrading of groundwater protection measures and
operational procedures may be demanded. Stipulations for all landfills will also include
types of waste acceptable for disposal and types of waste not permitted. Unacceptable
                 Waste disposal and landfill: Control and protection                    637

waste may include hazardous wastes, for which specialized disposal or incineration may
be required. Other requirements will generally also include monitoring procedures and
frequency, and possibly also maintenance provisions at closure.
    A policy of minimum travel time between landfills and groundwater-fed drinking-
water sources has been adopted in a number of countries, often within the concept of
drinking-water protection zones, as discussed in Chapter 17. According to this policy,
waste disposal facilities are prohibited in areas within a certain (e.g. 50-day) travel time
(by groundwater flow) of a groundwater-fed drinking-water source. A key drawback to
the travel-time criterion is that it requires an indication of the mean groundwater flow
velocity in order to estimate an appropriate separation distance. In practice, this is
difficult to determine due to the pronounced heterogeneity and complexity of many
groundwater systems. More refined approaches base landfill site selection decisions on a
more detailed understanding of groundwater conditions, and the ability of the natural
environment to contain or alternatively attenuate contaminants in waste leachate.
Groundwater flow conditions can be assessed from local borehole records (i.e. hydraulic
gradient, aquifer thickness) and the results of pumping tests in the underlying aquifer (i.e.
estimates of hydraulic conductivity). The geology of a potential landfill site and, hence,
its natural capacity to restrict subsurface flow and attenuate contaminants, can be
elucidated from drilling logs (if available) and geological maps of the area.
    Further planning aspects critical to potential groundwater contamination are the size
of a waste disposal facility and the rate at which refuse is deposited. These determine its
operational lifetime. Also, planning and siting needs to include transfer stations and
material recovery facilities to ensure that these are not polluting groundwater.


24.3       DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR LANDFILLS
Different approaches exist regarding strategies of protecting groundwater resources from
the leachate generated by waste disposal. Two different design strategies for landfills are:
containment and treatment of leachate on site versus attenuation through degradation,
dilution and dispersion of leachate.

24.3.1 Containment strategy
Containment requires that all liquid and gaseous emissions produced within the landfill
are contained and collected for treatment. The central aim of containment is, therefore, to
minimize production of leachate by restricting access of rainwater to the waste, and to
prevent its migration from the landfill of leachate produced. This is accomplished by
enclosing the waste in artificial lining systems consisting of a landfill liner and cap. As a
consequence, leachate drainage systems, containment ponds and leachate treatment
facilities are essential additional components of modern containment landfills.
Experience has shown that artificial membranes will eventually leak so modern designs
usually include composite two-, three- and four-layer multibarrier clay/membrane liner
systems (Figure 24.1). These multibarrier systems consist of sheets of artificial
membrane, most commonly high-density polyethylene, interlayered with natural or
bentonite-enriched clay layers (Seymour, 1992; Cossu, 1995). In the European Union,
638                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

for example, landfill regulations make it mandatory to entomb waste using engineered
lining systems except at sites with low in situ hydraulic conductivity (less than 10-9 m/s)
(Allen, 2001).




Figure 24.1. A sanitary landfill featuring an engineered lining and leachate collection system
(Rowe et al., 1997)

    Leachate containment with engineered lining systems requires a suitable geological
sub-base as a secondary barrier to groundwater when containment structures become
permeable. Leakage can result from stress cracking of the membrane, cracking under
cold conditions, damage, particularly from stones in the protection layer and from heavy
dumping equipment, or failure of the membranes near welded seams (Rollin et al., 1991;
Surmann et al., 1995). Synthetic liners are also susceptible to failure if installation is not
subject to strict quality controls and favourable weather conditions (Averesch, 1995).
Indeed, it is unlikely that any manufactured synthetic membrane is completely free of
defects even prior to installation (Christensen et al., 1994a). Lastly, some contaminants
are able to diffuse through installed liners including intact geotextiles (Potter and Yong,
1993; Rowe, 1994).
    Natural leachate containment is assumed under geological conditions where in situ
hydraulic conductivity is less than 10-9 m/s. In practice, this is not always easy to
ascertain. This is indicated by bulk hydraulic conductivities, derived from pumping or
tracer tests over a larger volume, which are often several orders of magnitude greater due
to preferential flow along discontinuities such as fissures (Gerber and Howard, 1996).
Thus apparently low permeability strata such as glacial till and shale do not necessarily
assure containment of leachate. When planning landfill based on natural leachate con-
ainment, it is therefore important to validate the bulk hydraulic conductivity of the site.
    An important aspect of containment is the aftercare timespan. Rates of waste
degradation are a function of moisture content. Under wet conditions (i.e. uncapped
landfills in climates where precipitation exceeds evaporation), an aftercare timespan of
30 years was initially assumed adequate to allow for degradation of waste to an inert state
(Bookter and Ham, 1982). However, more recent work indicates that even under very
wet conditions, complete degradation of waste may take at least 40-60 years (Wall and
                Waste disposal and landfill: Control and protection                   639

Zeiss, 1995), and that some components (e.g. NH4-N concentrations) may not have fallen
to compliance thresholds of wastewater regulations for at least 100 years subsequent to
landfill closure (Kruempelbeck and Ehlrig, 1999). On the other hand, for dry uncapped
landfills in climate regimes where annual evaporative rate exceeds precipitation, giving
rise to a moisture deficiency, degradation of waste may be considerably slower and
estimates for dry landfills in water deficient areas suggest timescales in excess of 400
years (Röhrs et al., 2000). The Gaza case study example given in Box 24.3 shows that
depending on the composition of the wastes, leachate production may suffice for
effective degradation.

       Box 24.3. Groundwater protection in Gaza through upgrading of disposal
                                     standards
   Collection and disposal of solid waste in the central part of the Gaza Strip are the
   responsibility of the Solid Waste Management Council – an autonomous public
   body governed by a board comprising the mayors of the eleven towns and
   villages that it serves. Services include collection and disposal of about 220 tons
   of MSW per day, generated by some 350 000 people. The sanitary landfill
   operated by this Council was designed and constructed in co-operation with the
   German Agency for Technical Cooperation.
   At the onset of the project in 1994 a number of uncontrolled open dumpsites
   existed in the area under consideration. Adopting a strategy of containment, the
   first step in improving this situation was to assess soil and groundwater
   conditions at several locations. Based on this information and other factors, one
   of the existing dumpsites was chosen as a site for a central landfill.
   In Gaza annual precipitation is between 200 mm and 450 mm; the wet season is
   October and April; no rainfall during rest of year; high annual evaporation
   between 1200 mm and 1400 mm. i.e. annual evaporative rate exceeds
   precipitation, representing moisture deficient conditions for most months of the
   year, so most experts were of the opinion that insignificant quantities of leachate
   would be produced.
   Nevertheless, since groundwater is the main potable water source in the Gaza
   Strip, it was considered desirable to avoid any risk of further groundwater
   contamination. It was therefore decided to line the landfill site as detailed below:
   two asphalt liners with a bitumen mastic layer between the liners; coarse
   aggregates and drainage pipes to convey leachate to a storage pond; pumps and a
   sprinkling system for recirculation of leachate.
   Decisions regarding capping, final cover and post-closure care were delayed until
   the quantity of leachate produced had been established. The lessons learned
   include:
   Leachate quantities produced are high, contrary to expectation: Measurements
   indicate that the average leachate flow during the winter 1999/2000 to be 27.4 m3
   per day, and only slightly less during the dry summer season (25.4 m3 per day),
   during which no leachate was expected at all. One possible explanation is that the
   composition of waste in Gaza differs from that for Western Europe. It contains
   more biodegradable organics with a high moisture content and more inert
640                      Protecting Groundwater for Health

  material, but less paper and other light fractions to absorb water. Because of its
  high initial moisture content this organic-rich waste biodegrades readily,
  promoted by the high temperatures prevailing in Gaza, producing large quantities
  of solubilized liquids even under moisture-deficient climate conditions, thus
  creating substantial quantities of leachate. Leachate samples, obtained and
  analysed, indicate that COD concentrations are in the range of 40 000 mg/l and
  BOD is about 11 000 mg/l, quite similar to values for young landfill sites in
  western Europe. These results indicate how incorrect conclusions can be arrived
  at if based on experience from quite different climatic and socioeconomic
  settings. Specifically, it proved to be important to have provided a lining in order
  to protect groundwater drinking-water resources.
  The density of landfilled waste at the disposal site is exceptionally high: Based on
  before-and-after topographical surveys and calculations relating the volume filled
  to the total weight disposed of at the site, the density amounts to about 1.9
  tonnes/m3. Again this value met with disbelief from experts because this is almost
  twice the value at landfill sites in western Europe. Benefits of these high disposal
  densities are considerable:
  - the life span of the site is almost doubled;
  - capital costs for disposal on a per tonne basis are reduced by almost half.
  This indicates that densities at disposal sites in the developing world may be
  considerably higher than in industrialized countries, again possibly due to the
  composition of the wastes, and the rapid biodegradation brought about by its high
  moisture content.
  New approaches to final cover: The generation of leachate at the Gaza landfill
  site is likely to decrease substantially once the site reaches its capacity limit. The
  reason for this expectation is that the bulk of the leachate generated is due to the
  high moisture content of the waste, which promotes rapid degradation under the
  high temperature conditions prevailing at Gaza. When no more fresh waste is
  added, the moisture content will drop and degradation rates will decrease. Hence,
  once the site has been filled, the main source of leachate – fresh waste that has
  just been placed – no longer exists. This suggests that the application of an
  impermeable cap may not be required. It was therefore decided that the main
  consideration in the selection of cover material should be that it is a suitable
  substrate for plant growth. Organic and inert material from the landfill itself
  proved to be suitable for this purpose.
  Appropriate solution for post-closure care: Considering that net evaporation is
  about 1000 mm per year, the surface area of the existing leachate storage pond is
  sufficient to allow evaporation of the quantity of leachate expected during the
  post closure period. It was therefore decided that, after closure of the site, the
  existing leachate storage pond be converted to an evaporation pond. This solution
  is inexpensive, reliable and almost maintenance-free.
  Costs: As the (virtual) disposal density is about 1.9 tonnes/m3, capital costs are
  equivalent to about US$ 2.5 per tonne of MSW delivered to the site. The average
  household size in Gaza is 6.9 persons, disposal costs per household amount to
  about US$ 0.60 per month. This shows that relatively high standards of
  protection of groundwater resources can be achieved at moderate cost.

    Isolating the waste from water (i.e. dry entombment) significantly reduces rates of
degradation of the waste, thereby prolonging the activity of the waste and inhibiting,
possibly by decades or centuries, its stabilization to an inert state (Allen, 2001). This
extends the time span during which synthetic materials in artificial liners are subjected to
the corrosive effects of leachate and the elevated temperatures generated by the
exothermic processes operating with landfills. Recent research indicates that degradation
of geomembranes occurs through oxidation processes over time (Hsuan and Koerner
1995; Koerner and Daniel, 1997).
    Further considerations on the containment landfill strategy are its inherent costs and
sustainability. The capital costs of installing an engineered lining and leachate collection
system (Figure 24.1) will vary depending upon the size and lifespan of the landfill but are
likely to prove prohibitive for many communities in low-income countries. Operational
costs for one small landfill in Ireland, situated on a thick natural clay overburden deposit
with a K value of <10-9 m/s, and initially employing unlined cells, increased ten-fold
when installation of a liner for future cells was required as part of its licensing
stipulations. Leachate collection and treatment add significantly to the operating costs of
containment landfills. There are, furthermore, the costs of other essential components of
containment landfills including leak detection and landfill gas collection systems.
Because of the large investment required for such technologies, landfills become
economical on a large scale, promoting development of regional superdumps.

24.3.2 Attenuation strategy
The attenuation strategy allows leachate to migrate outwards from the landfill and takes
advantage of the natural subsurface processes of biodegradation, filtration, sorption and
ion exchange to attenuate the contaminants in leachate. The attenuation strategy is based
on the dilute and disperse principle of leachate management proposed by Gray et al.
(1974). A significant study at the time drew from a large body of field and laboratory
investigations to highlight the efficacy of natural processes in attenuating leachate
concentrations and indicated that, in appropriate situations, such an approach is effective
in reducing the risk of pollution to water resources. This method of leachate management
relied on natural low permeability and attenuation characteristics of geological barriers in
the subsurface, primarily clay-rich overburden and, to a lesser extent, consolidated
mudrocks, to prevent groundwater pollution by landfill leachate. The dilute and disperse
principle of leachate control was superseded in the early 1980s by the containment
strategy after having been discredited due to failures which occurred where the strategy
was employed without adequate consideration of prevailing hydrogeological conditions.
    The critical difference between the modern attenuation approach and the former dilute
and disperse approach is that attenuation is an active management strategy, requiring the
presence of a natural in situ or imported attenuation barrier to attenuate the leachate,
whereas dilute and disperse relied on passive subsurface dilution and dispersion
processes without the presence of a specific attenuation layer. Although the concepts are
similar, it is now recognized that dispersion and dilution alone may not sufficiently
attenuate leachate to adequately protect groundwater. More recent studies (e.g. Warith
and Yong, 1991; Batchelder et al., 1998; Yong et al., 1999) support the conclusion that
642                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

clay-rich overburden and mudrocks have the capacity to attenuate leachate. The
effectiveness of the strategy is further confirmed by the fact that even within geological
units of relatively high permeability and supposedly poor attenuation potential, such as
sandstone, and sandy overburden, attenuation processes operate very effectively, and
most pollutants are moderated within a few hundred metres (Christensen et al., 1994b;
Williams, 1999; Ball and Novella, 2003; Butler et al., 2003).
    Natural geological barriers, may be defined as low permeability clay-rich geological
units (hydraulic conductivity <10-5 m/s), which can perform the function of an
attenuating layer, enabling leachate to percolate slowly downwards, simultaneously
undergoing attenuation by biodegradation, sorption, filtration and ion exchange
processes with the clays in the unit (Allen, 2002). Extremely low permeability geological
units (hydraulic conductivity <10-9 m/s) cannot fulfil an attenuation function as they
perform in a similar manner to artificial or natural lining systems providing almost
complete containment of all emissions. Similarly, geological units with higher
permeability (hydraulic conductivity >10-5 m/s) do not provide sufficient confinement to
leachate and are thus unsuitable for attenuation. The optimum permeability for
attenuation is in the order of 10-6 to 10-8 m/s.
    It is also recognized that the rate of degradation of waste materials can be enhanced
by maximizing the flow of rainwater into the landfill leading to dilution of the leachate
produced from the waste. Degradation of waste follows a well-documented path, with
production of both leachate and biogas which vary in composition as degradation
progresses. Waste with a high proportion of organics will produce significant quantities
of leachate even under moisture-deficient conditions (see case study in Box 24.3), due to
solubilization of organics by microbiological and biochemical processes. Rates of
degradation are promoted by a steady flow of water through the waste, which also results
in production of greater quantities of leachate but of a more dilute, less toxic nature.
    The fundamental assumption of the attenuation strategy is that the underlying geology
is able to moderate contaminant concentrations derived from landfill leachate to
acceptable levels prior to groundwater discharge in a stream or water source (e.g. well or
spring). However, not all geological units are able to fulfil this function, so a site
selection protocol that includes an assessment of proximity to drinking-water wells, as
described in Chapter 24.2, is an essential prerequisite to the adoption of an attenuation
strategy. The attenuation mechanism may still be operated in unfavourable situations if
natural clay or peat material is imported and installed as a liner to improve hydraulic
conductivities and attenuation potential and if leachate migration is controlled.
Nevertheless in certain types of terrain, such as karstified limestone, where groundwater
flow occurs primarily along secondary fissures (i.e. non-intergranular flow) and
attenuation of contaminants is limited, rapid and severe pollution of groundwater can
result (Edworthy, 1989) and the attenuation strategy should be avoided.
    Even in favourable geological situations, leachate migration should be controlled and
monitored. Control measures include leachate collection and recirculation systems in
order to prevent shock loading of the receiving environment. Location of monitoring
wells needs to be based on detailed hydrogeological investigations or incipient
groundwater pollution may be missed due, in part, to the limited predictability of
groundwater flow from waste deposits (Chapter 12.2.3). Drainage, storage and
                 Waste disposal and landfill: Control and protection                     643

recirculation of leachate prevent build up of leachate head as a guard against shock
loading of the attenuation medium. The dilute nature of the leachate allows inexpensive
treatment options by reedbeds or peat beds where leachate production is excessive.
    A key attraction of an attenuation strategy is avoidance of the excessive costs of
containment landfills that are untenable for many countries. It also avoids the long-term
costs for maintenance and aftercare monitoring, which may be required for containment
landfills for decades or even centuries after the site has ceased operating, as long as the
waste remains active (Mather, 1995). Apart from a drainage system and containment
ponds to control the leachate head in order to prevent shock loading of the attenuating
medium and a monitoring programme, attenuation landfills have little attendant costs.
The key constraint of the attenuation strategy, however, is the uncertain but genuine risk
of groundwater pollution by leachate if attenuation proves less effective than assumed
when selecting the site or if the site is not adequately managed (e.g. with respect to
drainage measures).

24.3.3 Choice of strategy
Choice of strategy is likely to differ for upgrading existing landfills, remediating historic
ones threatening a groundwater resource and for planning new ones. In choosing a
suitable strategy for landfilling, with protection of groundwater for use as drinking-water
a high priority, the following should be borne in mind:
     • Every case is unique both with respect to natural hydrogeological conditions,
         land use and socioeconomic requirements, and the option chosen should be the
         most appropriate for the specific situation.
     • The choice of site needs to be based on a detailed site selection process and needs
         to undergo a rigorous geotechnical investigation programme including
         hydrogeological surveys and delineation of the attenuation potential of the
         underlying geology (see also Chapters 8 and 14). Regardless of whether the
         chosen landfill management strategy is containment or attenuation, the
         underlying geology should have the potential to act as a groundwater protection
         barrier.
     • The merits of containment with probable delays in stabilization of the waste to an
         inert state for many decades must be balanced against an attenuation strategy that
         seeks to degrade and stabilize waste in the shortest time possible.
     • In balancing the economics of the containment strategy against that of attenuation
         landfills it is essential to include the costs of all ancillary elements required for
         each management option, and maintenance and monitoring costs after closure.
    In many countries legislation now requires containment as well as collection and
treatment of all leachate produced in the landfill. The rationale for this is protecting
groundwater not only for drinking-water abstraction but also for environmental
objectives, including the protection of soil and groundwater ecosystems in proximity to a
landfill. The NA strategy, however, explicitly accepts environmental impact within some
distance downstream of the landfill, in which no drinking-water abstraction would occur.
    Economic constraints often limit the feasibility of technical options, particularly in
developing countries. The preface of Botswana’s Guidelines for the Disposal of Waste
by Landfill highlights approaches towards incremental improvements (see Box 24.4).
644                         Protecting Groundwater for Health

            Box 24.4 Extract from the Preface to the Guidelines for the Disposal of
                     Waste by Landfill, Republic of Botswana, 1997
      “The principal method of waste disposal in Botswana is by land burial. The
      uncontrolled burial of waste however can lead to serious groundwater pollution
      problems. For a country almost totally reliant on its already scarce groundwater
      resources, it is important that the standards of waste disposal by landfill are
      sufficiently improved to minimize the risk of pollution to water resources, and
      furthermore to public health and the degradation of natural resources. Water is a
      public commodity, and it is not ours to pollute as we wish. Due to the regional
      characteristics of water, any actions by users or polluters of a water source will
      affect other ‘innocent’ people downstream of that source. Legislation is being
      drafted which will require all landfill sites (as well as all waste facilities,
      transporters and even generators) to be licensed. In this respect it is essential that
      the licensing authority has guidelines on which to base their licensing decisions
      and the specific licensing conditions which they are to impose on each
      individual facility.
      “The underlying philosophy and guiding principles used in drawing up the
      guidelines are that they should be:
      -   regionally compatible – to avoid the situation where Botswana could
          become a dumping ground for the southern African region, merely because
          it has lower environmental standards than neighbouring countries;
      -   specific to Botswana – to incorporate the specific social, cultural, economic
          and political criteria within Botswana;
      -   affordable without compromising on risk – to provide optimum protection
          of water resources.
      “Because of its sparse population, the predominance of small villages in the
      country, and being a largely arid country, a degree of flexibility is needed in
      specifying requirements. A system of graded standards has therefore been
      introduced where the requirements could be adjusted up or down according to
      the risk imposed. Graded standards, an innovation developed and used
      extensively by the authors of the South African minimum requirements for
      landfills, are applied to different categories of landfill site (categorized
      according to its risk of pollution) as defined by the type and quantity of wastes
      to be landfilled.
      “In this way the standards for landfilling of waste can be improved without
      incurring excessive development and operation costs, and without subjecting the
      community to an unacceptable risk.
      “These guidelines are practical and specific to Botswana yet regionally
      compatible, and should be widely used by waste management practitioners.
      They should be seen as a dynamic set of requirements which will change with
      time to reflect the latest in relevant landfill technology as the results of world-
      wide landfill research dictates”.
                  Waste disposal and landfill: Control and protection                     645

    The challenge is to choose approaches that are viable in the longer term even if they
do not immediately meet optimal technical standards. Graded standards for landfill are an
innovation towards this aim. In South Africa, for example, minimum requirements for
landfills vary according to different categories of landfill sites that are defined by the type
and the quantity of wastes that are disposed by landfill. The Gaza case study (Box 24.3)
demonstrates that locally adapted solutions may be very effective. It also shows that
careful planning, taking into account the uncertainties when extrapolating experience
gained in different types of settings, can lead to viable options at rather low costs.
    Maintenance of an inventory of all waste disposal sites including those no longer in
operation is critical since the risks posed by the landfill to the quality of local
groundwater remain for decades. Where poorly sited, designed or constructed landfills or
informal dumps are identified as hazard, an approach to remediation is to discontinue
their use, cover them and, where necessary, monitor downstream groundwater quality.
    Strategies for landfill sites (including historic sites and informal dumps) that
are polluting or threatening aquifers used as drinking-water source include
engineered barriers to leachate migration such as cut-off walls or trenches. A
further option is to install defence wells to abstract leachate with high pollutant
concentrations before the leachate plume reaches the drinking-water well. In some
cases, particularly where there is evidence that hazardous wastes are leaching
towards a drinking-water abstraction point, digging away and relocating the waste
to a more adequately designed and managed landfill may be necessary. However,
due to their high costs, these measures may not be economically feasible in all
situations and relocating drinking-water abstraction wells may also be an
alternative option.


24.4       OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF LANDFILLS
Regardless of the choice of strategy, controlling the operation of landfills is important to
prevent groundwater contamination. Depending on the type of landfill and the type of
waste, specific operational requirements may be set out in the license and operational
controls need to enforce these. It may be effective to define these requirements in a
management plan jointly developed by the water supplier(s) together with the other
stakeholders and the surveillance authorities involved.
    A key operational control is to monitor, record and document the composition and
amount of waste delivered to the landfill (e.g. through inspecting and weighing waste
trucks entering the landfill) and to turn deliverers away if the waste does not meet
specifications. Documentation should include the origin and composition of the waste,
and potential hazard classification. Random sampling is important for enforcing
compliance with license requirements, and its approximate frequency would be defined
in the management plan. Furthermore, documentation of where specific types or batches
of wastes within the landfill are deposited may help trace the origin of particularly
problematic leachate plumes detected by monitoring and thus enable targeted
remediation.
    Operational activities include landfill development. In containment landfills with a
cellular structure, preparation and lining of future cells will necessarily occur. Whilst an
646                        Protecting Groundwater for Health

active cell is operational, capping of recently active cells that have received their quota of
waste will also be conducted. It is helpful to specify the lining and capping requirements
and all other engineering systems to be installed in the license issued for the landfill, and
to further detail them in the management plan. Licenses will also specify the height to
which waste can be accumulated as well as the final profile of the capped landfill. On the
basis of projected tonnages of waste to be deposited, the date of decommissioning of the
landfill can be estimated. Daily operation of landfills may include the application of
cover at the end of each working day for hygienic reasons in order to reduce wind blow
and accessibility for flies, birds and vermin.
    Drainage of leachate is important to reduce the hydraulic head of leachate, as this
promotes leakage through artificial liners and can also lead to increased leachate
migration rates through a clay liner. Accumulated leachate needs to be drained to a lined
leachate pond from where it may be either tankered to a leachate or wastewater treatment
facility or recirculated through the landfill to promote degradation of the waste.
Depending on the type of waste deposited and ensuing leachate composition, treatment
approaches range from wastewater lagoons to highly sophisticated methods such as
reverse osmosis.
    Regular maintenance of technical installations, e.g. leachate drainage systems, caps
and barriers, is important to ensure that such technical controls are functioning. Operatio-
nal monitoring is critical both for technical systems and for the implementation of
management plans (see examples in Table 24.1), and they should therefore include a
description of the operational monitoring to be conducted for each control measure.
    Periodic monitoring of groundwater quality using a system of wells located both
upstream and downstream of a landfill site is normally a license requirement for highly
regulated landfills. It is particularly important for landfills based on the attenuation
strategy. Monitoring will focus on indicator and bulk parameters such as conductivity
and organic carbon, but may also include the hazardous components such as adsorbable
organic halogen compounds and metals. Exceeding of threshold values may trigger
actions such as closing and capping cells in a landfill, improving containment of new
cells or establishing defence wells as outlined above.


24.5       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND EDUCATION
Public involvement, based on the communication of the relationship between waste
disposal, groundwater and health, is important in two ways: health concerns often drive
opposition to establishing waste treatment facilities or landfills, and the lack of
understanding of health and groundwater concerns, particularly for hazardous wastes, is
often a cause for careless, informal waste dumping.
    Public participation in the selection of sites for landfill and waste treatment facilities
can help to overcome the not in my back yard syndrome. Comprehensive dissemination
of information about the plans, including the type and amount of waste envisaged as well
as the intended measures to protect drinking-water resources and the environment, is the
basis for public participation. This best commences at the outset of the selection process
when the public is informed as to local/regional landfill site requirements in the context
of the overall waste management strategy for the region. Public meetings would then
                 Waste disposal and landfill: Control and protection                    647

follow at various stages in the selection procedure, with details of the selection process
explained, concerns allayed and questions answered. In some countries, public
participation in the management of landfills is encouraged. Consultative committees
composed of local community representatives and the landfill managers serve to improve
public perception of landfills and promote trust between the local community and landfill
operators. They may also allay suspicion and fears over health and environmental issues
as well as act as a conduit for information and concerns to be passed among stakeholders.
    A widespread public understanding of groundwater protection issues is the
prerequisite for avoidance strategies that require waste separation at the household level.
Examples for this are campaigns to promote proper disposal and recycling of hazardous
wastes such as batteries, motor oil, paints and solvents, or returning unused
pharmaceuticals to the pharmacy. The development of an awareness of the potential of
hazardous substances to contaminate groundwater-fed drinking-water supply may be
particularly important for communities with much small-scale enterprise where they rely
on shallow groundwater (see also Chapter 23). Public participation based on an
understanding of contamination pathways from wastes to wells may also be important in
making relocation decisions, i.e. to either move a waste dump or nearby wells if the
distance between them has proven unsafe.
    In various countries public participation is promoted by media advertising and by
education campaigns, particularly of children at the earliest levels of schooling.
Education is the key to changing public attitudes towards waste issues.


24.6       MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF MEASURES
           CONTROLLING WASTE DISPOSAL AND LANDFILL
The protection and control measures for waste disposal in drinking-water catchments
proposed above range from planning tools in the context of broader environmental policy
to specific technical measures such as containing a landfill, managing leachate or
constructing defence wells and trenches where leachate is threatening an aquifer. Selec-
ted examples are summarized in Table 24.1. Among these, planning and choice of site
are particularly critical for waste disposal. This includes fundamental decisions on the
disposal strategy with implications for operational controls. In some settings, some of
these control measures may be suitable for integration into the WSP of a drinking-water
supply (Chapter 16) and become subject to operational monitoring in the context of such
a plan.
    Monitoring of the measures implemented is crucial to ensure that they are in place
and effective. Table 24.1 therefore includes options for surveillance and monitoring of
the protection and control measure examples given. Most of these focus on checking
whether the controls are operating as intended rather than on contaminant concentrations
in groundwater. For planning, surveillance will begin with reviewing permits, the
applications for which should not only demonstrate how aquifer vulnerability has been
taken into account, but also how the landfill will be designed. If the strategy is controlled
attenuation, review of the information base for assessing and predicting leachate
migration will be particularly important. Where containment is intended, review of the
application will address the choice of liner technology and leachate management. As
648                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

waste deposits have long-term implications for groundwater, the review of applications
for permits will also consider future land use and development planning in relation to
groundwater demands. As landfill is a highly emotive issue in many cultures, reviewing
applications for permits may take this into account by addressing whether and how
planning has been based on public consultation and participation.


   NOTE X            The implementation of control measures such as those suggested in
                     Table 24.1 is effectively supported if the stakeholders involved in
                     waste disposal collaboratively develop management plans that
                     define the control measures and how their performance is
                     monitored, which corrective action should be taken both during
                     normal operations and during incident conditions, responsibilities,
                     lines of communication as well as documentation procedures.
                     The implementation of control measures protecting drinking-water
                     aquifers from waste disposal and landfill is substantially facilitated
                     by an environmental policy framework (see Chapter 20).


    For protection and control measures addressing design and construction, the first step
in surveillance is to assess whether or not they are adequate for achieving the protection
target, and whether or not they are in place as indicated in the construction plan. For
landfills based on attenuation, construction controls will be few but controlling design
may be important (e.g. for ensuring that protective layers of overburden are maintained
or introduced as planned). For contained landfills, monitoring the quality of the liner and
particularly its installation will be important. Documentation of the design and structure
of the landfill, as well as of the criteria upon which planning decisions were based, is
particularly important as it provides a basis for future situation assessment.
    For the day-to-day routine operation of landfills, monitoring focuses on whether the
amounts and type of waste deposited are in compliance with the permit (see Table 24.1).
Such monitoring can include random sampling of waste delivered by trucks and
checking accompanying documents. Further important operational controls include but
are not restricted to leachate drainage and recycling or treatment as well as operation of
defence wells or trenches where these are needed.


   NOTE X            Options for monitoring suggested in Table 24.1 include monitoring
                     downstream groundwater for selected indicators of leachate
                     migration.
                     Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are a
                     supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of providing
                     verification of the efficacy of the overall drinking-water catchment
                     management.

   In addition to surveillance and monitoring of the functioning of control
measures, groundwater monitoring serves to verify the whole drinking-water
catchment management concept comprehensively. For waste disposal,
groundwater monitoring is also a measure to control whether natural attenuation is
performing as anticipated, whether leachate migration is within the area expected,
and whether containments are leaking. It typically focuses on indicator and bulk
parameters and in some situations will address specific substances of concern.

Traffic and transport: Control and
protection
A. Golwer




The most frequently occurring groundwater contaminants from traffic and transport are
de-icing agents, particularly salt, fuel, including fuel additives, and some persistent
herbicides e.g. atrazine. The issues are, therefore, less related directly to health than to
drinking-water acceptability, except in specific local circumstances where a spill due to
an accident can lead to a substance draining into an area vulnerable to groundwater
contamination.
    A number of approaches and control measures can be used to minimize pollution of
aquifers with hazardous substances originating from traffic and transport related
activities. These include proper planning of new transport links and routes, protective
structures and containments, control of construction works, technical improvement of
vehicles, impact assessment of substances used in transportation systems (such as de-
icing agents or fuel additives), improved management of maintenance activities,
regulation of the transport of hazardous goods through drinking-water catchments, rapid
response to accidents involving spills of hazardous substances and treatment of traffic
surface run-off prior to discharge. Monitoring programmes are important for determining
the success of such prevention measures.
    The existence of strategies and policies for protecting the environment from traffic
and transport-related emissions facilitates the development and implementation of

specific control measures to protect a drinking-water catchment. While their
development and implementation may be initiated by the water supply or the public
authority responsible for its safety, establishing effective control measures to protect
groundwater usually requires intersectoral collaboration. This includes changes in public
awareness and transport policies as well as training of people employed in the traffic
sector. Successful implementation of strategies for the protection of groundwater
resources may require a combination of education, fiscal, regulatory and supply-
orientated measures (see also Chapter 20). Economic incentives can also contribute
towards improving traffic behaviour or reducing the use of environmentally harmful
types of traffic.
    As with other potentially polluting human activities, giving priority to the prevention
of groundwater contamination avoids the need for subsequent measures to reduce or
remediate groundwater pollution, which is usually much more difficult and expensive.
Where necessary precautionary measures are not immediately economically feasible,
incremental improvement towards long-term targets should be envisaged, particularly
through taking aquifer vulnerability into account when planning new transport systems
or expanding existing ones.
    As discussed in Chapter 13, situation assessment will collect information on the
existing traffic and transport related infrastructure together with data on its proximity to
groundwater systems and designated groundwater protection zones in order to assess
pollution potential of aquifers. While many protection zone concepts seek to avoid traffic
systems in the inner protection zone (i.e. close to abstraction points), they may be
tolerated in the outer area of protection zones, though under the prerequisite of locally
appropriate, largely constructional measures of protection.


   NOTE X            In developing a Water Safety Plan (Chapter 16), system assessment
                     would review the efficacy of control measures and management
                     plans for protecting groundwater in the drinking-water catchment
                     from traffic and transport. Chapter 13 provides the background
                     information about the potential impact of traffic and transport and
                     provides guidance on the information needed to analyse these
                     hazards.
                     This chapter introduces options for controlling risks from traffic and
                     transport. As the responsibility for these activities usually falls
                     outside that of drinking-water suppliers, close collaboration of the
                     stakeholders involved, including the authorities responsible traffic
                     and transport, is important to implement, upgrade and monitor
                     these control measures. This may be initiated by the drinking-water
                     sector, e.g. in the context of developing a Water Safety Plan or of
                     designating protection zones (see Chapter 17).

25.1       PLANNING AND REGULATIONS
Planning is particularly important in vulnerable groundwater catchments in order to limit
or restrict construction of traffic facilities or to provide robust defences against pollutants
entering the groundwater systems. For existing traffic lines, this may result in upgrading
protective structures as well as in operational changes such as directing transports of
hazardous goods to other routes (e.g. outside of the drinking-water catchment or
protection zone). In planning the construction of new or extended traffic routes and
facilities, the appropriate traffic system and route should be evaluated with respect to
groundwater protection requirements. In some cases the construction of new traffic
routes might be dispensed with through the improved utilization of existing routes.
Aquifer protection may be an important criterion for decisions on the allocation of
investments to railway versus road transport.
    Requiring permits for the construction of traffic infrastructure may be an effective
planning tool to assess plans for their impact on drinking-water and thus for the
protection of human health. In this context, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA;
see Chapter 20) of the proposed facilities and any alternatives provide a valuable basis
for decisions. These include an assessment of the vulnerability of the aquifer to
substances potentially emitted from the traffic lines intended and transport-related
accumulation of hazardous substances with the potential to contaminate groundwater.
Designing traffic infrastructure to include adequate drainage and disposal of drainage as
well as less polluting maintenance procedures is easiest and least costly if included
already in the planning stage. Management plans which restrict traffic or investment into
protective structures may be more easily enforced if the drinking-water catchment or its
most vulnerable areas are designated protection zones (see Chapter 17).
    Frequently, not only transport activities themselves, but also the temporary
construction areas associated with transport infrastructure pose a significant (though short
term) risk themselves (see Chapter 13) and thus should be included in such impact
assessments. Where soil and rock are to be removed, care should be taken to ensure this
will not remove valuable protective layers to aquifer systems, or that dams created
through construction unexpectedly affect flow paths to the groundwater. Management
plans for the construction activity may be effective to define sufficiently protective
procedures, and surveillance, e.g. through inspection of construction sites, is often critical
for their implementation.
    Regulatory requirements such as EIAs facilitate the selection of alternative routes and
construction methods. Guidelines can be supplied for different construction activities as
well as for raising awareness for pollution prevention. In many countries, numerous
technical regulations at both a regional and a national level already exist which govern
the construction and drainage of traffic routes and also – at least partly – take account of
groundwater protection. An example directly addressing groundwater protection are the
Guidelines for road construction measures and for existing roads in drinking-water
protection areas in Germany (FGSV, 2002). Regulatory approaches have induced
behavioural changes in some countries, e.g. safe disposal of motor oil and restriction of
car washing to contained sites at service stations.
656                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

    A further important regulatory and planning approach is the development of accident
response plans, particularly for transport of hazardous goods, but also for fuel spills
caused by accidents, as rapid clean-up can prevent or substantially reduce groundwater
contamination. To be effective, such response plans need to be tailored for the respective
setting. Further, it is important to train the response with the parties that need to react
quickly in the case of a spill or accident.
    A number of international regulations target reducing the environmental impact of
transport, and their improved coordination and harmonization facilitates implementation
of many measures. For example, the construction and operation of airports is regulated
internationally (ICAO, 2000).


25.2      RUNOFF CONTROL
Whether or not collection and treatment of run-off from roads and other surfaces
potentially contaminated by transport and traffic is necessary, depends both on the
amount of traffic and on aquifer vulnerability and use. In rural areas, scattered run-off
from low density traffic routes can percolate over a wide area, and the impact on
groundwater quality is frequently regarded as harmless or tolerable if, outside of water
protection areas, percolation occurs through a vegetation-covered area with an
unsaturated zone at least 1 m thick.
    In contrast, roads in built-up areas, as well as aircraft manoeuvring areas and airport
aprons, are frequently connected to a drainage system. From less polluted roads this may
be directed into a separate storm sewer system, not connected to the foul sewer system,
and discharged into a receiving water body. Treatment is often not necessary or may be
limited to retention basins (Figure 25.1) which settle some of the particulate load. These
are best constructed at least 2 m deep in order to allow evenly distributed through-flow to
avoid resuspension through turbulence. Where necessary because of aquifer
vulnerability, they need to be impermeable to the underground. Retention basins may
also be equipped with a vertical barrier to skim off low-density liquids such as fuels that
float as upper layer on the run-off which need to be removed immediately after the
pollution event. Removal of solids settled to the bottom, inspection and maintenance
should occur at regular intervals and after events such as storms, extended periods of
drought or frost and after accidents leading to loading of fuel and oil to the basin.
Management plans are useful to define these maintenance activities, including the time
intervals and responsibilities for their performance.
    For collected run-off from very busy roads (average daily traffic volume >15 000
vehicles) treatment may be a necessary control measure before percolation to
groundwater or discharge into surface waters, through mechanical separation as shown in
Figure 25.1, through further steps such as percolation through artificial wetlands, or even
by retention in larger basins and eventual discharge to a sewage treatment plant. The
scale of treatment required for road run-off is determined by the hazard posed. Indeed, as
the pollutant load and water volume can vary considerably over time, designing
treatment to cope with the variable loading and volumes may be both difficult and
expensive.

   In some areas, road drainage systems may be connected directly into a sewage
system, and the run-off can then be treated together with domestic and industrial waste
water. While this is desirable in principle, combined collection of road drainage with
sewage also poses problems. Elements of traffic-specific substances – for example,
heavy metals – may enrich the sewage sludge and thus compromise sludge reuse and
even cause problems for its disposal. Furthermore, during heavy rainfall events,
combined sewerage systems can deliver huge volumes of run-off over short periods.
Where storage volume is insufficient, this may swamp the treatment process, overflow
into recipient water-bodies without treatment, or even place raw sewerage on streets and
other areas. Therefore, planning for construction or upgrading of systems directing run-
off to sewage treatment plants must include these considerations when calculating the
dimensions necessary, particularly for retention basins.

25.3       DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE OF PROTECTIVE
           STRUCTURES
The appropriate design for pollution prevention structures is best selected following a
pollution risk assessment that considers both the type of traffic and the vulnerability of
any aquifers in the vicinity. Legislation requiring protective structures in specified
settings exists in many countries, often in combination with good practice codes or
engineering guidelines (see e.g. DEFRA (2002) for the United Kingdom or FGSV
(2002) for Germany). Typical pollution prevention designs incorporate the use of
double-skinned tanks for fuel storage, bunding (i.e. containing) of above-ground storage
facilities, adequate monitoring facilities in above and below-ground storage facilities (e.g.
observation boreholes in tankpits, leak detection mechanisms in double-skinned tanks,
pressure sensors in delivery infrastructure), overfill prevention systems, tanker stand
areas with drainage capturing spills during delivery.
    These engineered pollution prevention systems are effective only in combination with
procedures for site operations, preferably described in a management plan and subjected
658                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

to regular surveillance or audit. Regardless of the presence of pollution prevention
structures, early detection of contaminant release is critical in protecting groundwater.
This requires adequate training of operational staff to ensure that monitoring procedures
are followed correctly, including regular (at least weekly) monitoring of volumes of
stored fuels and other wetstock (at the most simple level, regularly conducting an audit of
fuel delivered versus fuel supplied). It also requires developing staff awareness of, and
interest in, the nature of plumbing and tank corrosion.
    Where drainage and pollution preventing structures exist, it is essential that they be
maintained in an optimum condition. For example, oil traps must be kept free of grit and
other particles, otherwise they will overflow and fail in their protective capacity.
Containments to prevent groundwater contamination (e.g. for fuel tanks) need to be
inspected regularly to ensure integrity. Management plans would include regular
maintenance programmes and operational monitoring to ensure such structures and
treatment facilities are kept functional. Inspections of conditions downstream of outfalls
are also recommended as part of a maintenance programme to ensure any adverse
impacts are noted and dealt with on a timely basis. Improving the maintenance of roads,
rail-track systems and airport operational areas forms part of effective control measures.
The positive effects of road cleaning and major factors influencing cleaning efficiency
were demonstrated by early investigation (Sartor and Boyd, 1972; Shaheen, 1975).


25.4      MINIMIZING USAGE OF HARMFUL CHEMICALS
Minimizing the amounts of chemicals used in maintenance of transport routes is an
obvious method of reducing pollution potential. Management plans should be developed
and applied to address applications of such chemicals. Subjecting the plans to regular
audit helps ensure that they are implemented correctly. Restrictions on the use of
particular chemicals in catchment areas will also aid in reducing pollution. For example,
in the United Kingdom, following serious pollution of run-off from some stretches of
railway lines with atrazine, the use of a different weed control method was adopted for
designated sections of track in drinking-water catchment areas, resulting in a decrease in
the levels of pesticide detected. The use of leaf and soil herbicides with quickly-
degradable active substances, potentially within the framework of integrated vegetation
control, represents an improvement in protective measures as compared with the current,
largely preventative application of herbicides. A further example is the replacement of
nitrogenous by non-nitrogenous de-icing agents on airfields.
    Developments to reduce the health hazards from transport-related substances in
groundwater include use of alternative chemicals less likely to pollute groundwater,
environmentally more compatible fuels, mechanical (instead of chemical) snow, ice and
weed clearance; these may all contribute to a coordinated pollution minimization policy.
Groundwater pollution from air fields can be reduced by safer refuelling of aircrafts as
well as switching fertilization of air-field lawns with highly soluble nitrogen compounds
to controlled-release fertilizers, or by using more readily biodegradable pest control
agents used against e.g. field voles (a burrowing rodent which needs to be controlled to
reduce damage to air strips).

   Regulating the nature, type and availability of maintenance materials can also aid in
reducing pollution. Checklists of suitable alternatives can be provided to operators and
local authorities to inform them of the benefits of their use over traditional substances
known to cause pollution. Legislation banning the production, import or use of heavily
polluting materials can be effective in avoiding the pollution they would otherwise cause.


25.5       ACCIDENTAL SPILLAGE AND DISPOSAL
A major pollution risk associated with traffic is spillage caused by accidents. Particularly
in drinking-water catchments, the risk of accidents on roads can be lowered through
technical measures (such as crash barriers, concrete skidding-walls, ramparts) and traffic-
regulation measures (speed limits, overtaking bans, prohibition or restriction of vehicles
with loads hazardous to water) (FGSV, 2002). National legislation banning the use and
transport of specific hazardous substances or banning their transport on roads,
particularly near vulnerable aquifers or in protection zones, can be an effective measure
to prevent accidental pollution. Where this is not possible, issuing permits is an important
control measure. They should take full account of the nature of the potential pollutant and
detail emergency procedures. Where permits for the transport of hazardous goods are
granted, emergency response plans to deal with accidents are important. These need to
take into account that for some spills, the clean up chemicals used and subsequent
washing of surfaces can introduce additional pollutants and aid in the spread of these.
    Leaks from fuel storage tanks and pipelines are frequent sources of pollution. Such
infrastructure should be subject to regular inspections and testing programmes. Even
simple physical structures such as bunded fuel tanks (i.e. placing them inside a structure
that can contain the tank’s volume should it leak) can provide a significant reduction in
pollution risk.
    Groundwater pollution with hazardous substances from filling stations, fuel or waste
transfer depots can be controlled by adequate design minimizing the risk of spillage and,
if spillage should occur, accident response plans should be in place to allow rapid
recovery of the spilt materials. If the facility is in the catchment of a public supply source,
the responsible water authority should be informed and immediate remediation and
control measures carried out, taking account of local conditions and the characteristics of
the hazardous substance. These may include temporary closure of drinking-water
abstraction to minimize drawing the pollutant into the aquifer, the construction of
scavenger wells to remove the pollutant, or the diversion of the pollution through
infiltration measures, thus producing a hydraulic barrier.


25.6       MONITORING AND VERIFICATION OF MEASURES
           CONTROLLING TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORT
The approaches to controlling traffic and transport in drinking-water catchments
proposed above range from planning tools in the context of broader environmental traffic
policy to specific technical measures such as structures, containments or the restriction of
chemicals used in maintenance of traffic facilities. They also include process controls to
check if transport facilities are operated properly in order to avoid contamination of
660                       Protecting Groundwater for Health

drinking-water catchments. The most important measures are summarized in Table 25.1.
In some settings, some of these measures may be suitable for integration into the WSP
(see Chapter 16) of a drinking-water supply and become subject to operational
monitoring in the context of such a plan.


   NOTE X            The implementation of control measures such as those suggested in
                     Table 25.1 is effectively supported if the stakeholders involved
                     collaboratively develop management plans that define the control
                     measures and how their performance is monitored, which corrective
                     action should be taken both during normal operations and during
                     incident conditions, responsibilities, lines of communication as well
                     as documentation procedures.
                     The implementation of control measures protecting drinking-water
                     aquifers from traffic and transport is substantially facilitated by an
                     environmental policy framework (see Chapter 20).


    In all settings, monitoring of the measures implemented is crucial to ensure that they
are in place and effective. Table 25.1 includes options for surveillance and monitoring of
the protection and control measure examples given. Most of these focus on checking
whether the controls are operating as intended, rather than on contaminant concentrations
in groundwater. For planning, surveillance will address whether plans exist, are
appropriate and are being implemented, particularly in the context of issuing permits for
traffic and transport infrastructure. Auditing of plans is an effective tool for such
surveillance. Similarly, for measures addressing design and construction, the first
verification step is to assess whether or not they are adequate for achieving the protection
target, and whether or not they are in place as indicated in the construction plan. For the
routine operation of controls, monitoring focuses on assessing whether they are
functioning correctly, e.g. whether containments are leaking or whether restrictions on
transport of hazardous goods through a catchment are being enforced (see Table 25.1).


      NOTE X          Options for monitoring suggested in Table 25.1 rarely include
                      regular groundwater quality monitoring. Where containments and
                      protective structures are poorly accessible for inspection of their
                      integrity, however, monitoring of selected indicator parameters in
                      groundwater may be needed to detect leakage.
                      Comprehensive groundwater quality monitoring programmes are
                      a supplementary aspect of monitoring with the purpose of
                      providing verification of the efficacy of the overall drinking-water
                      catchment management.

    Some protection measures are difficult to monitor directly, e.g. integrity of a
subterranean fuel road drainage pipes, and may most effectively be monitored by some
parameter analysed in groundwater that would most sensitively indicate leakage (e.g.
chloride, conductivity or in some settings, simply changes in water-table). Intensified
monitoring of specific contaminants in groundwater may serve as a control measure after
transport accidents involving hazardous goods or fuel spillage. Also, in drinking-water
catchments with a potential for pollution by traffic and transport, overall verification of
the catchment management concept would include monitoring of specific transport-
related contaminants anticipated or known to occur.
