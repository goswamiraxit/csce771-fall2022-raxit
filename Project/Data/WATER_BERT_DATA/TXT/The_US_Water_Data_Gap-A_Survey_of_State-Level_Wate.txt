                and error measurements through the models is often limited by this lack of data. The risk of biased conclu-
                sions is therefore not uncommon, and these issues are only exacerbated when attempting projections and
                forecasts.
                Water data challenges extend beyond academia. Reliable data are central to the design and evaluation of
                public sector decisions (Gallaher & Heikkila, 1990; Laituri & Sternlieb, 2006). This is especially the case
                for the development and implementation of sustainable water management strategies (High Level Panel on
                Water, 2017). To accurately describe and predict both supply and demand requires the following: hydrolog-
                ical and hydrogeological data to understand the physical system; climatic data to quantify weather impacts
                on availability and use; and industrial, agricultural, energetic, and socioeconomic data to evaluate demands
                and responses. Thus, the challenge extends beyond the question of water allocation to questions of finances,
                infrastructure, and health associated with water security and climate variability, such as size of dams and
                reservoirs, design of water treatment plants, and set water rates. The World Economic Forum has cited water
                risk as a critical concern for businesses. Hence, the corporate sector is similarly dependent on water data
                to assess production, demand, and competition potential; establish resilient supply chains; and evaluate
                climatic risks and investments in water and other infrastructure. Water information is also useful for indi-
                viduals, whether it is used to adapt their direct use of water, make informed decisions regarding the water
                footprint of their usage patterns, or assess water quality concerns and the associated health risk.
                1.1. U.S. Water Data at the Federal Level
                Renewed attention has been placed on the state of water data in the United States, as information is key
                to “fix water” (Fishman, 2016; Jerome, 2006). In the absence of data and rigorous analysis to establish the
                current state of the system, we do not know exactly what these issues are. The state of water use data in the
                United States has been referred to as primitive (Fishman, 2016; Jerome, 2006). Comprehensive nationwide
                water use estimates (Dieter et al., 2017; Maupin et al., 2017) are only produced every 5 years with their
                publication typically delayed; 2015 estimates for the public and domestic sectors were released in November
                2017 (Dieter & Maupin, 2011) and for other sectors in June 2018 (Dieter et al., 2017), meaning that until
                then only 2010 estimates (Maupin et al., 2017) were available on which to base any sector-specific analysis.
                Estimates are produced at the county scale, a rather coarse resolution in particular in the more arid western
                states, where counties have large land area, and as annual averages, making it impossible to quantify crucial
                seasonal cycles.
                Besides issues regarding the temporal and spatial scales of the measurements and the lag in their avail-
                ability, water use estimates are prone to uncertainty, not only because of the difficulty in defining them
                (Ruddell, 2015) but also from measurement and reporting errors. In a recent analysis of the water data for
                thermoelectric plants, Harris and Diehl (2019) highlight discrepancies between U.S. Energy Information
                Administration data, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data, and USGS models on the order of 23% for the
                United States, though that sector's water use is arguably the easiest to estimate with few users and strong
                regulation. This cast doubt on our capacity to understand water use patterns and to forecast future water
                demand (Perrone et al., 2017), despite a more pronounced need as water supply fluctuations and periods of
                drought increase.
                Data concerns are not restricted to water use. In 2001, Vörösmarty et al., 2014 described the whole landscape
                of water data as “a new endangered species” due to reduced funding and a decreasing number of gauges.
                With respect to groundwater information, the USGS has proposed new platforms and services (Blodgett et
                al., 2002; Hirsch & Fisher, 2017), but the uneven and limited spatial coverage of gauges (1,559 real-time
                ground water table gauges in 2014; Hirsch & Fisher, 2017) only provides a coarse overview. The spatial issue
                is not only on the latitude-longitude scale: Russo and Lall (2018) note that a lack of deep aquifer data limits
                a robust assessment of signals in water table depth as a function of climate or water use.
                The availability of water quality information is equally troubling. A significant amount of data on chemical
                and biological attributes is collected from surface and ground water bodies, waste water streams, and drink-
                ing water suppliers. For raw water, the USGS operates a National Water Quality Assessment program that
                surveys benchmark sites for assessment (National Research Council, 2002). However, the capacity to assess
                trends in the national performance of regulations related to the Clean Water Act and the Drinking Water Act
                is rather limited. This is in part due to the limited sampling of the attributes and largely due to the quality of
                the relevant databases maintained by the federal agencies. The first national assessment of trends in drink-
                ing water quality (Allaire et al., 2018) was only presented in 2018, using the publicly available data sets from
                the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Information System and separately


JOSSET ET AL.                                                                                                                 434

                available data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau. A major caveat for national drinking water quality infor-
                mation is that violations of Safe Drinking Water Act standards are underreported at the national level. The
                EPA and Government Accountability Office estimate that 26–38% of health-related violations are either not
                reported or inaccurately reported to the national Safe Drinking Water Information System (EPA, 2017; GAO,
                2016). Similarly, regarding information related to Clean Water Act compliance, Sprague et al. (2017) report
                that nearly 58% of the records pertaining to nutrients in surface waters, as reported in the Water Quality
                Portal (WQP) and in records obtained directly from major water-resource agencies in each state, presented
                ambiguous or flawed metadata. These problematic records that represent data collection costs of $6.8 to $19
                billion potentially prevent a secondary use of the data that are, in effect, wasted. Beyond ambiguous meta-
                data, our study found a large fraction of the nutrient data in the WQP were inconsistent at the sample level.
                Our analyses of dissolved oxygen data for surface waters across the United States, as available in the WQP,
                also indicate that 28% of records contain either negative values or values that are physically unfeasible, even
                when accounting for unit conversion uncertainties. This lack of data for water quality was brought forward
                twice by the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, in particular for Alabama (De Albuquerque, 2014; Walton,
                2001), illustrating how dire the situation is.
                The financial dimension of water issues is also of concern. Indeed, improper water quality is often ascribed
                to a lack of funds to address the issue. A national overview of the financial characteristics of water util-
                ities is only available through three Community Water Systems surveys that were conducted in 1995,
                2000, and 2006.
                Individual utilities often use municipal bonds or similar vehicles to generate finances needed for major
                upgrades, expansion of service, and infrastructure renewal. Accordingly, there is limited ability to bench-
                mark performance, raising the costs associated with obtaining private funds. Another challenge associated
                with inadequate benchmarking information is projections of future funding needs, which might be particu-
                larly important as delays in investments, lack of maintenance, and aging may translate in the simultaneous
                expiration of much of the water infrastructure. The Congressional Budget Office in its assessments of
                the need for a federal plan for water infrastructure in 2002 noted that due to the lack of representative
                data from utilities and future economic, regulatory, and technological conditions, their estimates could
                be outside of the estimated range of uncertainty (Beider & Tawil, Office2002). Highlighted by the recent
                Oroville dam issues, lack of data on reservoir levels, use, governance, and their maintenance are equally
                concerning, and though frightening on their own, they are only to be exacerbated in a context of climate
                change (Ho et al., 2017).
                The lack of publicly available water data also impacts Environmental Justice issues. Specific concerns
                include the quality of water services, especially in the rural and poorer areas, and issues of affordability.
                The lack of a national database containing information on water prices and assistance programs at the com-
                munity level prevents the systematic quantification of affordability and forces researchers to perform the
                aggregation of several data sets themselves or having to pay to access partial surveys conducted by the indus-
                try (Mack & Wrase, 2013). With limited or no data on these problems, they become not only unaddressable
                but also invisible (Fishman, 2016).
                In addition to the lack of availability or poor frequency of nationwide data, the information is scattered
                across several institutions. While vast amounts of freshwater resources data are collected and archived by
                local, state, and federal departments and agencies, there is little coordination on how these data are col-
                lected, organized, or stored, leading to discrepancies in estimates (Averyt et al., 2013; National Research
                Council, 2012; Shaffer, 2017). Accordingly, the collection of the information necessary for the construction
                of a national water account required, until recently, the consultation of many websites, as acknowledged
                by the USGS (National Academy of Sciences, 2016). The National Water Information System (NWIS) con-
                solidates data on quantity and quality of surface and ground water in one-spot web interfaces. Though this
                a key advance, it provides limited practicality for aggregated or large-scale analyses and no information on
                water use. In addition, the platform only allows for the selection and download of the data without offering
                further help as to how to interpret it. To avoid the pitfall of considering data a replacement for understand-
                ing and theoretical concepts (Crutchfield, 2016), the simple collection of data is not enough; data sets need
                to be usable and transparent.
                The limitations and advancements of water data federal platforms are very much dependent on the data
                collected by state-level authorities. Indeed, state-level agencies are responsible for the monitoring and
                enforcement of national regulations (e.g., for the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act), as well
                as state-level regulations (e.g., in-stream flows, water rights, allocations, and withdrawals limits). The role

                of the federal agencies, whether regulatory or not, are in great part limited to gathering and presenting
                state-level data sets (National Academy of Sciences, 2016). Motivated by the federal agencies' dependence
                on states to construct their data sets, we conducted a systematic evaluation of water data sets at the state
                level to assess the possibility of filling the federal water data gaps as well as to provide an overview of current
                practices in data centralization and dissemination efforts.
                The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows. We first detail the methodology followed to
                survey data websites at the state level (section 2), before proceeding to the description and analysis of the
                collected results (section 3). We conclude with the potential of addressing the national water data gaps using
                state-level data and present our suggestions for a water data platform at the federal level to inform water
                management, investment, and development for the United States.

                2. State-Level Data Survey Methodology
                A systematic survey of state-level water information was conducted to identify (1) data sets that are present at
                the state level that could be aggregated to augment water information at the national scale and (2) examples
                that could be followed to offer better data visualizations and construct a centralized national water data
                platform. Scientific, public or private analyses of the water sector require many types of information. In
                order to present a more global overview without preferring one objective or one sector, we review any data
                sets that can inform the environmental or anthropic dimension of water.
                2.1. Website Identification and Selection
                The first step of the survey consists of the identification of websites hosting water data at the state level. This
                is performed by systematically exploring the 100 first results in web search engines for “[state name] water
                data” for the 48 conterminous United States. Variations were also attempted to identify specific categories
                of data when no results were found among the 100 first results.
                The identified websites are then explored to extract the specific pages hosting the data sets. Information dis-
                closed within reports are ignored as the format suggests that they contain aggregated or estimated numbers,
                as opposed to primary data. Furthermore, the format prevents direct integration with other models or appli-
                cations. Note that state websites directly associated with a local USGS office are not retained as we attribute
                them to national-level information.
                2.2. Web Page Evaluation
                The selected web pages are then evaluated on data content, analytics presented, and available exploration
                tools, to assess both the raw data and the functionality offered. The process consisted of three steps:
                (1) Hosting institution
                     The identity of the hosting institution is reported and categorized as governmental, academic, civil
                     society, corporate, consortium, or media organizations.
                (2) Content determination
                     A rating of the websites content is performed by identifying which type of data are disclosed, regardless
                     of the completeness, coverage, and frequency of updates of the information. The five categories and their
                     respective subcategories are the following:
                          1. Surface water—combining estimates of discharge and volume for rivers, lakes, and reservoirs
                             and information consigned in surface water permits. Subcategories: gauge location, discharge,
                             reservoir level, permit, and use type.
                          2. Groundwater—focusing on groundwater levels for both observation and use whether recorded
                             through time or consigned in groundwater permit information or well records. Subcategories: well
                             location and depth, water table depth, well record, permit information, and sector of use.
                          3. Water quality—referring equally to chemical and biological in-stream quality data and to post-
                             treatment drinking quality measurements. Subcategories: groundwater quality measurements,
                             surface water quality measurements, and return permits.
                          4. Water use—comprising withdrawals, consumption, and return flows of water. Subcategories:
                             withdrawal volumes, diversion volumes, point of use, sector of use, and return volumes.
                          5. Financial data—considering any expense or price data sets pertaining to water, such as capital
                             or variable costs for extraction, treatment, distribution, and waste collection, or purchase and
                             contract prices.

                 categories and their respective subcategories of data.


                For each category of content listed above, we first assess if analytics are proposed to facilitate the under-
                standing and manipulability of the data, in particular summary statistics, quantification of uncertainty,
                projections, and export capabilities for further analysis. Additionally, we review how the data are disclosed.
                We remark in particular if visualization options are included (graphs and plots) and specifically if maps,
                interactive or not, are offered. The selected websites are rated according to these categories, here again
                without assessing the quality, relevance, and thoroughness of the tools offered but only by identifying the
                presence of these attributes.
                2.3. Disclaimer
                The first limitation of our survey is that we focus only on websites with readily available information. While
                undoubtedly much more information is collected which could be disclosed and used, we limited the scope
                of the present survey, to avoid contacting the responsible agencies or filing a Freedom of Information Act
                request, which constitutes an additional barrier to overcome for a water data user that is sometimes pursued
                by researches and met with mixed results.
                Second, the survey task is difficult due to the great variability from one state to another in definition, content,
                format, vocabulary, and approach to data collection and management. The authors performed the selection
                and classification of the websites to the best of their ability but acknowledge that the process is prone to
                inconsistencies due to inherent variations from one platform to the other.
                Last, the identification and evaluation of the websites were performed over the time period from July to
                October 2017. In addition to the disclosure of the survey results in the supporting information of this paper,
                we have created an online forum to maintain the survey table, keep it up to date, and augment its content
                when websites evolve or if new ones appear.

                3. Results
                The complete list of websites identified following the methodology described above is provided in a table
                in the supporting information. The information aggregated at the state level is presented in Appendix A,
                detailing the scores for each state in each of the five categories. A total of 275 websites were found to have
                data, with a mean number of 5.7 websites per state. The number of sites per state ranges from 0 websites
                with data in Rhode Island or only one website in West Virginia to a maximum of 15 websites in Texas. Note

                that depending on the state's objectives, the number of state-level agencies with water management respon-
                sibilities and the chosen hosting platform, separate websites do not necessarily indicate that more data are
                disclosed by the state. It could, instead, reflect a lack of centralization. Out of the total of 275 websites, 213
                are from governmental organizations, 51 are from academic institutions, 6 are from the civil society, 2 are
                from news organizations, 2 are from consortia of academic and governmental organizations, and 1 is from
                the private sector.
                This breakdown is not surprising. State universities (hosting 19% of the websites) are privileged partners of
                governments for water-related issues and are often mandated by the state to collect and analyze the data, for
                example, for Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, and Kentucky. One should note, however, that the academic insti-
                tutions behind the reviewed websites are not necessarily located in the state for which data are presented;
                for example, the University of North Carolina is the creator and host of water rate dashboards for eight states
                (and six more have been added since the completion of the survey). Civil society websites are from indepen-
                dent organizations such as Alabama Water Watch, California Data Collaborative, or the New York Public
                Interest Research Group. The civil society together with consortia are behind many more data websites, but
                they often follow different boundaries than the state, such as a watershed. The Bear River basin, the Con-
                necticut River, or the North Georgia water associations are examples. In two instances, news organizations
                also provided state overview of water data; the Texas Tribune provides a statewide interactive map of the
                reservoir water levels maintained until hurricane Harvey, while StateImpact Oklahoma provided a snap-
                shot of water rates for the state in 2012 also in the format of an interactive map. These illustrate that current
                water information was deemed relevant to a general audience.
                3.1. Review of the Websites' Content
                We focus only on whether the information is available for a given state and refer to section 3.2 for a review
                of the centralization of the various data sets. Table 1 reports the number of states disclosing information in
                each category and subcategory (the breakdown per state is disclosed in Tables A1 and A2).
                Scores for data content are computed for each state and category (i.e., groundwater, surface water, quality,
                use, and financial) by giving one point for each subcategory of information listed in Table 1 for which one
                or more websites were identified. Scores for data presentation are computed in a similar fashion for the five
                categories for each of the indicators listed in Table 2, that is, summary statistics, uncertainty, projection,
                visualization, interactive map, and export capabilities. The total scores of data content and data presentation
                are plotted in Figure 1. Key external information on water use, climate, and water quality are reported in
                Figure 2 to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
                3.1.1. Ground and Surface Water Data
                Groundwater information is available for nearly all states, with a few exceptions in the northeast (Figures 2a
                and 2b). Groundwater is arguably of low importance in the northeast because surface water is the primary
                source for 85% to 100% of water use; however, we note that surface water data are not often encountered
                for the northeast either. A reason for this might be that the region does not suffer from a lack of water and
                thus rely on their state-level USGS websites. Demarcation present in the Koppen-Geiger climate classes
                (Figure 2c) seems to align much more with the groundwater and surface water scores, indicating that water
                scarcity is potentially a strong incentive to deliver water information.
                Yet we note that all of the reviewed states except Rhode Island have their own web-based platform for surface
                or ground water, and 39 states present both. We remind the reader that USGS state surface water web-
                sites were excluded from the survey. This indicates that states intend to host and present this information
                themselves. We identify several potential reasons that could motivate this:
                • Additional data sets are collected at the state level, which a local authority desires to present itself or
                  barriers prevented the aggregation of this data to the federal level.
                • State agencies might have designed tools or conducted other postprocessing of the data to provide the most
                  relevant information to their end users, individuals, businesses, and other stakeholders.
                • There might be regulatory requirements or legal incentives to disclose the information themselves, such
                  as liability or simply registry purposes.
                • There may be political motivations such as showcasing the success of a given policies or preserving an
                  independence from the federal agencies.
                • There could be an interest in centralizing the information and breaking down the division between data
                  categories in a way that is not accomplished at the federal level.

                (f) total score. The scores indicate the number of subcategories for which data were found for the given state; the score
                reflects content, analytics, and exploratory tools but does not inform on the quality and completeness of the hosted data
                sets.

                Though the survey does not allow us to test and evaluate these hypotheses in great detail, the sheer presence
                of the number of individual state websites suggests that federal platforms present shortcomings.
                Further inspection of groundwater platforms shows a great variety of approaches ranging from simple
                reporting of water tables without any further analysis (see Tables A1 and A2) to sophisticated tools devised
                to help determine the location and characteristics of new wells by simulating impacts on the water table.
                Another common type of groundwater-related online resource provides databases of well records or well
                log information. While key information could be extracted from the logs (e.g., depth of the wells, observed
                water table, intended use, or permitted withdrawals), it is often reported in PDF forms and thus requires
                additional processing to render the information usable for analysis. A plausible explanation for this is that
                these databases are primarily used for administrative purposes.
                Surface water data platforms also vary greatly in approach and are quite different from their USGS coun-
                terparts. Broadly, websites appear designed to primarily serve one of three purposes: (i) to report discharge
                measurements with analytics and alternative representations of the data, (ii) to be more transversal and
                include groundwater information, or (iii) to report permit information. The more informative platforms with
                the highest scores on the survey aggregate multiple data sets on an interactive map, such as gauge locations,
                links to historical discharges or water table depth, and permits.
                It would be of great value to have platforms that combine the above mentioned approaches to bridge the
                gap between the infrastructure in place and its use (e.g., wells location and depth, maximum withdrawals,
                sector of use) and the environmental conditions (e.g., trends in surface and ground water levels). Beyond
                making the connection between existing data sets and platforms, there is also a need to develop analytics to

Figure 2. Patterns observed in Figure 1 might show some correlations with the following maps: (a) groundwater irrigation water use per state for the year 2010
(Maupin et al., 2017), (b) percent of total water use supplied by surface water for the year 2010 (Maupin et al., 2017), (c) Koppen-Geiger climate classes per
county (Kottek et al., 2017), and (d) water quality violations per state for the period of 1980–2015 (Allaire et al., 2018).


                                        guide interpretation of the measurements, both statistically (e.g., trends, variability, and uncertainty) and
                                        phenomenologically (e.g., recharge and climate impacts).
                                        Regarding reservoirs and dams, only 23 states have data platforms that provide some form of information.
                                        Around a third of the platforms with reservoir information simply provide time series of water height. The
                                        remainder tend to provide a snapshot of the current state of reservoirs, often through maps and representa-
                                        tion of the capacity of the reservoirs and their current storage. Rather than simple disclosure of data, these
                                        platforms seem to be oriented toward communicating effectively with a broad audience on the current state
                                        of storage. This is in stark contrast to state agencies that do not disclose information due to security reasons.
                                        Yet nearly half of the surveyed states present storage information. It could be argued that for security reasons
                                        it is essential to disclose dam and reservoir characteristics, uses, and maintenance plans so that the public
                                        can be made aware of the infrastructural risks. This could enable insurance policies and proper financing
                                        of infrastructure maintenance and operations to be developed. Furthermore, the connection with climate is
                                        never made explicit, even though it is essential to assess both the relevance of the dams and their services
                                        to the ecosystem and population to deal with droughts and floods, and the risk of failures. As for surface
                                        and ground water, integrating information across climate, infrastructure, use, and the environment is key
                                        to maximize the use and relevance of the platforms.
                                        3.1.2. Water Quality Data
                                        Water quality information is only slightly less common than general surface and ground water data and is
                                        presented by 38 of the reviewed states. Only 16 states disclosed return flows permits information, though
                                        this information is compulsorily collected by each state with delegated authority for the National Pollutant
                                        Discharge Elimination System under the Clean Water Act (45 of the 48 states reviewed). Figure 2d shows the
                                        water quality violations reported to the EPA for the period of 1980–2015 aggregated at the state level. There
                                        seems to be little correlation between states' reporting of quality measurements and water quality violations
                                        reported by drinking water systems.
                                        Some states that have a very high number of violations per person disclose information (with Oklahoma
                                        scoring a high mark in the survey), whereas Nebraska has a score of 0, raising the question of access to
                                        information pertaining to water standards and subsequently to water justice issues. Underreporting of water
                                        quality violations further hinders our capacity to analyze the results and understand states' behaviors.

                Figure 3. States for which water permits are available for (a) groundwater withdrawals, (b) return flows, (c) surface
                water withdrawals, and (d) the sum of the three, demonstrating a potential to derive a better understanding of water
                use.

                An examination of the platforms shows three broad types of approach: (i) the disclosure of raw data exclu-
                sively, which may be difficult to understand but is transparent; (ii) disclosure of raw data, but centralized
                on a map to facilitate access to the data; and (iii) more sophisticated visualization of the data with accom-
                panying analytics, in a clear effort to communicate results. It would be interesting to inspect further how
                each approach was chosen. A more detailed analysis should also be conducted to evaluate the platforms and
                the data contained within for assessing the successes and failures of the Clean Water Act. It is important
                to note that no platform makes the connection between quality of raw water used by drinking water sys-
                tems and quality measurements in groundwater or in-stream locations. An integrated view of water quality
                issues could provide key insights on infrastructure and financial needs to address the water quality chal-
                lenges currently faced by the communities, thus bridging objectives of the Clean Water Act and the Safe
                Drinking Water Act. Furthermore, there is a need to integrate water quality and water quantity considera-
                tions. Combining the necessary data sets on a single platform would be a formidable first step to address the
                water quantity-quality nexus (Gunda et al., 2013).
                3.1.3. Water Use
                Only 22 states provided some sort of water use information, with as few as five states presenting information
                as to point of use, raising questions regarding enforcement of water withdrawal permits and allocation. This
                also challenges the idea that the water footprint of supply chains can be studied systematically without
                spending tremendous efforts on data collection. Only 14 states provided information as to what sector is
                using the abstracted water. Figure 1d shows which states disclosed water use information. We observe a
                pattern that follows the definition of climate zones as illustrated in Figure 2c: Where water is lacking, states
                made an effort to collect water use information to conduct water budget exercises. The limited information
                reported at the federal level is thus a consequence of the lack of water use information collected at the state
                and local levels.
                One should note however that though their number is limited, the states that disclose water use information
                often do so at a much better resolution than available at the national level. For instance, many states pro-
                vide yearly water use numbers. A flexible data structure at the federal level could allow for more frequent
                reporting and highlight states that provide yearly numbers. Furthermore, as remarked previously, many
                states provide databases of water permit information (Figure 3), for groundwater withdrawals (37 states),
                surface water withdrawals (24), or return flows (16). None of this information is consolidated at the federal
                level, in particular, no aggregation of the wells location records. It might be possible to leverage this informa-
                tion to derive water withdrawals, use locations, and permitted amounts to inform hydro(geo)logical models.

                             Earth’s Future                                                       10.1029/2018EF001063


                Some platforms at the state level are already taking one step in this direction, simply by offering interactive
                maps with points of withdrawals/extractions combined with discharge gauges and observational ground-
                water wells. Obtaining a similar platform at the national level with a map of both points of use and points
                of observations would be a fantastic tool for water management and to assess the relevance of the network
                of observations wells and discharge gauges for the monitoring of water availability.
                Despite this untapped source of information, water use data remain scarce in space (rare examples are found
                at a smaller scale than the county, though arguably water stresses happen at smaller scales; e.g., Mayer et al.,
                2014) and in time (only a few platforms provide monthly sectoral use). Developing a broader understanding
                of water withdrawals, consumption and return patterns remains extremely difficult and subject to large
                uncertainties (Worland et al., 2016). There is also a need to aggregate this information with water availability
                considerations. Typically this requires streamflow, reservoir storage, and groundwater level data with some
                processing to be translated into volumes of water available for use. A few platforms can be found that do
                this, however only at a very local scale (e.g., at the field scale) and without explicit consideration of climate
                fluctuations. It is essential that data platforms embed climate information to further our understanding and
                capacity to adapt to climate variability and change.
                3.1.4. Financial Information
                Water finance data were only found for 11 states. Average water bill information aggregated from survey
                data is available for some states (e.g., Wyoming). Even when yearly details are publicly accessible, the infor-
                mation is only found within report documents. More sophisticated water rate dashboards, constructed by
                the University of North Carolina for eight states, permit the comparison of water rates between municipal-
                ities as a function of use, rate structure, source of water, and various other facility- or demographic-related
                characteristics depending on the state for which the platform is built. While the dashboards were initially
                intended as a benchmarking tool to aid small water utilities, they could inform potential commercial or
                industrial structures and individual water users as to the water costs they encounter.
                Additional water utility financial information of interest, such as operation and maintenance expenses and
                capital expenditures, were not found, possibly because they are not directly regulated. The only two excep-
                tions are Kentucky and Oklahoma, which present data sets for state-administered infrastructure funding
                programs with project descriptions and costs related to the water infrastructure financing. It should be
                noted that the Kentucky Infrastructure Authority's platform is significantly more comprehensive, including
                budgeting information at the utility level, to support a state initiative to overhaul water infrastructure and
                encourage consolidation of water systems.
                Though a few examples were found, it would be of great interest to expand the water rates dashboards
                and water infrastructure financing to all states and consolidate the results at the federal level. Indeed, a
                national understanding of water rates structures and bills at the municipal level, put in perspective with
                demographic information, systematically performed every year and for every municipality, would not only
                improve water use information but would support much further analysis of water access issues. Similarly,
                a national overview of water infrastructure projects and utility maintenance cost would allow researchers
                and governmental entities to target areas of particular need and to devise much more specific infrastructure
                financing plans.
                3.1.5. Analytical and Exploratory Tools
                In terms of tools proposed to analyze the data, around half of the states that provide ground or surface water
                information provide summary statistics with it. Systematic review of the websites reveals that typical sum-
                mary statistics are mean, minimum, and maximum values, rarely going into more depth. The presentation
                of analytics is rare for water quality, though they would be especially relevant in helping users understand
                trends and significant thresholds for key indicators. This questions our assumption that state-level data are
                hosted to provide additional analysis. While it might be true for some, it is not systematically the case.
                None of the surveyed websites provided uncertainty estimates around the numbers that are presented. This
                goes against all metrology recommendations. Error estimates would facilitate the aggregation of water data
                sets by making explicit differences in standards of accuracy, across states and across data categories. Uncer-
                tainty propagation is a central element of water security assessments that would further inform which
                management strategies and policies to adopt in order to mitigate the risks and also simply to evaluate the
                value of water data and identify collection campaigns that should be conducted.

                             Earth’s Future                                                       10.1029/2018EF001063


                The number of states proposing projections for any of the categories ranged between 1 (water quality cate-
                gory) and 4 states (surface water and use categories). There might be liability reasons for this, though one
                should note that projections are regularly proposed for weather and climate information, such as the USDA
                drought projection. Further inspection of the websites indicates that the time horizon of the projections
                ranged between 3 days to a century, with a preponderance for long-term projections and assessment of cli-
                mate change impacts. These projections rarely come hand in hand with uncertainty estimates around the
                projections. There are only two exceptions: a case where it is possible to compare multiple scenarios at once,
                thus providing a range of variability, and the second instance where projections for the future are based on
                extreme values of historical data without attempting forecasts.
                As for exploratory tools and the ability to analyze data, the overall impression that we get is that these plat-
                forms are not designed to provide a global overview of water within one state but rather for a location-specific
                use of the data. For example, permit details are often shown one by one. Download capabilities are often
                restricted to a specific number of entries or a maximum geographic area and rarely permit exports to other
                tools or online displays (e.g., through an API) for further analyses.

                3.2. Centralization of Water Data
                The two previous subsections focused on what information is available for each state by aggregating the
                results at the state level. In this section, we focus on individual websites to evaluate water data centralization
                potential and to inform federal-level platforms that could constitute a one-stop hub for water data. One
                hundred sixty-nine websites were found to have data only pertaining to one category, 59 had data for two
                categories, 40 for three categories, and 3 for four categories. No websites were found to disclose information
                pertaining to all five categories, not surprisingly due to the lack of financial information. This nonetheless
                demonstrates that a centralization of water data is possible on a single platform.
                The three websites covering four categories of data are the “Ground Water Management Branch Map Inter-
                face” from the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources, Utah's “Division of Water Rights Esri
                Platform,” and Wyoming's “Water and Climate Web Atlas” by the University of Wyoming. Note that the
                first two are also top global scorers, with scores of 22 and 21, respectively. Three other high-scoring websites
                are the Colorado Water Conservation Board's “Data Viewer Mapper” (score of 18), the California Depart-
                ment of Water Resources' “Water Data Library” (score of 18), and the Mississippi Water Resources “Data
                Compendium” (score of 23). These three show data for only three categories, with the last two excluding
                water use considerations, while Colorado's Data Viewer Mapper leaves aside water quality. They, however,
                illustrate that sophisticated platforms beyond a simple repository are possible and serve a purpose. Further
                research should investigate the role they play and who the users are to evaluate their success and learn from
                them (Laituri & Sternlieb, 2006).


                4. Conclusion
                Though the survey did not quantify the volume of data available at the state level, it confirmed that the water
                data gaps identified at the federal level can be filled in part with state-level information. For groundwater,
                this is currently the object of an initiative led by the USGS, the Advisory Committee on Water Information,
                which is centralizing information of many universities, states, and other entities to extend the USGS net-
                work of water table gauges. The aggregation is still underway as the task presents a tremendous challenge
                due to differences in standards and accuracy. Indeed, while there are rich and massive data assemblages
                on water, these data are archived in discrete databases with incompatible units; inconsistent classifications;
                varied structural, temporal, and spatial organization; and they are maintained by different state and federal
                agencies (Wiener et al., 2017) or are assembled by water-specific governance bodies (e.g., inter-state com-
                pacts), local or county-level government (e.g., water quality for small systems), or consulting groups (e.g.,
                water rates).
                The responsibility of centralization does not solely rest on the shoulders of the USGS; many initiatives are
                underway. Notably, the Food and Agriculture Organization has launched an initiative on water accounting
                for agriculture to establish the adequate definitions necessary to fill the water gap existing between water
                supply and irrigation use; and the Aspen institute is leading a dialogue series on a national policy framework
                to address “the institutional barriers to scaling the integration of water data and information to support
                sustainable water management” (Patterson et al., 2012) .

                             Earth’s Future                                                       10.1029/2018EF001063


                However, assuming all aggregation challenges can be addressed, collecting state-level information would
                not suffice to meet all water data needs. Though it would improve the coverage for groundwater levels, water
                use data would still remain notably sparse, in particular regarding the identification of point of source, use
                and returns, making systematic water footprint assessment along supply chains impossible. Beyond federal-
                and state-level data sets, additional sources of information at different scales could be assembled to improve
                water use estimates (Dunham et al., 2014). Water reuse is also greatly absent (Wiener et al., 2017). Financial
                information essential to the construction of hydroeconomics models is equally hard to come by aside from
                the recent development of the water rate dashboards proposed by the University of North Carolina. This
                renders the evaluation of the water stress or infrastructure development at the national scale prone to great
                uncertainties, such that the words of caution voiced by Beider and Tawil (Office2002) regarding the accuracy
                of their estimates would likely not be very different today.
                To fill this data gap, beyond increasing primary data collection, recent developments could be leveraged
                to derive the quantities of interest using secondary information. A particularly promising lead is remote
                sensing, such as with GRACE, which provides information that can be used to infer groundwater storage
                changes, though still at limited spatial resolution (e.g., Doöll et al., 2014, 2018) or, less commonly, water
                quality (Gholizadeh et al., 2014). Additional remote sensing images and other products at excellent spatial
                resolution could also be harvested using machine learning tools to identify point of extraction, point of
                returns, and irrigation systems; quantify water use for outdoor space; or derive irrigation volumes using
                crop models (Kanwar et al., 2016). Besides the data that can be collected, this also puts in perspective the
                reluctance of water facilities to disclose water use for privacy reasons (Jerome, 2006), if the information can
                be inferred using remote sensing (e.g., location of water infrastructure). The Internet of things seems as
                though it might also be a promising tool to refine water use and needs estimates for the domestic and public
                sector in particular (Cheifetz et al., 2013; Earth Security Group, 2002; Klein & Oberg, 2010; Patterson et al.,
                2012; Yang et al., 2010). Regarding industrial water use, disclosure policies, voluntary or not (e.g., 23% of U.S.
                companies reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project disclosed water information; CDP, 2015), represent
                another untapped source of data.
                Beyond creating an inventory of existing data at the state level, the survey also revealed the great diversity in
                what types of information and tools are centralized. Fifteen percent of the reviewed websites showed data
                for three categories of data or more, illustrating that a centralization of water data within a single structure
                is possible. As mentioned by Fishman (2016) and Jerome (2006), an example of such a platform already
                exists at the federal level: The Energy Information Authority, centralizing energy data, offers projections
                and analytics to inform operators and investors alike. Water maybe presents a greater challenge due to the
                sheer number of water facilities in the United States in comparison to the number of power plants. However,
                these could be overcome soon with increasing computational capacities and the development of standards
                (e.g., Taylor et al., 2017) and automation capabilities. Extensive literature exists on cyberinfrastructures
                (Castronova et al., 2018; Goodall et al., 2016, 2011; Horsburgh et al., 2011, 2014, Horsburgh & Reeder, 2017;
                Jeong et al., 2009; Latre et al., 2014; Laituri & Sternlieb, 2006; Larsen & Young, 2013; Laniak et al., 2014;
                Yang et al., 2018) and more recently the potential of “big data” techniques to assist with this task (Chen &
                Han, 2017; Klein & Oberg, 2010).
                Though we are hopeful that the state of water data in the United States can be improved through the previ-
                ously mentioned venues, many other entities have a key role to play as the water challenges are very much
                dependent on other sectors, in particular, the food-energy-water nexus. It is thus necessary to go beyond
                water data and aggregate demographics-, energy-, food-, and climate-related data (Scanlon et al., 2017).
                Network information (transportation of energy, water and food, and supply chain characteristics) are also
                crucial to assess water and infrastructure resiliency. (The university-led project FEWsion is currently under-
                taking this task for food, energy, and water under NSF Award#1639529). The challenge is only increased by
                the scale at which data should be reported, both temporally and spatially, ranging from the hour to decades
                and from the individual to the nation to inform operations and address infrastructure developments. And
                though time series information is crucial to understand variability and trends, up-to-date concurrent infor-
                mation is equally important to understand current transitions and anticipate future stresses. We further note
                that confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates around all data measurements are essential for robust
                propagation of uncertainty and quantification of risks.

                                        Water security has been identified as a key objective by the World Economic Forum. A federal water infor-
                                        mation platform maintained and managed by a federal water authority could provide a holistic view of water
                                        and its governance. This is deemed essential in the context of climate change and higher frequencies of
                                        extreme weather, crumbling infrastructure (Beider & Tawil, Office2002), new technologies such as desalin-
                                        ization, transition in the food and energy sector, and growing inequalities in environmental justice. Such
                                        federal water authority information could guide policy-makers at various federal agencies to local water
                                        utilities, as well as actors from the private sector, such as investors, insurers, manufacturers, and industri-
                                        als in the food and beverage or mining sector (Earth Security Group, 2016, 2002). It could also inform and
                                        support individuals, advocacy groups, civil society, journalists, and educators (Jones & Moulton, 2016). The
                                        successes of the decision-makers of tomorrow for the future of the United States depend solely on the quality
                                        of the information that will be available to them.
