A. Standards for the quality of navigable waters shall assure water quality, if
attainable, which provides for protecting the public health and welfare, and
shall enhance the quality of water taking into consideration its use and value
for public water supplies, the propagation of fish and wildlife and
recreational, agricultural, industrial and other purposes including

quality of all navigable waters which establish numeric limitations on the
concentrations of each of the toxic pollutants listed by the administrator
pursuant to section 307 of the clean water act ( 33 United States Code
section 1317).

C. In setting numeric standards for the quality of navigable waters, the
director may consider the effect of local water quality characteristics on the
toxicity of specific pollutants and the varying sensitivities of local affected
aquatic populations to such pollutants, and the extent to which the natural
flow of the stream is intermittent or ephemeral, as a result of which the
instream flow consists mostly of treated wastewater effluent, except that
such standards shall not, in any event, be inconsistent with the clean water
act. In applying such standards the director may establish appropriate
mixing zones.

                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-223. Aquifer water quality standards

A. Primary drinking water maximum contaminant levels established by the
administrator before August 13, 1986 are adopted as drinking water aquifer
water quality standards. The director may only adopt additional aquifer
water quality standards by rule. Within one year after the administrator
establishes additional primary drinking water maximum contaminant levels,
the director shall open a rule making docket pursuant to section 41-1021 for
adoption of those maximum contaminant levels as drinking water aquifer
water quality standards. If substantial opposition is demonstrated in the rule
making docket regarding a particular constituent, the director may adopt for
that constituent the maximum contaminant level as a drinking water aquifer
water quality standard upon making a finding that this level is appropriate
for adoption in Arizona as an aquifer water quality standard. In making this
finding, the director shall consider whether the assumptions about
technologies, costs, sampling and analytical methodologies and public
health risk reduction used by the administrator in developing and
implementing the maximum contaminant level are appropriate for
establishing a drinking water aquifer water quality standard. For purposes of
this subsection "substantial opposition" means information submitted to the
director that explains with reasonable specificity why the maximum
contaminant level is not appropriate as an aquifer water quality standard.

B. The director may adopt by rule numeric drinking water aquifer water
quality standards for pollutants for which the administrator has not
established primary drinking water maximum contaminant levels or for
which a maximum contaminant level has been established but the director
has determined it to be inappropriate as an aquifer water quality standard
pursuant to subsection A of this section. These standards shall be based on
the protection of human health. In establishing numeric drinking water
aquifer water quality standards, the director shall rely on technical protocols
appropriate for the development of aquifer water quality standards and shall
base the standards on credible medical and toxicological evidence that has
been subjected to peer review.

C. Any person may petition the director to adopt a numeric drinking water
aquifer quality standard for any pollutant for which no drinking water
aquifer quality standard exists. The director shall grant the petition and
institute rule making proceedings adopting a numeric standard as provided
under subsection B of this section within one hundred eighty days if the
petition shows that the pollutant is a toxic pollutant, that the pollutant has
been, or may in the future be, detected in any of the state's drinking water
aquifers, and that there exists technical information on which a numeric
standard might reasonably be based. Within one year of the commencement
of the rule making proceeding, the director shall either adopt a numeric
  ARS 49-223 Aquifer water quality standards (Arizona Revised
                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


standard or make and publish a finding that, pursuant to subsection B of
this section, the development of a numeric standard is not possible. The
decision to not adopt a numeric standard shall, for purposes of judicial
review, be treated in the same manner as a rule adopted pursuant to title 41,
chapter 6.

D. For purposes of assessing compliance with each aquifer water quality
standard adopted pursuant to this section, the director shall for purposes of
articles 3 and 4 of this chapter, and may for purposes of other provisions of
this title, identify sampling and analytical protocols appropriate for
detecting and measuring the pollutant in the aquifers in the state.

E. Within one year from the reclassification of an aquifer to a non-drinking
water status, pursuant to section 49-224, the director shall adopt water
quality standards for that aquifer. For any pollutants which were not the
basis for the reclassification, the applicable standard shall be identical with
the standard for those pollutants adopted pursuant to subsections A and B
of this section. For any pollutants which were the basis for reclassification,
the standard shall be sufficient to achieve the purpose for which the aquifer
was reclassified but shall minimize unnecessary degradation of the aquifer
by taking into consideration the potential long-term uses of the aquifer and
the short-term and long-term benefits of the activities resulting in
discharges into the aquifer.

F. The director shall adopt water quality standards for an aquifer for which a
petition has been submitted pursuant to section 49-224, subsection D
sufficient to achieve the non-drinking water use for which that aquifer was
classified, taking into consideration the potential long-term uses of that
aquifer and the short-term and long-term benefits of the discharging
activities creating that aquifer.

G. In any action pursuant to this title, aquifer water quality protection
provisions, including monitoring requirements, may be imposed only for
pollutants for which aquifer water quality standards have been established
that are likely to be present in a discharge. Indicator parameters and quality
assurance parameters appropriate for such pollutants also may be specified.

C. The director, after consulting with the appropriate groundwater users
advisory council established pursuant to title 45, chapter 2, article 2 if the
aquifer is in an active management area, and a public hearing held pursuant
to section 49-208, may change the classification of an aquifer or part of an
aquifer for a protected use other than drinking water on making all of the
following findings:

1. The identified aquifer or part of an aquifer is or will be so hydrologically
isolated from other aquifers or other parts of the same aquifer that there is
no reasonable probability that poorer quality water from the identified
aquifer or part of an aquifer will cause or contribute to a violation of aquifer
water quality standards in other aquifers or parts of the same aquifer.

2. Water from the identified aquifer or part of an aquifer is not being used as
drinking water.

3. The short-term and long-term benefits to the public that would result
from the degradation of the quality of the water in the identified aquifer or
part of an aquifer below standards established pursuant to section 49-223,
subsections A and B would significantly outweigh the short-term and long-
term costs to the public of such degradation. Benefits and costs to be
considered include economic, social and environmental.

D. Owners or operators of facilities whose discharges are solely responsible
for creating an aquifer may petition the director for a classification of the
aquifer for a non-drinking water use. The director may, by rule, classify that
aquifer for a non-drinking water use upon making the findings prescribed in
subsection C, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section.

E. The director shall provide for public participation in proceedings under
this section pursuant to section 49-208 and shall hold at least one public

applicable water quality standards, determine the effectiveness of best
management practices, agricultural best management practices and best
available demonstrated control technologies, evaluate the effects of
pollutants on public health or the environment and determine water quality
trends.

B. The director shall maintain a statewide database of groundwater and soils
sampled for pollutants. All agencies shall submit to the director, in a timely
manner, the results of any groundwater or soils sampling for pollutants and
the results of any groundwater or soils sampling that detect any pollutants.

C. The director shall establish minimum requirements and schedules for
groundwater and soils sampling that will ensure precise and accurate
results. The requirements shall be distributed to all agencies that conduct
sampling. All sampling conducted shall meet the minimum requirements
established pursuant to this subsection.

ยง 49-231. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Impaired water" means a navigable water for which credible scientific
data exists that satisfies the requirements of section 49-232 and that
demonstrates that the water should be identified pursuant to 33 United
States Code section 1313(d) and the regulations implementing that statute.

2. "Surface water quality standard" means a standard adopted for a
navigable water pursuant to sections 49-221 and 49-222 and section 303(c)
of the clean water act ( 33 United States Code section 1313(c) ).

3. "TMDL implementation plan" means a written strategy to implement a
total maximum daily load that is developed for an impaired water. TMDL
implementation plans may rely on any combination of the following
components that the department determines will result in achieving and
maintaining compliance with applicable surface water quality standards in
the most cost-effective and equitable manner:

(a) Permit limitations.

(b) Best management practices.

(c) Education and outreach efforts.

(d) Technical assistance.

(e) Cooperative agreements, voluntary measures and incentive-based
programs.

(f) Load reductions resulting from other legally required programs or
activities.

(g) Land management programs.

(h) Pollution prevention planning, waste minimization or pollutant trading
agreements.

(i) Other measures deemed appropriate by the department.

4. "Total maximum daily load" means an estimation of the total amount of a
pollutant from all sources that may be added to a water while still allowing
the water to achieve and maintain applicable surface water quality
standards. Each total maximum daily load shall include allocations for
sources that contribute the pollutant to the water, as required by section
303(d) of the clean water act ( 33 United States Code section 1313(d)) and
ARS 49-231 Definitions (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))



regulations implementing that statute to achieve applicable surface water
quality standards.

           (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-232. Lists of impaired waters; data requirements; rules

A. At least once every five years, the department shall prepare a list of
impaired waters for the purpose of complying with section 303(d) of the
clean water act ( 33 United States Code section 1313(d)). The department
shall provide public notice and allow for comment on a draft list of impaired
waters prior to its submission to the United States environmental protection
agency. The department shall prepare written responses to comments
received on the draft list. The department shall publish the list of impaired
waters that it plans to submit initially to the regional administrator and a
summary of the responses to comments on the draft list in the Arizona
administrative register at least forty-five days before submission of the list to
the regional administrator. Publication of the list in the Arizona
administrative register is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41,
chapter 6, article 10 that may be appealed by any party that submitted
written comments on the draft list. If the department receives a notice of
appeal of a listing pursuant to section 41-1092, subsection B within forty-five
days of the publication of the list in the Arizona administrative register, the
department shall not include the challenged listing in its initial submission
to the regional administrator. The department may subsequently submit the
challenged listing to the regional administrator if the listing is upheld in the
director's final administrative decision pursuant to section 41-1092.08, or if
the challenge to the listing is withdrawn prior to a final administrative
decision.

B. In determining whether a water is impaired, the department shall
consider only reasonably current credible and scientifically defensible data
that the department has collected or has received from another source.
Results of water sampling or other assessments of water quality, including
physical or biological health, shall be considered credible and scientifically
defensible data only if the department has determined all of the following:

1. Appropriate quality assurance and quality control procedures were
followed and documented in collecting and analyzing the data.

2. The samples or analyses are representative of water quality conditions at
the time the data was collected.

3. The data consists of an adequate number of samples based on the nature
of the water in question and the parameters being analyzed.

4. The method of sampling and analysis, including analytical, statistical and
modeling methods, is generally accepted and validated in the scientific
community as appropriate for use in assessing the condition of the water.
  ARS 49-232 Lists of impaired waters; data requirements; rules
           (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


C. The department shall adopt by rule the methodology to be used in
identifying waters as impaired. The rules shall specify all of the following:

1. Minimum data requirements and quality assurance and quality control
requirements that are consistent with subsection B of this section and that
must be satisfied in order for the data to serve as the basis for listing and
delisting decisions.

2. Appropriate sampling, analytical and scientific techniques that may be
used in assessing whether a water is impaired.

3. Any statistical or modeling techniques that the department uses to assess
or interpret data.

4. Criteria for including and removing waters from the list of impaired
waters, including any implementation procedures developed pursuant to
subsection F of this section. The criteria for removing a water from the list of
impaired waters shall not be any more stringent than the criteria for adding
a water to that list.

D. In assessing whether a water is impaired, the department shall consider
the data available in light of the nature of the water in question, including
whether the water is an ephemeral water. A water in which pollutant
loadings from naturally occurring conditions alone are sufficient to cause a
violation of applicable surface water quality standards shall not be listed as
impaired.

E. If the department has adopted a numeric surface water quality standard
for a pollutant and that standard is not being exceeded in a water, the
department shall not list the water as impaired based on a conclusion that
the pollutant causes a violation of a narrative or biological standard unless:

1. The department has determined that the numeric standard is insufficient
to protect water quality.

2. The department has identified specific reasons that are appropriate for
the water in question, that are based on generally accepted scientific
principles and that support the department's determination.

F. Before listing a navigable water as impaired based on a violation of a
narrative or biological surface water quality standard and after providing an
opportunity for public notice and comment, the department shall adopt
implementation procedures that specifically identify the objective basis for
determining that a violation of the narrative or biological criterion exists. A
total maximum daily load designed to achieve compliance with a narrative
or biological surface water quality standard shall not be adopted until the
  ARS 49-232 Lists of impaired waters; data requirements; rules
           (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


implementation procedure for the narrative or biological surface water
quality standard has been adopted.

G. On request, the department shall make available to the public data used
to support the listing of a water as impaired and may charge a reasonable fee
to persons requesting the data.

H. By January 1, 2002, the department shall review the list of waters
identified as impaired as of January 1, 2000 to determine whether the data
that supports the listing of those waters complies with this section. If the
data that supports a listing does not comply with this section, the listed
water shall not be included on future lists submitted to the United States
environmental protection agency pursuant to 33 United States Code section
1313(d) unless in the interim data that satisfies the requirements of this
section has been collected or received by the department.

I. The department shall add a water to or remove a water from the list using
the process described in section 49-232, subsection A outside of the normal
listing cycle if it collects or receives credible and scientifically defensible data
that satisfies the requirements of this section and that demonstrates that the
current quality of the water is such that it should be removed from or added
to the list. A listed water may no longer warrant classification as impaired or
an unlisted water may be identified as impaired if the applicable surface
water quality standards, implementation procedures or designated uses
have changed or if there is a change in water quality.

                    Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-233. Priority ranking and schedule

A. Each list developed by the department pursuant to section 49-232 shall
contain a priority ranking of navigable waters identified as impaired and for
which total maximum daily loads are required pursuant to section 49-234
and a schedule for the development of all required total maximum daily
loads.

B. In the first list submitted to the United States environmental protection
agency after the effective date of this article, the schedule shall be sufficient
to ensure that all required total maximum daily loads will be developed
within fifteen years of the date the list is approved by the environmental
protection agency. Total maximum daily loads that are required to be
developed for navigable waters that are included for the first time on
subsequent lists shall be developed within fifteen years of the initial
inclusion of the water on the list.

C. As part of the rule making prescribed by section 49-232, subsection C, the
department shall identify the factors that it will use to prioritize navigable
waters that require development of total maximum daily loads. At a
minimum and to the extent relevant data is available, the department shall
consider the following factors in prioritizing navigable waters for
development of total maximum daily loads:

1. The designated uses of the navigable water.

2. The type and extent of risk from the impairment to human health or
aquatic life.

3. The degree of public interest and support, or its lack.

4. The nature of the navigable water, including whether it is an ephemeral,
intermittent or effluent-dependent water.

5. The pollutants causing the impairment.

6. The severity, magnitude and duration of the violation of the applicable
surface water quality standard.

7. The seasonal variation caused by natural events such as storms or weather
patterns.

8. Existing treatment levels and management practices.
   ARS 49-233 Priority ranking and schedule (Arizona Revised
                    Statutes (2021 Edition))


9. The availability of effective and economically feasible treatment
techniques, management practices or other pollutant loading reduction
measures.

10. The recreational and economic importance of the water.

11. The extent to which the impairment is caused by discharges or activities
that have ceased.

12. The extent to which natural sources contribute to the impairment.

13. Whether the water is accorded special protection under federal or state
water quality law.

14. Whether action that is taken or that is likely to be taken under other
programs, including voluntary programs, is likely to make significant
progress toward achieving applicable standards even if a total maximum
daily load is not developed.

15. The time expected to be required to achieve compliance with applicable
surface water quality standards.

16. The availability of documented, effective analytical tools for developing a
total maximum daily load for the water with reasonable accuracy.

17. Department resources and programmatic needs.
 ARS 49-234 Total maximum daily loads; implementation plans
          (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-234. Total maximum daily loads; implementation plans

A. The department shall develop total maximum daily loads for those
navigable waters listed as impaired pursuant to this article and for which
total maximum daily loads are required to be adopted pursuant to 33 United
States Code section 1313(d) and the regulations implementing that statute.
The department may estimate total maximum daily loads for navigable
waters not listed as impaired pursuant to this article, for the purposes of
developing information to satisfy the requirements of 33 United States Code
section 1313(d)(3), only after it has developed total maximum daily loads for
all navigable waters identified as impaired pursuant to this article or if
necessary to support permitting of new point source discharges.

B. In developing total maximum daily loads, the department shall use only
statistical and modeling techniques that are properly validated and broadly
accepted by the scientific community. The modeling technique may vary
based on the type of water and the quantity and quality of available data that
meets the quality assurance and quality control requirements of section 49-
232. The department may establish the statistical and modeling techniques
in rules adopted pursuant to section 49-232, subsection C.

C. Each total maximum daily load shall:

1. Be based on data and methodologies that comply with section 49-232.

2. Be established at a level that will achieve and maintain compliance with
applicable surface water quality standards.

3. Include a reasonable margin of safety that takes into account any lack of
knowledge concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and
water quality. The margin of safety shall not be used as a substitute for
adequate data when developing the total maximum daily load.

4. Account for seasonal variations that may include setting total maximum
daily loads that apply on a seasonal basis.

D. For each impaired water, the department shall prepare a draft estimate of
the total amount of each pollutant that causes the impairment from all
sources and that may be added to the navigable water while still allowing the
navigable water to achieve and maintain applicable surface water quality
standards. In addition, the department shall determine draft allocations
among the contributing sources that are sufficient to achieve the total
loadings. The department shall provide public notice and allow for comment
on each draft estimate and draft allocation and shall prepare written
responses to comments received on the draft estimates and draft allocations.
 ARS 49-234 Total maximum daily loads; implementation plans
          (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


The department shall publish the determinations of total pollutant loadings
that will not result in impairment and the draft allocations among the
contributing sources that are sufficient to achieve the total loading that it
intends to submit initially to the regional administrator, along with a
summary of the responses to comments on the estimated loadings and
allocations, in the Arizona administrative register at least forty-five days
before submission of the loadings and allocations to the regional
administrator. Notwithstanding this subsection, draft allocations shall be
submitted to the regional administrator only if that submission is required
by the rules that implement 33 United States Code section 1313(d).

E. Publication of the loadings and allocations in the Arizona administrative
register is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article
10 that may be appealed by any party that submitted written comments on
the estimated loadings and allocations. If the department receives a notice of
appeal of a loading and allocation pursuant to section 41-1092.03 within
forty-five days of the publication of the loading and allocations in the
Arizona administrative register, the department shall not submit the
challenged loading and allocations to the regional administrator until either
the challenge to the loading and allocation is withdrawn or the director has
made a final administrative decision pursuant to section 41-1092.08.

F. The department shall make reasonable and equitable allocations among
sources when developing total maximum daily loads. At a minimum, the
department shall consider the following factors in making allocations:

1. The environmental, economic and technological feasibility of achieving
the allocation.

2. The cost and benefit associated with achieving the allocation.

3. Any pollutant loading reductions that are reasonably expected to be
achieved as a result of other legally required actions or voluntary measures.

G. For each total maximum daily load, the department shall establish a
TMDL implementation plan that explains how the allocations and any
reductions in existing pollutant loadings will be achieved. Any reductions in
loadings from nonpoint sources shall be achieved voluntarily. The
department shall provide for public notice and comment on each TMDL
implementation plan. Any sampling or monitoring components of a TMDL
implementation plan shall comply with section 49-232.

H. Each TMDL implementation plan shall provide the time frame in which
compliance with applicable surface water quality standards is expected to be
achieved. The plan may include a phased process with interim targets for
 ARS 49-234 Total maximum daily loads; implementation plans
          (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


load reductions. Longer time frames are appropriate in situations involving
multiple dischargers, technical, legal or economic barriers to achieving
necessary load reductions, scientific uncertainty regarding data quality or
modeling, significant loading from natural sources or significant loading
resulting from discharges or activities that have already ceased.

I. For navigable waters that are impaired due in part to historical factors
that are difficult to address, including contaminated sediments, the
department shall consider those historical factors in determining allocations
for existing point source discharges of the pollutant or pollutants that cause
the impairment. In developing total maximum daily loads for those
navigable waters, the department shall use a phased approach in which
expected long-term loading reductions from the historical sources are
considered in establishing short-term allocations for the point sources.
While total maximum daily loads and TMDL implementation plans are
being completed, any permits issued for the point sources are deemed
consistent with this article if the permits require reasonable reductions in
the discharges of the pollutants causing the impairment and are not
required to include additional reductions if those reductions would not
significantly contribute to attainment of surface water quality standards.

J. After a total maximum daily load and a TMDL implementation plan have
been adopted for a navigable water, the department shall review the status
of the navigable water at least once every five years to determine if
compliance with applicable surface water quality standards has been
achieved. If compliance with applicable surface water quality standards has
not been achieved, the department shall evaluate whether modification of
the total maximum daily load or TMDL implementation plan is required.

ยง 49-242. Procedural requirements for individual permits;
annual registration of permittees; fee

A. The director shall prescribe by rule requirements for issuing, denying,
suspending or modifying individual permits, including requirements for
submitting notices, permit applications and any additional information
necessary to determine whether an individual permit should be issued, and
shall prescribe conditions and requirements for individual permits.

B. Each owner of an injection well, a land treatment facility, a dry well, an
on-site wastewater treatment facility with a capacity of more than three
thousand gallons per day, a recharge facility or a facility that discharges to
navigable waters to whom an individual or area-wide permit is issued shall
register the permit with the director each year and pay an annual
registration fee for each permit based on the total daily discharge of
pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

C. Each owner of a surface impoundment, a facility that adds a pollutant to a
salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground cave or mine, a mine
tailings pile or pond, a mine leaching operation, a sewage or sludge pond or
a wastewater treatment facility to whom an individual or area-wide permit is
issued shall register the permit with the director each year and pay an
annual registration fee for each permit based on the total daily influent of
pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

D. Pending the issuance of individual or area-wide aquifer protection
permits, each owner of a facility that is prescribed in subsection B or C of
this section that is operating on September 27, 1990 pursuant to the filing of
a notice of disposal or a groundwater quality protection permit issued under
title 36 shall register the notice of disposal or the permit with the director
each year and shall pay an annual registration fee for each notice of disposal
or permit based on the total daily influent or discharge of pollutants
pursuant to subsection E of this section.

E. Only for a one-time rule making after the effective date of this
amendment to this section, the director shall establish by rule an annual
registration fee for facilities prescribed by subsections B, C and D of this
section. The fee shall be measured in part by the amount of discharge or
influent per day from the facility. After the one-time rule making, the
director shall not increase those fees by rule without specific statutory
authority for the increase.

F. For a site with more than one permit subject to the requirements of this
section, the owner or operator of the facility at that site shall pay the annual
registration fee prescribed pursuant to subsection E of this section based on

   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-243. Information and criteria for issuing individual permit;
definition

A. The director shall consider, and the applicant for an individual permit
may be required to furnish with the application, the following information:

1. The design of the discharge facility. When formal as-built submittals are
unavailable, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to allow
evaluation of those elements of the facility affecting discharge pursuant to
the demonstration required in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section.

2. A description of how the facility will be operated.

3. Existing and proposed pollutant control measures.

4. A hydrogeologic study defining and characterizing the discharge impact
area, including the vadose zone.

5. The use of water from aquifers in the discharge impact area.

6. The existing quality of the water in the aquifers in the discharge impact
area.

7. The characteristics of the pollutants discharged by the facility.

8. Closure strategy.

9. Any other relevant federal or state permits issued to the applicant.

10. Any other relevant information the director may require.

B. The director shall issue a permit to a person for a facility other than water
storage at a storage facility pursuant to title 45, chapter 3.1 if the person
demonstrates that either paragraphs 1 and 2 or paragraphs 1 and 3 of this
subsection will be met:

1. That the facility will be so designed, constructed and operated as to ensure
the greatest degree of discharge reduction achievable through application of
the best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating
methods or other alternatives, including, where practicable, a technology
permitting no discharge of pollutants. In determining best available
demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other
alternatives, the director shall take into account any treatment process
contributing to the discharge, site specific hydrologic and geologic
characteristics and other environmental factors, the opportunity for water
conservation or augmentation and economic impacts of the use of
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


alternative technologies, processes or operating methods on an industry-
wide basis. A discharge reduction to an aquifer achievable solely by means of
site specific characteristics does not, in itself, constitute compliance with
this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph for wetlands designed
and constructed to treat municipal and domestic wastewater for
underground storage pursuant to section 49-241, subsection B may be met
by including seepage through the bottom of the facility if it is demonstrated
that site characteristics can act to achieve performance levels established as
the best available demonstrated control technology by the director. In
addition, the director shall consider the following factors for existing
facilities:

(a) Toxicity, concentrations and quantities of discharge likely to reach an
aquifer from various types of control technologies.

(b) The total costs of the application of the technology in relation to the
discharge reduction to be achieved from such application.

(c) The age of equipment and facilities involved.

(d) The industrial and control process employed.

(e) The engineering aspects of the application of various types of control
techniques.

(f) Process changes.

(g) Non-water quality environmental impacts.

(h) The extent to which water available for beneficial uses will be conserved
by a particular type of control technology.

2. That pollutants discharged will in no event cause or contribute to a
violation of aquifer water quality standards at the applicable point of
compliance for the facility.

3. That no pollutants discharged will further degrade at the applicable point
of compliance the quality of any aquifer that at the time of the issuance of
the permit violates the aquifer quality standard for that pollutant.

C. An applicant shall satisfy the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of
this section either by making a demonstration that the facility will meet the
criteria of that paragraph or by agreeing to utilize the appropriate
presumptive controls adopted by the director pursuant to section 49-243.01,
subsection A.
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


D. In assessing technology, processes, operating methods and other
alternatives for the purposes of this section, "practicable" means able to be
reasonably done from the standpoint of technical practicality and, except for
pollutants addressed in subsection I of this section, economically achievable
on an industry-wide basis.

E. The determination of economic impact on an industry-wide basis for
purposes of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section shall take into account
differences in industry sectors, the type and size of the operation and the
reasonableness of applying controls in an arid or semiarid setting.

F. Control measures designed to further reduce discharge may not be
required if the director determines that site specific conditions, in
conjunction with technology, processes, operating methods or other
alternatives are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection B,
paragraph 1 of this section.

G. A discharging facility at an open pit mining operation shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section if the
director determines that both of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The mine pit creates a passive containment that is sufficient to capture the
pollutants discharged and that is hydrologically isolated to the extent that it
does not allow pollutant migration from the capture zone. For the purposes
of this paragraph, "passive containment" means natural or engineered
topographical, geological or hydrological control measures that can operate
without continuous maintenance. Monitoring and inspections to confirm
performance of the passive containment do not constitute maintenance.

2. The discharging facility employs additional processes, operating methods
or other alternatives to minimize discharge.

H. The director shall issue a permit to a person for water storage at a storage
facility proposed under title 45, chapter 3.1 if the person demonstrates that
the facility will be so designed, constructed and operated as to ensure that
the project will not cause or contribute to the violation of any standard
adopted pursuant to section 49-223 at the applicable point of compliance for
the facility.

I. With respect to the following pollutants, the permit applicant for a new
facility must meet the criteria of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section to
limit discharges to the maximum extent practicable regardless of cost:
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


1. Any organic substance listed by the secretary of the department of health
and human services pursuant to 42 United States Code section 241(b)(4), as
known to be carcinogens or reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens.

2. Any organic substance listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section
261.33(e), regardless of whether the substance is a waste subject to
regulation under the resource conservation recovery act ( P.L. 94-580; 90
Stat. 2795).

3. Any organic toxic pollutant that the director lists by rule after determining
that minute amounts of that pollutant in drinking water will present a
substantial short-term or long-term human health threat.

J. The director, by rule, may prescribe requirements for issuing a single
permit applicable to all similar facilities under common ownership and
located in a contiguous geographic area in lieu of an individual permit for
each facility.

K. The director shall consider and may prescribe in the permit the following
terms and conditions as necessary to ensure compliance with this article:

1. Monitoring requirements.

2. Record keeping and reporting requirements.

3. Contingency plan requirements.

4. Discharge limitations.

5. Compliance schedule requirements.

6. Closure requirements and, for a facility that cannot achieve clean closure,
postclosure monitoring and maintenance requirements.

7. Alert levels that, when exceeded, may require adjustments of permit
conditions or appropriate actions as are required by the contingency plans.

8. Such other terms and conditions as the director deems necessary to
ensure compliance with this article.

L. With the consent of the applicant or permittee, the director may include
in an aquifer protection permit for an existing facility the requirement that
the applicant or permittee undertake a remedial action, as defined in section
49-281, to prevent, minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or
welfare or to the waters of the state resulting from a discharge that occurred
before August 13, 1986, if the following conditions are met:
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


1. The selection of remedial action, including the level and extent of cleanup,
was determined according to the criteria in section 49-282.06 and the rules
adopted pursuant to that section.

2. The pollutant that was discharged constituted a hazardous substance.

M. With the consent of the applicant or permittee, the director may include
in an aquifer protection permit as a condition the mitigation measures
authorized under section 49-286 instead of issuing a mitigation order under
section 49-286.

N. The director may deny a permit for a facility if the director determines
that the applicant is incapable of fully carrying out the terms and conditions
of the permit, including any conditions that require monitoring or installing
and maintaining discharge control measures. The following apply to an
application for a permit or to an issued permit:

1. The director may require the applicant to furnish information, such as
past performance, including compliance with or violations of similar laws or
rules, and technical and financial competence, relevant to its capability to
comply with the permit terms and conditions.

2. For the purposes of evaluating an applicant's financial competence for
closure, the director may consider a closure strategy and cost estimate
rather than a detailed closure plan. Except for a state or federal agency or a
county, city, town or other local governmental entity, the cost estimate shall
be based on the cost for the applicant or permittee to hire a third party to
conduct the closure strategy or plan unless the financial responsibility
mechanism provided pursuant to this subsection is a self-assurance or a
guarantee and the director determines that the applicant or permittee is
technically and financially capable of closing the facility at its own cost and,
if necessary, of conducting post-closure monitoring and maintenance.
Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local
governmental entity, the permittee shall update its cost estimate:

(a) For the duration of the permit on a periodic basis as scheduled in the
permit but not more frequently than once every five years. The cost estimate
shall be updated to adjust for inflation or as necessary to reflect increased or
decreased costs resulting from changes to the facility or to the facility
closure strategy or plan, or to any other relevant conditions related to the
facility.

(b) For a significant amendment as defined by rule adopted by the director,
if required to address incremental changes in the cost estimate that result
from the significant amendment.

   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


3. Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local
governmental entity, the applicant or permittee shall demonstrate financial
responsibility to cover the estimated costs to close the facility and, if
necessary, to conduct post-closure monitoring and maintenance by
providing to the director for approval a financial assurance mechanism or
combination of mechanisms as prescribed in rules adopted by the director
or in 40 code of federal regulations section 264.143 (f)(1) and (10) as of
january 1, 2014. An applicant or permittee that demonstrates financial
responsibility by means of a self-assurance or guarantee shall aggregate the
estimated closure and post-closure costs for all aquifer protection permits in
this state for which the applicant, permittee or guarantor has provided a
self-assurance or a guarantee in order to determine whether the applicant,
permittee or guarantor meets the applicable financial test.

4. The permittee shall maintain its demonstration of financial responsibility
prescribed in this subsection for the duration of the individual permit.
Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local
governmental entity, the permittee shall periodically demonstrate financial
responsibility and report to the director that the financial assurance
mechanism is being maintained as scheduled in the permit and as
prescribed in paragraph 3 of this subsection but not more frequently than
once every two years. The permit's applicable reporting schedule shall be
based on the type of financial assurance mechanism that is selected
pursuant to this subsection.

5. A demonstration of financial responsibility made for a facility as
prescribed by section 49-770 shall suffice, in whole or in part, for any
demonstration of financial responsibility prescribed by this section.

6. A demonstration of financial assurance or competence required under
this section or section 49-770 for a facility shall not be required before
completion of construction but shall be required before the department
issues approval to operate. Financial assurance for a facility is not required
pursuant to this section if substantially similar financial assurance for that
facility is required and has been provided pursuant to other federal, state or
local laws, and evidence of that financial assurance is filed with the director.

7. Financial information required to be supplied under this subsection is
confidential.

O. The director shall require an applicant for an individual permit to submit
evidence that the discharging facility complies with applicable municipal or
county zoning ordinances and regulations. The director shall not issue the
permit unless it appears from the evidence submitted by the applicant that
the facility complies with the applicable zoning ordinances and regulations.
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


P. The director may issue a single area-wide permit applicable to facilities
under common ownership and located in a contiguous geographic area in
lieu of an individual permit for each facility. In issuing an area-wide permit,
the demonstration required under subsection B, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this
section may be considered collectively for all facilities included in the
permit. The director may evaluate discharge reduction collectively for
existing facilities in the pollutant management area by considering any one
or all of the factors set forth in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section. The
director may consolidate those permit conditions listed in subsection K of
this section that have general applicability to the facilities included in the
area-wide permit. An area-wide permit shall specify all of the following:

1. A description of the pollutant management area and point or points of
compliance.

2. Those facilities that have been evaluated individually for meeting the
criteria in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section and that are included in
the area-wide permit.

3. For multiple facilities within the pollutant management area that are
substantially similar in nature and, considered alone, would have a small
discharge impact area compared to other facilities in the area, narrative
permit conditions may be used to define the best available demonstrated
control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives
consistent with subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section replacing the need
for an individual technical review.

4. A compliance schedule for submittal and evaluation of information
regarding design and discharge for existing facilities within the pollutant
management area that, because of the small size, quantity or quality of
discharge, or physical location with regard to the point or points of
compliance, the director has determined that review for the purposes of
subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section shall be conducted in the future. In
determining the requirements and length of a compliance schedule for an
area-wide permit, the director shall consider the character and impact of the
discharge, the nature of the activities necessary to prepare appropriate
technical submittals, the number of persons potentially affected by the
discharge, the current state of treatment technology, and the age of the
facility.

Q. The director may expedite processing of an aquifer protection permit
application by a permit applicant who proposes a new facility to discharge
liquids that do not contain any pollutant in a concentration that exceeds a
numeric aquifer water quality standard. The director shall not require the
applicant to complete a hydrogeologic study in order to obtain the permit
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


unless the permit applicant is relying on site specific characteristics to meet
the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section or unless the
study is necessary to demonstrate compliance with narrative aquifer water
quality standards. Applications made pursuant to this subsection shall have
precedence and be considered by the department before all other aquifer
protection permit applications.

ARS 49-243.01 Presumptive best available demonstrated control
     technology (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-243.01. Presumptive best available demonstrated control
technology

A. The director may establish, by rule, presumptive best available
demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other
alternatives, consistent with section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 1, for a
class of facilities, if the director determines that the facilities in that class are
substantially similar in nature. Once presumptive controls are established by
rule for a particular class of facilities the director shall review those rules
every five years and, if appropriate, revise the rules for that class of facilities.

B. An owner or operator of a facility who applies for an individual permit
under section 49-243 shall be deemed to have demonstrated that the design
meets the requirements of section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 1, if the
application incorporates the presumptive controls for that class of facilities
established pursuant to subsection A of this section.

C. A person or group of persons who own or operate facilities that are
required to obtain a permit pursuant to this article may petition the director
to establish by rule presumptive best available demonstrated control
technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives for that class
of facilities. The director may grant the petition if he determines that the
following conditions have been met:

1. The petition identifies the class of facilities for which rule adoption is
requested.

2. The petition includes a description of the presumptive controls for the
requested class of facilities.

3. The petition complies with section 41-1033.

4. The class of facilities described in the petition satisfies subsection A of this
section.

D. The owner or operator of a facility with a permit shall not be required to
obtain a new or modified permit because of rules adopted or revised
pursuant to subsection A of this section. Any complete application that is
filed before the effective date of any rules adopted or revised pursuant to this
section shall be processed by the department without requiring compliance
with the rules adopted or revised pursuant to subsection A of this section.
ARS 49-244 Point of compliance (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                          Edition))


ยง 49-244. Point of compliance

The director shall designate a point or points of compliance for each facility
receiving a permit under this article. For the purposes of this chapter, the
point of compliance is the point at which compliance must be determined
for either the aquifer water quality standards or, if an aquifer water quality
standard is exceeded at the time the aquifer protection permit is issued, the
requirement that there be no further degradation of the aquifer as provided
in section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 3. The point of compliance shall
be a vertical plane downgradient of the facility that extends through the
uppermost aquifers underlying that facility. For an aquifer that has no
existing or reasonably foreseeable drinking water beneficial use, the director
may establish monitoring for compliance in another aquifer in lieu of
monitoring in the uppermost aquifer. The point of compliance shall be
determined as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this section , for a pollutant that is a
hazardous substance the point of compliance is the limit of the pollutant
management area. The pollutant management area is the limit projected in
the horizontal plane of the area on which pollutants are or will be placed.
The pollutant management area includes horizontal space taken up by any
liner, dike or other barrier designed to contain pollutants in the facility. If
the facility contains more than one discharging activity, the pollutant
management area is described by an imaginary line circumscribing the
several discharging activities.

2. A point of compliance for hazardous substances other than that identified
in paragraph 1 of this section may be approved by the director if the facility
owner or operator can demonstrate either:

(a) That it is technically impracticable or inappropriate considering the
likely fate or transport of a pollutant in an aquifer to monitor at the
boundary specified in paragraph 1 of this section.

(b) The alternative point of compliance will allow installation and operation
of the monitoring facilities that are substantially less costly. Such a request
by a facility owner or operator under this paragraph must be supported by
an analysis of the volume and characteristics of the pollutants that may be
discharged and the ability of the vadose zone to attenuate the particular
pollutants that may be discharged, including such factors as climate,
hydrology, geology and soil chemistry. In no event shall an alternative point
of compliance be further from the boundary specified in paragraph 1 of this
section than is necessary for purposes of this paragraph, subdivisions (a)
and (b) of this paragraph , and in no event shall it be so located as to result
in an increased threat to an existing or reasonably foreseeable drinking
ARS 49-244 Point of compliance (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                          Edition))


water source. In addition an alternate compliance point for a hazardous
substance pursuant to this subdivision shall never be further downgradient
than any of the following:

(i) The property boundary.

(ii) Any point of an existing or reasonably foreseeable future drinking water
source.

(iii) Seven hundred fifty feet from the edge of the pollutant management
area.

3. For pollutants that are not hazardous substances the director, in
identifying a point of compliance, shall take into account the volume and
characteristics of the pollutants, the practical difficulties associated with
implementation of applicable water pollution control requirements, whether
the facility is a new facility or an existing facility, water conservation and
augmentation and the site-specific characteristics of the facility, including,
but not limited to, climate, hydrology, geology, soil chemistry and pollutant
levels in the aquifer. The point of compliance must be so located as to ensure
protection of all current and reasonably foreseeable future uses of the
aquifer.

ยง 49-245. Criteria for issuing general permit

A. The director may issue by rule a general permit for a defined class of
facilities if all of the following apply:

1. The cost of issuing individual permits cannot be justified by any
environmental or public health benefit that may be gained from issuing
individual permits.

2. The facilities, activities or practices in the class are substantially similar in
nature.

3. The director is satisfied that appropriate conditions under a general
permit for operating the facilities or conducting the activity will meet the
applicable requirements in section 49-243 or, as to facilities for which the
director has established best management practices, section 49-246.

B. In addition to other applicable enforcement actions, if a person violates
the conditions of a general permit, the director may revoke the general
permit for that person and require that the person obtain an individual
permit. A general permit may be revoked, modified or suspended at any
time by the director if necessary to comply with this chapter.

C. Rules establishing a general permit shall include terms and conditions to
ensure that all discharges and facilities will meet the requirements of this
chapter and shall provide for the collective or individual revocation of the
general permit if necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

D. Rules adopted pursuant to subsection A of this section may require a
person who owns or operates a facility seeking coverage under a general
permit to notify the director of the person's intent to operate the facility
pursuant to the general permit and pay the applicable fee required pursuant
to section 49-203.

ยง 49-245.01. Storm water general permit

A. A general permit is issued for facilities used solely for the management of
storm water and that are regulated by the clean water act, including
catchments, impoundments and sumps, provided the following conditions
are met:

1. The owner or operator of the facility has obtained a national pollutant
discharge elimination system permit issued pursuant to the clean water act
for any storm water discharges at the facility, or that the facility has applied,
and not been denied coverage, for this type of permit for any storm water
discharges at the facility.

2. The owner or operator notifies the director that the facility has met the
requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. The owner or operator of the facility has in place any required storm
water pollution prevention plan.

B. If the director determines that discharges of storm water from a facility or
facilities covered by this general permit are causing a violation of aquifer
water quality standards at the applicable point of compliance, the director
may revoke the general permit of the facility or facilities or may require that
an individual permit be obtained pursuant to section 49-243. If the director
determines that discharges of storm water from a facility or facilities covered
by this general permit, with reasonable probability, may cause a violation of
aquifer water quality standards at the applicable point of compliance, the
director may require a facility or facilities covered by the general permit to
obtain an individual permit pursuant to section 49-243.

determine that protection of aquifer water quality standards can be
accomplished through development and implementation of a best
management practice for the class of discharge.

2. Assign a specific advisory committee to create the specific class best
management practice to regulate the problem and report its
recommendations to the director on a specified schedule.

3. On issuing a general permit containing best management practices, make
a reasonable effort to notify persons conducting or managing the activity
subject to the best management practices of the requirements of the best
management practices contained in the general permit.

B. The director may establish best management practices for the following
facilities or activities:

1. On-site facilities for urban runoff.

2. Storm sewers.

3. Urban runoff.

4. Silvicultural activities.

5. Septic tank systems.

ยง 49-247. Agricultural general permits; best management
practices for regulated agricultural activities

A. The director shall adopt by rule , pursuant to the requirements of this
section, agricultural general permits consisting of best management
practices for regulated agricultural activities. Agricultural general permits
are not subject to section 49-245 or 49-246. Except as provided in
subsection G of this section, a person is not required to obtain an individual
permit for a regulated agricultural activity.

B. The terms and conditions of agricultural general permits adopted
pursuant to this section shall be agricultural best management practices
which have been determined by the director to be the most practical and
effective means of reducing or preventing the discharge of pollutants by
regulated agricultural activities. Agricultural best management practices
may vary within the state, according to regional and hydrogeologic
conditions. The director may waive the use of best management practices in
a designated region if the director determines that existing regulated
agricultural activities will not cause or contribute to a violation of the
adopted water quality standards.

C. The director shall adopt, by rule, agricultural best management practices .

D. In adopting agricultural best management practices, the director shall
consider:

1. The availability, the effectiveness and the economic and institutional
considerations of alternative technologies.

2. The potential nature and severity of discharges from regulated
agricultural activities and their effect on public health and the environment.

E. In adopting best management practices for regulated agricultural
activities, the director shall require the application of all economically
feasible best management practices which have been determined by the
director to be the most practical and effective means of reducing or
preventing the discharge of pollutants by regulated agricultural activities but
shall not require application of more stringent practices if such a
requirement would result in cessation of the regulated activity.

F. Compliance with best management practices adopted pursuant to this
section constitutes compliance with this article.

G. If the director, after providing a person with notice and an opportunity
for a hearing , determines that the person has violated the applicable best
management practices, the director may revoke the agricultural general

to section 49-241.

H. The director may periodically reexamine, evaluate and propose any
modification to or waiver of agricultural best management practices
necessary to meet the requirements of this article .

ยง 49-256. [For Repeal, See Note] Adoption and enactment of
federal definitions

For the purposes of this article and for establishing primacy for this state's
dredge and fill permit program under 33 United States code section 1344,
the following definitions are adopted and enacted as follows:

1. "Compensatory mitigation" means the restoration (re-establishment or
rehabilitation), establishment (creation), enhancement, and/or in certain
circumstances preservation of aquatic resources for the purposes of
offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all appropriate
and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved.

2. "Dredged material" means material that is excavated or dredged from
NAVIGABLE waters.

3. "Fill material" means:

(a) Except as specified in subdivision (c) of this definition, the term fill
material means material placed in NAVIGABLE waters where the material
has the effect of:

(i) Replacing any portion of a NAVIGABLE water with dry land; or

(ii) Changing the bottom elevation of any portion of a NAVIGABLE water.

(b) Examples of such fill material include, but are not limited to: rock, sand,
soil, clay, plastics, construction debris, wood chips, overburden from mining
or other excavation activities, and materials used to create any structure or
infrastructure in the NAVIGABLE waters.

(c) The term fill material does not include trash or garbage.

4. "General permit" means a permit authorizing a category of discharges of
dredged or fill material under this article. General permits are permits for
categories of discharge which are similar in nature, will cause only minimal
adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have
only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.

5. "In-lieu fee program" means a program involving the restoration,
establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation of aquatic resources
through funds paid to a governmental or non-profit natural resources
management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements for
dredge and fill permits issued pursuant to this article. Similar to but distinct
from a mitigation bank, an in-lieu fee program sells compensatory
mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory
  ARS 49-256 [For Repeal, See Note] Adoption and enactment of
   federal definitions (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


mitigation is then transferred to the in-lieu program sponsor. The operation
and use of an in-lieu fee program are governed by an in-lieu fee program
instrument.

6. "Mitigation bank" means a site, or suite of sites, where resources (e.g.,
wetlands, streams, riparian areas) are restored, established, enhanced,
and/or preserved for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation for
impacts authorized by dredge and fill permits issued pursuant to this article.
In general, a mitigation bank sells compensatory mitigation credits to
permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then
transferred to the mitigation bank sponsor. The operation and use of a
mitigation bank are governed by a mitigation banking instrument.

7. "Party Affected by a Jurisdictional Determination" means a permit
applicant, landowner, a lease, easement or option holder, or other individual
who has an identifiable and substantial legal interest in the property (OR A
PERSON ACTING WITH THE APPROVAL OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING)
who has received an approved jurisdictional determination.

8. "Permittee-responsible mitigation" means an aquatic resource
restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activity
undertaken by the permittee (or an authorized agent or contractor) to
provide compensatory mitigation for which the permittee retains full
responsibility.

9. "Practicable" means available and capable of being done after taking into
consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall
project purposes.

10. "Wetlands" means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that
under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically
adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include
swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

written determination that an emergency exists.

B. Any reasonable, necessary and cost-effective remedial action costs
incurred by the director pursuant to this section in response to a release or a
threat of a release of a hazardous substance that presents an imminent and
substantial endangerment to the public health or the environment may be
recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general against any
responsible party as prescribed by section 49-285, subsection A. This
subsection does not preclude the department from initiating actions under
other provisions of state or federal law. With respect to any reasonable,
necessary and cost-effective remedial action costs incurred by the director
pursuant to this section in responding to a release or a threat of a release of
a pollutant, the attorney general may recover those costs in a civil action
against a person only to the extent otherwise permitted by statute or the

A. On the request of any person, the director may take interim remedial
actions to address the loss or reduction of available water from a well before
the selection of a remedy, including making grants from the water quality
assurance revolving fund to provide alternative water supplies, well
replacement or water treatment if the director determines that both of the
following apply:

1. The well currently supplies water for municipal, domestic, industrial,
irrigation or agricultural uses or is currently part of a public water system.

2. The well produces water or, in the reasonably foreseeable future, will
produce water that is not fit for its current or reasonably foreseeable end use
without treatment due to the release of hazardous substances at or from a
site on the registry established pursuant to section 49-287.01, subsection D.

B. The interim remedial action taken by the director pursuant to subsection
A of this section shall be the minimum necessary to address the loss or
reduction of available water until a remedy is selected. The director, to the
extent possible, shall consider potential remedies when selecting the interim
remedial action pursuant to subsection A of this section. The interim
remedial action shall not include the costs of reimbursement for costs
already incurred. The director may choose not to take interim remedial
action pursuant to subsection A of this section if the director has sufficient
information to reasonably establish that the person requesting the remedial
action may be responsible under this article for the release of hazardous
substances contaminating the well. Notwithstanding this section, the
director shall select remedies pursuant to section 49-287.04.

C. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, if the director, in the record
of decision, determines that the remedial action taken pursuant to
subsection A of this section was not necessary, based on the criteria in
section 49-282.06 and the rules adopted pursuant to that section, or if the
person requesting the remedial action pursuant to subsection A of this
section is later determined to be responsible under this article for the release
of hazardous substances which contaminated or threatened to contaminate
the well, that person shall reimburse the water quality assurance revolving
fund for the costs incurred in taking the remedial action. The person
requesting the interim remedial action shall make arrangements for
financial assurance for the obligation to the satisfaction of the director. The
attorney general shall file an action for reimbursement of costs pursuant to
this section if requested by the director and may file an action on his own
initiative.

A. The director of environmental quality, in consultation with the director of
water resources, may inspect wells for vertical cross-contamination of
groundwater by hazardous substances and may take appropriate remedial
actions to prevent or mitigate this cross-contamination at no cost to the well
owner, subject to subsection D of this section. The director shall consult with
and seek the voluntary compliance of affected well owners regarding well
access, investigations and remedial actions. On receiving permission from
the well owner or operator, the director or the director's designee may enter
property owned or operated by the well owner at reasonable times under any
of the following circumstances:

1. To inspect and collect samples from a well and to inspect and copy all
documents or records relating to the well. If a sample is obtained pursuant
to this section, the director, before leaving the property, shall give to the well
owner or operator a receipt describing the sample obtained and, if
requested, a portion of each sample. A copy of the results of any analysis
made of these samples shall be furnished promptly to the well owner.

2. To conduct appropriate remedial actions regarding vertical cross-
contamination or to investigate liability regarding contamination of
groundwater caused by vertical cross-contamination.

B. The director of environmental quality shall notify the director of water
resources of the results of the inspection and shall provide copies of its
records and documents and the analysis of any samples taken. If it is
determined that a well results in vertical cross-contamination, the director
of environmental quality, upon receiving permission from the well owner or
operator, may take appropriate remedial action, including well modification,
abandonment or replacement, or provision of a replacement water supply.

C. A well owner who is not a responsible party pursuant to this article and
who cooperates with the investigation and remedial activities of the director
and the department of water resources to the extent possible consistent with
its water delivery responsibilities and system operational requirements shall
receive a covenant not to sue for secondary contamination resulting from
the well unless the well owner had actual knowledge of groundwater
contamination and constructed a well in violation of well construction
requirements administered by the director of water resources, resulting in
vertical cross-contamination of an aquifer.

D. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, if the director takes
remedial action pursuant to subsection A of this section and the well owner
or operator is later determined to be responsible under this article for a

owner or operator responsible for the release shall reimburse the fund for
the owner or operator's proportionate share of the costs incurred in taking
the action.

2. To the extent practicable, provide for the control, management or cleanup
of the hazardous substances in order to allow the maximum beneficial use of
the waters of the state.

3. Be reasonable, necessary, cost-effective and technically feasible.

B. The director shall adopt rules necessary to implement this article. The
director may adopt CERCLA rules, guidelines or procedures by reference to
the extent consistent with this article. Rules adopted pursuant to this
subsection shall include rules for:

1. The use of monies from the fund, including establishing priorities for the
use of the monies from the fund.

2. The scoring and rescoring of sites or portions of sites.

3. The criteria for a finding of no further action for sites pursuant to section

4. The selection of remedial actions including the establishment of the level
and extent of cleanup at a site or a portion of a site. The rules shall provide
for the selection of a remedial action by comparison of alternative remedial
actions, which may include no action, monitoring, source control, controlled
migration, physical containment, plume remediation and the consideration
of the criteria in subsection C of this section. The rules also shall provide
that the selected remedial action meet the requirements of subsection A of
this section and the following:

(a) For remediation of soil, the selected remedial action shall be consistent
with the soil remediation standards adopted pursuant to section 49-152.

(b) For remediation of waters of the state, the selected remedial action shall
address, at a minimum, any well that at the time of selection of the remedial
action either supplies water for municipal, domestic, industrial, irrigation or
agricultural uses or is part of a public water system if the well would now or
in the reasonably foreseeable future produce water that would not be fit for
its current or reasonably foreseeable end uses without treatment due to the
release of hazardous substances. The specific measures to address any such
well shall not reduce the supply of water available to the owner of the well.

5. Incentives for initiating early remedial actions and implementing
innovative remedial technologies.

C. In adopting the rules required by this section and in selecting remedial
actions, the director shall consider the following factors:

1. Population, environmental and welfare concerns at risk.

2. Routes of exposure.

3. Amount, concentration, hazardous properties, environmental fate, such as
the ability to bioaccumulate, persistence and probability of reaching the
waters of the state, and the form of the substance present.

4. Physical factors affecting human and environmental exposure such as
hydrogeology, climate and the extent of previous and expected migration.

5. The extent to which the amount of water available for beneficial use will
be preserved by a particular type of remedial action.

6. The technical practicality and cost-effectiveness of alternative remedial
actions applicable to a site.

7. The availability of other appropriate federal or state remedial action and
enforcement mechanisms, including, to the extent consistent with this
article, funding sources established under CERCLA, to respond to the
release.

D. Notwithstanding this article, the director may approve a remedial action
that may result in water quality exceeding water quality standards after the
completion of the remedy if the director finds that the remedial action meets
the requirements of this section.

E. The director's approval pursuant to this section does not affect the
classification of an aquifer pursuant to section 49-224.

          (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-283. Responsible party liability exemptions; definitions

A. For purposes of imposing liability under this article, and except as
provided in this section, a person is deemed the party responsible for the
release or threatened release of a hazardous substance if the person:

1. Owned or operated the facility:

(a) When the hazardous substance was placed or came to be located in or on
the facility.

(b) When the hazardous substance was located in or on the facility but
before the release.

(c) During the time of the release or threatened release.

2. Owned or possessed the hazardous substance and arranged, by contract,
agreement or otherwise, for the disposal, treatment or transport for disposal
or treatment of the hazardous substance.

3. Accepted for transport to a disposal or treatment facility waste that
contained a hazardous substance and either selected the facility to which it
was transported or disposed of it in a manner contrary to law.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, a person that owns real
property is not a responsible party if there is a release or threatened release
of a hazardous substance from a facility in or on the property unless one or
more of the following applies to that person:

1. Was engaged in the business of generating, transporting, storing, treating
or disposing of a hazardous substance at the facility or disposing of waste at
the facility, or knowingly permitted others to engage in such a business at
the facility.

2. Permitted any person to use the facility for disposal of a hazardous
substance.

3. Knew or reasonably should have known that a hazardous substance was
located in or on the facility at the time right, title or interest in the property
was first acquired by the person and engaged in conduct by which he
associated himself with the release. For the purpose of this paragraph, a
written warranty, representation or undertaking, which is set forth in an
instrument conveying any right, title or interest in the real property and
which is executed by the person conveying the right, title or interest, or
which is set forth in any memorandum of any such instrument executed for
the purpose of recording, is admissible as evidence of whether the person
 ARS 49-283 Responsible party liability exemptions; definitions
          (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


acquiring any right, title or interest in the real property knew or reasonably
should have known that a hazardous substance was located in or on the
facility. For purposes of this paragraph, "associated himself with the release"
means having actual knowledge of the release and taking action or failing to
take action that the person is authorized to take and that increases the
volume or toxicity of the hazardous substance that has been released.

4. Took action which significantly contributed to the release after he knew or
reasonably should have known that a hazardous substance was located in or
on the facility.

C. Any liability which accrues to an owner of real property under this section
does not accrue to any other person who is not an owner of the real property
merely because the other person holds some right, title or interest in the real
property. An owner of real property on which a public utility easement is
located is not a responsible party with respect to any release caused by any
act or omission of the public utility which holds the easement in carrying out
the specific use for which the easement was granted.

D. A person otherwise deemed a responsible party is not liable under this
article if he can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release
or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the resulting damages were
caused solely by:

1. An act of God.

2. An act of war.

3. An act or omission of a third party, whether lawful or unlawful including
acts of vandalism or unlawful disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous
substances, other than an employee or agent of that person or other than
one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual
relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with that person, unless the sole
contractual arrangement arises from a published tariff and acceptance for
carriage by a common carrier by rail, if that person establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that:

(a) He exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance
concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of the hazardous
substance in light of all relevant facts and circumstances.

(b) He took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such
third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such
acts or omissions.
 ARS 49-283 Responsible party liability exemptions; definitions

4. A release or threatened release which was subject to limits or conditions
in a federal permit or a state permit relating to the protection of public
health or the environment and the operation of the releasing facility has
been and is in compliance with applicable limits or conditions.

5. The application of a pesticide product registered under the federal
insecticide, fungicide, and rodenticide act (61 Stat. 163) and applied
according to label requirements.

6. Liability has been assumed by the federal postclosure liability fund
established under 42 United States Code section 9607(k).

7. Any combination of paragraphs 1 through 6 of this subsection.

E. A person is not a responsible party with respect to a hazardous substance
that is located on or beneath property that is owned or occupied by that
person if the hazardous substance is present solely because it migrated from
property that is not owned or occupied by that person and that person is not
otherwise a responsible party as prescribed by subsection A, paragraph 2 or
3.

F. A person is not liable for costs or damages incurred solely as a result of an
action taken or omitted while rendering care, assistance or advice that is
consistent with rules adopted by the director, is consistent with the national
contingency plan or is under the direction of an on-scene coordinator
appointed pursuant to the national contingency plan and that is rendered
with respect to a release or a threat of a release of a hazardous substance
that creates a danger to public health or the environment. This subsection
does not preclude liability for costs or damages that result from that person's
negligence.

G. A state or local government and its employees or authorized
representatives are not liable for costs or damages incurred as a result of an
action taken in response to an emergency created by the release or
threatened release of a hazardous substance that is generated by or from a
facility owned by another person. This subsection does not preclude liability
for costs or damages that result from gross negligence or intentional
misconduct by this state or local government. For purposes of this
subsection, reckless, willful or wanton misconduct constitutes gross
negligence.

H. A person who maintains indicia of ownership in a property primarily to
protect a security interest in a facility and who does not participate in the
management of the facility is not liable as an owner or operator of that
 ARS 49-283 Responsible party liability exemptions; definitions
          (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


facility pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to a person
who does any of the following:

1. Through intentional misconduct or gross negligence causes, contributes to
or aggravates the release of a hazardous substance.

2. Fails to disclose to the facility's purchaser the known presence of a release
or a threatened release of a hazardous substance at the time of sale or
divestiture of the facility or the security interest in the facility.

3. Fails to obtain a phase I environmental assessment of the facility that
complies with standards adopted by rule pursuant to subsection K of this
section at the time of or at a reasonable time before foreclosure. This
paragraph does not apply to residential properties with fewer than five
residential units.

4. Fails to do any of the following after acquiring ownership of the facility:

(a) Provide the department reasonable access so that the necessary remedial
actions may be conducted.

(b) Undertake reasonable steps to control access to the area of known
presence of a release of a hazardous substance to protect the public health
and welfare and the environment.

(c) Act diligently to sell or otherwise divest the property within two years of
the lender's possession or ownership, whichever is earlier.

I. A fiduciary is not personally liable as an owner or operator pursuant to
this section. This section does not preclude claims against assets held in an
estate, a trust or other fiduciary capacity for the release or a threatened
release of a hazardous substance from one of the assets. This section does
not apply if either of the following apply:

1. A fiduciary through intentional misconduct or gross negligence causes,
aggravates or contributes to the release or threatened release of hazardous
substances or permits others to do so, except that a fiduciary shall not be
liable for the intentional misconduct or gross negligence of any
nonemployee agent or independent contractor if the fiduciary has not
specifically directed the nonemployee agent or independent contractor to
perform the grossly negligent act or engage in the intentional misconduct.

2. The appointment of the fiduciary is for the purpose of avoiding liability
under this article. It is prima facie evidence that the fiduciary was appointed
to avoid liability under this article if the facility is the only substantial asset
in the fiduciary estate.

A. Except as otherwise provided in section 49-283, a person who is a
responsible party shall be strictly and severally liable for such reasonable,
necessary and cost-effective expenditures for remedial actions as are
incurred by this state, a political subdivision of this state or any other person
in a manner consistent with the rules and procedures adopted under section
49-282.06, but not including nonrecoverable costs. A responsible party may
be held liable for remedial action costs for a release of a hazardous substance
even though the conduct that resulted in the release or the release itself
occurred before August 13, 1986.

B. In order to preserve any right to recover remedial action costs from
responsible parties, remedial actions conducted by this state, a political
subdivision of this state or any other person shall when evaluated as a whole
be in substantial compliance with the rules and procedures adopted
pursuant to section 49-282.06. The director's approval of a remedial action
that is conducted by a person other than the state is not required to preserve
any right to recover remedial action costs from potentially responsible
parties. Any person other than the state who undertakes a remedial action
may request that the director approve the remedial action as prescribed by
rules adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06 at any time before, during or
after the remedial action. The director's decision shall be in writing and shall
specify the basis of the decision. Any remedial action so approved by the
director shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the rules and
procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06. Any person who
requests the director's approval of a remedial action shall reimburse the
department for the total reasonable cost to the department for the review of
the remedial action unless the director waives all or a part of the
reimbursement. These monies shall be deposited in the water quality
assurance revolving fund established by section 49-282. Costs that are
reimbursed to the department by a party that obtains the director's approval
of remedial actions pursuant to this subsection constitute remedial action
costs that may be recovered from responsible parties.

C. Any person who is a defendant in an enforcement proceeding brought
under section 49-287 may join in the action any other person who is or may
be a responsible party.

including common law, for damages, injury or loss resulting from a release
of any hazardous substance or for remedial action costs, except that any
person who receives compensation for remedial action costs pursuant to this

article is precluded from recovering compensation for the same remedial
action costs pursuant to any other federal or state law. Any person who
receives compensation for remedial action costs pursuant to any other
federal or state law is precluded from receiving compensation for the same
remedial action costs as provided in this article.

E. In allocating several liability between two or more potentially responsible
parties, the department, an allocator pursuant to section 49-287.06 or a
court shall consider the following to determine each responsible party's
allocated shares and the orphan shares:

1. The amount and concentration of each hazardous substance involved.

2. The degree of toxicity of each hazardous substance involved.

3. The degree of involvement by the responsible parties in the generation,
transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of the hazardous substance.

F. After the allocated shares and the orphan shares are determined pursuant
to subsection E of this section and reduced to writing, the department, an
allocator or the court may consider the following factors to adjust the
allocated shares of the responsible parties, except that any adjustment under
this subsection shall not adjust the amount allocated to orphan shares:

1. The magnitude of the risk to human health or the environment caused by
each hazardous substance involved.

2. The degree of cooperation by the responsible party with federal, state or
local officials to prevent any harm to the public health or the environment.

3. Any other factors deemed relevant by the department, an allocator or the
court in determining the liability of the parties under this section.

G. An action brought by a person other than the state to recover remedial
action costs from a responsible party shall be brought within three years of
the completion of the remedial action or within six years of the initiation of
on-site physical construction activities for the remediation, removal or
disposal of hazardous substances, whichever is earlier.

H. In an action brought for recovery of remedial action costs incurred at a
site not on the registry maintained pursuant to section 49-287.01 or that is
brought pursuant to section 49-287.07, subsection A, paragraph 3,
subdivision (a), (b) or (d), the court shall initially allocate costs among the
responsible parties based on the factors listed in subsection E of this section.
To the extent that the allocation results in costs being allocated to orphan

shares, those costs shall be reallocated to the responsible parties based on
such equitable factors as the court deems appropriate, including:

1. The factors listed in subsection F of this section.

2. Each responsible party's ability to pay.

3. The degree of care exercised by each responsible party with respect to the
hazardous substance of concern and taking into account the characteristics
of that substance.

A. The department may provide, pursuant to section 49-292, to a
prospective purchaser of a facility a written release and a covenant not to sue
and may also agree to seek an order of the court granting approval of a
settlement that includes immunity from contribution claims for any
potential liability for existing contamination under this article or CERCLA if
all of the following conditions are met:

1. The facility is within a site identified on the registry maintained by the
department pursuant to section 49-287.01 or the department has been
provided sufficient information to reasonably identify the extent of the
contamination at the facility.

2. The person is not currently liable for an existing or threatened release of a
hazardous substance at the facility.

3. The proposed redevelopment or reuse of the facility will not contribute to
or exacerbate existing known contamination or unreasonably interfere with
remedial measures necessary at the facility or cause the contamination to
present a substantial health risk to the public.

4. The agreement will provide a substantial public benefit that may include
any of the following:

(a) An agreement by the prospective purchaser to provide substantial
funding or other resources to perform or facilitate remedial measures at the
facility pursuant to this chapter.

(b) An agreement by the prospective purchaser to perform substantial
remedial measures at the facility pursuant to this chapter.

(c) Productive reuse of a vacant or abandoned industrial or commercial
facility.

(d) Development of a facility by a governmental entity or nonprofit
organization to address an important public purpose.

(e) Creation of conservation or recreation areas.

B. If the prospective purchaser of a facility is affiliated with any other person
who is a party responsible for the release or threatened release of a
hazardous substance under this chapter, through any familial relationship or
any corporate or contractual relationship other than a contract to protect a
security interest, the director may refuse to provide a written release or
covenant not to sue or may refuse to seek an order of the court granting
immunity from contribution claims under this section.

C. An agreement between the department and a prospective purchaser shall
include provisions deemed necessary by the department and may include:

1. A representation by the prospective purchaser that the purchaser did not
cause or contribute to the contamination or otherwise cause or contribute to
a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at the property
before the purchaser acquired title.

2. If the prospective purchaser does not undertake remedial action, a
representation that the purchaser will not exacerbate or contribute to the
existing contamination.

3. An agreement that any activity that the prospective purchaser may
conduct or direct on the contaminated property will not unreasonably
interfere with any ongoing remedial actions that are being performed by a
responsible party or the department and that the purchaser will cooperate
with those activities.

4. An agreement to undertake those measures that constitute a public
benefit as prescribed by subsection A, paragraph 4 of this section.

5. If remedial measures are to be performed under the agreement, an
agreement to perform those measures in compliance with the applicable

purchaser is not liable, the state as a condition of the agreement may impose
a lien upon that property for the unrecovered costs. The priority of the lien is
as of the date the lien is recorded in the county where the property is
located. The lien becomes due on the sale, assignment or transfer of the
property by the prospective purchaser unless the new purchaser, assignee or
transferor accepts and assumes the lien as a personal obligation with the
department's prior written agreement.

D. Subject to satisfactory performance of the obligations under the
agreement, the prospective purchaser is not liable to this state under this
article for any release of a hazardous substance at the facility that exists on
the date of acquisition of ownership or operation of the facility. The person
shall bear the burden of proving that any hazardous substance existed on the
facility as a result of releases of the hazardous substance before the date of
acquisition of ownership or operation of the facility. This release from
liability may be voided by the director if the person fails to perform any of
the provisions of the prospective purchaser agreement.

E. The purchaser shall provide written notice to the department of any sale,
assignment or other transfer of the property at least fifteen business days
before the date of the transfer.

F. An agreement pursuant to this section is assignable if the assignee
qualifies pursuant to subsections A and B of this section for a prospective
purchaser agreement under this section and notice is given to the
department as prescribed by subsection E of this section. On assignment,
the assignee assumes the obligations and the benefits of the agreement.
Unless the assignor has breached the agreement, the assignor retains the
benefits of the agreement.

G. The department shall provide notice of a prospective purchaser
agreement by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
in which the property is located at least fifteen business days before the
execution of a prospective purchaser agreement. The notice shall include a
general description of the contents of the agreement. Any interested person
may comment on the proposed agreement in writing to the director.

A. If the director determines that a drinking water source is being or is about
to be rendered unusable without treatment as a drinking water source by a
non-hazardous substance that was disposed by a person that would be a
responsible party under section 49-283 if the substance were a hazardous
substance, the director may order that person to perform one or more of the
following mitigation measures:

1. Providing an alternative water supply.

2. Mixing or blending if economically practicable.

3. Economically and technically practicable treatment before ingesting the
water.

4. Such other mutually agreeable mitigation measures as are necessary to
achieve the purposes of this section.

B. The director's selection of mitigation measures shall balance the short-
term and long-term public benefits of mitigation with the cost of each
alternative measure. The director may only require the least costly
alternative if more than one alternative may render water usable as a
drinking water source.

C. A mitigation order issued under this section is enforceable under sections

A. Except as provided in section 49-286, the provisions of this article are
independent of and are not subject to the enforcement remedies of article 4
of this chapter and section 49-264.

B. This section does not preclude the director from initiating actions
pursuant to section 505 of the clean water act and section 1449 of the safe
drinking water act. The director shall not initiate any action under section
107(a) or 107(f) of CERCLA or section 7002 of the resource conservation
and recovery act to the extent that the action is inconsistent with this article,
except under any of the following circumstances:

1. In an action initiated by the director filing a complaint
contemporaneously with a consent decree or any other agreement to provide
contribution protection or a covenant not to sue under CERCLA.

2. In an action involving a facility at a site listed on the national priorities list
on April 29, 1997. In an action involving a facility at a site on the national
priorities list that is listed after April 29, 1997 the director may initiate an
action if the facility is not being remediated pursuant to this article or any
other provision of this title.

3. In a counterclaim action when the state is sued under section 107 (a) of
CERCLA, but only against the party asserting the claim. For purposes of this
paragraph, "state" does not include political subdivisions of the state.

C. The director may initiate an action to recover natural resource damages
under section 107(f) of CERCLA but may recover only the proportionate
share of these damages from a defendant who is also a responsible party
under this article.

D. Judicial actions initiated pursuant to this section have precedence over all
other civil proceedings.

E. If there is a release or the threat of a release of a hazardous substance
which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health
or welfare or the environment:

1. The director may take such remedial action as he deems necessary to
protect the public health or welfare or the environment.

2. The attorney general may request a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction or any other relief necessary
to protect the public health or welfare or the environment from the release.

3. The director may issue an order requiring abatement of such release or
threat of a release and appropriate remedial action if the action is consistent
with the criteria listed in and rules adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06
and before taking such action the director provides written notice to the
responsible party, if known, and the owner of the real property where the
facility is located if the owner is not a responsible party. The notice shall
include:

(a) The reasons for the remedial action.

(b) A reasonable time for beginning and completing the actions, taking into
account the urgency of the actions for protecting public health or welfare or
the environment.

(c) The steps taken to comply with the criteria listed in and rules adopted
pursuant to section 49-282.06.

(d) The intention of this state or a political subdivision to take remedial
action and the possible liability of the responsible party for the costs of such
actions if that action is not taken by the responsible party.

4. The director may take action pursuant to sections 49-287.01 through 49-
287.07, or enter into a settlement under section 49-292 or any other
applicable provision of this article. Actions taken by the director pursuant to
sections 49-287.01 through 49-287.07 may substantially affect the rights
and obligations of persons who may be liable under this article for the
release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a site or portion of
a site for purposes of determining insurance coverage. Any action taken by
the director pursuant to sections 49-287.01 through 49-287.07 is not
appealable unless otherwise provided in this article.

F. A remedial action order issued under subsection E of this section becomes
final and enforceable in the superior court for purposes of subsections I and
J of this section unless, within thirty days after the receipt of the order, the
recipient moves to quash or modify the order in the superior court. If the
motion to quash or modify the order raises issues of fact, the recipient of the
order and the state are entitled to conduct expedited discovery on
application to the court and are entitled to a priority for trial. A party who
undertakes the actions prescribed in a remedial action order issued
pursuant to this section may obtain a court order to recover from the fund
the reasonable and necessary costs of the actions if the party demonstrates
to the court that the actions required by the order were arbitrary and
capricious or otherwise were not in accordance with law, that the party is
not a responsible party as prescribed by section 49-283 or for the amount of

costs incurred that exceeded the party's share of liability pursuant to section
49-285.

G. If there is a release or the threat of a release of any pollutant which may
present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare,
the director may take such remedial action as he deems necessary to protect
the public health or welfare or the environment.

H. Any remedial action costs, other than nonrecoverable costs, incurred by
the director pursuant to the procedures in subsection E of this section may
be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general against any
responsible party pursuant to section 49-287.07.

I. A responsible party who wilfully violates or fails or refuses to comply with
any order of the director under subsection E, paragraph 3 of this section
may, in an action brought in the superior court in the appropriate county to
enforce such order, be assessed a civil penalty of not more than five
thousand dollars for each day in which the violation occurs or the failure to
comply continues. All civil penalties assessed pursuant to this subsection
shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state
general fund.

J. A responsible party who fails, without sufficient cause, to properly provide
remedial action on order of the director pursuant to subsection E, paragraph
3 of this section may be liable to this state for punitive damages in an
amount up to three times the amount of any costs incurred by the director as
a result of the failure to take proper action. The attorney general may
commence a civil action against the responsible party to recover the
remedial action costs and the punitive damages. Any punitive damages
received by this state pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited,
pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund. The
director's failure to comply with the requirements of section 49-282.06 or
the director's order to take a remedial action that causes the responsible
party to incur costs that exceed the responsible party's proportionate share
of liability pursuant to section 49-285 is a defense to an action for punitive
damages and the amount of the punitive damages requested may be
reduced, in full or in part.

K. If the director may act pursuant to this section, he may undertake such
investigations, monitoring, surveys, testing and other information gathering
as he may deem necessary or appropriate to identify the existence and extent
of the release or threat of a release, the source and nature of the hazardous
substances and the extent of danger to the public health or welfare or to the

ยง 49-287.01. Investigation scoring and site registry; no further
action

A. When information of a possible release or threatened release of a
hazardous substance is received, the director may conduct a preliminary
investigation to obtain additional information necessary to determine the
potential risk to the public health or welfare or the environment in order to
score the site or portion of the site and include it on the site registry. By
written agreement, the director may allow any person to conduct any
portion of the preliminary investigation.

B. After completing the preliminary investigation or at any time during the
preliminary investigation, the director may suspend or terminate an
investigation or determine that no further investigation or action is
necessary. The director may reopen the preliminary investigation on a
determination that the release or threatened release continues to present an
imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the
environment. If a preliminary investigation is completed, the director shall
prepare a draft of the site registry report required under subsection D of this
section. If the director drafts a site registry report pursuant to this section,
the report shall contain a description of the site or portion of the site,
including its geographical boundaries, and a score in accordance with the
site scoring method established in rules adopted by the director.

C. Before finalizing the report and the score, the director shall furnish a copy
to the current owners and operators of the site or portion of the site, if
known, and shall provide fifteen days for review and comment. The director
shall then place a copy in the public file and shall publish the score in a
newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the site is
located. The director shall provide thirty days for comment and shall
consider any comments before issuing the final report and score.

D. The director shall maintain a registry of scored sites or portions of sites
that includes a brief description of the site or portion of the site, its score
and a brief description of the status of investigative and remedial actions.
The scoring of a site or portion of the site, its relative score or its placement
on the registry does not necessarily represent a determination that the
release of a hazardous substance from the site poses a threat to human
health or welfare or the environment. Prior to approving any remedy that
may result in water quality exceeding water quality standards after
completion of the remedy, the director shall place a notice in the registry
established pursuant to this subsection that the remedy may result in water
quality exceeding water quality standards.

E. New scores shall be added to the registry as soon as practicable. The
registry shall be published annually by the secretary of state in the Arizona
administrative register. The department shall also publish notice of the
availability of the registry in a newspaper of general statewide circulation.

F. Any person may request that the director make a determination that a site
or portion of a site requires no further action or should be rescored. The
request shall include information, including the specific hazardous
substances released at or from the site or portion of the site, and a
geographical description of the site or portion of the site sufficient for a
determination by the director regarding the requested action. The director
may request additional information from the requesting party within ninety
days after receiving the party's request, and the director shall provide the
reasons for requesting the additional information. The person making the
request shall submit the additional information within sixty days after
receiving the director's request for additional information. Within thirty
days of receipt of the additional information, the director shall notify the
requesting party if the additional information is complete. The submission
of incomplete information may result in a denial of the no further action
request. The parties may agree in writing to additional time for responses. In
addition to requesting information, the director or the director's authorized
representative may conduct an investigation of the site or portion of the site
and shall be given access to the portion of the site under the control of the
requestor. The director or the director's authorized representative shall be
allowed access to the site as a requirement for making a no further action
request. The director shall deny a request for a no further action
determination if access to the site is not provided. A request pursuant to this
subsection may only be made once per calendar year. After determining that
the information submitted is sufficient for action on the request, the director
shall publish notice of the request for rescoring or determination of no
further action on a site or portion of the site and shall provide thirty days for
public comment. Based on the information and comments received, and
within sixty days after the close of the public comment period, unless
extended by the director for good cause, the director shall determine
whether the score should be changed or a determination of no further action
should be made and shall give notice of that decision to the person who
made the request and any persons who provided comment. The director
shall make a final decision on a no further action or rescoring request within
three hundred days after receiving the request unless the time is extended in
writing by the parties. The director's decision shall contain the factual,
technical and legal grounds for the decision. Any changes to a score or
determinations of no further action shall be published in the registry.

G. A determination of no further action shall be made if the director finds
that the site or portion of the site does not present a significant risk to the
public health or welfare or the environment. The director's determination on
a no further action request shall be based on the rules adopted by the
department pursuant to section 49-282.06. A determination of no further
action shall state whether it is for soils or the groundwater, or both. A
determination of no further action regarding a site or a portion of the site
means that the department shall not proceed with or require further
remedial action under this article for the specific hazardous substances
within the geographical area covered by the determination, provided that
the determination of no further action does not preclude the director from
obtaining access to the area covered by the determination under this article
or any other law. The department may reopen an investigation and take or
require remedial action for any of the following reasons:

1. On discovery of new information that, based on the rules adopted by the
department pursuant to section 49-282.06, would result in the potential
denial of a no further action request.

2. That information submitted to the director pursuant to subsection F of
this section was inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.

3. The reopening of an investigation or the taking of a remedial action is
necessary to respond to a release or the threat of a release of a hazardous
substance that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the
public health or welfare or the environment.

H. The director's decision under subsection F of this section may be
appealed pursuant to section 49-298, subsection B by the person who made
the request or any party who will be adversely affected by the action and who
submitted comments. A person who has previously filed an administrative
appeal under this subsection or any provision of law in effect on or after
April 29, 1997 concerning previous investigations by the director that
resulted in the director's decision being upheld bears the burden of proving
by clear and convincing evidence that the director's action that is being
appealed was unsupported by the evidence in any further administrative
appeals involving the same site or portion of the site and shall pay the
director's cost of reviewing the request and the director's attorney fees and
costs incurred in the appeal if the director's decision is upheld.

I. If the director determines that remediation of a site or a portion of a site
will be addressed pursuant to a provision of this title other than this article,
the director may suspend any further investigation or action under this
article. If the site or portion of a site is listed on the registry, the suspension
shall be reflected on the registry.

provision of this title other than this article, the director may remove the site
from the registry.

K. If the director determines that a site on the registry does not require
further remedial action under this article, the director may remove the site
from the registry.

L. The director shall maintain a list of sites removed from the registry. This
list shall be available to the public.

M. A site that has been removed from the registry may be reopened and
remedial action taken or required for any of the following reasons:

1. On discovery of new information that, based on the rules adopted by the
department pursuant to section 49-282.06, would result in the potential
denial of a no further action request.

2. Information submitted to the director pursuant to this section is
inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.

3. The reopening of an investigation or the taking of a remedial action is
necessary to respond to a release or the threatened release of a hazardous
substance that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the
public health or welfare or the environment.

A. If the director determines that a remedial investigation at a site or portion
of the site may be necessary and the director determines that cost recovery
may be appropriate, the department shall conduct an investigation to
identify any person who may be liable under this article. The department
shall use its best efforts to identify all persons who may be liable under this
article for the release or threatened release at the site or portion of the site.

B. During the investigation, any person may provide the director with
information regarding the identification and potential liability of any person
or regarding any facility within the site from which a release of a hazardous
substance may have occurred. If the director receives sufficient information,
the director shall investigate the facts relating to the person's potential
liability, including its share of liability under this article, without regard to
the financial ability of the person. If the director receives sufficient
information regarding a release of a hazardous substance from a facility
within the site to indicate that it has contributed to contaminants of concern
at the site or portion of the site being investigated pursuant to this section,
the director shall investigate the release of the hazardous substance and the
potential liability of persons under this article. If the director declines to
investigate a person or facility, the director shall notify the person who
provided the information of the director's decision not to investigate.

C. If the director declines to investigate a person or facility, any person who
conducts an investigation and provides the results of the investigation to the
director shall receive a credit for the reasonable and necessary cost of the
investigation as an offset against any liability to the fund or to the state
under this article if the investigation results in a settlement or a finding by
the director, the allocator or the court that this additional identified person
is liable under this article with respect to the site or portion of the site being
investigated pursuant to this section.

A. The department may conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility
study of a scored site or portion of the site to assess conditions on the site or
portion of the site and to evaluate alternative potential remedies to the
extent necessary to select a final remedy in a manner consistent with the
rules and procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06.

B. Unless the director determines that the necessary remedial action can be
completed within one hundred eighty days, before the department begins a
remedial investigation and feasibility study for a site or a portion of a site,
the department shall prepare a scope of work, a fact sheet and an outline of a
community involvement plan. The scope of work shall generally describe the
proposed scope of the remedial investigation and feasibility study. The
outline of the community involvement plan shall address all of the elements
of the community involvement plan requirements of section 49-289.03.

C. The department shall provide written notice to each person who,
according to information available to the department, may be liable under
this article that the scope of work is available for inspection and that any
person by agreement with the department may develop and implement a
work plan for the remedial investigation and the feasibility study. The
department shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
where the site is located a notice of the availability of the scope of work, fact
sheet and outline of a community involvement plan for public comment. The
notice shall provide an opportunity for a public meeting.

D. The department shall prepare a responsiveness summary before
implementing the scope of work. Before the director implements a remedial
investigation, unless the director determines that the necessary remedial
action can be completed within one hundred eighty days, the department
shall prepare and implement the community involvement plan based upon
the outline and after considering the public comments, consistent with the
requirements of section 49-289.03. The department shall update the
community involvement plan at least every two years.

E. The remedial investigation shall collect the data necessary to adequately
characterize the site or the portion of the site for the purpose of developing
and evaluating effective remediation alternatives pursuant to the feasibility

A. After evaluating the site or portion of a site under section 49-287.03, the
director shall prepare a proposed remedial action plan that describes all of
the following:

1. The boundaries of the site or portion of the site that is the subject of the
remedial action.

2. The results of the remedial investigation and feasibility study.

3. The proposed remedy and its estimated costs.

4. How the remediation goals and selection factors in section 49-282.06 and
rules adopted by the director have been considered.

B. The director shall issue notice of the proposed remedial action plan
pursuant to the community involvement plan. The notice shall:

1. Describe the proposed remedy and its estimated cost.

2. Identify where the proposed remedial action plan and remedial
investigation and feasibility study report may be inspected.

3. Advise the public of the opportunity to provide comments on the
proposed remedial action plan and the closing date for those comments.

C. A copy of the proposed remedial action plan shall also be sent to each
person on the preliminary list of potentially responsible parties with a notice
that includes the information required in subsection B of this section and
that also shall:

1. Notify the recipients of the opportunity to propose alternative methods of
allocation of liability among responsible parties.

2. Provide a preliminary list of potentially responsible parties and
summarize the basis for each party's liability if the director determines that
cost recovery may be appropriate.

3. Advise the recipient that all information known to the recipient regarding
a person who may be liable under this article and any facility within the site
from which a release of a hazardous substance may have occurred must be
provided to the department within a reasonable period of time set by the
department, but not less than sixty days. Failure to comply with this
ARS 49-287.04 Proposed remedial action plan; preliminary list of
responsible parties; opportunity to comment; record of decision;
       appeal (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))

subsection precludes a person from introducing the evidence in an
allocation hearing pursuant to section 49-287.06, and in an action brought
pursuant to section 49-287.07, except as otherwise prescribed by those
sections.

D. Within ninety days after the end of the public comment period, if the
department has received sufficient information pursuant to section 49-
287.02, subsection B identifying additional persons who may be responsible
under this article or facilities where a release of a hazardous substance may
have occurred, the director shall investigate that person or facility within the
site as provided in section 49-287.02, subsection A or shall decline to
investigate and shall notify the person providing the information in writing
of the director's decision.

E. If, on the basis of new information or its investigation, the department
believes there is sufficient evidence that an identified person is a responsible
party under this article, the department shall provide the notice and
proposed remedial action plan required by subsection C of this section to
that party and a revised list of potentially responsible parties to the parties
originally identified in the proposed remedial action plan. A newly identified
potentially responsible party shall have the same opportunity for comment
and the submission of information including information concerning
additional responsible parties or releasing facilities as provided to the
originally identified responsible parties under this section. If as a result of
the submission of information by subsequently identified responsible parties
or its own investigation the department believes that there are additional
responsible parties, it shall provide the notice required by this subsection to
those parties and the previously identified responsible parties and shall
comply with the other procedures prescribed by this section.

F. After the conclusion of all public comment periods prescribed by this
section, the director shall prepare a comprehensive responsiveness
summary. The director shall prepare the record of decision regarding the
remedial action plan.

G. The director shall serve written notice that a record of decision has been
signed upon each person who submitted written comments on the proposed
remedy selection and all persons identified as potentially responsible
parties. A notice shall be published pursuant to the community involvement
plan informing the public that the record of decision and comprehensive
responsiveness summary have been prepared and are available for review.

H. A record of decision signed by the director is deemed to be a final
administrative decision as defined in section 41-1092 as of the date it is
served pursuant to subsection G of this section. There is no right to an
ARS 49-287.04 Proposed remedial action plan; preliminary list of

administrative appeal, review or rehearing by the director on the record of
decision. Any person who will be adversely affected by the record of decision
and who commented on the proposed remedial action plan pursuant to this
section may seek judicial review of the record of decision by filing a
complaint in superior court pursuant to section 12-904, subsection A. The
plaintiff shall serve the notice required by section 12-904, subsection B on
the director.

I. If a complaint is filed pursuant to subsection H of this section, the court
action is stayed and no answer is required until twenty days after one of the
following events occurs:

1. Ninety days after notice of the allocator's report is served pursuant to
section 49-287.06, subsection G.

2. Notice that no allocation hearing will be held is served pursuant to section
49-287.06, subsection A.

3. Notice of termination of an allocation hearing is served pursuant to
section 49-287.06, subsection I.

4. The director moves that the stay should be lifted and the court grants the
motion.

J. If a complaint is filed pursuant to subsection H of this section, the director
shall serve any notice required by section 49-287.06, subsection A, E or G on
each person who commented on the proposed remedial action plan.

K. The director shall notify all parties to an appeal if the director intends to
implement the remedy before the stay under subsection I of this section is
lifted. If the director gives this notice, the stay of the action pursuant to
subsection I of this section does not preclude any party from seeking a
preliminary injunction against the director from implementing the remedy.

L. On termination of the stay of an action pursuant to subsection I of this
section, the director shall transmit the record to the superior court. The
record shall consist of the proposed remedial action plan, copies of all
written comments on the proposed remedial action plan, the comprehensive
responsiveness summary and the record of decision. Judicial review shall be
pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6. If an evidentiary hearing is held
pursuant to section 12-910, subsection A, then notwithstanding section 12-
910, subsection B, no evidence may be admitted by the court unless it
supports a specific comment made before the conclusion of the public
comment period pursuant to this section by the party seeking to introduce
the evidence. Section 12-910, subsection C does not apply to the appeal.

A. After signing the record of decision, if the director determines that cost
recovery may be appropriate, the director shall notify each person that has
been determined to be liable under this article of the following:

1. The boundaries of the site or portion of the site that is the subject of the
notice.

2. The basis on which the director has determined the person to be a
responsible party.

3. The names and addresses of all other persons who the director has
determined to be responsible parties.

4. The method of allocation chosen by the director, the reason it was chosen
and the percentage share of remedial action costs for which the department
has determined each person to be liable, which shall total one hundred per
cent. For each person's share, the department shall state the reasons for the
consideration given to the factors of section 49-285, subsections E and F.

5. The record of decision selecting the remedial action and the estimated
cost of the remedy. A copy of the record of decision and comprehensive
responsiveness summary shall be included. The record of decision shall
demonstrate that the requirements of section 49-282.06 were considered.

6. A list of all remedial action costs, other than nonrecoverable costs,
incurred by the director at the site that is the subject of the notice.

7. A list of costs of approved remedial actions, other than nonrecoverable
costs, incurred by the state or an eligible party at the site that is the subject
of the notice.

8. A statement of the person's right to an allocation hearing pursuant to
section 49-287.06 and the availability of a settlement pursuant to section
49-292, 49-292.01 or 49-292.02.

9. An offer to settle the person's liability pursuant to this article and
CERCLA with respect to the site or portion of the site if the person agrees to
pay seventy-five per cent of the share of remedial action costs allocated to
the person by the department. If the settlement allows payment over time or
satisfaction by performance of future work, the settlement shall be
conditioned on the person making a substantial down payment and
providing financial assurance that it can meet its obligations to satisfy the
remainder of its share under the agreement. Each settlement shall be
conditioned on cooperating with the department with respect to further
 ARS 49-287.05 Notice of liability allocation; eligibility (Arizona

proceedings under this article including providing access to its property for
the remedial action and complying with section 49-288 except that the
person may reserve the right to challenge the remedy selection. The
department's offer to settle expires unless the written acceptance is received
by the director within one hundred twenty days after service of notice on the
person pursuant to this subsection. Any person who has been penalized
under section 49-288, subsection G is not eligible to obtain a settlement
under this paragraph. Settlements under this paragraph are voidable at the
director's discretion if the settling party institutes an action to recover
remedial action costs or response costs incurred at the subject site or facility
before the time specified under section 49-287.07, subsection B.

B. If a person cannot be notified of the department's determination pursuant
to this section because it no longer exists or cannot be found after
reasonable efforts by the department, the department is relieved of its
obligation to notify that person.

C. If a person accepts the department's offer to settle pursuant to this section
within the time allowed, the department shall enter into a settlement with
the person pursuant to section 49-292. The settlement shall include a
covenant by the state not to sue under this article or CERCLA and, at the
option of the person and subject to court approval, protection from
contribution actions under this article and CERCLA. The department may
revoke the settlement if the person and the department are unable to agree
to reasonable terms and conditions of settlement within ninety days after
the offer is accepted.

ยง 49-287.06. Allocation hearing

A. Ninety days after the issuance of notice pursuant to section 49-287.05,
subsection A, the director shall issue a notice to each person who has not
settled its liability with the department of the start of an allocation
proceeding. The director shall propose the names of at least three allocators
taken from a list maintained by the director. The director shall be entitled to
be represented in the allocation proceeding but may waive this right. If all
parties have settled, the director's notice shall advise all persons notified
pursuant to section 49-287.05 that no allocation hearing will be held
pursuant to this section.

B. Within fifteen days of receipt, each person receiving the notice of
allocation proceeding shall respond to the director regarding the
acceptability of any of the allocators on the director's list. If all of the parties
cannot agree on one of the allocators proposed by the director, each party
may provide the names of up to three other proposed allocators. If the
director and all of the parties cannot agree on a proposed allocator within
thirty days after the issuance of the director's notice pursuant to this section,
the director shall request the presiding civil judge of the superior court in
the county where the site is located to select an allocator. Within thirty days
after the request, the presiding civil judge shall select an allocator and advise
the director of the selection.

C. The director shall give all parties written notice of the selection of the
allocator. The allocator shall set the date for hearing at least sixty and not
more than one hundred twenty days after the date of the notice of selection
of the allocator pursuant to this section. The allocator may continue the date
of the hearing for good cause. Ex parte contact with the allocator regarding
any of the evidence or issues in the allocation is prohibited.

D. The allocator shall conduct an allocation hearing and, on request of one
or more of the parties, may conduct a mediation or settlement conference
before the allocation hearing. The allocator has the power to administer
oaths or affirmations to witnesses. In conducting the allocation hearing, the
allocator has discretion to determine the procedures to be followed, except
that:

1. Each party shall provide the allocator, the director and all parties with a
disclosure statement at least thirty days before the date of the first scheduled
hearing. The disclosure statement shall comply with rule 26.1, Arizona rules
of civil procedure, and shall include a statement of the method of allocation
proposed, a description of evidence supporting the factors listed in section
49-285, subsections E and F intended to be presented at the hearing and a
description of any other relevant evidence known to the party, including
   ARS 49-287.06 Allocation hearing (Arizona Revised Statutes
                        (2021 Edition))


information regarding the responsibility of any other person. Copies of any
documentary evidence shall be included with the disclosure statement
unless already in the department's public file on the site or a disclosure
statement previously filed pursuant to this paragraph. Evidence that is not
disclosed in a party's disclosure statement is inadmissible by that party at
the hearing. Evidence that a party failed to provide the director pursuant to
a request under section 49-288 is inadmissible by that party at the hearing.
The liability allocation notice issued by the director pursuant to section 49-
287.05, subsection A and the public record on file at the department may
serve as the disclosure statement of the director and any persons who have
settled their liability with the director. The director may supplement the
liability allocation notice up to thirty days prior to the first scheduled
hearing date. The allocator shall resolve disputes regarding the adequacy of
disclosure statements.

2. The director has the burden of proving that all other parties are
responsible parties under this article. The allocator shall allow each party to
present evidence relevant to the liability and proportionate share of liability
of any person, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this subsection.
There is no burden of proof as to the proportionate share of any person. The
allocator shall hear all of the evidence and assign the proportionate shares in
accordance with the considerations as specified in section 49-285,
subsections E and F.

3. The allocator shall allow each party to cross-examine any other party's
witnesses, except that the allocator may limit cross-examination to avoid
needless delay or a needless presentation of cumulative evidence or to
expedite the hearing.

4. The allocator may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses
and the production of documents. The subpoenas shall be served and, on
application to the superior court, enforced in the manner provided by law
for the service and enforcement of subpoenas in civil actions. Service of the
subpoena is the responsibility of the person requesting the subpoena.
Discovery shall not be permitted except on a showing of good cause and due
diligence as determined by the allocator.

5. The allocator may request any additional information from any party if
the allocator believes that this information is necessary to assist in making a
determination regarding liability or the share of any person.

6. If, during the hearing or at its conclusion, the allocator believes that
additional information is necessary to issue a report, the allocator may order
the parties to exchange additional information and submit posthearing
evidence for a period of not more than sixty days.
   ARS 49-287.06 Allocation hearing (Arizona Revised Statutes
                        (2021 Edition))


7. The allocator shall use the Arizona rules of civil procedure as guidance for
hearing procedures, but may depart from these rules as prompt and fair
resolution of the issues demand, and shall honor all privileges recognized
under Arizona law. The allocator may allow any relevant evidence, including
hearsay evidence, to be admitted and shall give appropriate weight to all of
the evidence. The allocator may impose time limits on individual
presentations and may require the consolidation of presentations or cross-
examination if this consolidation can be justified by commonality of
interests. The disclosure statements and the liability allocation notice sent
by the director pursuant to section 49-287.05 shall be admitted as evidence.
The proceeding shall be recorded by a court reporter upon request by any
party who agrees to pay the costs.

8. Except on a showing of good cause and due diligence as determined by
the allocator, a party may not allege that a person is responsible for a share
of liability unless that person was named in the director's list of liable
persons issued pursuant to section 49-287.05 or was identified as a
potentially liable person pursuant to section 49-287.04.

9. A party may not introduce evidence at the hearing regarding the liability
or share of liability of any person under this article unless the director was
notified of the existence of the information pursuant to section 49-287.04.
The allocator may allow the introduction of that evidence if the party
acquired the information after that time and if the party shows good cause
and due diligence as determined by the allocator, if the party provided the
evidence to the director promptly after it was acquired.

E. Within sixty days after the hearing or, if applicable, the end of the period
for submitting posthearing evidence, the allocator shall issue a written
allocation report identifying the persons who are liable and the
proportionate share of liability of each person in accordance with section 49-
285, subsections E and F in percentages adding up to one hundred per cent.
The allocator shall send a copy of the report to each party.

F. All parties to the allocation shall bear an equal share of the allocator's fees
and costs, which shall be specified in the allocator's report.

G. The director shall serve notice of the issuance of the allocator's report on
all persons notified pursuant to subsection A of this section and on the
persons who filed an appeal of the record of decision pursuant to section 49-
287.04. The notice shall state that there shall be a period of ninety days after
service of the notice for settlement discussions, that the allocator's findings
are final unless a challenge is filed pursuant to section 49-287.07 and the
period for challenging the allocator's findings as provided in section 49-
287.07, subsection B.
   ARS 49-287.06 Allocation hearing (Arizona Revised Statutes
                        (2021 Edition))


H. The findings regarding liability and the proportionate share of liability for
each person as set forth in the allocator's report are final unless a timely
challenge regarding a person's liability or proportionate share is filed as
provided in section 49-287.07, subsection B. The director or any other
person with a claim for recovery of remedial action costs against a
responsible party whose proportionate share as found by the allocator has
become final pursuant to this subsection may obtain a judgment based on
the proportionate share determined in the allocator's report. In any action to
obtain such a judgment, the responsible party whose allocated share has
become final may not dispute its proportionate share of liability as
determined by the allocator, and the plaintiff may recover its costs and
attorney fees incurred in obtaining and enforcing the judgment. The liability
of any person that has become final pursuant to this subsection is not
affected by any subsequent determination by a court in any action.

I. If all parties settle during a proceeding pursuant to this section, the
director shall terminate the proceedings. If all parties, not including the
director, fail or refuse to participate, the director may proceed with the
allocation hearing or may terminate the proceedings. If the director
terminates the proceedings, the director shall provide written notice within
thirty days of termination of proceedings pursuant to this section to all
persons who received notice pursuant to section 49-287.05.

remedial action costs to challenge a determination of liability or
proportionate share in an allocator's report pursuant to section 49-287.06.

2. An action by a person to challenge a determination of its liability or its
proportionate share in an allocator's report issued pursuant to section 49-

3. An action by the director or any person for allocation and recovery of
remedial action costs at any site or a portion of a site listed on the registry
maintained pursuant to section 49-287.01, subsection D, except as follows:

(a) An action by a person or group of persons who have obtained a no
further action determination for a site pursuant to section 49-287.01,
subsections F and G, for both soil and groundwater. Such an action may be
brought pursuant to section 49-285.

(b) An action by one or more responsible parties who have conducted or will
conduct a voluntary remedial action pursuant to section 49-282.05 or who
have entered into a settlement or agreement with the director under which
the person or group of persons agree to undertake a remedy or any other
remedial action and to reimburse the fund for the department's costs, if any.
Such an action may be brought pursuant to section 49-285.

(c) An action by the director to enforce a settlement agreement.

(d) An action by the director to recover costs incurred in undertaking an
emergency remedial action pursuant to section 49-282.02. Such an action
may be brought pursuant to section 49-285.

B. If the action includes a challenge regarding a determination of liability or
proportionate share of a party in an allocator's report pursuant to section
49-287.06, the action shall be commenced by filing a complaint not fewer
than ninety days nor more than one hundred twenty days after notice of the
allocator's report is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection G. If
the director issues a notice of termination of allocation proceedings
pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection I, the action may be brought any
time after that notice is served. In all other cases, actions brought pursuant
to this section shall be filed no fewer than ninety days after notice of the
allocator's report is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection G. All
actions commenced under this section shall be brought in the superior court

action costs; limitation of actions (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                              Edition))

in the county where the site is located or in which the department maintains
an office. Title 12, chapter 7, article 2 and title 41, chapter 6, articles 6 and 10
do not apply to the action. Within five calendar days after filing the
complaint, the plaintiff shall serve written notice of the filing of the
complaint by certified mail on the director and each person whose liability
or proportionate share were determined in the allocator's report. In any
action brought pursuant to this section, unless otherwise provided in this
section, the parties shall bear their own costs, expert witness fees and
attorney fees.

C. A plaintiff who is challenging its own proportionate share or a finding of
its liability shall name the director as the defendant. The director or a
plaintiff who is seeking recovery of remedial action costs shall name as a
defendant each party whose liability or proportionate share as determined
by the allocator is being challenged and any other person who the plaintiff
alleges is a responsible party and who was not allocated a share of liability
by the allocator. The plaintiff shall not name as a defendant any person who
has entered into a settlement agreement with the director that includes
contribution protection or whose proportionate share or liability as set forth
in the allocator's report is not being challenged. On the entry of any
judicially approved consent decree providing contribution protection to any
defendant regarding the site or portion of the site that is the subject of a
challenge under this section, the court shall dismiss that defendant from the
action pursuant to this section. The complaint and answer shall be filed and
served as provided in the applicable rules of civil procedure. The action shall
be tried by the court without a jury.

D. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that each defendant is a
responsible party under this article, except that in an action in which a
person challenges a determination of its own liability in an allocator's report,
the director has the burden of proving that the person is a responsible party
under this article. There is no burden of proof as to the proportionate share
of any person. The court shall receive evidence offered by any party
regarding the allocation of liability among the parties and any other persons,
except as provided in subsection I of this section. The liability allocation
notice issued pursuant to section 49-287.05, subsection A and the allocator's
report issued pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection E shall be admitted
as evidence. The court shall issue an order establishing the proportionate
share of liability of each party it determines to be a responsible party in
accordance with section 49-285, subsections E and F. Notwithstanding a
finding regarding the proportionate share of liability that differs from the
allocator's report or any settlement, the court's order does not affect the
liability of any person who has settled with the department pursuant to this
  ARS 49-287.07 Actions for allocation and recovery of remedial
action costs; limitation of actions (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                              Edition))

article or whose proportionate share of liability has become final pursuant to
section 49-287.06, subsection H.

E. In an action challenging a party's proportionate share of liability as
determined in the allocator's report, if the party filing the challenge is not
the prevailing party as determined by the court, the liability of the parties
shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection. If the parties have filed
complaints against each other challenging the allocator's report, no
adjustments may be made pursuant to this subsection. The court shall
determine whether the plaintiff is the prevailing party based on whether the
proportionate share determined by the court is closer to an offer of
judgment pursuant to rule 68 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure made by
one or both of the parties or to the proportionate share as determined in the
allocator's report. If the plaintiff is not the prevailing party, the share of
liability of the responsible party whose proportionate share is being
challenged shall be adjusted as follows:

1. If the plaintiff is challenging its own proportionate share as stated in the
allocator's report, the plaintiff is liable for the proportionate share contained
in the court's order plus a premium of two per cent of the total remedial
action costs at the site or, if applicable, a portion of the site, unless the
court's order is for less than four per cent, then the premium is fifty per cent
of the plaintiff's proportionate share as determined by the court.

2. If the plaintiff is the director who is challenging the proportionate share of
a defendant, the defendant is liable for the proportionate share contained in
the court's order minus a discount of two per cent of the total remedial
action costs at the site or, if applicable, a portion of the site, unless the
court's order is for less than four per cent, then the discount is fifty per cent
of the defendant's proportionate share as determined by the court.

3. If the plaintiff, other than the director, is seeking recovery of remedial
action costs and is challenging the proportionate share of a defendant, the
defendant is liable for the proportionate share contained in the court's
order, and the plaintiff is liable to the defendant for an amount equal to two
per cent of the total remedial action costs at the site or, if applicable, a
portion of the site.

F. In any action pursuant to this section, including an action to obtain a
judgment based on a final allocator's determination pursuant to section 49-
287.06, subsection H, or in any settlement after the conclusion of the
allocation proceeding under section 49-287.06, a party who received notice
pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection A, who did not participate in the
allocation proceeding under section 49-287.06 and who is found to be a
responsible party under this article is liable for all of the following:

1. Its proportionate share of liability.

2. A premium of fifty per cent of that party's proportionate share.

3. The plaintiff's costs, attorney fees and expert fees incurred in both the
allocation proceeding and the court action.

G. In any action brought pursuant to this section, if the superior court finds
that a defendant is not a responsible party under this article, the plaintiff is
liable for all of that defendant's reasonable costs, attorney fees and expert
fees incurred in the court action.

H. If more than one action is filed under this section, the court shall join all
actions into a single proceeding.

I. No party may allege that any other person is responsible for any portion of
liability unless that person was identified to the director pursuant to section
49-287.04 except on a showing of good cause and due diligence.

J. No determination by the director or an allocator pursuant to this article as
to the fact or extent of a person's liability under this article may be admitted
into evidence or used in any judicial proceeding initiated against that person
other than a proceeding pursuant to this section.

K. In any action brought pursuant to this section, on the request of any party
with a claim for recovery of remedial action costs, the court shall award a
judgment against the responsible party for its proportionate share of
remedial action costs as prescribed by section 49-285. The judgment shall
reflect any adjustments of amounts due pursuant to subsections E and F of
this section.

ยง 49-288. Information gathering and access; enforcement;
retaliatory action; civil penalties

A. The director may take an action authorized under subsection B or C of
this section to determine the need for, to select or to undertake any remedial
action pursuant to this article, to investigate and allocate the liability of any
person under this article or to otherwise enforce the provisions of this article
or a rule adopted pursuant to this article. Any such action taken regarding
the release or threatened release of a pollutant shall not require a person to
create information or documents not then in existence but may require
sorting, organization, compilation or formatting of information in existence.

B. The director may require a person who has or may have information
relevant to a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, or
pollutant as identified by the director in the request, or the liability of any
person under this article including information relating to the ability of a
person to pay for or to undertake remedial actions pursuant to this article, to
furnish, after reasonable notice, information or documents relating to such
release or threatened release or the liability of any person under this article
or to grant access at all reasonable times, after reasonable notice, to a facility
or other place owned or operated by the person to inspect and copy all
documents or records relating to such release or threatened release or the
liability of any person under this article. At the option of the person, the
person may copy and furnish, at the person's expense, all such documents or
records to the director. If any information under this section is claimed
confidential pursuant to section 49-205, subsection A, the information shall
be provided to the director but not made available to the public pending the
determination of confidentiality pursuant to section 49-205. Written notice
of the determination regarding confidentiality shall be provided to the
person claiming confidentiality. If the person claiming confidentiality does
not file an action for declaratory relief in superior court within thirty days of
receiving this notice, the information shall be made available to the public.

C. The director or an agent designated by the director with appropriate
documentation that identifies the person who has been given authority from
the director, after reasonable notice, may enter a facility or other place at
reasonable times under any of the following circumstances:

1. Where a hazardous substance or a regulated substance as defined in
section 49-1001 may be or has been generated, stored, treated, disposed of
or transported from and which may be related to a release or threatened
release of a hazardous substance or regulated substance.

                              Edition))

2. From which or to which a hazardous substance or a regulated substance
as defined in section 49-1001 has been or may have been released or where
such release is or may be threatened.

3. Where entry is needed to determine the need for remedial actions or the
appropriate remedial actions or to effectuate remedial actions pursuant to
this article.

4. To inspect and obtain samples of any suspected hazardous substance or a
regulated substance as defined in section 49-1001 which has been or may
have been released or where such release is or may be threatened, including
samples of containers or labeling.

D. If a sample is obtained pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 4 of this
section, the director shall, before leaving the premises, give to the owner,
operator or other person in control of the facility or other place from which
the samples were obtained a receipt describing the sample obtained and, if
requested, a portion of each sample. A copy of the results of any analysis
made of such samples shall be furnished promptly to the owner, operator or
other person in control, if such person can be located. Inspections pursuant
to subsection C, paragraph 4 of this section shall be completed with
reasonable promptness.

E. If consent is not granted regarding any request made by the director
under subsections A through C of this section, then the director may issue an
order requiring compliance with the request within a specified time period
that the director determines is appropriate under the circumstances. The
order shall provide that the time period for compliance shall be extended for
good cause shown as determined by the director. The order may not be
issued until an opportunity for consultation as is reasonably appropriate
under the circumstances has been afforded to the person to whom the
request is made.

F. The director may ask the attorney general to commence a civil action to
compel compliance with a request made pursuant to subsections A through
C of this section or an order issued pursuant to subsection E of this section.

G. The court may enjoin acts of noncompliance or may assess a civil penalty
of not to exceed five thousand dollars for each day of noncompliance against
any person who unreasonably fails to comply with an order issued pursuant
to subsection E of this section. All civil penalties assessed pursuant to this
section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the
state general fund. The attorney general, at the request of the director, may
commence an action in superior court to recover civil penalties provided for

                              Edition))

in this subsection. In determining the amount of a civil penalty under this
subsection, the court shall consider:

1. The seriousness of the act of noncompliance under this section.

2. As an aggravating factor only, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from
the act of noncompliance under this section.

3. Any history of such violation.

4. Any good faith efforts to comply with the order.

5. The economic impact of the penalty on the person.

6. Such other factors as the court deems relevant.

H. No person shall fire or otherwise discriminate against any employee with
respect to wages, hours, duties, responsibilities or employment position by
reason of the fact that the employee provided information to the state, has
testified or may testify, in any administrative, allocation or judicial
proceeding commenced pursuant to this article. Any employee alleging a
violation of this section may bring an action in superior court to obtain
reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, and reasonable attorney
fees. An action must be commenced within one year of the alleged violation
and shall constitute the exclusive recourse for the violation.

I. Nothing in this section shall preclude the director from securing access or
obtaining information in any other lawful manner.

ยง 49-290. Exemption from permit requirements; definition

A. Notwithstanding any other statute, a person who performs a remedial
action or a portion of a remedial action that has been approved by the
department if that action or portion is conducted in compliance with this
article is not subject to any requirement to obtain any permit or approval
that may otherwise be required by the department.

B. Except as prescribed in subsection D of this section, a person who
conducts a portion of a remedial action, where that portion is entirely on site
and is conducted in compliance with this article, may be exempted from a
requirement to obtain any other state or local permit or approval, other than
any requirement of title 45, at the written request of the person conducting
the remedial action. The written request shall identify the specific permit to
be exempted and the reasons the exemption is requested. The permit may be
exempted if the director finds both of the following:

1. The requirement does not arise out of any permit or regulatory program
that is required pursuant to the laws of the United States.

2. The requirement presents a substantial impediment to effective
performance of the remedial action selected by the department.

C. The director may waive any regulatory requirement adopted pursuant to
this title with respect to a site or portion of a site as part of a record of
decision adopted pursuant to section 49-287.04 for that site or portion of a
site if the regulatory requirement conflicts with the implementation of the
selected remedy, provided that the waiver does not result in adverse impacts
to public health or the environment. No waiver may be granted under this
subsection if it is prohibited by federal law or if the waiver would jeopardize
the continued delegation to the state of authority to implement a federal
environmental program.

D. Discharge of wastewater to off-site publicly owned treatment works and
sewer systems does not constitute an activity conducted entirely on site for
purposes of subsection B of this section.

E. The director shall give written notice of any request for exemption made
pursuant to subsection B of this section to the remedial action coordinator
designated pursuant to subsection G of this section by the governmental
entity whose permit requirements are the subject of the request. Before
making any finding pursuant to subsection B of this section, the director or
the director's designee shall meet and confer with the remedial action
coordinator and the person conducting the remedial action to identify
alternatives to exemption.

F. Any finding made by the director pursuant to subsection B of this section
shall be in writing. The governmental entity whose permit requirement is
preempted as a result of such finding is not liable for property damage,
personal injury damage or violations of state or local law resulting from the
exemption. The director shall notify the affected governmental entity of any
finding made pursuant to subsection B of this section. A finding of the
director made pursuant to subsection B of this section is a final
administrative decision as defined in section 41-1092 and is subject to
judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

G. Each city, town and county shall designate a remedial action coordinator
who shall have responsibility for monitoring and facilitating any remedial
actions conducted within its jurisdiction. The designated remedial action
coordinator shall:

1. Regularly consult, as needed, with the department and the person
conducting a remedial action throughout the duration of the remedial
action.

2. Expedite the processing and issuance of permits, approvals or other
authorizations required by the governmental entity represented by the
remedial action coordinator, to facilitate the prompt conduct of a remedial
action.

3. Provide information to the department and the person conducting the
remedial action regarding applicable requirements of the governmental
entity represented by the remedial action coordinator and the potential for
waiver of such requirements.

H. In order to encourage remediation activities under this article and to
conserve the fund, neither this state nor any county that imposes an excise
or similar tax that is levied at a rate applied as a percentage of the rates on
each business class subject to the tax imposed by title 42, chapter 5, article 1
may impose a tax on the sale or purchase of tangible personal property
incorporated or fabricated into any real property, structure, project,
development or improvement under a contract specified in section 42-5075,
subsection B, paragraph 6.

I. For purposes of this section, "on site" means the areal extent of
contamination and all suitable areas in close proximity to the contamination
that are reasonably necessary for implementation of the remedial action.

of water resources

A. Notwithstanding section 49-290, any person conducting a remedial
action shall obtain and comply with applicable permits, approvals or other
authorizations required by the department of water resources. On
consultation with the director of environmental quality, the director of water
resources may waive its applicable permits, approvals or authorizations if
the director of water resources determines that the permit, approval or other
authorization unreasonably limits the completion of a remedial action and if
the waiver does not conflict with the statutory intent of the permit, approval
or other authorization. The department of water resources shall expedite the
processing and issuance of permits, approvals or authorizations to facilitate
the prompt conduct of approved remedial actions. If the department of
water resources fails to issue or deny a permit within one hundred twenty
days of the date of receipt of a complete application for a permit, approval or
authorization required for the remedial action or subsequent implementing
work plan approved by the department, the department may authorize the
party conducting the approved remedial action to proceed with that action
and that person shall not be subject to any penalties for failure to obtain the
permit, approval or authorization from the department of water resources,
but shall be required to comply with the substantive requirements of such
permit, approval or authorization. The determination of whether an
application for a permit is complete shall be made by the department of
water resources. The person conducting the approved remedial action who
uses groundwater withdrawn in an active management area as part of an
approved remedial action shall continue to pay the groundwater withdrawal
fee for the groundwater the person withdrew and used or received and used.

B. The director of environmental quality and the director of water resources
shall enter into a memorandum of understanding which establishes a
procedure for expediting the review and issuance of permits issued under
title 45 when the director of environmental quality has made a
determination that a delay in the issuance of a permit required by title 45
will result in the continuance of an imminent and substantial endangerment
to the public health or welfare or the environment.

C. The director of environmental quality and the director of water resources
shall coordinate their efforts to expedite remedial actions, including
obtaining information pertinent to site investigations, remedial
investigations, site management and beneficial use of remediated water.

resources requirements; metal mining facilities

A. A metal mining facility conducting mitigation activities pursuant to an
order issued by the director of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-
286 shall obtain and comply with applicable permits, approvals or other
authorizations required by the department of water resources. On
consultation with the director of environmental quality, the director of water
resources may waive its applicable permits, approvals or authorizations if
the director of water resources determines that the permit, approval or other
authorization unreasonably limits the completion of mitigation activities
undertaken by a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued pursuant
to section 49-286 and if the waiver does not conflict with the statutory intent
of the permit, approval or other authorization. The department of water
resources shall expedite the processing and issuance of permits, approvals
or authorizations to facilitate the prompt conduct of approved mitigation
activities undertaken by a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued
pursuant to section 49-286. If the department of water resources fails to
issue or deny a permit within one hundred twenty days of the date of receipt
of a complete application for a permit, approval or authorization required
for completion of the mitigation activities approved by the department of
environmental quality pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 49-
286, the department of environmental quality may authorize the metal
mining facility conducting the approved mitigation activities to proceed with
those activities and that metal mining facility shall not be subject to any
penalties for failure to obtain the permit, approval or authorization from the
department of water resources, but shall be required to comply with the
substantive requirements of such permit, approval or authorization. The
determination of whether an application for a permit is complete shall be
made by the department of water resources. A metal mining facility
conducting mitigation activities pursuant to an order issued by the
department of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-286 that uses
groundwater withdrawn in an active management area shall continue to pay
any applicable groundwater withdrawal fee for the groundwater the metal
mining facility withdrew and used or received and used.

B. The director of environmental quality and the director of water resources
shall coordinate their efforts to expedite mitigation activities undertaken by
a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 49-
286, including obtaining information pertinent to site investigations, site
management and beneficial use of water withdrawn for mitigation purposes.

C. With respect to mitigation activities undertaken by a metal mining facility
pursuant to an order issued by the department of environmental quality
pursuant to section 49-286, the director of water resources may waive any

portion of a site as part of a mitigation order issued by the department of
environmental quality pursuant to section 49-286 for that site or portion of
a site if the regulatory requirement conflicts with the implementation of the
ordered mitigation activities, provided that the waiver does not result in
adverse impacts to other land and water users. No waiver may be granted
under this subsection if it is prohibited by federal law or if the waiver would
jeopardize the continued delegation to the state of authority to implement a
federal environmental program.
  ARS 49-292 Settlement; authority and effect (Arizona Revised
                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-292. Settlement; authority and effect

A. The director shall consider any offer of settlement by a person who is
potentially liable for remedial action costs under this article and CERCLA.
The director shall consider the factors in section 49-282.06 and section 49-
285, subsections E and F in determining whether to settle any person's
liability. In determining the settlement amount, the director shall take into
account any past costs incurred for remedial actions at the site by the
person. Costs of remedial actions that are incurred by an eligible party as
defined in section 49-281, that are or have been approved by the director
pursuant to section 49-285, subsection B and that are conducted under the
oversight of the director shall be used as a credit against that eligible party's
liability. Nothing in this section requires the director to reimburse from the
fund the orphan share of costs of approved remedial actions incurred by an
eligible party before June 30, 1997. The director may enter into a settlement
agreement or consent decree with a potentially responsible party or with a
prospective purchaser pursuant to section 49-285.01 without making an
express finding in the settlement agreement or consent decree regarding an
imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare, the
waters of this state or the environment.

B. In any settlement agreement or consent decree entered into pursuant to
subsection A of this section, the director may provide any potentially
responsible party with a covenant not to sue concerning any liability to the
state under this article or under CERCLA including future liability that may
result from a release or threat of a release of a hazardous substance
addressed by a remedial action whether that action is on site or off site. A
covenant not to sue takes effect when the settlement agreement or consent
decree becomes final. A covenant not to sue with respect to future liability
shall include an exception that allows the director to sue the responsible
party concerning future liability from the release or threatened release that
is the subject of the covenant if the liability arises out of conditions that are
unknown to the director at the time the director enters into the covenant. A
covenant not to sue does not preclude the director from suing the potentially
responsible party for failure to comply with the terms of the settlement
agreement or consent decree in which the covenant was included.

C. A potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state
that arises from this article or from CERCLA in a judicially approved
consent decree is not liable for claims for contribution or cost recovery
regarding matters addressed in the consent decree. Any such judicially
approved consent decree does not discharge other potentially responsible
parties unless its terms so provide, but such a settlement does reduce the
potential liability of other potentially responsible parties by the amount of
the settlement. If a potentially responsible party receives an allocation
  ARS 49-292 Settlement; authority and effect (Arizona Revised
                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


pursuant to section 49-287.06 or 49-287.07 that is less than the amount the
potentially responsible party agreed to pay the state pursuant to a settlement
agreement or consent decree, the excess amount paid by the potentially
responsible party shall be credited to the fund. Any payment by a potentially
responsible party in excess of the allocation shall not reduce the
proportionate liability of any other potentially responsible party.

D. If the state has obtained less than complete relief from a potentially
responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state, the state may
bring an action against any other potentially responsible party pursuant to
section 49-287.07 who has not so resolved its liability.

E. A potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state
may seek contribution for matters addressed in the settlement from any
person who is not a party to a settlement entered into under this section.

F. In any action under this section, the rights of any potentially responsible
party who has resolved its liability to the state in a judicially approved
consent decree or a settlement agreement are subordinate to the rights of
the state for matters addressed in the settlement agreement or consent
decree, unless otherwise provided in the settlement agreement or consent

ยง 49-292.01. Qualified business settlements; definition

A. The director shall enter into a settlement under this article and section
107 of CERCLA with a person that qualifies pursuant to this section without
regard to the extent of its liability except for a person whose liability under
this article arose from criminal acts.

B. An applicant seeking settlement under this section shall have identifiable
gross income as defined in section 61 of the internal revenue code greater
than one dollar in each of the two years prior to the application and in each
of the two years preceding the year that an investigation of the applicant's
share was initiated by either the department or the United States
environmental protection agency. The applicant shall submit a letter to the
director requesting a qualified business settlement on a form provided by
the director. The request letter shall include the applicant's tax returns for
the time periods provided in subsection J of this section. The director may
require additional information to verify the applicant's eligibility for a
settlement under this section. Financial information submitted by the
applicant pursuant to this section and marked "confidential" shall be kept
confidential by the director.

C. If the director verifies that the applicant meets the definition of a
qualified business, the director shall enter into a settlement within ninety
days after receipt of the request letter and other information required under
this section. The settlement shall meet the requirements of section 49-292,
but without regard to the extent of its liability, and shall require that:

1. The qualified business pay ten per cent of its average annual gross income
for the two years preceding the year that a request was submitted by the
applicant including the income from money or assets transferred by the
applicant within the two years preceding the application. The director shall
allow the settlement amount to be paid over time, up to a maximum of ten
years, subject to payment of interest at the rate of six per cent per year. If the
settlement amount is paid in full within the first five years, the payments
shall not be subject to the payment of interest. An applicant may file a
petition with the director to modify the payment schedule.

2. The qualified business cooperate with the director in providing reasonable
access and information necessary for the director to carry out the
requirements of this article.

D. Notice of the settlement shall be published as provided in section 49-292.
The notice shall provide a general description of the contents of the
agreement. Any interested person may comment on whether the applicant is
     ARS 49-292.01 Qualified business settlements; definition
            (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


a qualified business in writing to the director. The director may withdraw
from a settlement after considering the comments.

E. If the director determines that the business does not qualify for the
qualified business settlement pursuant to this section, the director shall
notify the applicant in writing within ninety days of the receipt of all
information required under subsection B of this section stating the reasons
for denial. If the director does not notify the applicant within ninety days,
the application is deemed denied. A denial of a settlement under this section
may be appealed to the office of administrative hearings pursuant to section
49-298. In any appeal made pursuant to section 49-298, the documents
submitted by the applicant under subsection B of this section are not
confidential.

F. In reviewing a proposed settlement, the United States district court or
superior court shall give deference to the department's determination that
the settlement is in the public interest and meets applicable legal standards
for court approval. Any person who challenges a proposed settlement bears
the burden of proving that the proposed settlement does not meet applicable
legal standards for court approval. If a settlement is reached with an
applicant, the confidential information supplied to the director under this
section may be submitted under seal to the court for in camera review.

G. In determining the applicant's gross income for purposes of determining
eligibility pursuant to subsection J of this section, the income of all concerns
in which the applicant maintains ownership, control or management may be
considered by the director. Any transfer of money or assets by the applicant
within the two years preceding the application shall be presumed void for
purposes of determining eligibility under this section. This presumption
may be rebutted by the applicant if the applicant submits a written
presumption rebuttal statement that includes the reasons why the transfer
of money or assets within this time period should not be presumed void for
purposes of determining eligibility. The department shall consider this
statement and provide a written record of decision to the applicant that
either affirms or denies the applicant's reasons provided in the presumption
rebuttal statement.

H. The director may adopt rules to implement this section. A settlement
under this section applies only to the applicant and does not release or affect
in any way the liability of any other person.

I. If a settlement is made pursuant to this section, the director shall not file a
lien pursuant to section 49-295 for an amount greater than the settlement.
     ARS 49-292.01 Qualified business settlements; definition
            (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


J. For the purposes of this section, "qualified business" means an applicant
who meets both of the following conditions:

1. The applicant's gross income as defined by section 61 of the internal
revenue service code is less than two million dollars per year and greater
than one dollar per year.

2. The applicant complies with the definition for the average of the two years
preceding the year that an investigation of the applicant's share was initiated
by either the department or the United States environmental protection
agency, and for each of the two years preceding the year that a request was
submitted by the applicant pursuant to subsection B of this section.

If a person does not qualify as a qualified business under this section, the
person is eligible to settle its liability under this article and section 107 of
CERCLA for less than its proportionate share under section 49-285 on a
demonstration of financial hardship under section 49-292.02.

                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-292.02. Financial hardship settlement

A. The director shall consider any offer by a person who may be potentially
liable for remedial action costs under this article or section 107(a) of
CERCLA without regard to the extent of that person's liability. In order to
obtain a settlement under this section, a person must demonstrate a
financial hardship with respect to payment of a potential liability under this
article or under CERCLA. A person whose liability under this article arose or
could arise from criminal acts is not eligible to request a settlement under
this section. In considering a person's ability to pay, the director shall
consider all of the following:

1. The financial resources of the person, including available insurance.

2. The person's ability to continue in business after payment of a settlement
amount.

3. Whether liability for the settlement amount would require the person to
seek protection under federal bankruptcy law.

B. An applicant seeking settlement under this section shall submit a letter to
the director requesting a financial hardship settlement on a form provided
by the director. The request letter shall include the applicant's tax returns
and all schedules, financial statements, balance statements and other
information concerning the person's gross income and net worth for the five
years preceding the date of the application on a form provided by the
director. Within ninety days of the application, the director may require
additional information to verify the applicant's eligibility for settlement
under this section. The applicant may provide any additional information
the applicant believes to be relevant. Financial information submitted by the
applicant pursuant to this section and marked "confidential" shall be kept
confidential by the director. If the director or the attorney general disputes a
claim of confidentiality, written notice shall be provided to the person
claiming the confidentiality that the claim is disputed. If the person claiming
the confidentiality does not file an action for declaratory relief in superior
court within thirty days after receiving this notice, the information shall be
made available to the public. An applicant who submits false or intentionally
misleading information is not eligible for a settlement pursuant to this
section.

C. If the director verifies that the applicant has demonstrated a financial
hardship with respect to payment of a potential liability under this article or
CERCLA, the director shall enter into a settlement within ninety days after
receipt of the request letter and other information required under this
section. The settlement shall meet the requirements of section 49-292, but
 ARS 49-292.02 Financial hardship settlement (Arizona Revised
                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


without regard to the extent of the person's liability, and shall be made
pursuant to subsection A of this section. The director shall allow the
settlement amount to be paid over time, up to a maximum of ten years,
subject to payment of interest at the rate of six per cent per year. If the
settlement amount is paid in full within the first five years, the payments
shall not be subject to the payment of interest. An applicant may file a
petition with the director to modify the payment schedule.

D. The applicant shall cooperate with the director in providing reasonable
access and information necessary for the director to carry out the
requirements of this article.

E. Notice of the settlement shall be published as provided in section 49-292.
The notice shall provide a general description of the contents of the
agreement. Any interested person may comment on whether the applicant
qualifies for a settlement pursuant to this section in writing to the director.
The director may withdraw from a settlement after considering the
comments.

F. If the director determines that the applicant does not qualify for a
settlement pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the applicant in
writing within ninety days of the receipt of all information required under
subsection B of this section stating the reasons. If the director does not
notify the applicant within ninety days, the application is deemed denied. A
denial of settlement under this section may be appealed to the office of
administrative hearings pursuant to section 49-298. In any appeal made
pursuant to section 49-298, the documents submitted by the applicant
under subsection B of this section are not confidential. The appeal shall
determine only the amount the applicant is able to pay.

G. In reviewing a proposed settlement, the federal district court or superior
court shall give deference to the director's determination that the settlement
is in the public interest and meets applicable legal standards for court
approval. Any person challenging a proposed settlement shall bear the
burden of proving that the proposed settlement does not meet the applicable
legal standards for court approval. If a settlement is reached with an
applicant, the confidential information supplied to the director under this
section may be submitted under seal to the court for in camera review.

H. In determining the applicant's financial resources, the financial resources
of all concerns in which the applicant maintains ownership, control or
management may be considered by the director. A settlement under this
section applies only to the applicant and does not release, affect or increase
the liability of any other person. The director may adopt rules to implement
this section.

                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


I. If a settlement is made pursuant to this section, the director shall not file a
lien pursuant to section 49-295 for an amount greater than the settlement.

J. Within thirty days after the director has proposed an allocation share
under section 49-287.05 or a share has been allocated under section 49-
287.06 to a person who has previously settled with the department pursuant
to this section, the director may request that the previous settlement be
reopened to determine whether the person who has settled can pay an
amount that is greater than the previous settlement amount but not more
than the allocated share. A decision by the director to initiate a review of the
previous settlement shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
twice within a one week period. The notice shall provide a general
description of the director's reasons for initiating a review of the previous
settlement. Any interested person may comment in writing to the director
on whether the settlement should be reopened and whether the person who
previously settled with the department pursuant to this section should be
required to pay a different amount from the previous settlement amount.
Public comments must be received by the director within thirty days of the
last date of publication. The person who settled shall submit updated
versions of the documents prescribed by subsection B of this section to
provide financial information since the previous settlement. Within ninety
days after receipt of the information prescribed by this subsection, the
director shall notify the person whether the original settlement amount will
be revised. If the director determines that the original settlement amount
will be revised, the director shall provide the person with the revised
settlement amount and the basis for that revision. Any monies paid
pursuant to the original settlement shall be credited toward any revised
settlement amount. If the director does not notify the person who settled
within ninety days, the original settlement amount is not subject to revision.
Within thirty days after the director's decision to revise the original
settlement amount, the director must petition the court having jurisdiction
over the settlement. The court shall determine whether the settlement
amount shall be reopened and what the settlement amount shall be, but it
shall not be more than the allocated share.

A. All monies obtained by the director as the result of a settlement entered
into pursuant to this article or through filing an action in state or federal
court under this article or under CERCLA shall be deposited, pursuant to
sections 35-146 and 35-147. Monies recovered pursuant to this section for
the department's remedial action costs that are incurred before the date of a
settlement or a court judgment shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-
146 and 35-147, in the water quality assurance revolving fund. Monies
recovered pursuant to this section for the department's remedial action costs
that are to be incurred after the date of a settlement or court judgment may
be deposited in separate accounts, and any interest earned on monies in
these accounts shall be credited to those accounts for use for remedial action
at the specific site or facility from which the monies were generated,
including reasonable and necessary costs, and legal costs for administration
of the account for that site or facility. If a specific site's or facility's account
contains monies at the completion of the remedial action, the director may
use these excess monies in the manner and for the purposes prescribed in
section 49-282.

B. This section and sections 49-292, 49-295 and 49-296 shall not be
construed to limit the authority of the director to take any action under
federal law or under other provisions of this title.
ARS 49-295 Environmental liens (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                         Edition))


ยง 49-295. Environmental liens

A. In addition to other rights or remedies available to this state, and in order
to protect the state's interest in recovering monies expended by the state for
remedial action, all remedial action costs for which a person is liable to the
state for the remedial actions conducted at that facility by the state under
this article constitute a lien in favor of the state against only the property
that is a facility subject to or affected by that remedial action and in which
the person who is liable has an ownership interest.

B. The director may request the attorney general to file an action in the
superior court in the county in which the property is located for an order
establishing an environmental lien. The application for an environmental
lien may be filed and recorded pursuant to subsection H of this section. The
application for an environmental lien shall include the following
information:

1. The name of the record owner of the real property on which the
environmental lien is requested, the name of the person purportedly liable,
if different, and the person's ownership interest.

2. The legal description of the real property where the environmental lien
attaches.

3. The amount and an itemization of remedial action costs that have been
incurred by this state as of the time the application is filed.

4. A statement of the evidence demonstrating that the person is liable for
remedial action costs incurred by the state under this article.

C. On the filing of an application for an environmental lien, the court shall
set a hearing date at least thirty but not more than forty-five days from the
date the application is filed with the court. The hearing may be rescheduled
if all parties agree to a different date. Service of the application and notice of
the hearing date on the purportedly liable person and the record owner of
the subject real property, if different, shall be in the manner prescribed in
the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

D. On a showing by the state of probable cause that the person is liable for
remedial action costs incurred by the state under this article and the amount
of the remedial action costs and that the person has an ownership interest in
the real property that is the subject of the application for an environmental
lien, the court may issue an order establishing an environmental lien in
favor of the state.
ARS 49-295 Environmental liens (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                         Edition))


E. The order establishing an environmental lien shall be filed and recorded
as provided in subsection H of this section. If the state records the
application for an environmental lien as provided in subsection H of this
section, the environmental lien shall be deemed to attach as of the date of
recording of the application for the environmental lien, once the order
establishing the environmental lien is filed and recorded. If the state does
not record the application for the environmental lien, the environmental lien
attaches only on the recording of the order establishing the lien as provided
in subsection H of this section.

F. If after establishment of an environmental lien the state incurs additional
remedial action costs for which the person is liable under this article, the
state may seek to amend the existing lien to include in the amount of the lien
the additional remedial action costs incurred. The state shall file a statement
itemizing the costs incurred with the court, with service as prescribed in
subsection C of this section. On a showing by the state of probable cause
with respect to the amount of those additional remedial action costs, the
court may increase the amount of the environmental lien by the amount of
those additional remedial action costs.

G. Any person that has been determined liable for remedial action costs in a
probable cause hearing for purposes of establishing a lien and that owns an
interest in real property that is the subject of an environmental lien
established under this section shall notify the state in writing at least sixty
days before alienating the interest. If the state believes that it will incur
future remedial action costs at the facility, the state may within thirty days of
receipt of the notification request a probable cause hearing pursuant to
subsection C of this section. The court shall schedule the requested hearing
before expiration of the sixty day period beginning on the date the state
received notice that the person intends to alienate its interest, unless the
parties agree to a continuance. Unless the person giving notice to the state
withdraws that notice before the scheduled date of the hearing, the court
shall conduct a hearing to estimate the state's future remedial action costs
and may issue an order amending the lien to include total future remedial
action costs that the state appears reasonably likely to incur. Any order
increasing the amount of an existing lien pursuant to this subsection may be
filed and recorded as provided in subsection H of this section. Any person
having an ownership interest in the property that may be adversely affected
by the order increasing the environmental lien may challenge the increased
lien amount by filing a motion to quash pursuant to subsection I of this
section. If the state fails to request a probable cause hearing with respect to
estimated future remedial action costs within thirty days of receipt of the
notification, any person subsequently purchasing an interest in real property
that is subject to an environmental lien takes that interest subject only to
ARS 49-295 Environmental liens (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                         Edition))


existing, unsatisfied liens, and that person is liable to the state for future
remedial action costs only to the extent it is liable for those costs because it
is a responsible party under section 49-283 or because it is otherwise liable
under other federal, state or common law.

H. Any application, order, lien, release or other document required to be
recorded under this section shall be recorded in the office of the county
recorder of the county where the real property is located. A filing fee or other
charge is not required for filing any document pursuant to this section. The
filing or mailing of any document pursuant to this section is the
responsibility of the director or the director's designee. A copy of an
environmental lien shall also be sent by certified mail to any other person
including an owner, purchaser, holder of a mortgage or security interest or
judgment lien creditor whose interest was perfected and recorded before an
application for an environmental lien was recorded.

I. If a court issues an order establishing an environmental lien, any person
having an interest in the real property that may be adversely affected by
establishment of the lien may file a motion to quash the lien. The court
retains jurisdiction to resolve any issue of fact or law raised by the motion to
quash. If the motion to quash raises issues of fact, the person challenging the
lien and the state are entitled to conduct expedited discovery on application
to the court and are entitled to a priority for trial.

J. At any time after the lien is recorded any person having an ownership
interest in real property subject to an environmental lien may move the
court to substitute other security for the lien. The court shall retain
jurisdiction to determine the sufficiency of the substituted security. On
approval of the substituted security, the environmental lien shall be
released.

K. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an environmental
lien does not apply to real property that is used primarily for or that is under
construction for use in single or multi-family housing at the time the
environmental lien is recorded.

L. The director shall release an environmental lien if the lien or a claim or
judgement for the remedial action costs is satisfied. If the lien or a claim or
judgement for the remedial action costs has been partially but not wholly
satisfied, the director on request of any person having an ownership interest
in the property shall reduce the amount of the lien by the amount satisfied.
The director may release an environmental lien if the director determines
that the lien is not in the best interest of the state.
ARS 49-295 Environmental liens (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                         Edition))


M. If the court refuses to issue an order establishing an environmental lien,
any person having an interest in the property against which an
environmental lien was sought is not entitled to attorney fees or damages
against the state if the court determines that there was reasonable cause for
the application.

N. Any determination of any issue by the court in a hearing held pursuant to
this section shall not be considered binding in any future judicial or
administrative proceeding except that any issue litigated in a motion to
quash filed pursuant to this section shall not be litigated again in any
subsequent motion to quash filed pursuant to this section that is filed by the
same party.

O. An environmental lien is subject to any other lien that is perfected and
recorded before the attachment date of the environmental lien as
determined pursuant to subsection E of this section.

P. On entry of a final judgment in favor of the state for remedial action costs,
an environmental lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided for
foreclosure of mortgages pursuant to title 33, chapter 6, article 2. The state
may combine an action to recover remedial action costs with an action to
foreclose an environmental lien established under this section.

Q. This section does not preclude the state from initiating other actions
under this title or under federal law.
