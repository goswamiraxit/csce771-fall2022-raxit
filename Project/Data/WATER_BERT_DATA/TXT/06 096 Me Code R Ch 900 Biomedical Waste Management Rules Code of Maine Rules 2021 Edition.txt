          Rules (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Chapter 900: BIOMEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT RULES

SUMMARY: The rule identifies biomedical waste subject to regulation;
requires the registration of biomedical waste generators; and establishes
packaging, labeling, handling, storage, transportation and treatment
requirements. The rule does not establish disposal standards for biomedical
waste because this rule defines treated biomedical waste as a special waste.
The disposal of untreated biomedical waste is prohibited in this rule. The
rule requires all transporters and owners or operators of transfer facilities
and treatment facilities to obtain a license. The rule specifies siting, design,
operating and reporting requirements and establishes a biomedical waste
tracking or manifest system.

1. Legal Authority

This rule is authorized by and adopted under 38 M.R.S.A. Sections 341-D(1-
B), 1303-C(34)(K) and 1319-O(3).

2. Preamble

It is the purpose of the Department of Environmental Protection, to provide
effective controls for the management of biomedical waste so as to ensure
the protection of public health, safety and welfare and the environment.

3. Applicability

This rule applies to all persons engaged in biomedical waste activity except
as provided for in section 4 of this rule.

4. Exemptions

A. Household Generators

This rule does not apply to household generators of biomedical waste except
that sharps must be packaged in accordance with Section 12(A)(4) of this
rule.

B. Small Quantity Generators

A medical facility which generates less than a total of 50 pounds of
biomedical waste in any one month is exempt from the requirements of this
rule for that month with the following exceptions:

(1) The facility shall register in accordance with Section 11(A).

(2) Discarded sharps, as defined in Section 7(A)(4), and discarded cultures
and stocks of infectious agents, as defined in Section 7(A)(5), shall be
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 900 Biomedical Waste Management
          Rules (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


packaged in accordance with Section 12(A), labeled in accordance with
Section 12(B) and treated in accordance with Section 10.

(3) Except as provided in (4) and (5) below, transport of biomedical waste
shall be by a licensed biomedical waste transporter and accompanied by a
four-part manifest unless the biomedical waste is taken by the generator to
another medical facility or to a permitted biomedical waste transfer or
treatment facility and the amount transported is less than 50 pounds.

(4) The generator or an employee of the generator may transport sharps
packaged in accordance with this rule to a licensed biomedical waste
treatment facility or another medical facility that has volunteered to serve as
a collection point for sharps if no more than 50 pounds of sharps are
transported in one trip.

NOTE: The rule allows employees to generate biomedical waste off site at
intermittent, temporary field collection points and transport it back to their
facility. Included are blood drives, home health care providers and
phlebotomists working at a temporary field location .

(5) A generator of biomedical waste may send up to 50 pounds of properly
packaged discarded sharps via the United States Postal Service to a licensed
biomedical waste treatment facility. All generators are responsible for
compliance with the packaging standards contained in Section 12 of the
rules.

NOTE: The enabling legislation for the mailing of discarded sharps via the
United States Postal Service (USPS) specified quantities of up to 50 pounds;
however, USPS guidelines limit the amount to 35 pounds.

NOTE: For a medical facility to qualify for the small quantity exemption, all
categories of biomedical waste identified in Section 7 must be considered
and the total amount must be less than 50 pounds per month.

5. Responsibility of Generator

The generator of biomedical waste is responsible for the appropriate
segregation, packaging, labeling, storage, handling, transport and treatment
of biomedical waste it generated as required by this rule. A person may
provide services to the generator of biomedical waste, including the
appropriate packaging, labeling, storage, handling, transport and treatment
of biomedical waste but it is the generator's responsibility to ensure that its
biomedical waste is properly treated.

12. Standards for Generators

A. Packaging

Biomedical waste must be properly packaged to assure effective
containment throughout the handling, storage, transport, and treatment
processes.

(1) Biomedical wastes, other than sharps and bulk liquids, must be packaged
in bags which are impervious to moisture and have a strength sufficient to
resist ripping, tearing or bursting under normal conditions of usage and
handling.

(2) All bags containing biomedical waste must be red in color and imprinted
with the international biohazard symbol and the words "biomedical waste"
or "infectious waste." Waste in red bags will be considered biomedical waste
and must be managed as biomedical waste.

(3) Bags must be sealed by forming a secure closure which results in a leak-
resistant seal.

(4) Discarded sharps must be segregated from other biomedical waste at the
point of generation. Discarded sharps will be placed directly into leak-
resistant, rigid, puncture-resistant containers without clipping or breaking.
When full or in preparation to be sent for treatment, these containers will be
taped closed or tightly lidded to preclude loss or leakage of contents. After
proper packaging, sharps containers may be placed in biomedical waste bags
referred to in Section 12 (A)(1) of these rules.

NOTE: An example of an acceptable container for storing discarded sharps
at home is an empty rigid plastic bottle.

(5) Discarded bulk blood and other liquids which is to be transported off-site
will be packaged in tightly stoppered, unbreakable flasks or bottles or other
appropriate containers.

(6) All biomedical waste bagged in accordance with Section 12(A)(3), sharps
containerized in accordance with Section 12(A)(4), and bulk liquids
containerized in accordance with Section l2(A)(5) which are to be
transported off-site must also be packaged for storage or handling by
placement in disposable corrugated fiberboard boxes or equivalent rigid
containers such as reusable pails, cartons, drums, or portable bins. The box
   06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 900 Biomedical Waste Management
          Rules (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


or container must be leak-resistant or lined with a bag which is impervious
to moisture and has a 200-pound burst strength as measured by the
industry's Mullen test.

(7) Reusable containers used for the handling of biomedical waste must be
thoroughly washed and disinfected each time they are emptied unless the
surfaces of the containers have been effectively protected from
contamination by disposable liners, bags or other devices which are removed
and disposed of with the waste. A red bag may not be enclosed in a bag of
another color.

(8) Reusable containers used for the handling of biomedical waste must not
be used for containment of waste to be disposed of as non-biomedical waste
or for any other purpose except after being disinfected.

B. Labeling

Biomedical waste to be transported off-site must be labeled immediately
after packaging in accordance with Section 12(A)(6). The label must be
securely attached to the outer layer of packaging and be clearly legible.
Indelible ink will be used to complete the information on the label, and the
label will be at least three inches by five inches in size. The following
information must be included on the label:

(1) The name, address, business telephone number, and registration number
of the generator;

(2) "Biomedical Waste" or "Infectious Waste" in large print;

(3) "Refrigeration Required" in large print if pathological waste, cultures, or
animal carcasses or body parts are included in the contents;

(4) The name, address, business telephone number, and registration
number of the person or persons to whose control the biomedical waste is to
be transferred;

(5) The international biohazard symbol; and

(6) The date upon which the biomedical waste was packaged in accordance
with Section 12(A)(6).

C. Handling

(2) Trash chutes will not be used to transfer biomedical waste between
locations where it is contained.

(3) Compactors must not be used in the handling of biomedical waste.
Biomedical waste in bags or other containers must not be subjected to
compaction by any compacting device and must not be placed for storage or
transport in a portable or mobile trash compactor.

D. Storage

(1) Biomedical waste must be segregated from other wastes.

(2) All on-site storage of containers of biomedical waste must be in a
designated area away from general traffic flow patterns and, where possible,
in a room reserved for this purpose. The manner of storage must prevent
access to or contact with such waste by unauthorized persons.

(3) Biomedical waste must be stored in a manner that preserves the integrity
of the container and is not conducive to rapid microbial growth and/or
putrefaction. Pathological waste, cultures, and discarded animal carcasses
and body parts stored for more than 24 hours after packaging in accordance
with Section 12(A)(3) must be refrigerated at a temperature of 45?F or below
in a refrigerator or refrigerated space used only for biomedical waste.

(4) All areas used for the storage of biomedical waste must be capable of
being readily maintained in a sanitary condition.

(5) All biomedical waste containers must be stored in a manner that allows
access for inspection.
