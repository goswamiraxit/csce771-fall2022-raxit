supply is the same body of water into which the discharge is made and if (2)
it is demonstrated to the Department that the toxic pollutant(s) present in
the owner's or operator's intake water will not be removed by any
wastewater treatment systems whose design capacity and operation were
such as to reduce toxic pollutants to the levels required by the applicable
toxic pollutant effluent standards in the absence of the toxic pollutant in the
intake water.

(b) Effluent limitations established pursuant to this section shall be
calculated on the basis of the amount of section 307(a) toxic pollutant(s)
present in the water after any water supply treatment steps have been
performed by or for the owner or operator.

(1) Where the Department determines that the ambient water criterion
established in these standards is not being met or will not be met in the
receiving water as a result of one or more discharges at levels allowed by
these standards, and

(2) Where he or she further determines that this is resulting in or may cause
or contribute to significant adverse effects on aquatic or other organisms
usually or potentially present, or on human health, he or she may issue to an
owner or operator a permit or a permit modification containing a toxic
pollutant effluent limitation at a more stringent level than that required by
the standard set forth in these regulations. Any such action shall be taken
pursuant to the procedural provisions of Chapters 522 and 524, as
appropriate. In any proceeding in connection with such action the burden of
proof and of going forward with evidence with regard to such more stringent
effluent limitation shall be upon the Department as the proponent of such
more stringent effluent limitation.

(3) Evidence in such proceeding shall include at a minimum: Analysis using
data and other information to demonstrate receiving water concentrations
of the specified toxic pollutant, projections of the anticipated effects of the
proposed modification on such receiving water concentrations, and the
hydrologic and hydrographic characteristics of the receiving waters
including the occurrence of dispersion of the effluent. Detailed specifications
for presenting relevant information by any interested party may be
prescribed in guidance documents published from time to time, whose
availability will be announced in the Federal Register.

(b) Any effluent limitation in an NPDES permit which a State proposes to
issue which is more stringent than the toxic pollutant effluent standards
promulgated by the Administrator is subject to review by the Administrator
under section 402(d) of the Act. The Administrator may approve or
disapprove such limitation(s) or specify another limitation(s) upon review of
any record of any proceedings held in connection with the permit issuance
or modification and any other evidence available to him or her. If he or she
takes no action within ninety days of this receipt of the notification of the
action of the permit issuing authority and any record thereof, the action of
the State permit issuing authority shall be deemed to be approved.

06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 525 § 3 Secondary Treatment. [see 40 Cfr
          133] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Section 3. Secondary Treatment. [see 40 CFR 133]

Subsection I. Purpose. [see 40 CFR 133.100]

This Section provides information on the level of effluent quality attainable
through the application of secondary or equivalent treatment.

Subsection II. Definitions. [see 40 CFR 133.101]

Terms used in this section are defined as follows:

(a) 7-day average. The arithmetic mean of pollutant parameter values for
samples collected in a period of 7 consecutive days.

(b) 30-day average. The arithmetic mean of pollutant parameter values of
samples collected in a period of 30 consecutive days.

average value equal to 1.5 times the value derived under paragraph (f)(1) of
this subsection.

(g) Facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment.
Treatment works shall be eligible for consideration for effluent limitations
described for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment (subsection VI),
if:

(1) The BOD-5 and SS effluent concentrations consistently achievable
through proper operation and maintenance (paragraph (f)) of the treatment
works exceed the minimum level of the effluent quality set forth in
Subsections III(a) and (b),

(2) A trickling filter or waste stabilization pond is used as the principal

necessary to meet the percent removal requirements of at least 5 mg/l more
stringent than the otherwise applicable concentration-based limitations
(e.g., less than 25 mg/l in the case of the secondary treatment limits for
BOD-5 and SS), or the percent removal limitations in Subsections III and VI,
if such limits would, by themselves, force significant construction or other
significant capital expenditure.

Subsection III. Secondary treatment. [see 40 CFR 133.102]

The following paragraphs describe the minimum level of effluent quality
attainable by secondary treatment in terms of the parameters--

BOD-5, SS and pH. All requirements for each parameter shall be achieved

6.0 to 9.0 unless the publicly owned treatment works demonstrates that: (1)
Inorganic chemicals are not added to the waste stream as part of the
treatment process; and (2) contributions from industrial sources do not
cause the pH of the effluent to be less than 6.0 or greater than 9.0.

Subsection IV. Special considerations. [see 40 CFR 133.103]

(a) Combined sewers. Treatment works subject to this Chapter may not be
capable of meeting the percentage removal requirements established under
Subsection III(a)(3) and Subsection III(b)(3), or Subsections VI(a)(3) and
Subsection VI(b)(3) during wet weather where the treatment works receive
flows from combined sewers (i.e., sewers which are designed to transport
both storm water and sanitary sewage). For such treatment works, the
decision must be made on a case-by-case basis as to whether any attainable
percentage removal level can be defined, and if so, what the level should be.

(b) Industrial wastes. For certain industrial categories, the discharge to
navigable waters of BOD-5 and SS permitted under sections 301(b)(1)(A)(i),
(b)(2)(E) or 306 of the Act may be less stringent than the values given in
Subsection III(a)(1), Subsection III(a)(4)(i), Subsection III(b)(1), Subsection
VI(a)(1), Subsection VI(b)(1) and Subsection VI(e)(1)(i). In cases when
wastes would be introduced from such an industrial category into a publicly
owned treatment works, the values for BOD-5 and SS in Subsection III(a)(1),
Subsection III(a)(4)(i), Subsection III(b)(1), Subsection VI(a)(1), Subsection
VI(b)(1), and Subsection VI(e)(1)(i) maybe adjusted upwards provided that:
(1) The permitted discharge of such pollutants, attributable to the industrial
category, would not be greater than that which would be permitted under
sections 301(b)(1)(A)(i), 301(b)(2)(E) or 306 of the Act if such industrial
06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 525 § 3 Secondary Treatment. [see 40 Cfr
          133] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


category were to discharge directly into the navigable waters, and (2) the
flow or loading of such pollutants introduced by the industrial category
exceeds 10 percent of the design flow or loading of the publicly owned
treatment works. When such an adjustment is made, the values for BOD-5
or SS in Subsection III(a)(2), Subsection III(a)(4)(ii), Subsection III(b)(2),
Subsection VI(a)(2), Subsection VI(b)(2), and Subsection VI(e)(1)(ii) should
be adjusted proportionately.

(c) Waste stabilization ponds. The Department, subject to EPA approval, is
authorized to adjust the minimum levels of effluent quality set forth in
Subsections VI(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) for treatment works subject to this
Chapter, to conform to the SS concentrations achievable with waste
stabilization ponds, provided that: (1) Waste stabilization ponds are the
principal process used for secondary treatment; and (2) operation and
maintenance data indicate that the SS values specified in Subsections VI
(b)(1),(b)(2), and (b)(3) cannot be achieved. The term ``SS concentrations
achievable with waste stabilization ponds'' means a SS value, determined by
the Department, subject to EPA approval, which is equal to the effluent
concentration achieved 90 percent of the time within a State or appropriate
contiguous geographical area by waste stabilization ponds that are achieving
the levels of effluent quality for BOD-5 specified in Subsection VI(a)(1).

(d) Less concentrated influent wastewater for separate sewers. The
Department is authorized to substitute either a lower percent removal
requirement or a mass loading limit for the percent removal requirements
set forth in Subsection III(a)(3), Subsection III(a)(4)(iii), Subsection
III(b)(3), Subsection VI(a)(3), Subsection VI(b)(3) and Subsection
VI(e)(1)(iii) provided that the permittee satisfactorily demonstrates that: (1)
The treatment works is consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its
permit effluent concentration limits but its percent removal requirements
cannot be met due to less concentrated influent wastewater, (2) to meet the
percent removal requirements, the treatment works would have to achieve
significantly more stringent limitations than would otherwise be required by
the concentration-based standards, and (3) the less concentrated influent
wastewater is not the result of excessive I/I. The determination of whether
the less concentrated wastewater is the result of excessive I/I will use the
definition of excessive I/I in 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(16) plus the additional
criterion that inflow is non excessive if the total flow to the POTW (i.e.,
wastewater plus inflow plus infiltration) is less than 275 gallons per capita
per day.

(e) Less concentrated influent wastewater for combined sewers during dry
weather. The Department is authorized to substitute either a lower percent
removal requirement or a mass loading limit for the percent removal
requirements set forth in Subsection III(a)(3), Subsection III(a)(4)(iii),
06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 525 § 3 Secondary Treatment. [see 40 Cfr
          133] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Subsection III(b)(3), Subsection VI(a)(3), Subsection VI(b)(3) and
Subsection VI(e)(1)(iii) provided that the permittee satisfactorily
demonstrates that: (1) The treatment works is consistently meeting, or will
consistently meet, its permit effluent concentration limits, but the percent
removal requirements cannot be met due to less concentrated influent
wastewater; (2) to meet the percent removal requirements, the treatment
works would have to achieve significantly more stringent effluent
concentrations than would otherwise be required by the concentration-
based standards; and (3) the less concentrated influent wastewater does not
result from either excessive infiltration or clear water industrial discharges
during dry weather periods. The determination of whether the less
concentrated wastewater results from excessive infiltration is discussed in
40 CFR 35.2005(b)(28), plus the additional criterion that either 40 gallons
pre capita per day (gpcd) or 1500 gallons per inch diameter per mile of
sewer (gpdim) may be used as the threshold value for that portion of the dry
weather base flow attributed to infiltration. If the less concentrated influent
wastewater is the result of clear water industrial discharges, then the
treatment works must control such discharges pursuant to Chapter 528.

Subsection V. Sampling and test procedures. [see 40 CFR 133.104]

(a) Sampling and test procedures for pollutants listed in this Chapter shall
be in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Administrator in 40
CFR part 136.

(b) Chemical oxygen demand (COD) or total organic carbon (TOC) maybe
substituted for BOD-5 when a long-term BOD:COD or BOD:TOC correlation
has been demonstrated.

Subsection VI. Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment. [see 40 CFR
133.105]

This subsection describes the minimum level of effluent quality attainable by
facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment
(Subsection II(g)) in terms of the parameters--BOD-5, SS and pH. All
requirements for the specified parameters in paragraphs(a), (b) and (c) of
this subsection shall be achieved except as provided for in Subsection IV, or
paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this subsection.

(a) BOD-5.

(1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l

(2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.

(3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.
06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 525 § 3 Secondary Treatment. [see 40 Cfr
          133] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(b) SS. Except where SS values have been adjusted in accordance with
Subsection IV(c):

(1) The 30-day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.

(2) The 7-day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.

(3) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.

(c) pH. The requirements of Subsection III(c) shall be met.

(d) Alternative State requirements. Except as limited by paragraph(f) of this
subsection, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the
Department, subject to EPA approval, is authorized to adjust the minimum
levels of effluent quality set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1) and
(b)(2) of this subsection for trickling filter facilities and in paragraphs (a)(1)
and (a)(2) of this subsection for waste stabilization pond facilities, to
conform to the BOD-5 and SS effluent concentrations consistently
achievable through proper operation and maintenance (Subsection II(f)) by
the median (50th percentile) facility in a representative sample of facilities
within a State or appropriate contiguous geographical area that meet the
definition of facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary
treatment (Subsection II(g)).

(e) CBOD-5 limitations:

(1) Where data are available to establish CBOD-5 limitations for a treatment
works subject to this subsection, the NPDES permitting authority may
substitute the parameter CBOD-5 for the parameter BOD-5 in Subsections
VI(a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3), on a case-by-case basis provided that the levels of
CBOD-5 effluent quality are not less stringent than the following:

(i) The 30-day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.

(ii) The 7-days average shall not exceed 60 mg/l.

(iii) The 30-day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.

(2) Where data are available, the parameter CBOD-5 may be used for
effluent quality limitations established under paragraph (d) of this
subsection. Where concurrent BOD effluent data are available, they must be
submitted with the CBOD data as a part of the approval process outlined in
paragraph (d) of this subsection.

(f) Permit adjustments. Any permit adjustment made pursuant to this
Chapter may not be any less stringent than the limitations required
06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 525 § 3 Secondary Treatment. [see 40 Cfr
          133] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


pursuant to Subsections VI(a)-(e). Furthermore, permitting authorities shall
require more stringent limitations when adjusting permits if:

(1) For existing facilities the permitting authority determines that the 30-day
average and 7-day average BOD-5 and SS effluent values that could be
achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment
works, based on an analysis of the past performance of the treatment works,
would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations, or

(2) For new facilities, the permitting authority determines that the 30-day
average and 7-day average BOD-5 and SS effluent values that could be
achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment
works, considering the design capability of the treatment process and
geographical and climatic conditions, would enable the treatment works to
achieve more stringent limitations.

         part 401] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Section 4. General Provisions. [see 40 CFR part 401]

Subsection I. Scope and purpose. [see 40 CFR 401.10] Regulations
promulgated or proposed under Section 5 and Chapter 528 prescribe
effluent limitations guidelines for existing sources, standards of
performance for new sources and pretreatment standards for new and
existing sources pursuant to sections 301, 304 (b)and (c), 306 (b) and (c),
307 (b) and (c) and 316(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as

(a) Section 301(a) of the Act provides that ``except as in compliance with
this section and sections 302, 306, 307, 318, 402 and 404 of this Act, the
discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.''

(b) Section 301(b) of the Act requires the achievement by not later than July
1, 1977, of effluent limitations for point sources, other than publicly owned
treatment works, which require the application of the best practicable
control technology currently available as determined by the Administrator
pursuant to section 304(b)(1) of the Act. Section 301(b) also requires the
achievement by not later than July 1, 1983, of effluent limitations for point
sources, other than publicly owned treatment works, which require the
application of the best available technology economically achievable which
will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of
eliminating the discharge of all pollutants, as determined in accordance with
regulations issued by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(b)(2) of the
Act.

(c) Section 304(b) of the Act requires the Administrator to publish
regulations providing guidelines for effluent limitations setting forth the
degree of effluent reduction attainable through the application of the best
practicable control technology currently available and the degree of effluent
reduction attainable through the application of the best control measures
  06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 525 § 4 General Provisions. [see 40 Cfr
         part 401] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


and practices achievable including treatment techniques, process and
procedure innovations, operating methods and other alternatives.

(d) Section 304(c) of the Act requires the Administrator, after consultation
with appropriate Federal and State agencies and other interested persons to
issue information on the process, procedures, or operating methods which
result in the elimination or reduction of the discharge of pollutants to
implement standards of performance under section 306 of the Act.

(e) Section 306(b)(1)(B) of the Act requires the Administrator, after a
category of sources is included in a list published pursuant to section
306(b)(1)(A) of the Act, to propose regulations establishing Federal
standards of performances for new sources within such category. Standards
of performance are to provide for the control of the discharge of pollutants
which reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the
Administrator determines to be achievable through application of the best
available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods,
or other alternatives, including, where practicable, a standard permitting no
discharge of pollutants.

(f) Section 307(b) provides that the Administrator shall establish
pretreatment standards which shall prevent the discharge of any pollutant
into publicly owned treatment works which pollutant interferes with, passes
through untreated, or otherwise is incompatible with such works.

(g) Section 307(c) of the Act provides that the Administrator shall
promulgate pretreatment standards for sources which would be ``new
sources'' under section 306 (if they were to discharge pollutants directly to
navigable waters) at the same time standards of performance for the
equivalent category of new sources are promulgated.

(h) Section 316(b) of the Act provides that any standard established
pursuant to section 301 or section 306 of the Act and applicable to a point
source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of
cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for
minimizing adverse environmental impact.

(i) Section 402(a)(1) of the Act provides that the Administrator may issue
permits for the discharge of any pollutant upon condition that such
discharge will meet all applicable requirements under sections 301,302, 306,
307, 308 and 403 of this Act. In addition, section 402(b)(1)(A) of the Act
requires that permits issued by States under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) established by the Act must apply,
and insure compliance with any applicable requirements of sections 301,
302, 306, 307 and 403 of the Act.
