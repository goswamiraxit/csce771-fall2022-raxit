      Enhanced risk communication to the public and public education efforts on
      water quality issues from the human health standpoint will help the public
      to better understand this issue relative to other hazards, such as pathogenic
      microbial risks. This means conveying the risks of exposure to very low
      concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking-water to the public using plain
      language.


      Knowledge gaps and future research
      Although current published risk assessments indicate that trace concentrations
      of pharmaceuticals in drinking-water are very unlikely to pose risks to human
      health, knowledge gaps exist in terms of assessing risks associated with long-
      term exposure to low concentrations of pharmaceuticals and the combined
      effects of mixtures of pharmaceuticals.

      Future research in these areas may be beneficial to better characterize
      potential health risks from long-term, low-level exposure to pharmaceuticals,
      particularly for sensitive subpopulations.

      One of the key challenges in estimating exposures to pharmaceuticals
      in drinking-water and assessing the potential risks to human health is the
      limited occurrence data for such a diverse group of human and veterinary
      pharmaceuticals. Implementing monitoring programmes is resource intensive
      in terms of costs, human resources and infrastructure, and there is also a lack of
      standardized sampling and analysis protocols to support monitoring studies.
      Future research should focus on filling these knowledge gaps, including by
      providing support to practitioners through the development of cost-effective
      methods and protocols for prioritizing pharmaceuticals within the context of
      an overall risk assessment for all drinking-water hazards.

      Noting that pharmaceuticals in drinking-water are an emerging issue, WHO
      will continue to review relevant scientific evidence and, where necessary,
      update the guidance provided in this report.

    wastewater influent in a study conducted by the Drinking Water Inspectorate
    in the United Kingdom.

    A monitoring programme in the United Kingdom focused on 12 pharmaceutical
    compounds or their metabolites in surface waters (Ashton, Hilton & Thomas,
    2004). The results showed that a range of pharmaceuticals from different
    therapeutic classes were present in both effluents from sewage treatment works
    and receiving waters in England. The values reported were within the same
    range as those reported in continental Europe and the USA, where more
    extensive monitoring has been conducted. Results in the published literature
    for studies conducted in the USA and Europe also suggest that usage data
    are positively associated with concentrations of pharmaceuticals measured in
    effluent and in surface water bodies receiving the treated effluent. Tables 2
    and 3 show additional illustrative examples of pharmaceuticals that have been
    found in the United Kingdom and other European countries, respectively.

     the probabilistic method.

     The health end-point used in this review was the MTD. Owing to insufficient
     data, an MTD value of 10 mg per day was used for topically applied
     pharmaceuticals and a conservative MTD value of 1 mg per day was used for
     pharmaceuticals for which there were no data, including illegal drugs. For the
     DWI (2007) evaluation, an uncertainty factor of 1000 was applied for all the
     compounds as a precautionary value to extrapolate below the level at which
     effects might be seen. The resultant screening values were used for determining
     the priority substances for further examination by probabilistic modelling. This
     additional uncertainty factor, which is widely accepted as a precautionary step
     by the medical profession, also provides an additional reassurance with regard
     to exposure of infants and young children.

     The MOE for each of the targeted pharmaceuticals was derived by comparing
     the maximum estimated concentrations in drinking-water with the MTD. The
     results allow an assessment of the significance of individual pharmaceuticals
     through drinking-water exposure.

In applying the guidelines, the calculated guideline values for the
pharmaceuticals were compared with the highest concentrations measured in
secondary treated effluent to derive the MOEs. Most of the calculated MOEs
are more than 1000; given that this does not take into account reductions
achieved by treatment processes, it is unlikely that pharmaceutical chemicals
will be present at levels approaching the recommended guideline values or
cause any adverse impacts on human health.

  .The removal of some pharmaceuticals appears to be negative. This has been attributed to the way in which removal is calculated, without hydraulic retention time being considered. This
    means that the effluent sample does not directly correspond to the influent sample. In the case of carbamazepine, the increase observed was consistent, and the most probable cause was
    reported to be conversion of carbamazepine glucuronides and other conjugated metabolites to the parent compound by enzymatic processes in the treatment plant (Ternes et al., 1999; Vieno,

     Wick et al., 2009), depending on such factors as sludge age (DWI, 2007),                           2006; Snyder et al., 2007). Free chlorine was found to oxidize approximately

Advanced water treatment processes such as ozonation, advanced oxidation,
activated carbon and membrane processes (nanofiltration, reverse osmosis)
were demonstrated to achieve higher removal rates (above 99%) for targeted
pharmaceutical compounds in various published literature studies. However,
advanced oxidation processes can lead to incomplete degradation products,
such as metabolites, and future research could consider the value and feasibility
of studying the formation and impact of these metabolites (Celiz, Tso & Aga,
2009).

For drinking-water sources that are contaminated with pesticides, advanced
treatment may already be in place to meet regulations. In such cases, removal
of pharmaceuticals during treatment may already be optimized.

Most importantly, it is prudent to note that advanced and costly water
treatment technology will not be able to completely remove all micropollutants
to concentrations below the detection limits of the most sensitive analytical
procedures at all times. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the toxicological
relevance of various compounds in the context of appreciable risks to human
health. Increased or rapidly changing exposure arising from specific local
circumstances (e.g. a significant increase in the concentration of pharmaceuticals
in surface waters impacted by wastewater discharge) should be investigated.

An informed risk assessment considering the above principles is essential
before allocating scarce resources to upgrade or invest in additional advanced
treatment processes to reduce trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals in
drinking-water.

In view of the substantial margin of safety for consumption of very low
concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking-water (Chapter 2 in this report),
concerns over pharmaceuticals should not divert the attention and resources of
water suppliers and regulators from other chemical and pathogenic microbial
priorities. For example, although the government in Australia has issued
proposed guideline values for 84 pharmaceuticals for water reuse schemes,
microbial pathogens remain their overriding priority in water reuse (NRMMC,
EPHC & NHMRC, 2008).

     Consumers are accustomed to disposing of unwanted and expired
     medicines through household waste and sewers. Such improper
     disposal practices release pharmaceuticals into our environment,
     wastewater and water sources. There is therefore a need to raise
     public awareness and encourage consumers to adopt proper disposal
     practices for unwanted pharmaceuticals. In Australia, the RUM Project
     focuses on raising consumer awareness to inform consumers of the
     appropriate option for drug disposal (RUM, 2010). In addition to
     regulations under New York’s Drug Management and Disposal Act, the
     New York State Department of Environmental Conservation publishes
     posters for all pharmacies and retail stores that sell drugs to advise
     consumers on the proper storage and disposal of unwanted medication
     (DEC, 2010). Consumers can then serve as environmental stewards to
     reduce water pollution.

Reports of trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals
in the water cycle have raised concerns among
various stakeholders, such as drinking-water
regulators, governments, water suppliers and the
public, over potential human health risks from
exposure to very low levels of pharmaceuticals in
drinking-water.

This technical report aims to provide practical
guidance and recommendations in managing
concerns over pharmaceuticals in drinking-water,
taking into consideration the available scientific
knowledge and evidence. It emphasizes the
importance to prioritize this emerging issue in the
overall context of water safety management, which
includes microbial and other chemical risks that may
threaten the safety of drinking-water.
