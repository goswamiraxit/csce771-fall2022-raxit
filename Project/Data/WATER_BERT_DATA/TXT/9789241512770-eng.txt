x      POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
1. INTRODUCTION
  KEY MESSAGES
  1 Potable reuse represents a realistic, practical and relatively climate independent source of drinking-water.
  2 Potable reuse schemes will be complex and proponents will need to have sufficient resources and capabilities for successful
     implementation.
  3 Management of potable reuse schemes should be based on the framework for safe drinking-water, including water safety plans (WSPs).
  4 The first step in developing WSPs is to assemble a dedicated team with appropriate expertise in all aspects of potable reuse from
     wastewater collection to treatment and delivery of drinking-water to consumers.



1.1 Purpose of this guidance
Potable reuse can represent a realistic and practical source of drinking-water in many circumstances. The purpose of this
guidance is to describe how to apply appropriate management systems to the production of safe drinking-water from
municipal wastewater. At meetings of drinking-water quality experts convened by WHO in 2013 and 2014, it was agreed that
further guidance is required to assist drinking-water providers and regulators on how to plan, design and operate potable
reuse schemes. The need for guidance is based on increasing interest and development of potable reuse schemes in response
to growing pressures on available water resources. The scope of the guidance includes both direct and indirect potable reuse
(DPR and IPR) and, unless otherwise specified, the term potable reuse refers to both DPR and IPR (see Box 1.1).

The principles described in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ) (WHO, 2017a) apply to potable reuse,
but implementation involves consideration of particular issues associated with source water quality and complexity of potable
reuse schemes. The purpose of this document is to build upon the guidance provided in the GDWQ and a previous report
on potable reuse (WHO, 1975) with information on specific aspects of potable reuse, including the quality and protection of
source waters, types of treatment processes, additional monitoring considerations, potential use of environmental buffers and
engineered storages, and public acceptance. The guidance follows a similar approach to the GDWQ in providing information
on water quality and effective management and performance of potable reuse schemes. It does not provide detailed technical
design criteria for technologies used in potable reuse. No new guideline values or principles are introduced.

The guidance is intended for use by drinking-water suppliers and regulators who are familiar with the GDWQ and, in
particular, the “framework for safe drinking-water” including WSPs. As the starting point of potable reuse schemes is
untreated wastewater, proponents should also be aware of the potential application of sanitation safety plans (SSPs) (WHO,
2015a). The guidance could also be useful to others with an interest in potable reuse, including environmental health and
water resource professionals.


1.2 Drivers for potable reuse
Population growth, increased urbanization, catchment pressures, expanding areas of water scarcity and the impacts of
climate change on water availability are all increasing pressures on existing drinking-water resources, resulting in the need
to identify new or alternative sources of drinking-water supply. Between 2014 and 2050 the world population is expected
to increase by 33% from 7.2 billion to 9.6 billion (UNDESA, 2014). During this period, urban populations are projected to
grow by 61% from 3.9 billion to 6.3 billion, with the largest increases expected in Asia and Africa. This projection means that
the percentage of people living in urban areas will increase from 54% to 66%, with urbanization in 89 countries expected to
exceed 80% (UNDESA, 2014). At the same time droughts and flooding associated with climate change and climate variability
are also increasing pressure on water supplies (World Water Assessment Programme, 2009; IPCC, 2014; UNESCO, 2017).

One response is to reduce vulnerability to these impacts by increasing resilience, diversity, adaptability and sustainability of
drinking-water supplies. Developing new and preferably more climate independent water resources in close proximity to
major population centres should be a priority. Potable reuse and, in coastal areas, seawater desalination meet this definition.

                                                                                                                          INTRODUCTION   1
     Box 1.1 Definitions for potable reuse

     Wastewater is liquid waste discharged from homes and other residential premises, commercial and industrial premises and similar sources, to individual
     disposal systems or to municipal sewer pipes. It contains mainly human excreta and used water. Wastewater collected in municipal sewerage systems is
     called municipal wastewater or municipal sewage. In well-operated sewerage systems, contributions of industrial contaminants are reduced by management
     of industrial waste discharges (e.g. through pre-treatment).
     Indirect potable reuse (IPR) represents the planned addition of treated wastewater into water bodies used as sources of drinking-water. The water bodies,
     which can include rivers, lakes, reservoirs and aquifers, are referred to as environmental buffers. Water containing a proportion of treated wastewater is
     taken from the environmental buffer and further treated to provide drinking-water.
     Direct potable reuse (DPR) represents the introduction of treated wastewater (with or without retention in an engineered storage) into a drinking-
     water supply without prior discharge to an environmental buffer. The treated wastewater may be blended with raw water from a river, lake, reservoir or
     aquifer immediately before a drinking-water treatment plant; blended with treated water downstream of a conventional drinking-water treatment plant;
     or introduced directly into a drinking-water distribution system.
     Unplanned potable reuse (also known as unacknowledged or de facto potable reuse) represents various descriptions of the long-standing and common
     practice of producing drinking-water from water sources impacted by wastewater discharges. This is particularly common in river systems serving multiple
     urban centres where discharged wastewater (treated or untreated) becomes part of the water resource used by downstream centres. Providing that
     appropriate control measures, including treatment are applied, drinking-water supplies incorporating unplanned potable reuse are capable of producing
     safe drinking-water.



Potable reuse can produce large volumes of drinking-water from wastewater available from established collection systems
in both coastal and inland locations. In addition, it can reduce negative impacts of microbial hazards and in some cases
nutrients from wastewater discharges on marine and freshwater environments (Table 1.1) (UNESCO, 2017). Urban
settlements represent the main point sources of coastal and riverine water pollution with wastewater discharges being
significant contributors (World Water Assessment Programme, 2009; UNESCO, 2017).

The number of potable reuse schemes is increasing. From the pioneering starts in the 1960s of IPR at Montebello Forebay
(USEPA, 2012a) and DPR at Windhoek in 1969 (Du Pisani, 2006), potable reuse systems have been established in several
continents, including Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America (Table 1.2). A number of these schemes are
discussed in case studies included in this document (see Appendix 5). The majority of potable reuse schemes have been
developed in the 21st century and it is expected that potable reuse will increase as populations and pressure on finite water
resources continue to grow.

Economically and practically, potable reuse compares favourably with seawater desalination, which is also increasing in use.
In some cases, such as Singapore and Perth (Australia), desalination is used in combination with potable reuse. Limitations of
seawater desalination are that it is restricted to coastal areas and has high energy use. Except for schemes involving pumping
to distant environmental buffers (where used), potable reuse is less expensive than seawater desalination (Freeman et al,
2008; Law, 2008; NRC, 2012; ATSE, 2013; Tchobanoglous et al, 2015).

2          POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
1.3 Challenges of potable reuse
Potable reuse involves producing safe drinking-water from wastewater. Due to the very poor microbial quality of municipal
wastewaters and threats from chemical contamination, potable reuse is often a complex activity generally involving advanced
treatment processes and substantial management expertise (Table 1.1). It can involve coordination of separate wastewater
and drinking-water treatment plants. Before proceeding, proponents should ensure that they have sufficient resources
and capabilities (financial, technical and operational) to implement potable reuse schemes safely and sustainably. The
consequences of poor design or failure of control measures are substantial.


1.4 Direct and indirect potable reuse
Both DPR and IPR generally involve advanced treatment of wastewater to produce drinking-water. The point of difference
between DPR and IPR is the use of environmental buffers in IPR (see Box 1.1). The claimed benefits of environmental buffers
vary and include provision of a diluting step, blending, additional contaminant attenuation1 processes, time to respond to
treatment failure and reduction of negative public perceptions (ATSE, 2013).

From the commencement of planned potable reuse in the 1960s, most of the focus and the development of schemes
has involved IPR (Table 1.2). Indirect potable reuse schemes have been developed using a variety of surface water and
groundwater environmental buffers and treatment configurations. They are well established, accepted and have a long
history of successful operation (NRC, 1998; 2012). However, in recent years there has been increased support for DPR
including from the American National Research Council and other sources (Leverenz et al, 2011; NRC, 2012; ATSE, 2013;
Tchobanoglous et al, 2015; TWDB, 2015; NWRI, 2016; Olivieri et al, 2016). The numbers of DPR schemes are increasing
with development of small schemes in Beaufort West (South Africa), Cloudcroft (New Mexico, United States of America
[USA]) and Big Spring (Texas, USA) (Burgess, 2015; Dahl, 2014; Drewes & Horstmeyer, 2015).

Similar to IPR, DPR can involve a number of configurations with treated wastewater and conventional water sources
mixed before or after treatment (ATSE, 2013; Tchobanoglous et al, 2015; Drewes & Horstmeyer, 2015; Olivieri et al, 2016).
Advantages of DPR include that it avoids potential contamination of treated wastewater in environmental buffers, particularly
those involving surface water. Direct potable reuse avoids issues over water access rights, reducing pumping and transport
costs and can be applied in locations where suitable environmental buffers are not available (Leverenz et al, 2011; ATSE,
2013). However, a perceived disadvantage of DPR compared with IPR is that the lack of an environmental barrier reduces
the time available to respond to treatment failures and other incidents that could impair drinking-water quality prior to
supply to consumers. In this respect DPR is similar in nature to traditional drinking-water treatment plants. To some extent
the lack of an environmental buffer can be compensated through the use of constructed storages to monitor water quality
after treatment and before supply. While detention times will typically be much shorter than those in environmental buffers,
engineered storage buffers (ESBs) can provide an increased capacity to assess and interrogate operational monitoring results
and to implement responses before supply of water to consumers (Tchobanoglous et al, 2011; Leverenz et al, 2011; ATSE,
2013; Cotruvo, 2014). Responses could involve actions ranging from substituting alternative sources of water to issuing
public notifications. Engineered storages can also be important in the more traditional role of providing buffering storages
to deal with variations in water demand.

    Attenuation can include biotransformation and photolysis of organic chemicals (Fono et al, 2006) and inactivation, removal and reduced infectivity of microbial pathogens
    by natural ultraviolet (UV) light and predation.

4          POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
1.5 Unplanned potable reuse
There has been increased discussion about similarities between planned IPR and long-standing practices of using
drinking-water sources impacted by wastewater discharges (Asano et al, 2007; NRC, 2012). The latter is variously referred
to as unplanned, unacknowledged or de facto potable reuse. The term unplanned potable reuse is used in this document.
Although the presence of such discharges in drinking-water catchments represents a potential source of hazards to drinking-
water supplies and is not ideal, it is a common reality (Asano et al, 2007; Rice & Westerhoff, 2015; WHO, 2017a). In these
circumstances, wastewater treatment and use of drinking-water treatment commensurate with source water quality are
essential. Providing appropriate control measures are applied, drinking-water supplies incorporating unplanned potable
reuse are capable of delivering safe drinking-water (Asano et al, 2007; WHO, 2017a).

While the addition of various amounts of wastewater to drinking-water supplies through unplanned potable reuse is
common, there are important advantages associated with planned potable reuse. The act of planning can improve quality
assurance by providing increased control on the quantities of treated wastewater of typically higher quality added to drinking-
water sources and better management of impacts on water quality. Planned potable reuse typically includes extensive
monitoring of receiving waters, while this is less common or less frequent in unplanned potable reuse. Although the volume
contribution of unplanned reuse is often low, there are examples where wastewater represents a substantial proportion of
river flows, particularly during low flows (Swayne et al, 1980; NRC, 2012; Rice & Westerhoff, 2015). However, the impacts
of these flows on water quality at intakes to drinking-water supplies have often not been quantified, particularly in relation
to microbial quality. The impacts of transport and natural attenuation processes (e.g. distance, dilution, loss of infectivity,
predation and inactivation) on microbial contaminants have received limited attention. These knowledge gaps limit the
value of comparisons between planned and unplanned potable reuse.

Irrespective of this discussion, the important point is that whatever the source water, the end product should meet drinking-
water quality requirements. This can best be achieved through developing and implementing risk-based WSPs incorporating
control measures based on the multiple-barrier approach, to collectively deal with identified risks to ensure that health-based
requirements are met. This principle applies equally to planned and unplanned potable reuse. The influence of wastewater
discharges in unplanned potable reuse is often under-estimated and has been associated with documented outbreaks
associated with contaminated drinking-water (Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004; 2014). If properly managed, both planned and
unplanned potable reuse can produce safe drinking-water.


1.6 Implementation of potable reuse
Ensuring the consistent supply of safe drinking-water from all drinking-water schemes, including from potable reuse,
requires the application of the framework for safe drinking-water, as described in the GDWQ. The framework includes
three components:
     • Health-based targets: These are risk-based measurable objectives that define the safety of drinking-water. They
       include performance targets to achieve microbial safety and numerical water quality targets for chemical and
       radiological parameters.
     • Water safety plans: A comprehensive risk assessment and risk management approach developed and implemented
       by water suppliers. A WSP includes:
        – System assessment to identify, assess and ensure management of public health risks along the water supply chain.
          Key activities include describing the water supply system; identifying hazards and hazardous events and assessing
          the associated risks; determining and validating control measures, reassessing and prioritizing the risks; and
          developing, implementing and maintaining an improvement/upgrade plan.
        – Monitoring to determine whether the control measures put in place are effective, that the WSP is being implemented
          in practice and that the system, as a whole, is effective and achieving health-based targets. Key activities include
          defining monitoring of the control measures and verifying the effectiveness of the WSP.
        – Management and communication to ensure that appropriate operational and management systems are in place
          to support and sustain water safety. Key activities include preparing management procedures (including incident
          protocols) and developing supporting programmes.
     • Independent surveillance: Activities undertaken by the regulatory agency to ensure that WSPs are being implemented
       effectively and that health-based targets are being met.

                                                                                                            INTRODUCTION      5
WSPs for potable reuse need to apply to all steps of supply, from collection of wastewater through treatment, distribution
and supply to consumers. In some cases, wastewater management might be described in a separate SSP (WHO, 2015a),
particularly when different entities are responsible for wastewater management and provision of drinking-water. Sanitation
safety plans are based on the same principles as WSPs. As in WSPs, SSPs apply a preventive risk management approach to
the entire sanitary system from wastewater generation to end use. The core components of SSPs are system assessment,
monitoring, and management and communication.

Where both forms of safety plans are used, they will need to be coordinated to ensure that the overall scheme functions
effectively. For example, the outcomes from a SSP on identifying hazardous events; assessing or validating existing control
measures; assessing exposure risks; monitoring control measures; and verification of performance should feed into the
WSP. The WSP, which will have primacy in ensuring the safety of potable reuse, should include or reference all key elements
associated with managing the schemes, from wastewater collection to delivery of drinking-water at customers’ taps. This
guidance will focus on design and implementation of WSPs.

1.7 Stakeholder engagement
1.7.1 Assembling a water safety plan team
A qualified team with sufficient technical expertise and breadth of knowledge is needed to implement potable reuse schemes.
Assembling this team should be the first step in developing a WSP. The team should be assembled by the drinking-water supplier
and will include representatives from the supplier as well as a wider group of stakeholders. The number and type of stakeholders
involved in potable reuse schemes will be influenced by the nature and complexity of the scheme and existing arrangements
for wastewater management and production of drinking-water. For example, IPR with aquifer or reservoir storage may involve
more stakeholders than DPR and can include water resource and environment protection agencies (Angelotti & Grizzard, 2012;
NRC, 2012). In some cases, wastewater management and drinking-water supply is undertaken by one agency (Seah & Woo,
2012) while in others, responsibilities can be split (Angelotti & Grizzard, 2012). Irrespective of the number of entities involved
in potable reuse schemes, it is essential that all activities associated with wastewater management and production of drinking-
water are coordinated, and communication between all entities is maintained. Water safety plan teams should consult with and,
where appropriate, include representatives of each stakeholder to provide a comprehensive understanding of all components
of the water supply system, including the wastewater system, environmental buffers (if used) and the drinking-water system.
Representatives from SSP teams should be included where these are used to manage wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

1.7.2 Public engagement
A key to successful implementation of potable reuse is planned and targeted public engagement to build acceptance,
confidence and trust. Critical steps in the process are agreement that drinking-water supplies require augmentation with new
water sources and, that after consideration of plausible alternatives, potable reuse is the preferred and accepted choice. There
have been examples where potable reuse schemes have not proceeded due to public opposition. There is also evidence that
public acceptance can be achieved, with the support of successful engagement programmes leading to schemes proceeding.

1.8 Scope of this guidance
This document applies to planned potable reuse of treated wastewater including both DPR and IPR. Unplanned potable
reuse is not included within the scope of this document.

The document is based on the principles of the framework for safe drinking-water, including the key WSP components
of system assessment, monitoring, and management and communication (Figure 1.1). The intent is not to repeat general
information provided in the GDWQ but rather to focus on specific issues and characteristics that are relevant to potable
reuse, including the high concentrations of microbial pathogens and wide array of chemical hazards potentially present in
wastewater, wastewater management, specific treatment options such as advanced oxidation and the use of environmental
buffers or engineered storages as control measures. General information provided in the GDWQ and supporting resources,
such as the Water Safety Plan Manual (Bartram et al, 2009) and associated texts that support WSP development and
implementation, can be consulted for additional guidance.2

A number of case studies are also provided to illustrate successful development of potable reuse schemes. The case studies
include discussions of potable reuse in:
     • Windhoek, Namibia (DPR)
     • Orange Country California, USA (IPR)
     • Upper Occoquan Service Authority, Virginia, USA (IPR)
     • Singapore (IPR)
     • Perth, Australia (IPR)
     • Big Spring and Laguna Madre, Texas, USA (DPR)
     • eMalahleni, South Africa (DPR using acid mine drainage [AMD] water).

The case studies demonstrate a diversity of approaches and settings and include coastal and inland schemes, IPR with
groundwater and surface water buffers, and DPR using wastewater and AMD as source waters. In the case of Singapore and
Perth, the potable reuse schemes are part of multiple source systems including traditional water supplies and desalination
showing that combinations of sources can increase resilience.

    KEY MESSAGES
    1 Untreated wastewater as a source for potable reuse can contain high concentrations of enteric pathogens. These
        represent the highest risk to the safety of potable reuse schemes.
    2 A broad array of chemical hazards can be present in wastewater, including industrial, commercial and domestic.
    3 Concentrations of chemicals/contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products are
        generally low (ng to µg per L).
    4 Control measures should be applied from collection of wastewater to delivery of drinking-water to consumers. Control measures at
        the source include requirements on industrial discharge quality and changing wastewater collection areas to reduce or eliminate
        industrial discharges.
    5   Potable reuse generally requires complex treatment trains with high levels of reliability. Control measures need to be validated.
    6   Environmental buffers used in IPR can provide time to detect and respond to failures, storage capacity, contaminant removal and
        dilution. However, they can reduce the purity of highly treated wastewater by the addition of natural organic matter, naturally
        occurring chemicals (from groundwater) and enteric pathogens.
    7   Engineered storages can provide time to respond to water concerns, including treatment failures (primarily associated with
        microbiological quality).
    8   Issues to be considered when blending DPR water with other sources of drinking-water include the need to stabilize DPR water to
        reduce impacts on treatment performance, (including disinfection and formation of disinfection by-products – DBPs) and corrosion.
        Potential impacts of IPR on environmental buffers also need to be considered.




While WSPs apply equally well to all types of drinking-water supplies, there are specific characteristics of potable reuse
schemes that need to be considered as part of system assessment. These include the high concentrations of microbial
pathogens in wastewater and potential presence of a wide range of industrial, commercial and domestic chemicals.




8         POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
The GDWQ and supporting documents (listed in Annex 1 of the GDWQ) provide a comprehensive discussion of microbial,
chemical and radiological public health hazards and acceptability parameters that can potentially influence the quality of
drinking-water. This information is particularly relevant to wastewater, which by its nature can contain a broad array of
contaminants.

Although there are numerous hazards that can compromise drinking-water produced by potable reuse schemes, not all
will represent significant risks to human health. Risks need to be assessed and prioritized by determining the likelihood of
occurrence at significant concentrations and the probability and severity of consequences if inadequate control measures
are applied. Health-based-targets provide the mechanism for defining significant concentrations (see Chapter 5).

To address the higher concentrations of microbial pathogens and wide array of potential chemical contaminants, potable
reuse schemes typically incorporate complex combinations of control measures, including industrial discharge management,
water and wastewater treatment processes, and the use of natural systems to provide high levels of pathogen removal and
protection against chemical hazards. Due to the higher levels of microbial contaminants in wastewater, there is an increased
need, during the design of potable reuse schemes, to ensure that the performance of control measures is validated, to
demonstrate that they are capable of providing the required levels of hazard reduction.


2.1 Microbial hazards
Unsafe drinking-water can be a significant source of enteric pathogens with the potential to cause large outbreaks, such as the
cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Milwaukee (MacKenzie, 1994; Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004; 2014). As described in this guidance
and the GDWQ, protecting public health from waterborne illness caused by microbial hazards is of paramount importance.

One of the challenges for potable reuse is that it involves closing the gap between wastewater and drinking-water systems.
By design, municipal wastewater systems collect pathogens, particularly those transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the
intent of separating them from communities as well as drinking-water sources. Pathogens that can be found in wastewater
are diverse in characteristics and behaviour and include bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths (Table 2.1). The greatest
risk from exposure to wastewater is gastrointestinal disease following ingestion of enteric pathogens, but other routes of
transmission such as inhalation of aerosols or dermal contact can also lead to disease.

Most of the enteric pathogens that cause gastrointestinal illnesses, with the notable exception of Vibrio cholerae, do not grow
or survive indefinitely in water. Hence, the prevalence and concentration of these pathogens in wastewater will reflect the
types and rates of disease in the community. Ranges of reported concentrations in untreated wastewater are provided in
Table 2.2. In contrast, so-called free-living pathogens, such as Legionella and mycobacteria, which are generally transmitted
by routes other than ingestion, can grow under favourable conditions in treated water and associated biofilms, and, in some
cases, can survive within amoeba, in distribution systems (Marciano-Cabral et al, 2010).

As a general note, care should be taken in interpreting microbial data as reported pathogen concentrations can be derived
using different methods, such as microscopy, culture and detection of genetic material using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and next generation sequencing. Culture-based methods tend to be time consuming and are not available for all
pathogens but have the advantage of detecting living organisms. Tests using PCR and next generation sequencing are much
quicker and are powerful tools for detecting the physical presence of microbial pathogens or components of pathogens, but
do not generally determine viability or infectivity.

Occasionally, emerging pathogens arise with possible links to water and wastewater. In the past 40 years, this has included
pathogens such as Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium (WHO, 2003). Discharge in faecal material and collection of these
pathogens by municipal wastewater systems does not automatically mean that transmission through water and wastewater
represents a health risk and this needs to be assessed as emerging pathogens arise. For example, the likelihood of transmission
of pathogens such as avian influenza (H5N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronaviruses and Ebola virus through
wastewater and drinking-water is extremely low (WHO, 2014; 2017a; CDC, 2014).

Issues have also been raised about the potential for selection and development of antibiotic resistant microorganisms in
treated wastewater (WHO, 2015c). Antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) are a substantial
worldwide public health issue and concerns have also been raised about exposure to ARB and ARG in water (WHO, 2015c;
Olivieri et al, 2016). However, as the level of treatment applied in potable reuse schemes will generally exceed that used in
existing drinking-water treatment plants, after treatment, concentrations of ARB and ARG in potable reuse schemes are
likely to be lower than those found in conventional drinking-water supplies (Olivieri et al, 2016).

  The data shown is indicative and should be used with caution. Reported concentrations are highly variable and rely on different methods. For
  example, bacteria are usually detected using culture-based methods while virus concentrations can be determined using culture (e.g. adenovirus)
  or nucleic acid based methods (e.g. norovirus, rotavirus). The relationship between genome concentrations and infectivity is variable.

2.2 Chemical hazards
Chemical hazards in wastewater can include a wide range of substances that are naturally occurring or of anthropogenic
origin. They include industrial chemicals, chemicals used in households, chemicals excreted by people, and chemicals used
or formed during wastewater and drinking-water treatment processes (Table 2.3). Depending on the type of chemical hazard,
concentrations may range from <1 ng to mg per L (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008). Metals and inorganic chemicals
are generally present in higher concentrations (µg to mg per L) while pharmaceuticals and personal care products, when
detected, are generally present in lower concentrations (ng to µg per L). While the list of chemical hazards in wastewater
can be broad, studies have shown that concentrations typically detected are well below those that would represent a risk to
public health (Schwab et al, 2005; Snyder et al, 2008; NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008; Bruce et al, 2010; Bull et al, 2011;
WHO, 2012) (see Chapter 5).

Depending on the management and control of industrial discharges, wastewater can have significant industrially related
chemical contributions. There are millions of chemical formulations available commercially and the number of chemicals
synthesized has grown tremendously over the past few decades (Snyder, 2014). Although only a small proportion of these
chemicals will be in commercial or industrial use at any one time, the nature of municipal wastewater systems dictates that
nearly all commercial products in use have some propensity to be collected and delivered to municipal WWTPs. Hence,
wastewater can present a continually evolving composition of chemicals in complex mixtures. It is likely that chemical
constituents will vary widely among regions depending on local circumstances and industrial activities. Industrial discharges
can be a source of heavy metals, synthetic industrial chemicals, manufactured pesticides and pharmaceuticals, volatile
organic carbons (VOCs), dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Table 2.3).

Domestic waste can also be a source of a wide range of chemical hazards, including, those in faecal material and laundry,
and kitchen and bathroom discharges. These can include pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, natural steroidal hormones,
personal care products such as soaps, insect repellents, detergents, cleaning products, veterinary products used for pet care
and antiseptics. Domestic waste can also be a source of chemicals from disposal of excess products, including paints, oils,
garden pesticides and unused pharmaceuticals. Some countries have established programmes to reduce disposal of excess
chemicals (USEPA, 2016; WHO, 2012).

Algal toxins such as microcystins, nodularins, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxins and saxitoxins are all naturally produced
by freshwater cyanobacteria (blue-green algae); some of the toxins are hepatotoxic (microcystins, cylindrospermopsins
and nodularins) while others are neurotoxic (anatoxins and saxitoxins). Under suitable conditions, cyanobacteria may
grow, and possibly produce toxins in wastewaters, wastewater storages (e.g. lagoons) or in surface water bodies used as
environmental buffers.




12        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Disinfection by-products are formed by reactions between disinfectants and organic and inorganic constituents of water and
are commonly produced at traditional drinking-water treatment plants. High initial concentrations of organic components,
ammonia, bromide or iodide in wastewater may lead to elevated production of various, and sometimes unique, DBPs in
potable reuse schemes. The nature and concentrations of DBPs will be influenced by:
     • Nitrification at the WWTP and the efficacy of treatment processes in removing organic compounds prior to
       disinfection (Krasner et al, 2009).
     • Wastewater possibly containing elevated concentrations of bromide and iodide leading to different DPB formation
       patterns compared with typical groundwaters or surface waters used as sources of drinking-water.
     • The types of disinfectant used and various process parameters (e.g. temperature, pH, detention times in distribution
       systems). Formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) has been identified as a greater issue when chloramination
       is a final disinfectant (Sgroi et al, 2015). Bromate, brominated DBPs and iodinated DBPs can be produced by oxidation
       of bromide and iodide; chlorate and chlorite can be formed by decomposition of hypochlorite and can be produced
       from use of chlorine dioxide (Krasner, 2009).

In comparison to chemical disinfectants the production of DBPs from UV disinfection is less well established, but will
depend upon factors such as the UV dose and the production of secondary oxidative species, such as hydroxyl radicals,
which may catalyse chemical transformations within the water matrix.

Emerging chemicals/materials of concern include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and nanoparticles. Per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances are persistent and some are highly water soluble. They are used in the production of water-
resistant and stain-resistant products, including furniture fabrics, cookware and clothing, as well as in fire fighting foams.
They also arise from the breakdown of fluorotelomer alcohols, which are widely used in consumer products such as
greaseproof food wrappers and stain-resistant carpet treatments. Perfluorinated residues (predominantly perfluorooctanoic
acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate) have been detected in treated wastewater (Zareitalabad et al, 2013).

Nanomaterials are defined as natural or manufactured materials containing particles where one or more external dimensions
range in size between 1 and 100 nanometres (European Union, 2011; Water Research Australia, 2013). The toxicological
concerns for nanoparticles are related not only to their chemical composition, but also to their physical parameters, including
particle size, shape, surface area, surface chemistry, porosity, aggregation and homogeneity of dispersions. As such, traditional
techniques used for toxicological and eco-toxicological evaluation of chemical substances are not readily applied to the
evaluation of nanoparticles (Hussain et al, 2009). Airborne exposures are the predominant risk concerns. There is limited
knowledge about risks associated with waterborne exposures (Hussain et al, 2009; Neale et al, 2012).


2.3 Radiological hazards
Radionuclides are a category of contaminants that can be present in wastewater. Radionuclides are elements or isotopes whose
nuclei spontaneously disintegrate to release alpha particles (helium nuclei), beta particles (electrons) or high energy gamma
radiation; some produce more than one type of emission. Exposure to radiation may increase the long-term incidence of cancer.

Occurrence, fate and transport of radionuclides are reasonably well understood. Most radionuclides are naturally occurring
and estimates of worldwide average annual exposures to radiation from cosmic rays, terrestrial radiation, inhalation, food
and drinking-water are about 2.4 mSv and the typical average dose is 1 to 13 mSv. The dominant source of radiation is
inhalation of radon (UNSCEAR, 2008).

Potential sources of radionuclides in wastewater include nuclear power plants and other facilities that use radioactive material
for manufacturing. Such radionuclide releases are usually tightly regulated and exposures from artificial sources are minimal
relative to natural background radiation. Medical facilities and patients discharging clinically used radionuclides can also be
a source. Medical applications for radioisotopes include iodine-131 (half-life ~8 days) contrast media and technetium-99m
(half-life ~6 hours). The short half-lives reduce persistence of these radioisotopes following shedding from out-patients or
patients discharged from hospitals. Discharges from medical facilities to wastewater systems should be prevented.

Standard treatment technologies and processes used in potable reuse are effective in removing radionuclides.

2.4 Acceptability aspects – taste, odour and appearance
Acceptability aspects for other drinking-water sources are also applicable to potable reuse (WHO, 2017a, Chapter 10).
However, some aesthetic issues are of particular relevance for potable reuse schemes due to source water quality, treatment
processes and potential impacts on distribution systems due to blending. Wastewater is highly turbid and typically contains
large numbers of compounds that can cause unacceptable tastes and odours. Treatment processes included in potable reuse
schemes are effective in removing turbidity and taste and odour compounds.

Consumers generally assess the quality of their drinking-water by appearance, taste and odour rather than by reviewing
physical, chemical and biological results. Therefore, appearance, taste and odour of drinking-water must be acceptable
to generate and maintain public perception of high-quality water. Drinking-water produced by potable reuse schemes
should match or exceed the acceptability characteristics of drinking-water from conventional local sources to maintain
public confidence. Unacceptable appearance, taste or odour in drinking-water supply augmented with potable reuse will
exacerbate consumer unease associated with its origin. Consumers may perceive that recycled water is not adequately
treated to remove wastewater-derived contaminants if objectionable or variable taste, odours or colour are present, even
when all health-based targets are met.


2.4.1 Taste and odour
Wastewater can contain a wide range of organic compounds that can give rise to odours ranging from ammonia to fishy and
putrid, often at low concentrations (Burlingame et al, 2004; Suffet & Rosenfeld, 2007; Agus et al, 2011). Many wastewater-
derived compounds have been extensively studied for their potential to produce nuisance odours (Burlingame et al, 2004;
Agus et al, 2011). Common odour compounds or classes reported from WWTPs include hydrogen sulfide, organic sulfides
(thiols), thiophenes, aldehydes, haloanisoles, halophenols, fatty acids and amines. In a well-operated municipal WWTP
with aerobic processes, these odour compounds are typically removed from the liquid phase. Due to their relatively high
volatility, a significant portion of wastewater-derived odorants are removed during open-air sedimentation, mixing and
aeration. Many odorants, such as amines and alkyl acids, are biodegraded by microbes in activated sludge, trickling filters,
biofilters or bioreactors. However, complete removal is not always achieved and in some cases odorants are detected in
secondary wastewater at concentrations above odour thresholds (Agus et al, 2011).

While traditional wastewater treatment processes can reduce or remove many odour-producing chemicals, some aerobic
and anaerobic biological processes employed for wastewater treatment may contribute to odours by transforming larger
natural or anthropogenic organic materials into smaller organic compounds with odorous functional groups, e.g. alkyl
acids, ketones or phenols. Wastewater processes such as trickling filters and activated sludge processes (ASPs) can support
the growth of microorganisms including actinomycetes that produce geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol. These compounds
produce earthy and musty/mouldy odours at very low concentrations (5–10 ng/L, Burlingame et al, 2004).

Treatment processes used in potable reuse that reduce organic contaminants such as soil-aquifer treatment (SAT), reverse
osmosis (RO), activated carbon and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can reduce most wastewater odorants. While no
single treatment process guarantees complete removal of taste and odour compounds from wastewater the combinations
of processes typically used in potable reuse schemes should be effective.

The use of environmental buffers in IPR schemes may intensify or mitigate aesthetic concerns depending on the quality
of the surface water source or characteristics of the aquifer. Blending in surface reservoirs and rivers will reduce volatile
organic odorants by aeration but may introduce odour compounds such as geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol due to the
occurrence of cyanobacteria.

Target concentrations have generally not been set for specific taste and odour compounds. In part this is due to the
subjective nature of acceptability, local preferences and difference in sensory sensitivity which means that actual threshold
concentrations and criteria for individual consumers can vary greatly. To determine acceptability of water supply augmented
with recycled water, it is recommended that consumer satisfaction studies should be performed.




14     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
2.4.2 Colour and turbidity
Colour in domestic wastewater may range from light-brownish grey to black but it significantly diminishes to light yellow
or light brown following secondary treatment (Metcalf & Eddy, 2003). Drinking-water containing colour at or below 15 true
colour units is typically considered acceptable by consumers (WHO, 2017a). Treatment processes such as RO, advanced
oxidation, ozone-biological activated carbon (ozone-BAC) and oxidizing disinfectants used in potable reuse schemes can
all reduce colour to acceptable levels. While turbidity due to suspended solids in untreated wastewater is high, treatment
processes used in potable reuse are very effective in reducing turbidity to below 0.1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU).
Crystal clear water has a turbidity of <1 NTU; water does not become visibly cloudy until it reaches 4 NTU or above (WHO,
2017b).

Colour and turbidity can increase in distribution systems as a consequence of poor corrosion control, particularly when
RO is included in the treatment train and the product water is not stabilized to reduce corrosion potential (Section 2.5.4).


2.4.3 Salinity
Salinity in wastewater depends on the initial salinity of the local mains water source and other factors such as intrusion of
saline groundwater into sewerage systems. The palatability of water with a total dissolved solids (TDS) level of less than
about 600 mg/L is generally considered to be good (WHO, 2017a). If TDS levels are significantly above 600 mg/L, they can
be reduced by RO. Other processes such as media filtration, microfiltration (MF) or nanofiltration (NF) are not effective
in the removal of salinity.


2.5 Control measures
Control measures should be applied from collection of wastewater to delivery of drinking-water to consumers. While
treatment processes tend to be a focus of potable reuse schemes, other control measures designed to prevent contamination
as close to the source as possible (e.g. industrial waste controls) are essential and should be included.

There are no prescriptive combinations of control measures that must be used in potable reuse schemes. The selection of
control measures will often be influenced by existing infrastructure for wastewater and drinking-water treatment, established
mechanisms to deal with industrial discharges, location (i.e. inland or coastal), availability of environmental buffers and
regulatory specifications. For example, regulatory authorities may define a minimum number of treatment barriers (see
Box 2.1). As a result, the treatment technologies and control measures employed can be quite diverse.


2.5.1 Source water protection
Source water for potable reuse schemes is wastewater which may contain domestic and commercial waste and, depending
on design, industrial and stormwater contributions. In some situations, it may be possible to separate industrial and
municipal waste streams. For example, in some locations, urban planning may allow heavy industries to be located away
from catchments of WWTPs used as the source of a potable reuse facility (e.g. see Singapore Case Study, CS4).

In many cases, potable reuse schemes are developed as extensions of established municipal WWTPs. In these circumstances
changing collection areas to reduce or eliminate industrial discharges may not be possible. However, control measures can
be applied to reduce impacts of industrial discharges on wastewater quality. Waste discharge restrictions and pre-treatment
requirements can significantly reduce the presence of chemical contaminants (Mosher et al, 2016). Controls on discharges
of contaminants that either will adversely impact on the biological treatment processes in the WWTP or are not well
removed by physical and chemical treatment processes will improve process efficiency and finished water quality. Many
jurisdictions provide specific guidance on pre-treatment programmes for industrial dischargers (USEPA, 2011; WSAA,
2012). Community education programmes, such as those designed to reduce disposal of chemical wastes (e.g. unused
paints, solvents and pharmaceuticals, etc.) via the sewerage system, may also have a beneficial impact on improving source
water quality (WHO, 2012; USEPA, 2016).




                                                                  SYSTEM ASSESSMENT: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL MEASURES   15
It is also important to note that in many parts of the world, sewerage systems may be combined with urban drainage
(stormwater primarily) and thus will be subjected to loading from urban runoff. Even in situations where stormwater is
not intentionally combined, sewerage systems are generally not operated under pressure and can be subject to infiltration
during rain events (Lee et al, 2015).

Organizations responsible for treating wastewater for subsequent potable reuse should undertake risk assessments to
determine the range of contaminants that may be found in wastewater used as a source for potable reuse schemes. Such
risk assessments should consider the sources of wastewater, including the range and number of industrial and commercial
premises providing discharges. These risk assessments should inform the design of treatment/management plans.

Control measures to prevent contamination should also be applied where environmental buffers are used. These should
take the form of normal catchment management activities to reduce spills, impacts of urban, industrial and agricultural
discharges and growth of cyanobacteria in surface water bodies. Catchment management should also be applied to prevent
contamination of groundwater.


2.5.2 Treatment
Following source water management, the next barriers to contamination are treatment technologies used to reduce
concentrations of remaining microbial, chemical and radiological hazards to acceptable levels. Depending on established
infrastructure, potable reuse schemes can include conventional WWTPs, advanced treatment plants and drinking-water
treatment plants. All applied treatment processes should be considered as components of the potable reuse system. Different
organizations may be responsible for operating the various treatment plants, hence coordination and communication will
be essential to ensure consistent performance of the various components is maintained.

From a risk management perspective, the removal and disinfection of pathogens remain the most critical issues in the
design of potable water reuse treatment trains since acute exposures can lead to immediate disease outbreak. Chemical
contaminants with limited exceptions (e.g. copper and nitrate) are generally not considered acute threats but long-term
chronic exposures may lead to adverse health outcomes.

As for all drinking-water supplies, ensuring safety is based on the use of multiple barriers, and in the case of potable reuse
should consider the entire system from collection of wastewater to production and supply of drinking-water to consumers
While this includes source water control, potable reuse schemes require multiple treatment barriers to ensure safety. In some
cases, minimum numbers of barriers may be specified in policies or regulations (see Box 2.1). The selection of processes
to include in a multiple-barrier treatment system should consider including a pre-determined level of redundancy tailored
to the removal of microbial and chemical contaminants (see Section 2.5.5). This design principle has been followed in
potable reuse schemes worldwide (Drewes & Khan, 2011; 2015). The multiple-barrier approach ensures that performance
failure at a single barrier should not lead to significant failure to remove microbial or chemical contaminants. As such, the
multiple-barrier approach may be most effective when processes with diverse modes of operation and removal mechanisms
are employed (see Section 2.5.5).



     Box 2.1 Multiple-barrier approach
     In a 1975 report on potable reuse it was recommended that multiple-barrier treatment designs should ensure that each pollutant should be reduced in
     concentration by at least two, and preferably by three or more, processes (WHO, 1975). In line with this recommendation the DPR scheme in Windhoek,
     Namibia, was specifically designed to include multiple barriers (Du Pisani & Menge, 2013; Law et al, 2015). The treatment train includes seven treatment
     barriers to address:
     • microbiological pollutants (three of the barriers)
     • physical and organoleptic parameters (two of the barriers)
     • trace organics and DBPs (four of the barriers)
     • critical parameters with no public health risk (e.g. stability) (one barrier).
     The Californian regulations for potable reuse specify that treatment trains for IPR must include at least three separate processes for each pathogen (CDPH,
     2014).


16         POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
The primary categories of treatment employed in potable reuse schemes are biological processes, physical separation
(filtration and adsorption), chemical oxidation and disinfection processes. These processes are described below. Multiple
combinations of these processes are possible, but, typically, advanced treatment processes such as membrane filtration,
advanced oxidation and activated carbon follow a biological wastewater treatment process such as activated sludge or
membrane bioreactor (MBR), which are primarily designed to remove organic matter, nutrients and some microbial
pathogens. Subsequent advanced processes provide additional barriers to pathogens and chemical contaminants that
might also result in reduction of salinity and nutrients (NRC, 2012). Some IPR schemes, such as the Montebello Forebay
Scheme in Southern California, USA, rely on treatment systems such as SAT that combine multiple removal mechanisms
(i.e. filtration, adsorption, biodegradation) using naturally based subsurface treatment systems (see Box 2.2). More recent
designs have generally favoured ozonation, activated carbon adsorption, AOPs and low pressure membrane filtration
(Drewes & Khan, 2011; 2015).

Communities in coastal regions have tended to adopt the type of treatment train developed by Orange County, USA (see
Box 2.2), and similar schemes incorporating RO have been installed in Singapore, Australia and Europe. In the absence of
ocean discharges, inland communities such as Windhoek, Namibia, have preferred non-RO based schemes and selected
combinations of oxidation processes, activated carbon filtration, biofiltration and membrane filtration (see Box 2.2).



  Box 2.2 Setting the scene: Pioneering potable reuse schemes
  Montebello Forebay, United States of America: Potable reuse was first implemented in the 1960s using surface spreading followed by SAT, where
  wastewater after secondary treatment, chlorination and media filtration is infiltrated through the vadose zone into the aquifer at the Rio Hondo and San
  Gabriel Coast Spreading Grounds. The recharged groundwater blended with native groundwater is subsequently recovered, disinfected and fed into the
  drinking-water distribution system.
  Orange County, United States of America: Potable reuse was introduced with development of Water Factory 21 in 1976. The scheme included injection
  of treated wastewater into a coastal aquifer. Water Factory 21 was replaced by the Groundwater Replenishment System in 2007. Following treatment by
  conventional biological wastewater processes, MF, RO, AOP (UV/H2O2), stabilization and final chlorination, wastewater is injected into the coastal aquifer
  to provide a seawater intrusion barrier and percolated from several lakes into groundwater used as a source of drinking-water that is often not chlorinated
  after withdrawal.
  Windhoek, Namibia: The first DPR scheme was introduced in the 1960s. The current scheme combines biological treatment, ozonation, dissolved air
  flotation, media filtration, activated carbon adsorption and ultrafiltration (UF) of wastewater, with the product water blended with drinking-water produced
  from surface water/groundwater and fed into the drinking-water distribution system.



In practice, full-scale potable reuse schemes include a large variety of process combinations (Drewes & Khan, 2011; USEPA,
2012a; Gerrity et al, 2013b; Burgess, 2015; Onyango et al, 2015; Tchobanoglous et al, 2015). Figure 2.1 shows examples of
potable water reuse schemes already in operation.

The selection of a treatment train for a specific potable reuse scheme must be carefully evaluated by each community.
Irrespective of which treatment combination is selected, safety will depend on meeting health-based targets identified for
microbial, chemical and radiological quality (Chapter 5) through application of multiple-barrier processes along with online
or frequent operational monitoring to ensure consistent and reliable operation.

The design of potable reuse schemes needs to consider wastewater flows and loads as these can vary diurnally (Nelson et
al, 2011), from day to day (Huerta-Fontela et al, 2008; Gerrity et al, 2011) and seasonally (Merel et al, 2015b).

Wastewater treatment
Initial treatment steps in potable reuse schemes typically involve traditional wastewater treatment processes. In many cases,
potable reuse schemes retain existing WWTPs. Although possible, replacing existing WWTPs can increase the cost of potable
reuse systems as well as presenting practical difficulties during construction. However, wastewater from established treatment
plants may exhibit wide variability in quality depending on the types of processes in place and their management (Ort et
al, 2010). Maintaining and optimizing effective wastewater treatment is extremely important for efficiency and efficacy of
later advanced treatment processes. Where necessary, upgrades of existing plants should be considered to reduce variability
and reduce the burden on subsequent treatment processes.

Wastewater treatment plants typically include primary and secondary treatment processes and may include advanced
treatment (sometimes identified as tertiary treatment).

Primary treatment is essentially a physical treatment process which removes suspended solids. It removes some organic
nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals but only provides limited removal of microbial pathogens.

Secondary treatment involves biological digestion and is commonly based on some form of ASP or trickling filters. It
removes organic materials by digestion and should reduce biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids by 85% or
more (Metcalf & Eddy, 2003; Asano et al, 2007). Particle bound chemicals are removed and concentrations of microbial
pathogens are reduced (see Section 2.6). Targeted nutrient reduction processes are often included in the design of ASPs,
e.g. biological nutrient reduction (BNR). Nitrification and denitrification processes, in particular, can greatly improve
water quality for downstream processes such as advanced oxidation and chlorination by removing ammonia and nitrate,
respectively. Maintaining longer solids retention times in activated sludge based processes can provide attenuation of many
trace organic contaminants (Clara et al, 2005; Gerrity et al, 2013a).

In recent years, secondary treatment has seen increased use of MBRs where membrane filtration (MF or UF) is integrated
with biological treatment in the form of a suspended growth bioreactor. The membranes are used to reject solids generated



18           POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
by the biological process resulting in the production of clarified secondary effluent. The membrane filters provide enhanced
removal of microbial pathogens with the extent of removal depending on pore size. This removal is enhanced by formation
of a cake layer on the surface of membranes during operation, which effectively reduces pore sizes and increases removal
of small particles such as viruses (Branch & Le-Clech, 2015).

Advanced treatment can include a range of processes of the type used in drinking-water treatment plants. These include
oxidation, adsorption, media filtration, membrane filtration and disinfection and are discussed below.

Soil-aquifer treatment
From a technical point of view, perhaps the most basic and robust potable reuse treatment is groundwater infiltration,
which is also known as SAT (Laws et al, 2011). Soil-aquifer treatment is a low technology process where treated wastewater
percolates from spreading basins through soil which provides nutrient, microbial and chemical attenuation. Soil-aquifer
treatment requires availability of unconfined aquifers, vadose zones with no constricting layers and soil that allows for
infiltration while being fine enough to provide filtration. Subsequent aquifer storage also results in reduction of microbial
pathogens and some chemical contaminants. While monitoring data show that viruses and bacteria are rapidly attenuated
during SAT (Betancourt et al, 2014), some trace organic chemicals can be highly persistent and may not be well attenuated
in this type of natural system (Snyder et al, 2004; Laws et al, 2011). In the Montebello Forebay of Los Angeles, USA,
treated wastewater is infiltrated into the groundwater which is later harvested and disinfected with chlorine before direct
distribution as potable water. The post-SAT water meets, or exceeds, all state and federal laws for drinking-water quality.
Aquifer storage involving direct injection of treated wastewater into aquifers without soil infiltration is also used for potable
reuse (see Case Study 5).

Oxidative processes
Many potable reuse treatment schemes utilize an oxidative process for attenuation of organic contaminants. The most
common oxidative processes, ozonation and AOP, can be extremely effective but by-product formation must be carefully
monitored and controlled. Operational and energy costs are high. Advanced oxidation processes enhance degradation of
chemical contaminants through increased production of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and UV light
or ozone and UV light. Advanced oxidation is effective against a wider range of organic chemicals and at higher reaction
rates than standard oxidation processes (Kommineni et al, 2000; Wang & Xu, 2012).

Using processes such as biological active carbon (BAC) following oxidative processes can be very effective for reducing
many organic transformation compounds produced by the oxidation step, although some substances such as bromate are
generally not effectively removed (Asami et al, 1999). In addition to providing attenuation of organic chemicals, AOPs also
provide high levels of microbial pathogen inactivation (Section 2.6).

Activated carbon adsorption
Adsorptive activated carbon can remove the vast majority of organic contaminants. However, breakthrough from the
activated carbon can occur as a function of molecular structure or contaminants, water quality, the type of activated carbon,
and the operational parameters employed (Snyder et al, 2007; Redding et al, 2009; Anumol et al, 2015). The use of activated
carbon can be relatively expensive and will require periodic replacement or reactivation. Activated carbon also can serve
as a support structure for the growth and retention of biological organisms resulting in formation of BAC which may be
operated as a stand-alone process or preceding absorptive granular activated carbon (GAC). While adsorptive removal
of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by BAC deteriorates over time, the removal of biodegradable DOC increases and is
maintained for many years (Pipe-Martin et al, 2010; Rattier et al, 2012).

Media filtration
Media filtration is one of the most common treatment processes used to remove particles and associated microbial pathogens
from sources of drinking-water. Media filtration includes slow sand, rapid sand, granular or dual media filters using
materials such as sand and anthracite. Filters act to remove suspended solids from source waters. Coagulation, flocculation
and sedimentation are often used immediately prior to media filtration to enhance particle removal. As an alternative to


                                                                    SYSTEM ASSESSMENT: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL MEASURES   19
sedimentation, dissolved air flotation can be used to remove flocs using fine air bubbles which float particles to the surface
of tanks where they can be removed by skimming. Particles trapped by media filtration are removed by taking filters out of
service and backwashing them to dislodge and discharge trapped particles. Media filtration needs careful management and
monitoring to maintain optimum performance. Particular care needs to be taken at the end of filter runs, during return to
service following backwash and at start up following interruptions to use. Incorporating filter to waste for a short period
following backwash can reduce the possibility of poor performance. Media filtration provides an effective barrier to protozoa
and to a lesser extent viruses and bacteria (USEPA, 2005).

Low pressure membrane filtration
Low pressure membrane filtration includes MF and UF with pore sizes ranging from 0.1–0.2 microns for MF to 0.01–0.05
microns or less for UF (USEPA, 2005) (Figure 2.2). Membranes are typically manufactured as flat sheets or hollow fibres
using synthetic polymers and remove particles primarily by size exclusion although electrostatic repulsion and adsorption
can play a role (USEPA, 2005). Filtration can be improved by formation of a cake layer fouling on the surface of membranes
during operation which effectively reduces pore sizes and increases removal of small particles such as viruses.

Membrane filtration is being used with increasing frequency in drinking-water and wastewater reuse schemes as effective
barriers for pathogenic protozoa and to a lesser extent the smaller viral pathogens (USEPA, 2005). In potable reuse schemes
membrane filtration can be used to provide consistently low turbidity water that reduces fouling of subsequent processes
such as NF and RO.

Ceramic filters which also remove microbial pathogens by size exclusion are attracting increased interest as alternatives
to membrane filters (Duke, 2014). They have a higher capital cost but operate at lower pressures and are longer lasting.

High pressure membrane filtration
High pressure desalting membranes such as RO and NF are extremely effective physical barriers for all pathogens and
most organic contaminants (Bellona et al, 2008). Most RO membranes can remove upwards of 99% of salinity from water
and hence are expected to provide an even greater removal of microbial contaminants (Figure 2.2). Nanofiltration is not
as effective in removing salinity but will remove substantial amounts of higher valent ions like calcium, magnesium and
sulfate. While highly effective in removing organic contaminants, some non-polar, low molecular weight organics, such as
NDMA and 1,4-dioxane, can pass through RO membranes (Drewes et al, 2005). A major challenge for operation of desalting
membranes is the loss of water in the form of a concentrated brine stream, which often contains up to 20% of the original
water flow and rejected salt and organic chemicals at elevated concentrations. For coastal communities, the brine stream
is often discharged into the marine environment but inland communities may find brine disposal challenging. Desalting
membrane processes are relatively expensive to operate because of the high pressures needed and associated energy costs.

20        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Disinfection
Potable reuse schemes invariably include disinfection processes to inactivate microbial pathogens, including bacteria,
viruses, protozoa and helminths. Disinfection can also be applied within treatment trains to reduce biofouling primarily
by bacteria (e.g. of membranes) and within distribution systems to reduce biological growth and to provide protection of
water quality in the event of ingress of contamination (e.g. through mains breaks).

While biological processes (e.g. secondary treatment), natural systems (e.g. SAT) and physical barriers (e.g. MF, UF, NF and
RO) all provide removal of microorganisms, disinfection generally refers to agents used to inactivate microbial pathogens
(i.e. disinfectants). The most common disinfectants used in drinking-water and wastewater treatment are oxidizing
chemicals such as chlorine, chloramines, ozone and chlorine dioxide and UV light irradiation. These have different impacts
against the various groups of pathogens, for example UV light is very effective in low doses against Cryptosporidium and
Giardia but much higher doses are required to inactivate viruses (Hijnen et al, 2006; USEPA, 2006b). Similarly, chlorine
is effective against pathogenic bacteria and viruses, can inactivate Giardia at higher Ct values3 but has limited impact on
Cryptosporidium. As described in Chapter 5, performance targets are normally defined for a small number of reference
pathogens. This approach also applies to assessing effectiveness of disinfection where abundant, resilient organisms are
generally selected as indicator pathogens. For example, the effectiveness of UV light in disinfecting pathogenic viruses is
typically based on inactivation of adenovirus which is relatively resistant to UV light (USEPA, 2006b). It is then assumed
that by ensuring effective inactivation of adenoviruses that less resilient viruses will be inactivated at least at the same level.

While effective disinfection is fundamentally important for potable reuse, many processes can lead to the production of
undesirable and potentially hazardous DBPs. The type and concentrations of DBPs formed depend on a number of factors,
including source water composition, treatment processes and the method of disinfection (see Section 2.2) (Krasner et al,
2009). It is important to note that DBP formation and control occur not only at the potable reuse treatment plant but also
extend into the distribution system where blended water may further impact formation potential.

The control of DBP production can be achieved by minimizing the presence of DBP-precursors using treatment processes
that reduce total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations before disinfection and optimizing disinfection processes. Selection
of disinfection processes can also reduce DBP production (e.g. chloramination rather than chlorination for control of
microbial quality in distribution systems). In addition, some DBPs can be removed by subsequent treatment processes
within the treatment plant or by the environmental buffer, if used. While treatment trains should be designed to minimize
formation of DBPs, an important tenet for all drinking-water supplies, including potable reuse schemes, is that disinfection
takes priority and should not be compromised in attempting to meet DBP targets (WHO, 2017a).


2.5.3 Environmental buffers and engineered storages
A key element of IPR is an environmental buffer. The environmental buffer, either an aquifer or a surface water reservoir,
provides a number of potential benefits, including contaminant attenuation, dilution and blending, and time to detect
and respond to failures before final treatment and distribution. Environmental buffers also provide storage capacity to
hold water during periods when production exceeds demand. Public acceptance may also be improved by the use of an
environmental buffer which provides a sense of natural assimilation for the treated wastewater and a physical or temporal
separation between the production of treated wastewater and delivery of drinking-water.

Validation of contaminant removal by environmental buffers can be challenging and generally needs to be done on a case-
by-case basis (Section 2.6). Removal of microbial pathogens has been demonstrated as a function of retention times in
groundwater storages (Pang, 2009; NRC, 2012; Betancourt et al, 2014).

While environmental barriers can provide advantages, there are also potential challenges and disadvantages that need to
be addressed including:
     • In some locations establishing an environmental buffer can be challenging due to the lack of local surface water
       reservoirs or accessible aquifers. There may also be regulatory restrictions on discharging and storing treated
       wastewater in existing water resources.

     • Pumping water into and out of groundwater basins or pumping water long distances to surface water reservoirs can
       be expensive and energy intensive (ATSE, 2013).
     • Water quality in environmental buffers can influence suitability for use in potable reuse schemes. Adding treated
       wastewater to an environmental buffer may dilute residual contaminants such as microbial pathogens or trace organic
       chemicals remaining after treatment. Conversely the addition of highly treated wastewater may dilute contaminants
       present in the environmental buffer but this will reduce the quality of the treated wastewater. For example, surface
       water can contain natural organic matter, microbial pathogens, cyanobacterial toxins and pesticides while groundwater
       can contain naturally occurring hazards such as arsenic, fluoride, selenium and nitrates. Potential impacts of
       environmental buffers on water quality need to be assessed as part of developing WSPs for potable reuse schemes.
       Conventional drinking-water treatment (filtration and disinfection) is typically applied when surface water is used
       as an environmental buffer.

For DPR schemes the environmental buffer is eliminated and mechanisms to compensate for the associated loss of
contaminant attenuation, dilution and time benefits (for monitoring and responding to treatment failures) should
be considered. Contaminant attenuation can be readily replaced with traditional treatment barriers. Hence, the key
considerations are how to effectively replace monitoring and response time benefits attributed to environmental buffers.
One mechanism that can be applied is an ESB. An ESB is a storage basin or system that provides sufficient time, termed the
failure and response time, to interrogate and respond to any faults, including exceedances of critical limits in operational
monitoring of the treatment train. Storage times in ESBs are likely to be of the order of hours to days. The failure and
response time should take into account sampling intervals, time to complete analyses and time to respond. For example,
for online parameters such as turbidity or disinfectant residuals, sampling intervals are very short, analyses are completed
immediately and actions can be implemented within minutes. This can involve interrogating system performance by an
operator or making a decision to stop the supply of water. Monitoring intervals for other tests such as pressure decay
testing of membranes may be undertaken daily, extending the failure and response time. Due to practical constraints, it is
unlikely that ESBs will provide sufficient failure and response time for chemical contaminants that require more complex
analyses and generally have long analytical turnaround times. This is not considered a significant issue since responding to
exceedances of chemical guideline values is generally not time sensitive. Risks generally occur only after long-term exposure
to concentrations consistently exceeding guideline values.

Configurations for an ESB can include plug-flow pipelines, baffled tanks or tanks in parallel, operated in a fill, storage and
draw mode. The latter approach, using three or more tanks in alternating fill, storage and draw mode is the simplest. The
ESB concept can also be employed in both IPR and DPR treatment schemes, as part of a final treatment step to ensure
disinfectant Ct values are achieved or to provide buffering storages to maintain supply during short-term peak demands that
exceed normal production capacities. This type of use is relatively common in traditional drinking-water systems. Potable
reuse schemes at Beaufort West, South Africa, and Big Spring, USA, both include ESBs (ATSE, 2013).


2.5.4 Blending, storage and distribution
From a practical perspective, incorporating potable reuse into a water supply portfolio faces many of the same challenges
as selecting and blending any other new water source such as groundwater, surface water or desalinated seawater into an
existing system. Potable reuse water can conceivably be blended into the water supply at three main locations in a drinking-
water treatment/distribution system (Figure 2.3), including within the:
     • source water before the drinking-water treatment plant (1)
     • drinking-water treatment plant prior to distribution (2)
     • potable water distribution system (3).

Blending requires a high level of operational control, appropriately sized storage and mixing zones, and a firm understanding
of the potential impacts on process performance and distribution system stability/quality, to ensure any upstream process
upsets can be addressed in a timely manner and to maintain public confidence in the system. These issues are not unique
to potable reuse, and potential water quality and distribution system impacts from drinking-water source blending have
been studied extensively leading to the development of multiple tools and recommendations for managing blended water
quality (Install & Zeilig, 2007; Peet et al, 2001; Taylor et al, 2005; 2008; Duranceau et al, 2011).


22     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Water from potable reuse schemes must be evaluated for corrosion potential and DBP formation, similar to conventional water
treatment systems. High purity water can pose unique challenges, especially if the water has been purified with RO treatment
to produce very low ionic strength water. Reverse osmosis product water requires stabilization with added minerals to raise
alkalinity and pH to achieve a positive Langelier saturation index, or an appropriate calcium carbonate precipitation potential
or aggressive index to prevent erosion or corrosion of pipeline and reservoir materials. Stabilization can be accomplished
by mineral addition post treatment or by blending treated water with other sources of waters with naturally higher mineral
content or alkalinity. Without proper stabilization, treated wastewater produced by processes incorporating RO will be
aggressive to cement mortar lined pipeline materials or concrete tanks and corrosive to metal pipeline and tank materials and
components such as valves and backflow prevention devices, the distribution system and household plumbing (e.g. copper
and lead). If water from potable reuse schemes is not stabilized prior to storage and distribution, alternative materials will
need to be selected to reduce the potential for corrosion damage. For example, high-density polyethylene pipeline materials
and properly cured epoxy coatings in reservoirs can be used to withstand the more aggressive waters without corrosion,
erosion or leaching.

                                                           reuse)


Blended waters may contain different DBP precursors. Depending on the modes of disinfection this may result in
different combinations and concentrations of DBPs. For example, formation of NDMA could be an issue, particularly if
chloramination is used as a residual disinfectant in blended water (Krasner et al, 2009; Sgroi et al, 2016).

Bench-scale testing should be undertaken to assess the impact of blending on drinking-water quality on treatment processes
(where blending occurs upstream of final drinking-water treatment plants), corrosion control and DBP production
(Tchobanoglous et al, 2015).

Blending can also be an issue in environmental buffers. The chemistry of purified waters introduced into groundwater
aquifers must be managed with an awareness of any potential for mobilization of naturally occurring elements such as
arsenic. Addition of minerals such as magnesium and calcium can help mitigate the risk of arsenic mobilization. Control
of pH and redox potential may also be necessary to avoid mobilizing elements such as arsenic or hexavalent chromium
from the aquifer geology.

2.5.5 Reliability, redundancy, robustness and resilience
Reliability can be achieved through the concepts of redundancy, robustness and resiliency (Pecson et al, 2015). Reliability
is a widely used term, which points to the attribute of consistently meeting goals. For public utilities reliability is often
associated with consistency in providing service. For potable reuse systems, reliability is used to describe the ability of the
system to provide water that consistently meets the public health protection provided by existing drinking-water supplies.
Redundancy, robustness and resiliency describe the measures, which can be taken to ensure this kind of reliability.

Redundancy is about the use of measures beyond minimum requirements to ensure that treatment goals are more reliably
met or that performance can be more reliably demonstrated. A common kind of redundancy used in the water industry is
the provision of a standby pump or filter to ensure that water can more reliably be provided at a facility’s design capacity.
As important as this kind of reliability is, it is different from the reliability provided when additional treatment is included
above that required to meet removal targets. The traditional concept of providing multiple barriers of treatment generally
describes this kind of redundancy. The benefits of providing redundancy in treatment for pathogen inactivation or removal
for a process train seeking to meet a 5-log reduction goal are illustrated in Figure 2.4. Three process trains are compared,
which are designed to seek a median performance of 5-, 6- and 7-log reduction, each with the same precision. The probability
that their performance will fall below the 5-log reduction goal rapidly diminishes as additional redundancy in reduction is
designed into the process. Increasingly, credit for performance goals is not achieved unless there is confirmation through
operational monitoring that critical control measures are performing (see Section 2.6). As a consequence, there are
circumstances when redundancy in monitoring can also support greater reliability.

Note: Adding treatment to provide higher median log reductions increases the likelihood that the performance target (5-log reduction) will be achieved.



Robustness refers to the ability of the system to address a broad variety of contaminants and resist catastrophic failures. The
use of multiple barriers of treatment will generally make a train of processes more robust than a single process even when
both the multiple-barrier train and the single process are designed to meet the same treatment goal (with no redundancy).
The multiple-barrier train exhibits greater resistance to partial or catastrophic failure, including the unlikely occurrence of
simultaneous failure of independent barriers (Pecson et al, 2015).

The elements of a multiple-barrier treatment train can also provide another kind of robustness increasing the breadth of
contaminants that the train is able to successfully address. This concept is illustrated in Figure 2.5 for a process train with
secondary wastewater treatment, MF, RO and AOP (UV/H2O2). In this process train, a number of typical treatment barriers
to both pathogens and chemical contaminants are included with the degree of removal of selected organic and microbial
contaminants illustrated by the reduction in the width of the arrows. The AOP (UV/H2O2) is broken into two parts to
illustrate the unique role of UV. The lack of an arrow means that targets have been achieved.

Resilience is about ensuring reliability when redundancy and robustness are not enough. Provisions need to be made to
respond and adapt to incidents and events (see Chapter 4). One example is the combination of monitoring control measures
within treatment trains and use of ESBs. If operational criteria are not met, immediate remedial action can be implemented
or the water diverted to alternate uses. ESBs provide time to stop supply before the water is delivered to consumers.


2.6 Validation of control measures
Control measures used in potable reuse schemes need to be validated to demonstrate that individual processes will meet
performance targets and collectively, will consistently and reliably produce safe drinking-water and ensure that public
health is protected. Although this is no different from other sources of drinking-water, the broader range of chemical
contaminants and relatively high concentrations of microbial pathogens in untreated wastewater can increase the focus on
validating performance.

Validation is the process of obtaining evidence that selected control measures will be effective in achieving specified levels of
hazard reduction. It also defines the operational criteria required to ensure that the control measures continue to function
effectively (Bartram et al, 2009; 2017a). It is an intensive activity undertaken over a limited period of time and is an essential
input into selection of treatment processes by drinking-water suppliers and approval of WSPs by regulatory authorities.
Validation can take three basic forms:
     • evaluation of existing data and information such as published data and manufacturer conducted challenge studies;
     • evaluation of results from process specific certification schemes;
     • on-site testing of pilot-scale processes or full-scale systems.

For some treatment technologies such as UV light disinfection and membrane filtration, standards and protocols have
been established for validating performance (ÖNORM, 2001; 2003; USEPA, 2005; 2006b; DVGW, 2006; WaterVal, 2016a;
2016b; 2016c). Certification against these standards and protocols can be used providing it is relevant to the characteristics
of the water to be treated. For example, certification of UV light technology is typically only valid for specified ranges of
transmissivities.



                                                                                                      SYSTEM ASSESSMENT: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL MEASURES   25
On-site testing of full-scale systems is usually undertaken as part of pre-commissioning or commissioning of potable reuse
schemes. An important constraint of on-site testing is that demonstrated pathogen reductions are often limited by the range
of concentrations of microbial pathogens or surrogates present in feedwater. On-site testing needs to be performed under
the range of conditions that are expected to occur during the life of the potable reuse scheme. This includes variations in
water quality and flow. Validation only applies within the defined windows of water quality and flow. On-site testing should
consider the effectiveness of control measures in dealing with system specific contaminants of concern. Validation does
not apply when design capacity of processes is exceeded. Pilot testing can also be used but only when there is certainty that
results are directly applicable and are scalable to full size plants and schemes.

The first component of validation is demonstrating the removal of microbial hazards by control measures which is usually
performed using challenge tests (USEPA, 2005; Department of Health, State of Victoria, 2013). The most direct approach is
to measure log10 reduction values4 (LRVs) of reference pathogens achieved by treatment processes (e.g. Cryptosporidium for
protozoa). Alternatively, surrogate organisms (e.g. E. coli for bacteria, coliphages for viruses and Clostridium perfringens or
Bacillus subtilis spores for protozoa) can also be used provided a correlation or conservative relationship with the reference
pathogens is established for the process being validated (USEPA, 2005; Department of Health, State of Victoria, 2013). Table
2.4 provides a summary of validated LRVs demonstrated by challenge testing (LRVC-test) for a range of indicative treatment
processes commonly used in potable reuse schemes.

The second component of validation is identifying operational criteria that can be used to demonstrate ongoing performance
of control measures. Operational monitoring parameters are required to ensure that any deviation from required performance
is detected in a timely fashion (see Section 3.1). In the case of disinfection processes this is relatively straightforward;
pathogen LRVs are based on transmitted UV doses or disinfectant Ct values which can be operationally monitored
online (USEPA, 2003; Hijnen et al, 2006; Keegan et al, 2012; USEPA, 2006b). However, for processes that provide physical
removal of pathogens (e.g. MBR, low pressure membrane filtration and RO) the relationship between removal capability
and operational monitoring parameters is not as direct. Testing of operational parameters used to monitor these processes
typically lacks the sensitivity of tests for pathogen removal (USEPA, 2005; Department of Health, State of Victoria, 2013).
For example, membrane filtration processes can be shown to achieve pathogen LRVs of 6 or more in challenge testing but
turbidity removal is limited to a sensitivity of 1.5–2.0 logs (USEPA, 2005; Department of Health, State of Victoria, 2013;
TWDB, 2015). Direct integrity testing of membrane filters can be used to demonstrate an LRV sensitivity of 4 logs (USEPA,
2005; TWDB, 2015). Operational monitoring sensitivity is typically included in established validation protocols (USEPA,
2005; WaterVal, 2016a; 2016b; 2016c). In these protocols the validated LRVs attributed to a technology are the lower of those
demonstrated by challenge testing and those from challenge testing after consideration of operational monitoring sensitivity.

Table 2.4 provides a summary of validated pathogen LRVs for indicative treatment processes, taking into account the
sensitivity of operational monitoring in addition to the results from laboratory or field-based challenge testing (LRVOMS).
Generally, the LRVOMS should be adopted in designing potable reuse schemes. This is consistent with the reliance in WSPs on
the use of operational monitoring to demonstrate ongoing performance of control measures. However, proponents of potable
reuse schemes, in consultation with regulators and other stakeholders, can choose whether validated LRVs based on results
from challenge testing are used with or without considering the sensitivity of operational monitoring (i.e. LRVC-test or LRVOMS).

In the case of chemical hazards, removal can be linked to operational monitoring of selected surrogates and indicators
(Drewes et al, 2008; Dickenson et al, 2009) (see Section 3.3). For example, TOC can be used as an operational parameter
to monitor general removal of chemical hazards by RO. Discrete chemical species that may or may not be of direct public
health relevance can also be used as operational indicators of treatment performance (Dickenson et al, 2009). For instance,
the artificial sweetener sucralose can be applied as an indicator of treatment process efficacy since it is relatively resilient
to oxidation and biological processes, yet is well removed by RO (Anderson et al, 2010; Mawhinney et al, 2011; Drewes et
al, 2013; Rice et al, 2013).

     KEY MESSAGES
     1 Operational monitoring of potable reuse schemes should incorporate continuous monitoring linked to supervisory
        control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems with automatic alarms for deviation from critical limits.
     2 Parameters for monitoring operational performance of processes used to achieve pathogen control include physical
       tests (e.g. turbidity for filtration), chemical tests (e.g. TOC, sulfate or fluorescent dyes for RO) and disinfectant residuals
       and contact times.
     3 Limited sets of indicator chemicals can be used to monitor operation of control measures used for chemical contaminants.
     4 Verification will follow the same approach used for other drinking-water supplies.
     5 Bioassays may become useful tools in the future for assessing chemical quality of drinking-water but further work is required to
       understand the public health significance of results. Potential use as part of treatment performance assessment is promising.




3.1 Operational monitoring of control measures
Operational monitoring is at the centre of WSPs and is the planned set of measurements and activities to determine that
control measures are operating effectively (i.e. is it working now?). A comprehensive monitoring and control system is
necessary to measure and track the performance of treatment processes to ensure that operational targets are being met.
Monitoring needs to be undertaken at a frequency that will enable rapid and timely responses if significant deviations occur
that could affect water quality. Operational monitoring is particularly important in potable reuse systems because of the need
to deal with the potential for substantial source water variabilities and the relatively high levels of microbial and chemical
hazards. Operational monitoring should be implemented for all control measures, starting in the wastewater collection
system and ending at delivery of drinking-water to consumers. For example, online VOC sensors are used in Singapore
(see Case Study 4) to provide early warnings of unauthorized industrial discharges that could threaten the production of
safe drinking-water by the NEWater schemes. Other parameters measured in wastewater collection systems could include
pH as a signal for changes in discharges and conductivity (electrical conductivity or TDS) as a measure of saline intrusion.
Operational monitoring should include regular inspections of controls and treatment applied to discharges from industrial
premises and medical facilities.




28        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
In comparison to conventional surface or groundwater supplies, the flow and composition of treated wastewater from urban
treatment plants can change greatly across the course of a single day and often varies substantially during weekends, holidays
or during special events. Monitoring programmes need to measure source water variability to maintain performance of
potable reuse treatment trains. Parameters such as ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, TOC, VOCs and turbidity/suspended solids
can be used to measure variations in wastewater quality. Ammonia, TOC and turbidity can be measured online while the
other parameters can be measured rapidly and frequently using grab samples. Volatile organic compounds can also be
measured online but are generally measured less frequently using grab samples.

Tiered operational monitoring programmes that emphasize those methods that produce data quickly are critical so
that process anomalies can be detected before finished water is adversely affected. It is strongly recommended that the
performance of treatment processes should be monitored using online meters with real-time data reporting wherever
possible. Where online monitoring is performed, results should be regularly calibrated using grab samples and bench
top analyses. When online monitoring is not practical, frequent grab samples, using rapid analytical procedures, can be
alternatives.


3.1.1 Operational monitoring parameters
Having monitoring data available to prevent and correct deterioration of the performance of each unit barrier in a treatment
train is the key to assuring consistent production of safe drinking-water. Monitoring of unit processes at control points within
a treatment train requires identification of appropriate parameters and target criteria to define operational performance
acceptability. Target criteria can take the form of operational limits and critical limits. Critical limits for treatment processes
used in potable reuse separate acceptable from unacceptable performance and loss of confidence in water safety. Depending
on the nature of the control measure, critical limits can be upper limits (e.g. filtered water turbidity), lower limits (e.g.
disinfectant Ct values) or ranges of values (e.g. pH). Operational limits are typically used as early warning signals that
performance of control measures is deteriorating, and enable implementation of corrective action before critical limits
are breached. Frequent operational monitoring to confirm that individual treatment barriers are operating within design
criteria provides assurance that drinking-water quality targets are being achieved.

Consistent with the operation of conventional public water systems, both acute and chronic risks must be managed. The
presence of microbial pathogens is by far the greatest concern with respect to potential acute impacts on human health
in public water supplies. Changes in operational monitoring parameters that imply a lesser level of microbial removal or
inactivation will require immediate corrective responses such as reducing water flow rates or boosting disinfectant doses.
Chronic risks, usually from potential chemical concentrations, must also be managed. While deviations in operational
parameters for chemical contaminants should be corrected as rapidly as feasible, risks are usually associated with long-term
exposures and usually would not require implementation of emergency measures.

Operational monitoring of pathogen control measures
In potable reuse, pathogen control is achieved by a combination of physical removal and inactivation processes. The most
widely used operational monitoring parameters are disinfectant residuals and physical removal parameters such as turbidity,
monitored online. Table 3.1 provides a summary of operational monitoring parameters and testing frequencies for a range
of indicative treatment processes commonly used in potable reuse schemes for pathogen removal. Microbial parameters,
such as E. coli, coliphages, Clostridium perfringens, aerobic spores and enterococcus, are currently not suitable operational
parameters largely because of the time required for analysis. This may change in the future as progress is being made on the
development of rapid tests for microbial indicators, such as coliphages, which could be particularly useful for monitoring
physical removal of viruses. Similarly, next generation sequencing may provide a basis for future monitoring.

Physical and chemical tests: Integrity of low-pressure membranes (MF and UF) can be assessed by online turbidity
measurements and periodic (daily) pressure decay tests (USEPA, 2005). Turbidity measurements can be made online and
rapidly by grab sampling. Integrity of high pressure membranes (such as RO or NF) can be monitored by online measurement
of electrical conductivity (representing TDS rejection) and TOC.

30       POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Disinfectant residuals: Disinfection processes should be designed to achieve specified disinfectant concentrations for set
periods of time (Ct in mg.min/L where C = concentration of the disinfectant in mg/L and t = time in minutes) to provide
designated log reductions of pathogens. Online and grab samples for disinfectant residuals provide almost instantaneous
performance information regarding in situ disinfectant concentration. The monitoring output allows for rapid adjustment
of disinfection doses, when needed. Other parameters such as pH and turbidity are also important components that should
be regularly monitored for ensuring effective disinfection. Ultraviolet lamp performance can be monitored by percentage
transmission and UV intensity.

Operational monitoring of chemical control measures
Prevention of source water contamination is a key component of assuring safety (USEPA, 2011; WSAA, 2012; Mosher et al,
2016). Discharges from industries and medical facilities should be regulated and subject to controls, ongoing inspections
and audits. This should be supported by monitoring of wastewater quality at key points in collection systems using online
monitoring of parameters such as pH, conductivity and VOCs.

For chemical contaminants, attenuation generally occurs through biological transformation, adsorption, physical removal
or chemical oxidation. Thus, appropriate surrogate parameters are needed for each general type of process. Source waters for
potable reuse can potentially contain a wide range of chemical contaminants and a nearly infinite number of transformation
products (Section 2.2) but risks associated with exposures to trace chemicals are usually of longer term and even lifetime
exposure concern. Frequent monitoring for every potential chemical substance is not practical, plausible or necessary.
A sound selection framework is needed that can provide a list of meaningful indicator measurements that can represent
key groups of contaminants, taking into account human health significance and assurance of proper performance of
water treatment processes (Drewes et al, 2008; 2013). The surrogate and indicator approach allows for relatively rapid and
comprehensive monitoring without frequent measurement of large numbers of chemicals (Drewes et al, 2008; 2013; Crook
et al, 2013; TWDB, 2015). Surrogate parameters suitable to measure performance of unit processes are bulk parameters that
often can be monitored using online monitoring or high-frequency grab samples and can be used for real-time decision-
making for process control. Examples include total TOC, VOC and conductivity (Table 3.2).

Chemical indicators will most often be measured using laboratory-based testing that may require several days to complete.
Fairly frequent measurements should be made of the selected indicator chemicals. More comprehensive but less frequent
monitoring of chemicals will typically be included in verification monitoring (Section 3.2). Chemical indicators are specific
substances that are likely to be detectable in raw water and are representative of larger classes of chemicals. Ideally, indicators
that are normally relatively well attenuated and relatively persistent are selected to provide a meaningful assessment of
performance (Drewes et al, 2008). For example, boron is normally present in reasonable concentrations in wastewater and
is partly removed by RO. Monitoring for boron can provide an assessment of RO performance in removing low molecular
weight chemicals (Drewes et al, 2008).

Examples of chemical indicators that could be selectively applied for periodic performance monitoring of two potable reuse
treatment trains is provided in Table 3.3. It should be noted that the concentrations in wastewater, even after secondary
treatment, are well below estimated health criteria values. Table 3.3 includes the chlorinated sweetener sucralose which is
one of the most widely applied indicator species in the USA (Mawhinney et al, 2011; Rice et al, 2013). However, the use of
sucralose is not as prevalent in all countries and it may not be a suitable indicator in large portions of the world. Caffeine has
also been suggested as a candidate indicator, but it is biodegradable and therefore less reliable as a performance indicator.

A practical example of the use of a limited set of chemical parameters is provided in the case study for the Perth, Australia
potable reuse scheme (see Box 3.1 and Table CS5.3). In this case, a suite of 15 chemicals representing DBPs, inorganic and
organic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, hormones, pesticides and phenols are used to assess treatment performance. These
parameters are monitored at a higher frequency than those included in verification monitoring.

For regulated chemicals, standardized methods are generally available and should be followed. However, for indicator
chemicals this is not always the case and method reporting limits can vary by orders of magnitude among laboratories
(Vanderford et al, 2012; Drewes et al, 2013). Many chemical indicator species will occur in ng per L concentrations in
treated wastewater and often are non-detectable in finished waters. In addition, usage may vary substantially depending
upon geographical region (e.g. sucralose) and industrial input into the sewer system. Indicators should be selected that are
relevant to local conditions and that preferably have standardized methods with suitable detection limits (Vanderford et
al, 2014). It is also extremely important to use a high degree of quality control for indicator monitoring, since many of the
selected substances are ubiquitous in the environment. For example, substances like caffeine and some flame retardants
are common and laboratory contamination of samples and blanks can be an issue when attempting to measure ng per L
concentrations. Thus a strong quality assurance programme with replicate samples, laboratory and field blanks, and matrix
spikes is crucial for trace indicator analyses.

3.1.2 Long-term assessment of operational monitoring
Operational monitoring is used for timely and typically short-term assessment of the performance of control measures. It
is also important to regularly examine accumulated operational monitoring results to check for trends that might indicate
changes in performance. Trends may be manifested in increasing frequencies of non-compliance with critical and operational
limits but can also be manifested in the absence of non-compliances. The basis for any deterioration in performance over
time should be investigated and corrected.


3.2 Verification
Verification provides a final check on the suitability of produced drinking-water quality for the health protection of
consumers. Verification provides an assessment of the effectiveness of WSPs in achieving compliance with health-based
targets. Verification of water quality will typically include testing for faecal indicator organisms and hazardous chemicals with
regulatory limits. Verification should include testing of water produced by each treatment plant, where potable reuse systems
can include separate wastewater and drinking-water treatments plants, and of drinking-water as supplied to consumers.
As discussed in the previous section, quality assurance and quality control programmes are essential, including the use of
standardized methods and certified/accredited laboratories wherever possible. This is vital to ensure confidence in results
and to enable proper interpretation of results.

Sampling frequency should consider potential variability in results, outcomes, and costs and benefits (WHO, 2017a).
All testing needs to have a defined purpose with responses established to deal with all types of results. Since microbial
contaminants pose the greatest risk to public health from acute exposure, monitoring is generally more frequent. Conversely,
since chemical risks are usually associated with chronic exposure with limited exceptions (e.g. copper and nitrate) monitoring
will typically be conducted less frequently.




                                                                                                                             MONITORING         33
3.2.1 Microbiological water quality
Monitoring for microbial pathogens in drinking-water is impractical and of little value (Section 5.1). The traditional
approach to verifying microbial quality of drinking-water is the use of faecal indicators such as E. coli or, alternatively,
thermotolerant coliforms. Drinking-water should contain no E. coli per 100 ml (WHO, 2017a). In conjunction with evidence
from operational monitoring that microbial performance targets are being met on an ongoing basis (Section 3.1), the absence
of E. coli which is present in high numbers in wastewater, provides assurance of microbial safety.

In addition to testing for E. coli, measurement of disinfectant residuals within distribution systems is a useful, rapid and low
cost method that can be used to provide an indicator of microbiological quality, particularly for bacteria and viruses. These
measurements serve a different purpose than operational monitoring of disinfectant residuals at the outlets of treatment
plants to ensure that required Ct values or doses (for UV light) have been achieved.

A limitation of E. coli is that it is not a particularly good indicator of enteric viruses and protozoa which are more resistant
to environmental pressures. Use of other indicators, including coliphages (for viruses), Clostridium spp. (for protozoa)
and enterococci, have been suggested and could be considered for inclusion in verification monitoring but they also have
limitations. Coliphages share some properties with enteric viruses and can be present in high numbers in wastewater (Table
2.2) but there is no direct correlation between numbers of coliphages and enteric viruses in drinking-water (WHO, 2017a).
Clostridium spores are far more resistant to environmental pressures and disinfection than protozoa and as a result are
conservative indicator organisms that can be present long after contamination events. Detection of Clostridium spores in
drinking-water needs to be treated with caution (WHO, 2017a).

Guidance on locations and frequency of monitoring is provided in the GDWQ.


3.2.2 Chemical water quality
Monitoring programmes for chemical quality need to consider a number of factors, including:
   • source water quality and variability (Thompson et al, 2007). In the case of IPR schemes, this should include
     consideration of the environmental buffer;
   • inputs that can influence source water quality (e.g. industrial discharges);
   • the type of treatment processes and treatment chemicals used. For example, the range of DBPs included in testing
     will depend on the type of disinfection;
   • availability of certified analytical facilities; and
   • regulatory requirements.

Beyond chemicals with regulatory limits or guideline values, potable reuse system operators may seek to better characterize
the potential occurrence of industrial chemicals, emerging contaminants and yet unknown chemical constituents (Snyder,
2014). There are ever increasing numbers of chemicals that have been identified in wastewaters at diminishingly minute
levels. Care should be taken to only include chemicals that are of potential concern based on chemical hazard identification
for the potable reuse system (Thompson, et al 2007) (see Chapter 2).

Monitoring locations and frequency of testing will depend on the source of the chemical, variability in concentrations and the
likelihood of changes occurring within distribution systems. Most chemicals can be tested in water entering distribution systems.
For substances that may change within the distribution system, for instance DBPs and metals released by corrosion, monitoring
may be required in both the finished water and multiple points within the distribution system. Substances that do not vary
in concentration substantially over time require less frequent monitoring than those that might, such as industrial chemicals.

Testing for “emerging contaminants” may increase confidence by operators and consumers in the safety of drinking-water
supplies. This is more likely to be required during initial start-up and commissioning periods. If such testing is to be
undertaken, it is important that mechanisms are established to interpret and if necessary to respond to results. Setting of
screening values is discussed in Section 5.2.2. Alternatives for testing for individual emerging contaminants include non-
targeted analyses to detect the potential presence of individual contaminants and biological assays to detect the activity and
removal of complex mixtures (see Boxes 3.2 and 3.3).


34     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
3.3 Monitoring during start-up of new treatment facilities
Starting the operation of a complex water treatment plant involves a number of activities, including individual and combined
process testing, commissioning and acceptance, and initial operator training. Water quality monitoring and the development
of baseline performance data are also integral activities in demonstrating the operational performance of any new facility
(Tchobanoglous et al, 2015). This should include operational monitoring of treatment processes and verification testing for
chemical parameters and faecal indicator bacteria. For potable reuse, it would be prudent to increase monitoring frequencies
during start-up and commissioning to provide confidence in the effectiveness of individual processes and the treatment
train as a whole. Disinfection by-product formation potential should also be determined.

Once a plant has been commissioned, it is common for it to then enter a proving period in which the plant is operated
continuously to demonstrate functionality. A period of 30 days is often used although longer periods can be applied. Water
quality monitoring data obtained during this period should be designed to document and verify that all components of
the treatment train meet specifications and are protective of public health. The data will also serve as a baseline of system
performance for future comparisons and analysis.



  Box 3.2 Non-targeted chemical analyses
  One mechanism to comprehensively evaluate the occurrence and attenuation of chemicals in potable reuse systems is to conduct non-targeted analysis
  to better elucidate tentatively identified compounds. These compounds are not necessarily candidates for future GDWQ development or regulations. Their
  immediate value is as site-specific indicators of source water content and treatment technology performance. Today, the most common tool for non-targeted
  analysis is mass spectrometry, which can tentatively identify chemicals compared with a library of compounds with established characteristics (mass to
  charge ratios). The method includes extraction and concentration of chemicals from water samples; separation processes using either gas chromatography
  for volatile chemicals or liquid chromatography for lower volatility species; and ionization. These types of analytical instruments are relatively expensive and
  technically complicated to operate. In addition, they cannot detect all potential substances. However, non-targeted analyses can provide a higher degree
  of specificity in identifying individual chemicals that are capable of breaching a particular treatment barrier.




  Box 3.3 Potential use of bioanalytical tools
  Assessing the presence and possible risks associated with drinking-water can be a challenge because of the usually low concentrations of individual
  chemicals and complex mixtures that may occur. Bioanalytical tools offer a path toward more comprehensive chemical evaluations of water – by detecting
  chemicals not by their structure but by their biological activity. This provides an improved capacity to detect categories of non-target compounds at low
  concentrations and some measure of mixture interactions at low doses.
  Bioanalytical tools are molecular or cell-based in vitro bioassays adapted to testing of water and/or concentrated water extracts (e.g. solid phase extracts).
  They have grown in complexity from bioassays for mutagenicity (Ames test) and genotoxicity (umuC bioassay) to encompass an ever growing range of
  biological end-points (NRC, 1998; Leusch & Snyder, 2015).
  It is difficult to simplify the vast diversity of available bioassays, which incorporate various and often overlapping modes of action, and at the same time
  remain scientifically accurate. One compromise suggested by Escher and Leusch (2012) is to sort bioassays into five broad categories based on a simplified
  cellular toxicity pathway: one group is a measure of metabolic response, three are based on the type of interaction with the target molecule (non-specific,
  specific and reactive toxicity), and the fifth is a measure of cellular defence mechanisms (adaptive stress response).
  There is still significant uncertainty regarding the potential role of bioanalytical tools in a regulatory context. In vitro bioassays measure the initial interaction
  of the xenobiotic at the molecular or cellular site, and generally do not take into account toxicokinetic modulators of toxicity (absorption, distribution,
  metabolism and excretion). In addition, defence and repair mechanisms can compensate for toxic injury in whole organisms. Therefore, it is difficult to
  relate in vitro responses to adverse human health effects.
  The Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008) recognize the limitation of current chemical methods to deal with complex
  mixtures and indicate that in vitro bioassay screening could be used as a screening and prioritization tool for subsequent chemical analysis.
  A recent study applied 103 bioassays for approximately 30 end-points to various water samples, including treated wastewater. The study reported a significant
  response with treated wastewater in most end-points, but a gradual loss of activity in most assays during advanced treatment, with only a few assays
  detecting activity in the treated wastewater (Escher et al, 2014). This finding agrees with other studies that have monitored these end-points in recycled water
  (Leusch & Snyder, 2015). The potential use of a small group of bioassays as part of treatment process evaluation and selection is a particularly promising area.
  Further work is continuing on bioanalytical tools and if successful, it should provide greater public confidence in the capability of potable reuse schemes
  to produce safe drinking-water. Developments in bioanalytical science should be monitored to identify useful candidate assays as they are validated.

     KEY MESSAGES
     1 While the aim is to maintain compliance with water quality requirements at all times, considered and controlled
        responses to non-compliance are essential for protecting public health and maintaining public confidence.
     2 Incident protocols should be developed in consultation with regulatory agencies and identify responsibilities and
       authorities of stakeholders, incident criteria, reporting requirements, internal and external communication protocols
       and emergency contact lists.
     3 Mechanisms for issuing public advisories (boil water or avoidance advisories) should be developed before they are needed.
     4 WSPs and protocols should be reviewed following significant incidents.




Management plans describing actions to be taken in response to incidents and emergencies are an important component
of WSPs for all drinking-water supplies (WHO, 2017a). While the aim should always be to operate drinking-water schemes
to continuously produce safe drinking-water, incidents will occur and response protocols need to be prepared to deal with
them. Considered and controlled responses to incidents that may compromise water safety are essential for protecting
public health and maintaining consumer confidence. In many cases the key to maintaining safety will be implementation
of rapid and effective responses. Responses to incidents need to be planned, coordinated and executed in an orderly and
timely fashion. In the event of significant incidents or emergencies, maintaining consumer trust is essential. This will be
influenced by how incidents and emergencies are handled and communicated. All agencies involved in responses need to
be fully informed, aware of their responsibilities and act in a coordinated manner.




36        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
4.1 Organizational understanding
Potable reuse schemes are complex systems that need to be managed and operated by well trained and skilled staff. Managers
and operators need to understand what is expected as part of normal operation and the systems that are in place to detect
deviations from normal operations such as SCADA and automatic alarm systems. Managers and operators should contribute
to development of incident response and communication criteria and understand the significance of non-compliance.

SCADA systems and automatic alarms must be monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to enable implementation of
rapid responses. Operators should be trained to always respond to alarms and to never change settings or turn off alarms
without receiving direction from an appropriate supervisor/manager. Alarm systems should be programmed to stop supply
if critical limits are not met. Supply should only be resumed when normal operation can be assured.

Incident and emergency response protocols should be regularly tested to ensure that they are effective and understood. This
can involve running mock scenarios.


4.2 Structure of incident protocols
Incident and emergency response protocols should be developed and documented prior to potable reuse schemes being
commissioned. Protocols need to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Two types of protocols should be developed:
external protocols supporting coordinated interagency responses to significant public health incidents; and internal protocols
within drinking-water suppliers to deal with lesser incidents that if dealt with appropriately will prevent incidents developing
to a level requiring public notification. Significant incidents should be notified verbally (i.e. telephone). Notification by
electronic means, while often effective, cannot be guaranteed to always be read promptly by intended recipients.

External protocols should be developed in consultation with regulatory agencies.

Incident protocols for potable reuse schemes should be based on the same principles as protocols for any other type of
drinking-water system (WHO, 2017a). Points of variation could include consideration of specific characteristics of wastewater
and wastewater collection systems, trade waste controls, types of treatment processes, possible use of environmental buffers
or engineered storages and blending. Key issues to be considered when designing protocols are shown in Box 4.1.



  Box 4.1 Indicative content of incident protocols
  1. Incident criteria such as:
      • non-conformance with health-based targets;
      • non-conformance with critical limits (e.g. exceedance of filtered water turbidity, failure to meet UV intensity required for advanced oxidation, failure
        to meet disinfectant Ct values);
      • accidents/spills that increase levels of contaminants (e.g. discharge of industrial waste into sewerage systems);
      • treatment failure;
      • prolonged power outage; and
      • extreme weather (e.g. floods, cyclones) and natural disasters (e.g. fires, earthquakes).
  2. Requirements to report unforeseen and undefined incidents that could represent significant risks.
  3. Reporting requirements including timelines and methods (e.g. significant incidents notified verbally within one hour).
  4. Responsibilities of all stakeholders.
  5. Communication protocols and strategies including notification procedures (internal, regulatory authorities, key agencies, senior management, consumers
     and media).
  6. Communication protocols between wastewater and drinking-water treatment plant operators, particularly when managed by separate entities.
  7. Emergency contact lists.




                                                                                                  MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION: INCIDENT PROTOCOLS                 37
Incident criteria should include considerations of magnitude and duration. For example, short-term spikes (e.g. under
15 minutes) in filtered water turbidity, while not ideal, do not necessarily represent a treatment failure; similarly, loss of
disinfection for a short period of time may not lead to unsafe water being released if there is a large treated water storage
between the disinfection plant and consumers. Time limits should be based on knowledge of the water system.

Clusters of customer complaints should be considered as an incident. Complaints such as off-tastes and odours, unusual
colour, increased turbidity, reduced water pressure and illness, could signal contamination events and should be investigated.
It may be useful to establish different categories of incidents, including:
     • Minor incidents that can represent small risks to health but represent early warning signals (e.g. temporary non-
       compliance with critical limits, minor exceedance of health-based targets).
     • Major incidents that if not managed can potentially represent a significant risk to public health.
     • Priority incidents and emergencies that if not managed represent a high likelihood of a significant risk to public
       health.

As a general rule, major or significant incidents are more likely to be associated with failures that threaten microbial safety.
Exposure to microbial pathogens can produce acute impacts and these incidents will typically require rapid responses.
Short-term exceedances of chemical quality will generally be minor in nature and require responses such as additional
sampling to confirm exceedances and investigate causes. Most chemicals only cause public health impacts following long-
term exposure to elevated concentrations. Guidance on how to respond to exceedance of parameter limits can be found in
Section 8.7 of the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a).

While it is important that incident protocols are comprehensive and define all incidents that may have public health impacts,
it is also important that protocols should not be excessively detailed. Incident protocols should not be used simply to
reinforce good management practices; this is the role of normal documented WSP procedures and training of personnel.
The inclusion of too many incidents, particularly too many incidents that do not warrant immediate responses, can lead to
incident fatigue and the danger that significant incidents will be overlooked and not receive appropriate attention.

Given the complexity of potable reuse schemes, one approach could be to divide the protocol into sections dealing with
separate components of the drinking-water supply (wastewater system, environmental buffers, treatment processes, blending
water, distribution systems, etc.). In this case, it is essential that communication is maintained between personnel responsible
for each component irrespective of whether these personnel are employed within a single agency or multiple entities.

Internal drinking-water supplier or wastewater management protocols should be accompanied by supporting documents
describing pre-planned remedial actions, strategies for increased monitoring, sources of alternative and emergency supplies,
lists of critical customers (e.g. hospitals, health-care facilities, food manufacturers, etc.) and procedures for discharge of
contaminated water.


4.3 Major incidents and emergencies
Protocols should include mechanisms for issuing boil water or water avoidance advisories when emergencies lead to
drinking-water being potentially unsafe. These advisories represent responses of last resort and should only be issued when
an unacceptable and ongoing risk to public health is identified. They should only be issued after consultation with the
relevant public health agency. Boil water advisories are issued when substantial contamination by microbial pathogens is
known or suspected. Water avoidance advisories may be required in response to substantial chemical contamination. In the
absence of spills, avoidance advisories are unlikely to be required. Further information on boil water and water avoidance
advisories is provided in Chapters 7 and 8 of the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a).




38     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
4.4 Communication
Effective communication is essential in managing incidents, ensuring coordinated responses and maintaining consumer
confidence and trust. There are three immediate questions that need to be considered in responding to incidents and where
necessary, in communicating outcomes to consumers:
     • What happened? Clear transparent explanations are required.
     • When did it happen? Unreasonable delays between occurrence and reporting of incidents will lead to extended
       exposure of consumers to potentially unsafe water. In addition, delays will indicate a lack of decisive action and erode
       public confidence.
     • What is being done to fix the problem?

A public and media communication strategy should be established before incidents occur. This should include communication,
where necessary, to the general public and critical customers (hospitals, health-care facilities, food manufacturers, etc.). Draft
communications that are understandable to all consumers, taking into account cultural, educational and language diversity,
should be prepared for predictable incidents. Delivery mechanisms, allowing for access and use by consumers, should also
be identified. While social platforms are increasing in popularity not everyone uses them, similarly not everyone uses the
internet on a regular basis, and television and radio reception may be limited in some areas.

Interagency protocols should identify communication responsibilities of each agency. This should include which agency
makes the decision about public notification of incidents and leads communication. In many cases there may be joint
responsibilities, for example, the health agency will take the lead on public health matters while the drinking-water supplier
will take the lead on operational responses, including repairs and delivery of alternative sources of water, particularly to
critical customers. These responsibilities need to be clearly described and understood. It is essential that communications,
particularly those released publicly, are consistent and reflect agreed positions. Inconsistent messages will cause confusion
and undermine public confidence.

An authoritative and trained spokesperson should be designated to lead communications in the event of an incident or
emergency. All employees should be kept informed as they can provide broad informal sources of information. In the case of
significant incidents dedicated telephone numbers, email addresses and websites may be needed to provide central sources
of information. Contact personnel should be briefed on dealing with inquiries.


4.5 Routine and post-incident reviews
Incident protocols should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they are operating as intended (e.g. annually).
Incident reports should be assessed to determine whether certain types of incident are recurring and provide evidence of
poor reliability. If such evidence is detected the WSP should be reviewed. The content of protocols should also be reviewed
to ensure that they remain current and take into account changes to WSPs and SSPs, including changes to treatment
processes, operational monitoring, critical limits, verification and water quality standards. Reviews should include updates
of contact personnel.

One of the aims of WSPs is to ensure safety of drinking-water supplies and to minimize occurrence and impacts of hazardous
events and incidents. WSPs and protocols should be reviewed and amended if necessary following significant incidents,
particularly those involving public notification. The review should include an investigation of the incident and the response.

     KEY MESSAGES
     1 Water quality targets (chemical guideline values) and microbial performance targets (log reductions of pathogens in
         sources waters) are the primary health-based targets for potable reuse. These targets will be underpinned by health
         outcome targets set by public health authorities or drinking-water regulators (e.g. 10-6 disability-adjusted life years
         (DALYs) per person per year (pppy).
     2   Microbial performance targets can be identified by using system specific pathogen data in source waters or by using default pathogen
         concentrations.
     3   Default performance targets identified in this guidance are 8.5-log reduction of enteric bacteria, 9.5-log reduction of enteric viruses
         and 8.5-log reduction of enteric protozoa. They do not represent guideline values and are not intended to encourage pathogen
         monitoring in drinking-water, which would be impractical and of little value for routine monitoring. These values have implications
         in identifying combinations of treatment processes and operational monitoring requirements, to ensure that the LRVs are being
         achieved.
     4   While there tends to be considerable interest in CECs, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, the concentrations in
         drinking-water are generally low and generally do not warrant setting of new guideline values in the GDWQ or national or regional
         standards.
     5   In specific circumstances, where a chemical with no guideline value is identified as a concern, approaches for developing screening
         values are identified to support investigations into potential risks and the need for implementation of additional control measures.



Health-based targets are risk-based measurable objectives used in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) to define the safety of drinking-
water. They apply irrespective of the source of drinking-water and apply equally well to potable reuse. Health-based targets
provide the basis for assessing risk associated from microbial, chemical and radiological hazards potentially present in
wastewater and incorporate four basic forms (see Box 5.1):
    • water quality targets
    • performance targets
    • specified technology targets
    • health outcome targets.




40         POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Health-based targets, with the possible exception of system specific performance targets, should be set by national or regional
health authorities in consultation with stakeholders, including drinking-water suppliers, and should consider economic,
social and technical feasibility. The most common form of targets used to define the safety of potable reuse schemes are
performance targets (microbial) and water quality targets (chemical guideline values). As with all forms of drinking-water
supply, microbial contamination represents the most likely and important risk to public health. Performance targets
for potable reuse will typically be much higher than those for other sources of drinking-water due to the relatively high
concentrations of pathogens in wastewater. Meeting identified performance targets is of paramount importance.



  Box 5.1 Health-based targets and disability-adjusted life years
  Water quality targets typically take the form of chemical guideline values and are used as a basis for setting national or regional drinking-water
  regulations and standards.
  Performance targets are typically applied to microbial hazards and represent the minimum reductions in source water pathogen concentrations
  (measured as log removals) required to meet a health outcome target (see below). Performance targets are usually calculated by water suppliers using
  methods provided by the health authority or drinking-water regulator. Alternatively, they can be set by the health authority or drinking-water regulator
  based on default source water pathogen concentrations.1
  Specified technology targets represent recommended combinations of treatment processes that can achieve safety based on assessments of source water
  quality. Specified technology targets are typically established for lower resource systems and therefore are not usually applicable to potable reuse schemes.
  Derivations of these targets are underpinned by health outcome targets determined by health authorities or drinking-water regulators. Health outcome
  targets define safety in terms of burdens of disease, such as frequencies of diarrhoeal disease or projected increased cancer risks. Health outcome targets
  in the GDWQ include an upper reference level of risk of 10-6 DALYs pppy for microbial pathogens, no or lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL or
  LOAEL), benchmark dose (BMD) or the lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose (BMDL) for threshold chemicals (e.g. fluoride and copper), and an
  upper limit cancer risk of 1 excess case per 100 000 people from lifetime exposure to chemical carcinogens (e.g. bromate and NDMA). These targets can be
  varied depending on local environmental, social, cultural, economic and political circumstances.
  DALYs are used to weight health impacts in terms of severity and duration of disease and the number of people affected. In drinking-water they are primarily
  used for microbial hazards, with 10-6 DALYs pppy being approximately equivalent to 1 case of diarrhoea per 1000 people per year. 10-6 DALYs pppy is also
  approximately equivalent to a cancer risk of 1 excess case per 100 000 people from lifetime exposure. The use of DALYs was first included in the third edition
  of the GDWQ and was retained in the fourth edition as well as the fourth edition incorporating the first addendum.
  1
      Examples of default performance targets for potable reuse are provided in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008) and by the State of California (Olivieri et al, 2016) (see Appendix 1).




5.1 Microbial performance targets
Microbial performance targets are typically expressed as LRVs of pathogens potentially present in source waters to achieve
the health outcome target set by regulators. The reference level of risk of 10-6 DALYs pppy included in the GDWQ is used in
this document. Regulators may choose to adopt this as a target or alternatively can vary it depending on local circumstances,
including overall burdens of disease.

As it is not realistic or possible to derive performance targets for all waterborne pathogens the practical approach is to derive
targets for enteric bacteria, viruses and protozoa using representative reference pathogens for each group of organisms. The
selection of reference pathogens should be based on a number of factors, including evidence of waterborne transmission,
sensitivity to removal or inactivation by treatment processes and local conditions including prevalence of disease and
associated source water characteristics (see Appendix 1). The reference pathogens used as examples in the GDWQ (WHO,
2017a) are Campylobacter, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium. However, the significance of rotavirus will be reduced over time
by the development of a vaccine that will change the incidence and severity of disease outcomes from this pathogen (Gibney
et al, 2014). Norovirus causes about 18% of acute diarrhoeal disease globally with similar proportions in high- and low-
income settings (Lopman et al, 2015). As a result, norovirus is used as the reference pathogen for viruses in this guidance.

It has not been standard practice to identify a specific reference pathogen or calculate performance targets for helminths in
drinking-water. Concentrations of helminths are relatively low in wastewater even in hyper-endemic regions (1000/L, Mara
et al, 2010) and a 5-log performance target is required to meet a health outcome target of 10-6 DALYs pppy. Helminths are
much larger than protozoa (40–90 µm compared with 4–6 µm for Cryptosporidium) which can be used as a conservative
surrogate for physical removal of helminths.



                                                                                                                                                                                      HEALTH-BASED TARGETS                       41
The application of microbial performance targets involves the identification of appropriate combinations of treatment
processes to achieve the LRVs (see Chapter 2). The treatment processes that are put in place have implications for operational
monitoring, which should be implemented to demonstrate that the LRVs are being achieved, rather than direct pathogen
monitoring. For example, maintaining low turbidity targets will demonstrate removal of protozoa (as well as helminths)
(see Section 3.1).


5.1.1 Calculation of performance targets
The method for determining performance targets is presented in Appendix 1. Targets are calculated using the formula:

                                           concentration of the pathogen in source wastewater
Required log reduction = log (pathogen concentrations equivalent to 10-6 DALYs pppy)

As shown in Appendix 1, pathogen concentrations equivalent to 10-6 DALYs pppy are:
     • enteric bacteria (Campylobacter)   – 2.0 × 10-5 organisms/L
     • enteric viruses (norovirus)        – 1.1 × 10-5 PCR detectable units (PDU)/L
     • enteric protozoa (Cryptosporidium) – 1.2 × 10-5 oocysts/L.

These concentrations were calculated using the method described in the GDWQ with modifications based on more recent
information. These include the replacement of rotavirus with norovirus as a reference pathogen. The changes are discussed in
more detail in Appendix 1. As noted in the GDWQ, pathogen concentrations equivalent to 10-6 DALYs pppy (10-4 to 10-5 per/L)
are only used in calculating performance targets for treatment processes. They do not represent guideline values and are not
intended to encourage pathogen monitoring in drinking-water which would be impractical and of little value for routine
monitoring. Ensuring microbial safety of drinking-water, including that produced by potable reuse schemes, is based on
online or frequent operational monitoring of control measures designed to meet required performance targets (Section 3.1).

Performance targets as a function of reference pathogen concentrations
As shown in the formula above, performance targets are proportional to the concentrations of pathogens in wastewater
(Figure 5.1). This will be influenced by the prevalence of disease in communities which will vary in different countries and
regions. Within countries, prevalence of some diseases can vary seasonally and will increase substantially in response to
outbreaks. For these reasons performance targets should ideally be calculated by drinking-water suppliers using system
specific data.

In the absence of system specific data an alternative is to adopt default concentrations for selected reference pathogens based
on published data. As discussed in Appendix 1, the following default concentrations can be used for untreated wastewater:
     • 7000 Campylobacter/L
     • 20 000 PDU noroviruses/L
     • 2700 infective Cryptosporidium oocysts/L.

These default concentrations can be used in the formula above to calculate performance targets as shown in Table 5.1.

5.2 Chemical water quality targets
The GDWQ includes guideline values for a wide range of potential chemical contaminants in drinking-water, including
naturally occurring chemicals, pesticides and industrial chemicals (WHO, 2017a). In order for derivation of a guideline
value to be considered one of the following criteria must be met:
     • There is credible evidence of occurrence of the chemical in drinking-water, combined with evidence of actual or
       potential toxicity.
     • The chemical is of significant international concern.
     • The chemical is being considered for inclusion or is included in the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme.

While chemicals that could be specifically associated with discharges from municipal WWTPs have not been considered
in setting guideline values, the existing rationale applies equally well to potable reuse. Guideline values are not required
for chemicals present in trace amounts that are highly unlikely to cause health impacts. New guideline values should only
be established for chemicals that meet the criteria specified in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a). No new guideline values are
proposed for potable reuse.


5.2.1 Derivation of guideline values
Two approaches are used for setting guideline values: one for threshold chemicals and the other for non-threshold chemicals
(mostly genotoxic carcinogens). Threshold chemicals are those for which it is believed that there is a dose below which no
adverse (toxic) effects will occur. For threshold chemicals, guideline values are calculated from tolerable daily intakes (TDI),
derived from the NOAEL or LOAEL or the BMDL. Non-threshold chemicals are those for which there is a theoretical risk at
any exposure. Guideline values are derived using mathematical models to project drinking-water concentrations associated
with an upper bound of one additional case of cancer per 100 000 people consuming drinking-water for 70 years. These
models are conservative, where the lower bound risk can be zero or below zero. The GDWQ describes how other upper
bound risk benchmarks can be calculated (WHO, 2017a).


5.2.2 Contaminants of emerging concern
A recurring issue raised in association with potable reuse has been concern expressed over the broad range of chemical
contaminants discharged into sewerage systems such as pharmaceutical residues, personal care products, household
chemicals, engineered nanoparticles and steroidal hormones. It is often suggested that these contaminants are unique to
potable reuse schemes, but they can also be present in any source waters that receive wastewater or industrial discharges.
Water bodies that receive wastewater and industrial discharges may provide dilution that significantly reduces the


                                                                                                              HEALTH-BASED TARGETS   43
concentrations of these contaminants. Most of these contaminants are not subject to specific regulation in drinking-water
and do not have guideline values as they do not meet the risk-based criteria included in the GDWQ.

Pharmaceuticals provide a good illustration of a group of chemicals that have received attention in relation to drinking-
water quality in general, and potable reuse in particular, due their known biological activity in humans. Numerous reports
have shown that many pharmaceuticals can and do occur at trace concentrations in wastewater and subsequent receiving
waters. However, a WHO review (WHO, 2012) concluded that in the absence of a specific local source, concentrations
detected in drinking-water were very unlikely to cause significant health effects and that development of guideline values
for inclusion in the GDWQ is not warranted. This includes antibiotics which have also been identified as a potential concern
in providing triggers for development of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. If a specific source of pharmaceuticals is
identified, screening values can be developed to support investigation of potential health risks (see below).

The review concluded that concerns over pharmaceuticals should not divert attention and resources from microbial
pathogens and established chemical priorities such as lead and arsenic. The report also noted that conventional treatment
processes such as chlorination can effectively remove 50% of pharmaceuticals investigated, while advanced treatment
technologies, such as ozonation, AOPs (UV/H2O2 or ozone/H2O2), activated carbon and high pressure membrane filtration
(RO and NF), can achieve higher removal rates (above 99%). Treatment applied in potable reuse schemes typically provides
stronger barriers to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, than those in conventional drinking-water treatment plants.

Traditional wastewater treatment processes remove a high proportion of nanoparticles while processes used in advanced
treatment, such as membrane filtration processes, are more effective in removing nanoparticles (Neale et al, 2012; Abbott
Chalew et al, 2013).

Screening values
The WHO review of pharmaceuticals in drinking-water noted that, in particular circumstances, where source water surveys
indicate a potential for elevated levels of pharmaceuticals (e.g. presence of poorly managed discharges from manufacturing
facilities), screening values could be developed as part of investigations into potential risks and the need for implementation
of additional control measures. The most effective response following detection of an unacceptable source of pharmaceuticals
is implementation of effective discharge controls. While screening values are useful indicators of potential risks they are
not equivalent to guideline values as defined in the GDWQ.

Approaches for developing screening values, commonly using minimum therapeutic doses and conservative safety factors,
have been developed for pharmaceuticals detected in wastewaters (Schwab et al, 2005; DWI, 2007; Snyder et al, 2008;
NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008; Bruce et al, 2010; WHO, 2012). These studies showed that there were considerable
margins of safety between concentrations of pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater, surface waters and drinking-water
and potential health impacts.

Screening values can also be developed for other chemicals of concern identified in particular circumstances. Where available,
toxicological information can be used to derive screening values using conventional approaches (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC,
2008) (see Box 5.2). Where there are insufficient toxicological data to set a screening value by the conventional method,
the threshold of toxicological concern concept can be used (Kroes et al, 2004; 2005; Munro et al, 2008). This model largely
relies on carefully compiled toxicological databases of acute, subchronic and chronic NOAELs. The concept was originally
developed to prioritize toxicity testing of food additives and food contact materials, but the methodology can be applied to
other occupational and environmental settings, including drinking-water contaminants, for setting conservative screening
or interim values until sufficient toxicological data are available to set guideline values where required (Rodriguez et al,
2007; NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008).

  In this framework conservative safety factors were applied. More details are provided in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-
  NHMRC, 2008).
  a
      ADI = (Australian) acceptable daily intake levels. ADIs are developed for veterinary and agricultural chemicals that may produce residues in food.
  b
      Existing guideline in this context means a guideline value developed by a country other than Australia.
  c
      TTC = threshold of toxicological concern. The TTC approach was adapted from Kroes et al (2004; 2005).




Dieter (2014) proposed a variation of this approach. Based on extrapolation of toxicological evaluations from almost 200
evaluations by international agencies for substances found in drinking-water, Dieter proposed a five-step scale of health-
related indication values ranging from 0.01–3.0 µg/L based on consumption of 2 L of drinking-water per day. The lowest
values were for chemicals with genotoxic potential while higher values were for non-genotoxic chemicals. Exceedances of
health-related indication values would prompt further investigation and a need for additional toxicological data to improve
assessments. In these cases, the health-related indication values function as interim values prior to setting threshold of
toxicological concern-based guideline values or traditionally set guideline values.

No matter which approach has been used, testing of wastewater, secondary treated wastewater and streams receiving
discharges has shown that there are substantial margins of safety for most individual compounds, even prior to advanced
treatment. In most circumstances, significant risks to human health from CECs are very unlikely through drinking-water
supplies including potable reuse schemes (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008; DWI, 2007; Snyder et al, 2008; WHO, 2012;
2016a).


5.2.3 Chemical mixtures
No natural water contains only one chemical discretely. The reality is that all waters contain complex mixtures of natural
and synthetic chemicals (of both organic and inorganic forms) in concentrations that vary greatly by location, season and
even diurnally. Within wastewater, the mixture of chemicals is highly complex and often at much higher concentrations
than would be found in non-wastewater impacted surface water and groundwater. The standard approach for determining
chemical safety is based on developing guideline values for individual chemicals, generally without consideration of additive
effects or potential synergistic or antagonistic interactions. In a limited number of cases guideline values account for
chemical mixtures, such as trihalomethaness, microcystins, nitrate/nitrite and radionuclides, where an additive approach
is recommended.



                                                                                                                                                              HEALTH-BASED TARGETS   45
It is considered that the large margin of uncertainty incorporated into drinking-water guideline values through conservative
application of safety factors (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008) is sufficient to account for potential interactions from
low-dose exposures, which are expected to be limited at concentrations usually present in drinking-water (WHO, 2017a).
Although there has been much discussion of the potential impacts of chemical mixtures, currently there is no scientifically
based and regulatory acceptable methodology for carrying out risk assessments for chemical mixtures in source waters
or drinking-waters. Further, significant knowledge gaps, complexity, limited practical experience and resource intensity,
preclude this type of approach being systematically introduced into drinking-water standards at the present time (WHO,
2017c). As discussed in Section 3.2, the use of bioanalytical tools has been suggested as one approach to measuring
toxicological activity in water. This approach would detect the activity of chemical mixtures as a whole, but these tools have
not been developed to the point where they can be used in a regulatory context. Further work is being undertaken in this area.

If it is suspected that a number of toxicologically similar chemicals (i.e. with similar modes of action and/or end-points)
are present in water, generally, an assumption of additivity is appropriate. In the absence of sufficient information on the
mode of action of the individual components, the dose/concentration addition method is often used as a default in human
toxicology chemical mixture assessments. Due to the limited evidence available, this includes a general assumption that
interactions (synergism and antagonism) either do not occur at all or are small enough to be insignificant to the risk estimate
(WHO, 2017a; 2017b).


5.3 Radioactivity
The GDWQ provides screening levels of 0.5 Bq/L for gross alpha activity and 1 Bq/L for gross beta activity (WHO, 2017a).
If a screening level is exceeded, specific radionuclides should be identified and their individual activity concentrations
measured. The activity concentrations can be compared against the guidance levels for individual radionuclides included in
the GDWQ (Chapter 9 and Annex 6). The GDWQ also describes how to aggregate the risks of the detected radionuclides.

The screening levels and guidance levels are based on the individual dose criterion of 0.1 mSv from one year’s consumption
of drinking-water, which is a conservative figure and below the International Basic Safety Standard’s5 recommendation
that the highest individual doses received due to consumption of drinking-water do not exceed approximately 1 mSv y-1
(WHO, 2017a). The individual dose criterion represents an annual risk for radiation induced cancer of 5.5 × 10-6 per year.
In general, radionuclides would seldom be a special concern in potable reuse because the concentrations are usually very
low and natural terrestrial exposures are greater. The focus should be on ensuring that adequate controls are maintained
on discharge of industrial and medical wastes containing radionuclides.




5
    The International Basic Safety Standards are the international benchmark for radiation safety and are sponsored by eight international organizations, including WHO.
    These standards are used in many countries as the basis for national legislation to protect workers, patients, the public and the environment from the risks of ionizing
    radiation.

  KEY MESSAGES
  1 The content of regulations should be consistent with those developed for other types of drinking-water supplies.
  2 Development of a single set of regulations for drinking-water including potable reuse should be considered.
  3 Implementation of the framework for safe drinking-water should be the focus of regulations.
  4 Regulations should include or reference water quality standards and specify monitoring requirements and reporting of results.
  5 Independent surveillance is essential to ensure appropriate design and implementation of WSPs and compliance with regulatory
     requirements.
  6 Regulations need to identify roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, including regulators, drinking-water suppliers and wastewater
     management utilities (where appropriate).



Regulation of drinking-water quality, irrespective of the source, plays an important role in protecting public health.
Regulations for potable reuse, while recognizing the potential complexity of schemes, should be similar to those for other
drinking-water supplies and development of a single set of regulations dealing with all sources should be considered.
Regulations should:
    • be consistent with the principles in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a);
    • provide clear direction to drinking-water suppliers on how safety can be achieved;
    • define how compliance will be assessed and enforced;
    • ensure communication between regulators, suppliers and consumers.

Provisions should be included to ensure application of the framework for safe drinking-water, including health-based targets,
WSPs and surveillance (WHO, 2017a). Provisions could also be required to ensure implementation of SSPs where used
(WHO, 2015a). This is more likely where wastewater and drinking-water treatment are managed by different entities. In
addition, specific requirements should be included to deal with particular characteristics of potable reuse, such as microbial
performance targets consistent with the use of wastewater as a water source, and the possible use of environmental or ESBs.
This could include management of industrial discharges into municipal wastewater systems; discharge of treated wastewater


                                                                                               REGULATIONS AND INDEPENDENT SURVEILLANCE      47
into waterways and reservoirs; and injection or infiltration of treated wastewater into aquifers. In many jurisdictions, these
specific issues may be dealt with by separate environmental protection or water resource legislation.

All relevant ministries and agencies should be involved or consulted in the development of regulations. These could include
ministries with responsibilities for health, water, wastewater, water resources; drinking-water suppliers; agencies with
responsibilities for wastewater collection and treatment; local government. Well-designed regulations support delivery of
safe drinking-water and, importantly for potable reuse schemes, should foster community confidence in drinking-water
quality and trust in regulators and providers.

The aim of drinking-water regulations, including for potable reuse schemes, should be to ensure production and delivery
of safe drinking-water to consumers. Regulations for potable reuse should align with principles described in the GDWQ
and include provisions describing:
     • responsibilities of drinking-water providers, wastewater management entities, regulatory agencies and other
       stakeholders;
     • requirements for WSPs and SSPs;
     • water quality standards;
     • monitoring and testing requirements;
     • reporting requirements during normal operation and in response to incidents and emergencies; and
     • surveillance.

The scope of potable reuse regulations will be influenced by existing regulations dealing with wastewater management,
environmental protection and water resource management. In some cases, existing regulations may need to be revised,
for example regulations for existing WWTPs may need to be strengthened to provide greater assurance of performance
of this component of potable reuse schemes. It is likely that administration, and perhaps augmentation of these existing
regulations, will be undertaken by different agencies and these agencies will need to be consulted in drafting potable reuse
regulations. Where appropriate, existing regulations should be cited.


6.1.1 Responsibilities
Regulations should identify the regulatory authority/authorities and their area of responsibility. In many countries
drinking-water quality is regulated by the ministry of health, either acting alone or in combination with regional and local
environmental health agencies. In some cases, environmental protection agencies can be the regulatory authority. Alternative
models can also be developed.

Regulatory authorities are responsible for administering legislation and ensuring that all specified activities are undertaken
and that all requirements are met. This includes monitoring compliance of drinking-water suppliers to relevant provisions.
Regulations need to include powers that can be used by regulatory authorities to ensure compliance. These powers can
include requiring remedial action where necessary, making decisions about the safety of drinking-water supplies, issuing
public notifications when needed and applying penalties. The ability to apply penalties and sanctions is necessary but should
only be used as a last resort.

Regulations will assign and describe specific functions to be undertaken by regulatory authorities. These can include setting
and varying water quality standards, defining incident criteria and protocols, undertaking or monitoring surveillance,
approval of testing laboratories and validation of treatment processes. Surveillance may be undertaken by the regulatory
authority directly or may involve review and assessment of surveillance undertaken by third parties. An accreditation system
should be established for surveillance officers and third-party auditors, where used.

Regulations should also identify the entities involved in the operation and management of potable reuse schemes and their
responsibilities. The range of entities involved will be influenced by existing arrangements. For example, in some cases,
wastewater management and drinking-water supply are undertaken by one agency (Seah & Woo, 2012) while in other cases
responsibilities can be split (Angelotti & Grizzard, 2012) (see Box 6.1).

48     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
  Box 6.1 Multiple agency involvement in potable reuse
  The Occoquan Watershed (Virginia, USA) provides an example of multiple agency involvement in potable reuse. In this case, a coordinating mechanism was
  established through a state regulation (the Occoquan Policy) to manage water quality in the Occoquan drinking-water reservoir including inputs of treated
  wastewater. The policy mandated the Upper Occoquan Service Authority (UOSA) to provide collection and treatment of wastewater and the Occoquan
  Watershed Monitoring Program (OWMP) to monitor the watershed and receiving reservoir. The OWMP provides oversight and recommendations to UOSA,
  the drinking-water utility (Fairfax Water) and state regulatory agencies (Angelotti & Grizzard, 2012).



Drinking-water suppliers are responsible for appropriate treatment and delivery of safe drinking-water to consumers.
They are responsible for applying sound management practices and quality control through implementation of WSPs.
Regulations should provide direction on what this will entail and describe functions to be undertaken by drinking-water
suppliers. This should include requirements to notify regulatory agencies when a supplier knows or suspects a drinking-
water supply may be unsafe.

Where wastewater and drinking-water are managed by separate entities, direction should be provided on the functions
and responsibilities of these entities. Continuous coordination of activities undertaken by wastewater management entities
and drinking-water providers is essential to assure ongoing production of safe drinking-water from potable reuse schemes.


6.1.2 Water safety plans and sanitation safety plans
Regulations should reinforce that good management requires the implementation of WSPs. Regulations may also specify
implementation of SSPs for municipal WWTPs, particularly where wastewater and drinking-water treatment are managed
by different entities. Regulations should specify the basic content of WSPs and SSPs based on components described in the
WSP and SSP manuals (Bartram et al, 2009; WHO, 2015a). Regulations should specify frequency of WSP and SSP audits,
requiring approval or auditing of WSPs and SSPs (if used) prior to commencement of supply and regularly thereafter to
ensure that the WSPs and SSPs remain effective.


6.1.3 Water quality standards
Water quality standards are the mechanism for formalizing application of health-based targets (Chapter 5). Water quality
standards should either be listed in regulations or incorporated by reference to a separate document, such as a set of national
drinking-water guidelines or standards based on the GDWQ. If a reference document is cited, the regulations should identify
which targets are relevant. Water quality standards could include:
     • Microbial performance targets: These can be set as default pathogen concentration reductions (described as LRVs)
       based on default source wastewater concentrations identified by the regulator. An alternative is to require operators of
       potable reuse schemes to determine performance targets from system specific pathogen concentrations (see Section
       5.1). Where water suppliers are required to determine these targets, standards would need to specify the health
       outcome target (e.g 10-6 DALYs pppy), and describe the methods for collecting system specific data (e.g. reference
       pathogens, numbers of samples) and for calculating targets (see Appendix 1). Some of these details could be included
       in associated codes of practice.
     • Numerical water quality targets for chemical and radiological parameters: These should be the same as those
       adopted for other drinking-water supplies.

Inclusion of critical limits for operational parameters could also be considered. Examples include filtered water turbidity and
disinfectant doses or Ct values. If critical limits are included it should be clear that they only apply when certain treatment
processes are selected. Regulations should not include mandatory requirements for specific types of treatment process.


6.1.4 Testing and reporting requirements
Regulations should define testing requirements for parameters, sampling frequencies, sampling locations and nature of
testing (e.g. field or laboratory testing). Testing requirements should include consideration of operational and verification
monitoring. Regulations for operational monitoring can include specific requirements for individual treatment processes



                                                                                                         REGULATIONS AND INDEPENDENT SURVEILLANCE             49
such as transmitted UV light, chlorine Ct values, filtered water turbidity and membrane integrity testing. Frequencies will
vary depending on the type of testing and practical considerations, for example filtered water turbidity will typically be
measured continuously online while membrane integrity could be measured on a daily basis (USEPA, 2005). Further details
on operational monitoring are provided in Section 3.1.

Regulations for verification monitoring should describe the frequency of testing for parameters listed in water quality
standards and sampling locations. Further details on verification monitoring are provided in Section 3.2.

Procedures for approving testing laboratories should be included in regulations. This could be based on compliance with
established accreditation systems. If accreditation systems have not been established the regulatory authority should consider
establishing competency standards. These should include criteria relating to approved methods and the skills and training
of analysts.

Reporting of results is an essential component of regulations. Provisions should deal with reporting to regulatory authorities of:
    • Routine results including the manner and frequency of reporting.
    • Non-compliance with water quality standards and other incidents that may threaten drinking-water safety. Time limits
      for reporting should be identified. For example, it could be specified that non-compliance with critical limits should
      be reported within one hour of detection. One option could be a requirement to develop approved incident protocols
      incorporating incident criteria, reporting requirements and contact details of emergency personnel (Chapter 4).


6.1.5 Surveillance
Independent surveillance is one of the three core components of the framework for safe drinking-water (WHO, 2017a) and
describes the external and periodic reviews to assess management and production of safe drinking-water. Surveillance should
assess compliance with the requirements of the framework for safe drinking-water, including the design and implementation
of WSPs and SSPs through regular audits. It should cover the whole of the drinking-water system from sources of water to
treatment processes, storage reservoirs and distribution systems, through to supply to consumers. For potable reuse schemes,
it should include consideration of the source of wastewater (domestic, agricultural, industrial) and barriers to entry of toxic
industrial waste and other preventable sources of hazards. Surveillance can include independent testing of water quality.

Testing undertaken by surveillance agencies should complement verification testing undertaken by the drinking-water
supplier. Results of testing undertaken as part of surveillance should be reported to the drinking-water supplier. In this
case, the surveillance agency would need to have the capacity to undertake sampling and have access to appropriate field
testing equipment and accredited laboratories. When regulators do not have this capacity, periodic testing undertaken by a
third party could be considered as an alternative. Irrespective of which approach is taken to water quality testing, all results
should be reviewed as part of auditing of potable water supplies. If water quality testing is included as part of surveillance,
regulations should specify the range of parameters, frequency of testing and sampling locations, and should be published
in a publicly accessibly manner.

Reporting requirements will also need to be specified. It is important that outcomes of surveillance activities, including
water quality results (where testing is undertaken), identification of significant faults and the need for remedial actions,
are reported promptly to the drinking-water supplier and, in the event of third-party auditing, to regulatory authorities.

Whether surveillance is undertaken by the regulatory agency or a third-party auditor reporting to the regulatory agency,
there should be legislated powers to ensure access to sites and documentation generated by drinking-water suppliers and
wastewater management utilities.

Water safety plan and sanitation safety plan audits
WSP and SSP audits are independent assessments of the completeness, adequate implementation and effectiveness of
WSPs and SSPs. Periodic audits should be undertaken at regular intervals, following substantial changes to water sources
or infrastructure and following significant incidents. Given the complexity of potable reuse, it should be expected that
proponents have high levels of expertise and the capacity to develop well-designed and comprehensive WSPs and SSPs.


50     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Informal audits to assist in the development of WSPs and SSPs prior to commencement of supply should not be necessary
(WHO, 2015b). Audits should be regarded as constructive processes that can confirm good practice; assist wastewater
management entities and drinking-water suppliers in ensuring effective operation of WSPs and SSPs; and, where necessary,
identify how operation of WSPs and SSPs can be improved. They should not be regarded as processes designed solely as
fault finding exercises or to penalize drinking-water suppliers. Audits should examine records and documentation to ensure
that WSPs are well designed and have been maintained and implemented as described in the plans.

Where more than one agency or organization is involved in the operation and performance of the potable reuse scheme (e.g.
separate wastewater management and drinking-water supply agencies), audits should determine whether all components
of the scheme have been included in WSPs and SSPs. Where multiple plans have been developed, audits should ensure
that they are consistent and coordinated. In addition, audits should determine whether relevant agreements and contracts
between agencies have been identified, mechanisms to ensure communication have been established, and obligations relating
to operation and monitoring have been met.

Specific guidance on performing periodic audits is provided in A Practical Guide to Auditing Water Safety Plans (WHO,
2015b). The guidance developed for WSPs can be adapted to SSPs. Audits should include an assessment of WSP and SSP
documentation, including whether it:
    • is complete, logical and up to date;
    • is easily accessible, understood and used by staff; and
    • includes a record-keeping system for all activities described in the WSP and SSP, including monitoring.

Audits should ensure that safety plans accurately describe and address all components of the potable reuse system, including
sources of wastewater (e.g. domestic, agricultural, industrial, etc.), the wastewater system, waste discharge controls, treatment
processes, environmental or engineered buffering storages (if used), blending waters (i.e. other sources of drinking-water)
and distribution systems.

Regulations should specify the frequency of audits, procedures for directing suppliers to take remedial action if required,
and provisions for follow-up audits to monitor implementation.

Responsibilities and accreditation
Surveillance officers and third-party auditors, if used, need to be suitably qualified to undertake surveillance. Accreditation
systems for auditors, based on recognized qualifications and experience, should be established. Guidance on auditor
qualifications, training and certification is provided in A Practical Guide to Auditing Water Safety Plans (WHO, 2015b).

Where surveillance is undertaken by third-party auditors the regulatory agency should review the content and
recommendations included in audit reports. Where there are adverse findings or recommendations for remedial action
the regulatory agency should ensure that appropriate responses are implemented and remedial action is completed. These
responses should be checked by a follow-up audit.

Communication of results
It is essential that results of surveillance activities are communicated to:
      • drinking-water suppliers and where applicable to other agencies such as wastewater management utilities;
      • regulatory agencies in the event of third-party auditing;
      • consumers; and
      • local authorities where the surveillance agency is a centralized government agency.

Surveillance requires the cooperation and assistance of drinking-water suppliers and wastewater management utilities and
requires good communication prior to the event. This communication should be maintained during an audit. Auditors
should provide a verbal report to drinking-water suppliers through an exit meeting before leaving the site of an audit. The
report should include an assessment of the WSP and SSP, the safety of the drinking-water supply, and any recommendations
for immediate remedial action and longer term improvements. Knowledge or suspicion that a potable reuse supply is unsafe


                                                                                      REGULATIONS AND INDEPENDENT SURVEILLANCE   51
must be communicated to the drinking-water supplier immediately. Failures of the water supplier to detect and report such
faults should be investigated. Auditors should provide a report of their findings to the drinking-water supplier within a
reasonable timeframe (e.g. one month). The drinking-water supplier should be given the opportunity to review and comment
on the report before it is finalized to clarify any misunderstandings or provide further information. Where independent
water quality testing is undertaken as part of surveillance, results should be communicated as soon as possible to the
drinking-water supplier together with any recommendations for follow-up testing, further investigations or remedial action.

Similar communication should be undertaken when surveillance is undertaken by third-party auditors. In addition, audit
reports should be provided to the relevant regulatory agency. Knowledge or suspicion that a potable reuse supply is unsafe
must be communicated to the relevant regulatory agency immediately.

In some cases, responsibilities for regulation and surveillance may be shared between a centralized government department
and regional and local health authorities. It is important that the central agency and the relevant regional and local authorities
receive and share the same audit reports and associated outcomes. Communication systems need to be established to ensure
that this occurs.

The community has the right to know the outcome of audits. Outcomes should be shared with consumers either by providing
access to the audit report or by providing an agreed summary of the report.

Implementation of surveillance results
Outcomes and recommendations from audits or based on water quality results (where included in surveillance) need to
be implemented. This can take the form of a range of actions to improve the design and implementation of WSPs and
SSPs. Auditors should provide an indication of the significance of faults or gaps in WSPs and SSPs to enable drinking-
water suppliers and wastewater management utilities to prioritize implementation of remedial action and improvement
programmes. This could involve classifying faults using a grading system (e.g. minor, moderate or major). Recommended
actions and improvements should be documented, included in the WSP and SSP, and progress assessed in the next audit.
Where significant faults are identified, the auditor should identify when the next audit will occur. Normally this will be
prior to the next routine audit.


6.1.6 Random inspections and responses to evidence of unsafe water
Regulations should include powers for regulatory authorities to inspect drinking-water supplies and associated documentation
and to take or require water quality testing. This is required to enable action to be taken in the event of evidence of unsafe
water through, for example, detection of waterborne illness or clusters of consumer complaints.


6.1.7 Communities and consumers
Consumers have a right to information about the quality of drinking-water supplies. A major community concern in regard
to the provision of safe drinking-water from wastewater is human error. While there may be confidence in the science of
providing safe drinking-water, there is concern about the risks inherent in the human operation of water supply systems
(Nancarrow et al, 2009). However, trust in the authorities (regulators and water supply providers) can have a major effect
on lessening community perceptions of risk. Transparent and open information and reporting will build community trust
in the authorities.

Therefore, regulations should incorporate provisions for information and regular reporting to consumers on:
    • The performance of potable reuse systems which include summaries of results accompanied by interpretations of
      what the results mean.
    • Results and information in response to reasonable requests delivered within a specified time.

Reporting can take the form of annual water quality reports published within a specified time (e.g. three months) after the
end of a calendar or financial year.




52     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Consumers have an expectation that they will be informed if drinking-water supplies are unsafe. Where a decision is made by
the regulatory authority that a potable reuse supply is unsafe and represents an unacceptable risk to public health it should be
communicated immediately to consumers. The responsibility and methods of delivery for this type of communication need
to be established before it is required. The content of notifications and the methods of delivery should take into account the
diversity of consumers and their access to communication services (e.g. print media, television, radio and electronic media).


6.1.8 Periodic review of regulations
Over time there can be changes that impact on regulations. These can be organizational, scientific or technical and can
include emerging hazards, new evidence leading to variation of standards, new treatment methods, different operational
procedures or changes to operational monitoring methods and parameters. Experience, including lessons from surveillance
outcomes, can also identify ways that application of regulations can be improved. Regulations and standards should be
subject to periodic review to ensure they remain current and effective. Processes for review should be clearly understood
and should involve consultation with all stakeholders, including consumers.


6.2 Existing policies, regulations and guidelines on potable reuse
There are limited examples of policies, regulations and guidelines dealing with potable reuse schemes. When the Windhoek
scheme was developed in the 1960s and upgraded in 2002 there were no standards available so self-regulation was introduced
and enforced through a management agreement (see Box 6.2). However, this is changing and there is increasing advocacy
in policy documents and papers for potable reuse (Tchobanoglous et al, 2011; 2015; Dahl, 2014; ATSE, 2013; Olivieri et al,
2016) (Appendix 3) and initial development of regulations has commenced.

California has established regulations for IPR via groundwater recharge (CDPH, 2014) and is in the process of developing
criteria for IPR via surface water augmentation. The feasibility of developing criteria for DPR is also under consideration.
In a limited number of cases regulations have been developed. In Queensland, potable reuse is included in drinking-water
legislation.6

In addition to the development of specific guidelines for potable reuse, it is common practice for established schemes to be
subject to drinking-water guidelines. In Singapore, the aim for the NEWater scheme is compliance with guideline values
specified in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) and USEPA drinking-water standards (USEPA, 2014). In the USA, water supplied
from potable reuse schemes is subject to drinking-water quality requirements specified in the Safe Drinking-water Act7
(Tchobanoglous et al, 2015) as well as possible state requirements.



     Box 6.2 Windhoek, Namibia – self-regulation
     When the first Goreangab reclamation plant was developed in the 1960s there were no standards for potable reuse. As a result, in 1973, the Reclamation
     Technical Subcommittee identified requirements to ensure the safety of potable reuse. These included requirements relating to wastewater quality, control
     of industrial discharges, treatment, operational control, verification of water quality and oversight by the Director of Public Health.
     When the new Goreangab reclamation plant was developed, although Namibian Guidelines for Drinking-water had been approved in 1988, there was no
     reference to use of treated wastewater. As a result, the City of Windhoek applied self-regulation by developing standards for the new plant from existing
     international standards and guidelines for drinking-water quality. These included a comprehensive set of numerical water quality standards, including
     intermediate and final water standards, each with target and absolute values. Multiple barriers were incorporated in the new plant to remove contaminants
     or substances to specified levels and to ensure compliance with the standards. The standards are enforceable under the private management agreement
     under which the plant is operated. For additional information see Appendix 3.

7. THE ART OF PUBLIC
ENGAGEMENT
     KEY MESSAGES
     1 The success of potable reuse depends on the ability to gain public confidence and trust.
     2 Information is paramount and should be made readily available to the public so they understand the background,
        context and available options.
     3 When dealing with difficult questions associated with health, safety and environmental impacts of potable reuse, it is essential to
        be open and transparent.
     4 Consider terminology – words matter. Use positive terms and avoid terminology that is not well understood.
     5 Key stakeholders should be engaged, including the media and opinion leaders in the political, social and community spheres.
     6 Where possible consider establishing visitor centres and organizing plant tours as learning experiences.
     7 Online communication is crucial. Social media should be leveraged to tell the potable reuse story in a positive and engaging manner.



Central to the success of any potable reuse project is the ability to gain public confidence and trust through a productive,
two-way engagement process with key stakeholders. There is ample research and documented case studies worldwide that
support this. A sustained and comprehensive public communication plan that addresses the health, safety and quality
concerns throughout the various stages, from planning to implementation, is an essential tool to advance the success of
projects.

Effective engagement involves an intimate understanding of water and how humans rely on it. It involves careful selection
of terminology to inform communities about the contaminants found in water and how treatment technology can remove
them to produce safe drinking-water. The goal is not to obtain public acceptance but to generate expanded and meaningful
interactions with the community – interactions that produce understanding.

In the absence of understanding about water use and reuse, a sustainable water future will remain out of reach. There is
no magic formula that yields public acceptance, but it has become clear that strong, imaginative information programmes
and early and consistent two-way engagement are necessary to open the door to more sustainable water management. This
is the art of attaining the level of public understanding that is essential to the success of any potable reuse programme.

This chapter outlines the key components of the potable reuse public engagement plan, and how it can be used to build
public confidence and trust. With differing political and social needs and circumstances from country to country and city
to city, an engagement programme for potable reuse cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. However, there are some key
aspects that need to be considered and included for an effective engagement programme. These can be adapted to suit
the needs of different communities. The list is by no means exhaustive, but it covers key factors that have led to successful
public engagement.


7.1 Engagement programme
7.1.1 Availability of information
Information is paramount. Information needs to be made readily available to the public in a suitable form to support
understanding of potable reuse proposals. The first step in any engagement plan is to provide information readily to
the public so that they understand the background, context and options available. Understanding rather than acceptance
should be the goal. An uninformed public cannot have informed opinions and is vulnerable to having knowledge vacuums
filled with misconceptions. Although not all members of the community will have the time or inclination to absorb the
information provided, the knowledge that it is available is reassuring and extremely important to effective engagement.



54        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Those who are interested should be able to gain sufficient knowledge, which may help to reassure those they know who
have doubts about the safety of potable reuse.

Access to information is therefore important to enable the subsequent dialogue between the utility and the stakeholders
to take place in a productive manner. Table 7.1 illustrates the key information areas that should be communicated to the
public. Information about available water supplies should be provided well in advance of discussion about potable reuse.
Table 7.2 summarizes useful communication tactics to consider when presenting messages on potable reuse.


Table 7.1 Communication of information to the public

Key information area                     Communication plan
Water supply options available           When formulating a water resources plan, it is important that problems of water shortages are clearly
                                         communicated and that all options are identified and evaluated. If the community thinks that some
                                         options have been overlooked, they will not trust the process. The goal of an engagement programme is
                                         not to promote potable reuse, but to ensure that it is understood, so that it can be considered a suitable
                                         option for augmenting drinking-water supplies.
Planned vs unplanned potable reuse       The public is generally aware of the natural water cycle, but some are not aware of the practice of
                                         discharging treated or untreated wastewater into rivers (unplanned potable reuse) for use by downstream
                                         communities as sources of drinking-water.
Contaminants (pathogens and              The communicators must be prepared to answer technical questions about the nature of the contaminants
chemicals) in drinking-water from        (including pathogens and chemicals) in water. They need basic knowledge to be able to explain how
potable reuse systems                    control measures, including treatment technologies, can be used in multiple-barrier processes to
                                         inactivate or minimize contaminants. Community health officials and physicians should be included in the
                                         outreach process.
Technology                               Advanced treatment processes must be clearly explained in simple terms so that the public of all ages are
                                         able to fully comprehend what the technology can do and how contaminants in water are removed.



Table 7.2 Tactics for communicating messages on potable reuse

Message                                  Communication tactics
Make potable reuse familiar – showcase   To make potable reuse familiar, it is useful to present case studies that clearly demonstrate how many
the experience of other countries and    communities are already drinking “reused water” without always being aware of it. Research has shown
cities                                   that communicating the success of potable reuse projects elsewhere helps to create a sense of familiarity.
                                         Telling the stories of early adopters helps quell fears. Their stories should emphasize the need for the
                                         water, the benefit of the projects, the fundamentals of treatment and the safety/reliability of the product
                                         water.
Quality, not history                     Terminology and messages must focus on the quality of the water, not the history of where the water has
                                         been, i.e. not its source as wastewater or how it has been used, but what the water can safely be used for.
                                         Explain how monitoring ensures safety. The main concern of the public is the safety and quality of
                                         drinking-water from potable reuse. For reassurance, it is important to emphasize the amount of
                                         monitoring and tests that will be undertaken. Emphasizing reliability and monitoring is part of the
                                         hallmark of quality.
                                         Explain that the water will meet appropriate national and international standards and that the scheme
                                         has the support of the relevant regulatory agency.
Benefits of potable reuse                Because supplies of wastewater are not subject to the variability of weather, potable reuse is a
                                         sustainable, drought-proof source of water that has an invaluable role to play in strategies to address
                                         the global water crisis. Potable reuse has benefits for the environment because it reduces discharges
                                         of nutrients into waterways. The technology is proven to be effective and well understood and can be
                                         affordable, considering some of the alternatives. Wastewater is the only source of water that increases
                                         with population.




                                                                                                               THE ART OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT            55
7.1.2 Information plan
When dealing with difficult questions associated with the health, safety and environmental impacts of potable reuse
it is essential to be open and transparent. An open and interactive channel for information sharing is important to
demonstrate that the utility or agency values the views of the public, and is involving the public in the implementation
process, as opposed to going ahead with the decision without seeking any feedback. One approach is to provide a website
and social media tools that present information and allow the community to engage by asking questions. It is important
to have mechanisms to deal with unexpected questions from the community. A plan needs to be in place to provide rapid
responses by a trusted expert.

Clear and consistent messages are important in communication plans. The key messages should build confidence in
potable reuse as a viable and sustainable water supply option and communicate its key benefits. Examples of key messages
are outlined below.
     • Potable reuse is a safe, reliable and sustainable source of drinking-water.
     • Using recycled water is good for the environment.
     • Potable reuse is a valuable and drought-proof water supply source capable of strengthening water supply resilience,
       especially against weather extremities like dry spells and droughts.

Messages alone are not sufficient – communication plans must include information about the approaches to show the
pollutants in water and the advanced technologies that remove them. Stakeholders need to be able to see that water gets
cleaner and cleaner as it goes through the various treatment processes. Information included in Box 7.2 showcases messages
that are memorable and have visual appeal.

Consider terminology – words matter. Use positive, non-stigmatizing terms and avoid terminology that is not
well understood. The meaning of words is closely linked to the feelings they convey; they can influence behaviour and
attitudes. Although there are numerous dictionaries and glossaries that aid in defining water reuse terms, most are written
for engineers, scientists and other water professionals and thus require some technical knowledge. Effective engagement
involves careful selection of terminology to inform communities about the contaminants found in water and how treatment
technologies can remove them to produce safe drinking-water.

This can be more challenging in countries with religious practices where water has specific religious and historically spiritual
connotations. It is imperative to use terms that are consistent with the significance of water to people of various faiths,
while still being mindful to use terms that do not stigmatize reuse. Consistency is also important, for example, there are
several terms used to refer to treated wastewater. Agreement should be reached on a single positive term, or phrasing that
is appropriate to the country and its setting.

Even though words like “wastewater” and “sewage” are internationally recognized terms within the water industry and
are used in this guidance and other WHO texts on wastewater reuse (WHO, 2006), they have a negative connotation that
reminds people of their source, and their use adds to the psychological aversion. It is worthwhile to consider replacing
technical terms with words that are neutral and factual. For example, “wastewater” and “sewage” can be referred to as “used
water”. This also better reflects treated wastewater’s true value as a resource within the water cycle. Water can be used and
reused, similar to the natural water cycle – it is not wastewater to be “thrown away.” “Water reclamation plants” or “used
water treatment plants” can be used in place of “sewage treatment plants” or “WWTPs” as these plants are not merely
treating sewage, but are now part of the process that reclaims the used water for further reuse. Treated sewage could be
referred to as “purified water”.

7.1.3 Communication strategy
Identify and engage with key stakeholder groups such as media and opinion leaders in the political, social and
community spheres so that they can help to garner more public support. Key to the campaign to win public confidence
and acceptance is the way an organization relates to and communicates with its various groups of stakeholders. This must be
done in a meaningful, thoughtful, and trustworthy manner, so that the public can see the proposal and its issues in context
and be able to consider and discuss the points made by its advocates and opponents.

Opinion leaders are important because they influence the attitudes, beliefs, motivations and behaviour of others. They
influence community opinions by raising awareness, persuading others, establishing or reinforcing norms, and leveraging
resources. They usually are highly visible in the community and have a defined constituency, which increases the likelihood
that others will adopt their behaviour. It is therefore vitally important that considerable attention be paid to ensure that
opinion leaders are aware of the need to increase water supply sources and are knowledgeable about the technical processes
associated with water management.

Political, religious, medical and university leaders can serve as key opinion leaders because of their visibility and the influence
they exert on the community and nation they serve.

Engaging the media. Another critical stakeholder group is the media, as they often act as the watchdog for the community
and question authorities on their plans and policies. A well thought out media plan is needed to get journalists to understand
and potentially support a project. Bringing the media on a tour of the potable reuse facility and giving them a first-hand look
at the advanced technology employed in the process will aid their understanding of potable reuse. Designating a primary
contact point for the media will help to ensure prompt replies are provided.

Independent expert testimony is an effective way to provide answers to difficult and challenging questions on health,
safety and quality. Having a panel of international and local water experts in the various related fields of engineering,
biomedical sciences, chemistry and water technology to provide independent expert testimony and address health, safety
and quality issues is an effective way to provide answers to frequently asked questions. As specialists in their own areas
of research, who are also familiar with water recycling projects elsewhere, experts have the credibility and are best suited
to address safety and health concerns – the public’s top priority. The expert panel’s reports can be captured on video and
shown in a visitor centre, on agency websites and reported by the media. Independent scientific panels can also garner
news coverage that the agency may not.

Employ visitor centres, demonstration centres, online (virtual) and plant tours as learning experiences. Visitor centres,
demonstration centres, and tours provide an appealing information dissemination alternative that can frequently become a
multi-objective destination. Even online virtual tours provide insight and images that can be game changing for audiences
unfamiliar with advanced technologies. They are an alternative to public meetings and even to the typical classroom
experience because they can provide spaces and exhibits that are novel, stimulating, evidence-rich, multisensory, and fun.
Visitor centres can vary in size and expense. They can be in a stand-alone building, a building associated with a treatment
plant or public spaces. Visitor centres are ideal for school tours.

Present water tasting opportunities, where possible. There is nothing more convincing than the public trying the product.
Recycled water can be bottled in attractive packaging so that the public can sample how pure the water is. The water samples
can be distributed at events, tours and at visitor centres. Tasting of the water samples by opinion leaders, including politicians
and other trusted community leaders, can build trust and reinforce the safety of the product.

Online communication is a key tool for spreading information. Leverage social media channels to tell the potable
reuse story in a fun and engaging manner. Social media is an increasingly important platform for sharing information
and seeding conversations. Social media is a space where people share their everyday lives. Communication efforts need to
engage in the spaces where people communicate and create opportunities for engagement and interactivity. Conversational




                                                                                                   THE ART OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT   57
approaches and the use of visual imagery rather than just factual messaging and language resonate with digitally literate
people. Using short, sharp animations and videos that can be shared in the social media space can enhance understanding.
Engaging in online conversations is also critical to demonstrate the willingness to listen to and respond to negative comments
that are raised in social media forums in a timely, positive and helpful way. There are many guidance documents on the use
of social media that can be consulted when crafting an education and engagement strategy.

Water utilities should continue to explore how best to communicate and connect with various demographics in their
communities using social media platforms. Dialogue can run both ways, and efforts to reach and engage hard-to-reach
audiences are expanded by developing a broader communication platform that goes beyond traditional mediums of print,
radio, email and television.


7.2 Preparing information to attract and hold attention
To be effective, an education/communication plan must be designed so that it attracts and holds attention. Information
must appeal to people who have a range of learning preferences – some learn by hearing, others prefer to read either in a
printed form or on their computer. All benefit from seeing the processes in action and it should always be remembered
that the use of humour is a powerful way to gain attention and stimulate the memory. A utility’s communications toolbox
should include a range of products, including:
     • informative factsheets
     • infographics
     • animations
     • videos, virtual tours and documentaries
     • interactive computer programmes
     • media outreach programmes and visits to water reuse facilities
     • social media channels
     • visitor centres, demonstration centres, displays and plant tours
     • water tastings.


7.3 Evaluating information and engagement programmes
Information/communication programmes should be evaluated, not only for the impact of their terminology and messaging
but also for their ability to attract and hold attention. Pre- and post-surveys can be very helpful in determining and
measuring whether educational experiences are having an impact. Evaluation can be used as a planning tool; building an
evaluation phase into the very beginning of a project or programme will ensure that it happens. Finally, it is important to
realize that education and engagement to promote change can take time and should be continued. Consistency is essential;
it is advisable not to start and stop outreach efforts for political expediency. An evaluation programme will allow the utility
to determine whether messages are being understood and reinforced. Because the education/communication programme
is about changing behaviour, the evaluation process will help determine if it is succeeding and inform the design of new
communication techniques. There are various techniques for evaluation, such as gathering responses pre- and post-
experiences in a visitor space or online.

It is important to understand that not everyone has comparable knowledge and experience with potable reuse. An effective
evaluation programme will help to identify how a specified education/engagement experience uniquely affects an individual’s
attitude about potable reuse.

In the absence of understanding about water use and reuse, a sustainable water future will remain out of reach. There is
no panacea or magic formula that yields public acceptance, but it has become clear that strong, imaginative information
programmes and early and consistent two-way engagement are powerful and effective strategies – strategies necessary to
open the door to more sustainable water management. This is the art of attaining the public understanding that is the critical
ingredient to the success of any water reuse programme.

7.4 Case studies and additional information
In some instances, officials have called off plans to implement potable reuse after they faced public opposition and outcry.
Although these projects were well designed with sound engineering principles, supported by extensive laboratory tests to
ensure water quality, the lack of a well thought out public communications programme combining science/technology and
art/social science considerations to garner public support dealt them a huge blow. Headlines like “toilet to tap,” that play
on the psychological and emotional aspects of the human mind, were shown to cloud logical reasoning. The result was
public resistance to potable reuse. But slowly, things are changing. In recent years, more cities are implementing schemes,
fuelled in part by prolonged dry spells and droughts. Appendix 4 provides four case studies where the water reuse project
has either succeeded or failed because of public communications:
     • Singapore: NEWater, nothing new
     • Orange County Water District, California, USA: One programme, multiple benefits
     • Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia: No to water recycling
     • San Diego, California, USA: Where persistence paid off.

60         POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
8. CONCLUSIONS
8.1 Summary of key messages
Potable reuse is a practical source of drinking-water that should be considered when developing new drinking-water
supplies or when expanding or replacing existing supplies. Major advantages of potable reuse are that it is largely a climate-
independent source of water that takes advantage of locally available and collected wastewater for sustainable use of water. In
addition to providing an ongoing source of drinking-water, potable reuse also reduces undesirable environmental impacts
of wastewater discharges.

As shown in Table 1.2 and demonstrated by the case studies provided in Appendix 5, interest in potable reuse is growing
and it is expected that the number of schemes will continue to increase in response to expanding populations and climate
pressures. As demonstrated in this guidance, the scientific and technological basis for implementing potable reuse has been
established. Well-designed potable reuse schemes, managed in accord with the framework for safe drinking-water, including
WSPs, will produce safe drinking-water. In this respect, potable reuse is no different from other sources of drinking-water.
The principles and health-based targets described in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) apply to potable reuse in the same way as
they do to all drinking-water supplies and generally there is no justification or requirement for additional targets, including
additional guideline values, to be applied to potable reuse.

While the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) applies to the design, management and operation of potable reuse schemes there are a
number of aspects of potable reuse that require particular attention compared with other drinking-water systems. These include:
    • The potential involvement of multiple agencies, including separate entities responsible for wastewater management
      and production of drinking-water (Chapters 1 and 6).
    • The importance of coordinating activities associated with wastewater management and production of drinking-water
      and communication between operators (Chapters 1 and 6).
    • The potential use and coordination of WSPs and SSPs (Chapters 1 and 6).
    • The high concentrations of pathogens and the broad range of chemical hazards potentially present in wastewater
      (Chapter 2).
    • Heightened public interest in CECs, including pharmaceuticals, natural hormones, personal care products and trace
      industrial compounds (Section 2.2).
    • Rapid variability in source water quality and flow (diurnal, daily, seasonal, etc.) (Chapter 2).
    • The use of complex multiple-barrier treatment trains which can include processes such as advanced oxidation and
      multiple forms of disinfection. Collectively these complex systems provide large reductions of potentially hazardous
      microorganisms and chemicals (Chapter 2).
    • The possible use of environmental and engineered storage buffers (Chapter 2).
    • Impacts of blending of different sources of drinking-water on distributions systems, particularly for DPR (Chapter 2).
    • Increased need for public engagement and education (Chapter 7).

While potable reuse is a practical source of drinking-water in many circumstances, potable reuse schemes are typically
complex and proponents need to have sufficient resources and capabilities for successful implementation. Availability of
appropriately trained and skilled operators is an essential requirement. Other key issues and associated conclusions include:
    • Wastewater contains high concentrations of enteric pathogens. As a result, production of microbially safe drinking-
      water requires setting of relatively high performance targets (default targets; minimum 8.5-log reduction of enteric
      bacteria, 9.5-log reduction of enteric viruses and 8.5-log reduction of enteric protozoa) (Chapter 5). They do not
      represent guideline values but rather, have implications in identifying control measures and in particular, combinations
      of treatment processes (Section 2.5.2).
    • While there tends to be greater interest in CECs, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, the
      concentrations are generally low and generally do not warrant setting of new guideline values. The guideline values
      described in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) are sufficient in most circumstances. Where source water surveys indicate
      a potential for elevated levels of a chemical without a guideline value (e.g. due to poorly managed discharges from
      manufacturing facilities) screening values could be developed as part of investigations into potential risks and the

                                                                                                             CONCLUSIONS     61
         need for implementation of additional control measures (Section 5.2).
     •   Control measures should be applied from collection of wastewater to the delivery of drinking-water. Control measures
         need to be validated and generally, LRVs are based on challenge testing and sensitivities of operational monitoring,
         particularly where operational monitoring is relied upon for demonstrating ongoing performance of treatment
         processes (Sections 2.5 and 2.6).
     •   While operational monitoring follows the principles described in the GDWQ, continuous monitoring linked to
         SCADA systems with automatic alarms for deviation from critical limits will be common (Section 3.1).
     •   The content of regulations should be consistent with those developed for other types of drinking-water supply.
         Development of a single set of regulations for drinking-water including potable reuse should be considered
         (Chapter 6).
     •   The success of potable reuse depends on the ability to gain public confidence and trust. Information should be made
         readily available to the public so they understand the background, context and available options. Key stakeholders,
         including the media and opinion leaders in political, social and community spheres, should be engaged (Chapter 7).


8.2 Case studies
Two sets of case studies are provided to illustrate how issues associated with potable reuse have been addressed. Case
studies on community engagement are provided in Appendix 4, while successful implementation of potable reuse schemes
is illustrated in Appendix 5, with seven case studies from Australia, Namibia, Singapore and the USA. The case studies on
implementation include examples of potable reuse with and without the use of environmental buffers.


8.3 Knowledge gaps and future research
There are a number of knowledge gaps including:
    • Improved operational monitoring methods are required to support validation of MBR and RO, including
      operational parameters or procedures that can be used to identify low level failures. As described in Section 2.6,
      pilot trials and laboratory tests have demonstrated that RO can achieve greater than 6-log reductions of microbial
      pathogens but operational monitoring lacks sensitivity and reduces the log credits that can be claimed to 2–4 logs.
      For MBR, operational monitoring parameters that correlate with pathogen log reductions have not been identified.
    • Additional data on concentrations and infectivity of pathogens in wastewater. A large proportion of wastewater
      pathogen monitoring is not published. Additional quality controlled data would enable identification of more accurate
      default values for calculation of performance targets. It would be particularly useful if regional or climate specific data
      could be identified. The reference pathogen used in this guidance for enteric viruses is norovirus, however, there is
      no practical method to routinely identify and enumerate human infectious norovirus. Culture methods developed
      using B cells (Jones et al, 2015) and stem cells erythroids (Ettayebi et al, 2016) may lead to future development of
      a routine assay. The availability of such a method would improve the accuracy of microbial risk assessments and
      improve the setting of performance targets required to achieve safe drinking-water.
    • Rapid testing to boost the effectiveness of engineered storages. The use of engineered storages in DPR can at least
      in part compensate for the incident response time provided by environmental storages in IPR. However, the size and
      detention time of water in engineered storages is limited by practical and economic considerations. The effectiveness
      of these storages would be enhanced by the development of additional rapid testing procedures that can be used to
      identify treatment failures and water quality non-compliance prior to water being discharged into distribution systems.
      This could include development of rapid assays for enteric pathogens or indicator organisms (e.g. coliphages).
    • Development of biological assays that can be used singly or in combination to demonstrate potential impacts on
      public health. As discussed in Box 3.3, more than 100 assays have been developed to test various types of biological
      activity in water. However, understanding the relevance of these assays, including the translation of results into
      assessments of public health risk, has not been achieved and uncertainty remains regarding the role of bioanalytical
      tools in a regulatory context. Further research is required to address these gaps.
    • Improved understanding of incident occurrence and management in potable reuse schemes. While the aim is to
      operate potable reuse schemes without failure or incidents it is inevitable that faults will occur. These incidents do not
      necessarily lead to a significant public health risk occurring providing appropriate remedial action is implemented
      in a timely fashion. Most incidents and responses go unreported. It would be useful if more were reported to enable
      lessons to be shared and learned.

62       POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Appendix 1. Reference pathogens and performance targets

A1.1 Introduction
Microbial safety is usually defined in terms of achieving performance targets expressed as log reductions of reference
pathogens selected to represent enteric pathogens potentially present in source waters. Log reductions are calculated using
quantitative microbial risk assessment and disease burdens to translate the probability of disease into potential human
health impacts (WHO, 2016b).


A1.2 Selection of reference pathogens
Due to the different characteristics of the major groups of enteric pathogens, it is standard practice to identify separate
reference pathogens for bacteria, viruses and protozoa.

Selection of reference pathogens is based on a number of properties including:
     • waterborne transmission established as a route of infection;
     • sufficient data available to enable a quantitative microbial risk assessment to determine the probability of disease
       following exposure of consumers to reference pathogens, including: dose–response relationships and infection to
       illness ratios;
     • data available on impacts of disease (prevalence and severity of symptoms) to enable calculation of disease burden
       in DALYs;
     • occurrence in source waters;
     • persistence in the environment; and
     • sensitivity to removal or inactivation by treatment processes.

The GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) identifies a number of potential reference pathogens, including Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter,
E. coli O157, Salmonella, Shigella, rotavirus, norovirus, enterovirus, Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Selection of reference
pathogens may vary between different countries and should be based on consideration of prevalence and severity of
disease and source water characteristics. The reference pathogens used as examples in the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a) are
Campylobacter, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium. While rotavirus remains a significant contributor to waterborne disease
the use of rotavirus as a reference pathogen has been complicated by the development and use of a rotavirus vaccine which
is changing the incidence and severity of disease outcomes from this pathogen (Gibney et al, 2014). Norovirus, which
fulfils the requirement of a reference pathogen, is a suitable alternative. Norovirus causes about 18% of acute diarrhoeal
disease globally with similar proportions in high- and low-income settings (Lopman et al, 2015) and is a common cause
of waterborne outbreaks (Guzman-Herrador et al, 2015; Moreira et al, 2016). Two-dose response models, a beta poisson
and a fractional poisson model, have been published for norovirus (Teunis et al, 2008; Messner et al, 2014) and a disease
burden has been determined (Gibney et al, 2014). The fractional poisson model characterizes hosts as being completely
susceptible or completely immune, with infection probability based on the probability of exposure to at least one virus
particle or aggregate. In this document, the traditional dose dependent beta poisson model has been adopted (Table A1.1).
The outcomes of using the two models are similar.


A1.3 Calculation of performance targets
Performance targets can be calculated using the formula:

                                      concentration of the pathogen in source wastewater
Required log reduction = log ( pathogen concentrations equivalent to 10-6 DALYs pppy )

The concentrations of reference pathogens equivalent to 10-6 DALYs pppy (DALYd) are calculated as shown in Table A1.1
using:
    • quantitative microbial risk assessment to determine the likelihood of disease arising from exposure to reference
       pathogens (WHO, 2016b); and
    • the disease burden from single cases of disease.

A1.4 Derivation of default pathogen concentrations
In the absence of system specific pathogen data, an alternative approach can be to use default pathogen concentrations
generated from published assessments of untreated wastewater quality. Preferably this should be derived from regions with
similar distributions and prevalence of disease.

This approach was adopted in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008), which
identified default values for concentrations of reference pathogens in untreated wastewater using data from influents to
large metropolitan WWTPs. The Australian guidelines used 95th percentile concentrations to take into account observed
variability in concentrations of reference pathogens and increases observed during outbreaks of disease. These concentrations
were used to calculate minimum performance targets to meet the health outcome of 10-6 DALYs pppy (Table A1.2).

The State of California has adopted a similar approach to determine conservative performance targets from maximum
reported concentrations of enteric pathogens in wastewater to reduce the level of risk to below an acceptable level of 10-4
infections pppy (Table A1.3).

Adaptations of these approaches can be used to derive performance targets for Campylobacter, norovirus and Cryptosporidium
using default values as described below.

Campylobacter
There is limited data for culturable Campylobacter in wastewater; Soller et al (2016) reported a range of 900–40 000 organisms
per L from results published in 1993. The Australian data (95th percentile 7000 organisms per L) is more recent and can
be used as a default value (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008).

Enteric viruses
Ideally, for reference pathogens there should be a method available to determine concentrations of potentially viable and
infectious particles. Although there are genome-based methods (e.g. using PCR-based molecular amplification) for norovirus
(and rotavirus), there are no practical methods for routinely monitoring infective particles in environmental samples. Culture
methods developed using B cells (Jones et al, 2015) and stem cell erythroids (Ettayebi et al, 2016) may lead to development
of a routine assay but such an assay is not yet available.

There are two alternative approaches that can be used to determine or estimate norovirus concentrations. The first is to use
published concentrations derived using PCR. A meta-analysis of published data (566 results) from 12 studies, including
results from inlets to 42 WWTPs, calculated a mean concentration of 3.9-log PDU per L (95% confidence interval: 3.5–4.3)
(Pouillot et al, 2015). Concentrations detected varied between treatment plants and demonstrated a general seasonality
consistent with prevalence of disease (Pouillot et al, 2015).

A significant limitation in using data generated using PCR is the lack of a consistent relationship between PDU and
infectious virus particles (Rodriguez et al, 2009; Jofre & Branch, 2010). Genome concentrations can be much higher than
concentrations of infectious particles in wastewater and drinking-water sources (Choi & Jiang, 2005; Lodder & de Roda
Husman, 2005; de Roda Husman et al, 2009; Rutjes et al, 2009; Lodder et al, 2010).

A second approach is to use culture-based methods to measure abundant virus species as surrogates for norovirus. Candidates
include culturable mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) and adenoviruses, which have been identified as useful indicators
for enteric virus concentrations in wastewater (Fong et al, 2010; Betancourt & Gerba, 2016; Mosher et al, 2016). Both are
environmentally robust and relatively abundant in wastewater (Fong et al, 2010; Hellmer et al, 2016; Betancourt & Gerba,
2016). Adenoviruses include a number of serotypes that collectively cause a wide range of infections, with types 40 and
41 the main causes of enteric illness (WHO, 2017a), while the human disease significance of reoviruses is unclear, it is a
common enteric virus (Betancourt & Gerba, 2016). Neither adenovirus or reovirus meet the requirements of a reference
pathogen due to insufficient data being available to enable calculation of disease burdens in DALYs as shown in Table A1.1.

Culturable reoviruses were detected in concentrations up to 12 000 MPN8 per L in a nine-year study by Sedmak et al
(2005) (107 samples) of wastewater in Milwaukee, USA, while adenoviruses were detected in concentrations up to 20 000
MPN per L (92 samples) from wastewater in Australia (Deere & Khan, 2016). The concentrations detected in Australia are
similar to those reported in Soller et al (2016) (range 56–6900 infectious units per L). Sedmak et al (2005) detected lower
concentrations of adenovirus (and enterovirus) in wastewater.

There is not a large difference between the maximum concentrations of culturable reoviruses (Sedmak et al, 2005) and
adenoviruses (Deere & Khan, 2016) and the upper limit of the 95th percentile credible interval for norovirus of 20 000
PDU from the meta-analysis by Pouillot et al (2015). As norovirus is the reference pathogen used in this guidance, the
concentration of 20 000 PDU per L has been selected as a default value.

Cryptosporidium
Concentrations of Cryptosporidium vary widely between WWTPs and during outbreaks of disease. In one recorded
outbreak, concentrations of infectious oocysts in wastewater increased between 10- and 40-fold during an outbreak (King
et al, 2017). Maximum concentrations from 282 samples collected from nine Australian WWTPs were between 242–42 667
oocysts per L (95th percentiles 150–5460 oocysts per L) (Deere & Khan, 2016). All concentrations were determined using
immunofluorescence and confirmed by 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and differential interference contrast
microscopy using the same standard method including correction for recovery (USEPA, 2012b). These results are consistent
with those published elsewhere (0.3–50 000 oocysts per L; Yang et al, 2015; Soller et al, 2016).

While the standard method provides an indication of viability it does not determine human infectivity of detected oocysts.
A separate investigation has demonstrated that between 7 and 44% of potentially viable Cryptosporidium oocysts detected
in untreated wastewater are capable of initiating human infections (King et al, 2017). Applying a conservative value of
50% infectivity to the highest 95th percentile result of 5460 oocysts per L from Deere and Khan (2016) provides a default
concentration of 2700 infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts per L.

Default concentrations and associated performance targets
Default concentrations of reference pathogens in untreated wastewater and associated minimum performance targets to meet
an upper limit of 10-6 DALYs pppy are summarized in Table A1.4. The data used to select the default values are relatively
conservative compared with that used for drinking-water (WHO, 2017a), which recommends the use of arithmetric means
and reflects the poor quality of source wastewater. The default concentrations should only be used in the absence of system
specific data.

Appendix 2. Determining chemical guideline values
Two approaches are used for determining guideline values for “threshold” and “non-threshold” chemicals.


A2.1 Threshold chemicals
An example of a dose–response curve for a threshold chemical is presented in Figure A2.1 These types of curves are developed
by experiments on animals (generally with very high concentrations of chemicals) to determine the relationship between
the daily administered dose of a chemical as a function of body weight in milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day)
leading to an established incidence of biological effects in the exposed population. From this (hypothetical) dose–response
curve, it can be observed that a dose above 10 000 mg/kg/day resulted in toxicity to roughly 100% of the exposed population.
Equally, it can be observed that there exists a dose (around 10 mg/kg/day) below which no “response” may be expected.
That is, there is an identifiable “safe dose”, known as the “threshold’ dose”.

Toxicological investigations for non-carcinogenic (“threshold”) studies are usually designed to enable the identification
of either the highest dose at which no adverse effects are observed (NOAEL) or the lowest dose at which adverse effects
are observed (LOAEL). NOAELs and LOAELs are conventionally determined in units of milligrams of the substance per
kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day).

The TDI for a chemical is then calculated from the animal test data after including adjustments to account for sources
of variability and uncertainty. Uncertainty factors are applied to account for extrapolation of animal studies to human
impacts (interspecies), variability amongst the human population (intraspecies) and uncertainties derived from incomplete
toxicological databases such as the use of subchronic studies to derive chronic effects or the use of a LOAEL in place of a
NOAEL. Each of these uncertainty factors are normally applied as a value of either 10 or 3, up to a suggested maximum
product of 3000 (Ritter et al, 2007). Where uncertainty factors exceed 1000, guideline values determined in the GDWQ
are designated as provisional due to the relatively high level of uncertainty (WHO, 2017a). Excessively large uncertainty
factors in risk assessments are undesirable, may include redundant elements and lead to overly conservative default based
calculations. Factors in the region of 100 are more desirable when an appropriate database is available. As an alternative
to the use of uncertainty factors, chemical specific adjustment factors based on the use of quantitative toxicokinetic and
toxicodynamic data can be used when available, to derive TDIs.




                                                                                           APPENDIX 2. DETERMINING CHEMICAL GUIDELINE VALUES   67
Increasingly, the preferred approach for the derivation of a TDI includes using the BMDL. When appropriate data are
available, BMDLs are used as alternatives to NOAELs (IPCS, 1994) to use the whole of the dose response data.

The TDI can be calculated from a NOAEL, LOAEL or BMDL using the following equation:

                                NOAEL or LOAEL or BMDL
		TDI =
                                    UF and/or CSAF
Where:
   NOAEL          =    no-observed-adverse-effect-level
   LOAEL          =    lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level
   BMDL           =    lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose
   UF             =    uncertainty factor
   CSAF           =    chemical specific adjustment factor

The guideline value is then derived from the TDI as follows:

		GV = TDI × bw × P
            C
Where:
   GV     =   guideline value
   bw     =   body weight (default assumption for adult body weight is 60 kg)
   P		    =   fraction of the TDI allocated to drinking-water to take account of exposure from other sources such as food
   C		    =   daily drinking-water consumption (default assumption for an adult is 2 L/day)


A2.2 Non-threshold chemicals
In the case of compounds considered to be genotoxic carcinogens, guideline values are often determined using a
mathematical model. Although several models exist, the linearized multistage model is generally adopted. Other models
are considered more appropriate in certain cases. These models lead to calculation of a “cancer slope factor” (CSF), in
which cancer risk per lifetime daily dose is given in inverse exposure units of (mg/kg/day)-1. The hypothetical carcinogenic
risk then is assumed to be linearly proportional in the low-dose range to the level of exposure to the chemical, with the
CSF defining the gradient of the dose–response relationship as a straight line, projecting from zero exposure-zero risk. A
sharper gradient, defined by a higher CSF, indicates a more potently carcinogenic chemical leading to increased cancer
risk for any identified level of exposure.

The CSF for a specific carcinogen may be determined from human epidemiological studies or (more commonly) from
chronic animal carcinogenicity assays. The CSF can be used to calculate the projected upper bound probability of increased
cancer incidence (over a background cancer risk) over a person’s lifetime (usually considered as 70 years) – the so-called
“excess lifetime cancer risk” associated with a particular level of exposure.

In the GDWQ, WHO applies a tolerable level of risk of 1 in 100 000 or 10-5. This is the excess lifetime cancer risk as a result
of exposure to the chemical in drinking-water. The guideline value is then derived from an identified tolerable excess life
time cancer risk level as follows:

		GV = ELCR × bw
        CDF × C
Where:
   ELCR       =       estimated upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk (applied by WHO at 10-5)
   bw         =       body weight (default assumption for adult body weight is 60 kg)
   CSF        =       cancer slope factor determined for the chemical (mg/kg/day)-1
   C		        =       daily drinking-water consumption (default assumption for an adult is 2 L/day)




68     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
The assumption of the absence of a toxicological threshold for many carcinogenic end-points (including mutagenicity and
genotoxicity) is well entrenched in chemical risk assessment, but is not universally accepted and is increasingly problematic
(Nielsen et al, 2008). It is, in fact, likely that there are thresholds for a number of genotoxic effects. Furthermore, the low-
dose extrapolation for non-threshold toxicological calculations is often across many orders of magnitude from the effects
observed in experimental animals to established tolerable risk levels for humans. This extrapolation introduces significant
uncertainties in the determination of acceptable exposure levels. In addition, it should be noted that the concentration
associated with this risk is usually based on the upper 95% confidence interval of the calculation; the actual risk is likely
to be much lower and may even be zero. It cannot be used to determine the number of cancer cases that will result from
this exposure.

Appendix 3. Policies, regulations and standards

A3.1 Windhoek, Namibia
A3.1.1 Old Goreangab reclamation plant
During the latter part of the 1960s, the first Goreangab reclamation plant was developed without a set of standards for
drinking-water produced from treated wastewater. Existing acts (Water Act 1956, Public Health Act 1919) did not refer to
potable reuse although the Water Act did include a provision allowing for a local authority with jurisdiction over sewage
disposal to use wastewater treated in accordance with standards to be used for any purpose approved by the minister. The first
guidelines used were adopted from a publication by Stander and Van Vuuren (1969), which for chemicals provided criteria
for potability, health hazards, toxicity, and as indicators of pollution. These were used in conjunction with International
Standards for Drinking-water (WHO, 1963).

In the absence of ratified guidelines or standards for treated wastewater, the Reclamation Technical Subcommittee in 1973
identified the following requirements to ensure safety of potable reuse:
     1) The treated wastewater used as raw water had to comply with a certain minimum standard.
     2) The treatment processes employed for reclamation had to be approved.
     3) Each unit had to be operated according to its operational guideline. When not complying, water had to be recycled
         from that unit to the inlet or to be wasted.
     4) Operational test results had to be conducted on a four-hourly basis.
     5) If routine bacteriological tests indicated satisfactory operation and control of the plant, then the water was acceptable.
     6) Virology tests had to verify water quality.
     7) Robust water quality test results were required to verify compliance of raw water and treatment steps.
     8) All light industries with a measurable discharge would be monitored by the pollution control programme to
         determine the composition of the discharge. Heavy industrial waste was diverted to a separate industrial wastewater
         treatment site.
     9) The Director of Public Health was given the authority to inspect the reclamation plant at any time and to stop production
         if it did not comply with any required standards or guidelines (Reclamation Technical Subcommittee, 1973).


A3.1.2 New Goreangab reclamation plant
Namibian Guidelines for Drinking-water were approved by the Cabinet of the Transitional Government in 1988. Once
again, no reference was made to treated wastewater. In the absence of enforceable guidelines and standards, the City of
Windhoek applied self-regulation by adopting standards from international drinking-water standards for the design of
the new Goreangab reclamation plant. The approach remained that specific processes were to be incorporated with the
specific purpose of removing or reducing concentrations of specific contaminants. For this new plant, however, specific
water quality standards were prescribed, and to reach these requirements, multiple barriers were incorporated to remove
hazards to specified levels.

In devising standards for the new plant, the following standards and guidelines were considered:
     • Guidelines for the Evaluation of Drinking-water for Human Consumption (1991), Department of Water Affairs,
       Namibia (Namibian Guidelines, 1991)
     • Potable Water Quality Criteria (Rand Water, 1994)
     • WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 1993)
     • The National Drinking-water Standards and Health Advisories USEPA (USEPA, 1996)
     • The European Community Guidelines for the use of water for human consumption (80/778/EWG) (1980 and 1994
       draft) (EC, 1980)
     • A guide for the planning, design and implementation of a water reclamation scheme (Meiring & Partners, 1982).

From these, a comprehensive set of standards were devised (Table CS1.2), including intermediate and final water standards,
each with target and absolute values. The standards are enforceable under the private management agreement under which
the plant is operated.

70     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
The 1988 Namibian Water Guidelines for Drinking-water were still applicable in 2016. The Namibian Water Resources
Management Act 2013 empowers the minister to issue regulations, but a proposed new drinking-water standard has not
been finalized.


A3.2 United States of America
Indirect potable reuse is included in the 2012 Guidelines for Water Reuse (USEPA, 2012a). The guidelines contain broad
recommendations for IPR and describe combinations of treatment processes, water quality criteria, monitoring requirements
and a two-month retention period in receiving waters (environmental buffers).

The framework for DPR (Tchobanoglous et al, 2015) reviews applicable USA regulations and summarizes microbial
and chemical criteria for DPR. Microbial criteria developed by California (see below) and a National Water Research
Institute (NWRI) expert group include minimum log reductions of 12-log for enteric virus, 10-log for enteric protozoa
(Cryptosporidium and Giardia) and 9-log for total coliforms. The framework includes discussion of source control
programmes, treatment technologies and treatment trains, achievable log reductions, process monitoring, facility operation
including operator training and residuals management.


A3.2.1 California
Regulations were adopted in 2014 for the replenishment of groundwater by surface spreading or subsurface injection. The
regulations include criteria for:
    • public consultation;
    • pathogen reduction requirements (12-log enteric virus, 10-log Cryptosporidium oocyst and 10-log Giardia cyst
      reduction) based on achieving an upper limit annual risk of infection of 10-4 per person;
    • inclusion of a minimum of three treatment processes for each pathogen;
    • the design of RO and advanced oxidation used to control chemicals of concern for subsurface injection;
    • soil-aquifer treatment, retention times and dilution;
    • process and water quality monitoring; and
    • an operations plan identifying procedures for facility operation, maintenance and incident responses.

The feasibility of criteria for IPR via surface water augmentation and DPR is under investigation (as of 2016). California
regulators have mechanisms to approve DPR in the absence of adopted criteria on a case-by-case basis should a community
require this option to deal with a drought emergency.


A3.2.2 Texas and New Mexico
Guidelines for DPR have been prepared for the New Mexico Water Department (NWRI, 2016) and the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB, 2015). The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has identified baseline targets
of 8-log enteric virus removal, 5.5-log Cryptosporidium removal and 6-log Giardia removal from conventionally treated
wastewater. Since these targets apply to treated wastewater and not untreated wastewater, which was the starting point for
the Californian and NWRI criteria, the finished water quality is likely to be similar.


A3.3 Australia
Guidelines for drinking-water augmentation (potable reuse) (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2008) were developed during the
Australian millennium drought (2000–2010). The guidelines combine features of the GDWQ (WHO, 2017a), the Australian
Guidelines for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-AHMC, 2006) and the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (NHMRC-
NRMMC, 2011). Key features include:
    • A focus on risk management plans (similar to WSPs).
    • Defining microbial safety in terms of a health outcome target of 10-6 DALYs pppy.
    • Achieving safety through application of microbial performance targets based on the use of reference pathogens
      (8.1-log Campylobacter, 9.5-log enteric virus, 8-log Cryptosporidium reduction from untreated wastewater).




                                                                              APPENDIX 3. POLICIES, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS   71
     • Chemical guideline values based on those in the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, augmented with an approach
       for setting interim guideline values or screening levels for pharmaceuticals, personal care products and other trace
       organics. The approach for setting interim guidelines is based on a hierarchy of existing toxicological information,
       tolerable doses for veterinary pharmaceuticals, lowest therapeutic doses for human pharmaceuticals and thresholds
       of toxicological concern. The main driver for including this approach was to provide a mechanism for responding to
       public concerns raised during debates about potable reuse. This was a major issue in the debate about the proposed
       Toowoomba scheme (see Appendix A4.3).




72     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Appendix 4. Engagement case studies

A4.1 Singapore: NEWater, nothing new
In the city of Singapore, where up to 40% of the city’s water demand of 1500 million litres per day (MLD) can be met by
potable reuse (branded NEWater in Singapore), with a bigger and more ambitious plan to meet up to 55% of its water
demand in the long term, water reuse has been an astounding success. Singapore’s success with reused water has been well
documented and much discussed in the global water fraternity, most notably in the area of securing public acceptance
through a comprehensive and wide-ranging public communications programme targeting various groups of stakeholders.

NEWater, introduced in 2003, is primarily supplied to non-domestic sectors such as wafer fabrication plants, industrial
estates and commercial buildings for industrial and air-cooling purposes. As NEWater is ultra-clean, it is ideal for processes
that require highly purified water. During dry months, NEWater is also used to top up reservoirs.

To gain public acceptance of potable reuse Singapore set out to design an education and engagement process that would
mitigate against the impacts of factors that inhibited trust and acceptance.

High on its agenda was engaging all possible groups of stakeholders early in the process with relevant information. This
included political leaders, media, grassroots organizations, business associations and religious groups. To build public trust
and confidence, exhibitions and roadshows were also held at the school and community level.

A panel of international and local water experts in the fields of engineering, biomedical sciences, chemistry and water
technology provided independent expert testimony and addressed health, safety and quality issues. Their verdict: that
NEWater was consistently of a safe, high quality, well within the drinking-water requirements of the World Health
Organization and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).

Central to the entire public education campaign in Singapore was the establishment of the NEWater Visitor Centre, a state-
of-the-art water museum that acts as a one-stop centre for anyone looking to understand how NEWater is produced and
the part it plays in Singapore’s water strategy.

The centre allows visitors to view the treatment process at the Bedok NEWater factory from a gallery and understand the
science behind it through interactive displays, tours and workshops. The centre is open to community groups, individuals
and foreign visitors. It has also become part of Singapore’s National Education Programme, giving every student a chance to
visit the NEWater Visitor Centre at least once during their time at school. Allowing the public greater access to the know-
how of water reclamation has fostered trust and a sense of assurance.

Bottles of attractively packaged NEWater are available for public sampling, and this has helped the general population to
judge for themselves the quality of NEWater.

Leading by example, the government demonstrated that the population’s trust in them was well placed. The political
leadership championed the move by publicly drinking NEWater. One of the earliest leaders was Mr Goh Chok Tong, the
then Prime Minister of Singapore, who drank from a bottle of NEWater right after a tennis game. Other cabinet ministers
and members of parliament followed suit, by toasting with NEWater at events held during National Day celebrations. The
definitive moment that marked the population’s support and confidence in NEWater and set the stage for its implementation
in Singapore was the toasting of NEWater in a show of solidarity by some 60 000 Singaporeans during the 2002 National Day.

An independent survey by Forbes Research at the end of 2002 confirmed the success of the programme. NEWater had
garnered a 98% acceptance rate, with 82% of respondents indicating that they would drink NEWater directly and another
16% would drink it mixed with reservoir water.




                                                                                         APPENDIX 4. ENGAGEMENT CASE STUDIES   73
The presence of key opinion leaders to influence and champion the project is paramount, and in Singapore’s case, instead
of letting the media run with images that would turn the community off, one of the first things that the Public Utilities
Board (PUB) did was to engage the media to gain support. Instead of the “toilet to tap” imagery, the result was fair and
unbiased reporting (“Good as new”, Today, 11 July 2002). Media reports also helped to frame NEWater in the right context
of Singapore’s water strategy (“Four big taps will keep water flowing”, The Straits Times, 23 May 2002). Public endorsement by
the country’s leaders was a powerful and influential signal that served to garner public support, and this was duly conveyed
by the media (“NEWater proves to be a smash hit with PM Goh”, The New Paper, 1–2 August 2002).

Sustained public education and engagement with its stakeholders is an ongoing process, and the NEWater Visitor Centre
continues to be the main vehicle for sustained public education on NEWater, with more than 1.3 million visitors to date.
Key milestones, such as the opening of NEWater plants, and commemoration of the first and 5 millionth NEWater bottles,
are celebrated to keep NEWater in the public eye and more importantly, maintain the public’s confidence in NEWater.
NEWater has won several awards for communication and education, including the “Water for Life” United Nations Water
(UN-Water) Best Practices Award in 2014.


A4.2 Orange County Water District, California, United States of America: One programme,
     multiple benefits
The Orange County Water District (OCWD) initiated its first potable reuse system, Water Factory 21, in the 1970s and
replaced it in 2008 by the Groundwater Replenishment System (see Case Study 2). The Groundwater Replenishment System,
which is operated jointly by the OCWD and Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) of Fountain Valley, California,
currently produces 380 MLD of water – enough to meet the needs of nearly 850 000 people. Approximately two thirds of
the advanced purified water is pumped to OCWD surface recharge facilities in Anaheim, California, and the remaining
water is injected into a seawater barrier.

To ensure a comprehensive and sound assessment of potable reuse and aquifer recharge efforts, an independent advisory
panel was established with experts from various fields, including toxicology, microbiology, hydrogeology, public health
and environmental engineering. This panel provided public confidence that critical aspects of the projects have been
independently and scientifically scrutinized.

Further, OCWD undertook a comprehensive public outreach and engagement strategy to bring about public acceptance of
potable reuse which has been emulated by countries such as Australia, Singapore and many cities in the USA.

The aggressive outreach campaign to garner public acceptance for the Groundwater Replenishment System started a
decade before the project came online in 2008. A public outreach consultant was hired, and initial research was conducted
consisting of focus groups and telephone surveys within the OCSD and OCWD combined service areas. From this research,
the following were identified: key issues (e.g. cost, health, safety, water reliability, suspicion of jargon, importance of RO
purification) and target stakeholder audiences (e.g. business, environmental, political and other community leaders). The
project’s original name, Orange County Reclamation Project, was changed to the Groundwater Replenishment System
because of research indicating that the former did not effectively communicate the project.

Outreach talking points also were developed as a result of focus groups and public polling. Initial outreach efforts focused
on educating the political and community leadership of Orange County on the project and building a foundation of
understanding and support. Subsequent phases broadened these efforts to reach the general public. From 1997 to 2007,
more than 1200 face-to-face presentations about the science behind the Groundwater Replenishment System were given
to local, state and federal policy-makers, business and civic leaders, health experts, environmental advocates, academia
and the general public. These efforts were augmented by developing collateral materials (e.g. letters, newsletters, brochures,
videos) and providing them to other water agencies, libraries, TV stations and special community events. In addition, a
series of four public workshops were held across Orange County to receive citizen input prior to the decision in 2001 to
proceed with the final engineering design.




74     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Importantly, letters of support for the project were solicited and obtained from elected officials representing cities that
would drink the water, as well as state and federal officials. Support was also obtained from the environmental, business,
medical and minority communities.

Public tours have also been a critical element of the outreach programme. Both OCWD and OCSD provide free public
tours of their facilities. OCWD receives hundreds of requests annually to provide tours of and briefings on the Groundwater
Replenishment System for visitors from local colleges, water agencies, the surrounding community and international
organizations.

Proactive outreach and education activities have continued throughout the design, construction, operations and initial
expansion of the project. As a result of this proactive outreach campaign, the project has received no active public opposition.
These outreach activities continue to remain a high priority for both OCSD and OCWD, with the ongoing goal of maintaining
community support for the Groundwater Replenishment System by educating the next generation of local citizens and
community leaders. OCWD’s public outreach programme has won several awards.


A4.3 Toowoomba, Australia: No to water recycling
Faced with an ongoing water crisis, the city of Toowoomba, (approximately 100 km west of Brisbane, the capital city of
Queensland, Australia) had plans to go ahead with a potable reuse proposal in 2006. At that time, the town, whose water
supply came mostly from three major reservoirs, had seen dam levels drop to 20% of capacity. Water restrictions had also
been in place since 2003.

To address the city’s water challenges, the Toowoomba City Council announced the Water Futures initiative in July 2005,
comprising a range of water solutions, key of which was the construction of an advanced water treatment plant to provide
potable reuse water for the town. However, this was principally a policy document, and not a public communication
document, although the Toowoomba City Council was planning to undertake a three-year community engagement
programme as part of the proposal.

The Citizens Against Drinking Sewage public interest group reacted quickly to this proposal, coming out publicly to voice
their opposition and provided arguments to support their position. They were well funded and politically motivated. They
were the first to communicate and provide information about potable reuse to the public. In six months, 10 000 people had
signed a petition against the proposal.

In March 2006, the Australian Government offered financial support subject to public support for the Water Futures project
being demonstrated through a referendum held within months. The rationale for the referendum is not completely clear
but in addition to public controversy, another factor was downstream agricultural interests that were concerned about the
loss of water. Instead of the planned three-year community engagement programme, the Toowoomba City Council had
to quickly condense the programme into a 10-week information campaign to educate the population on the project. They
distributed a Water Futures booklet which contained explanations about the water cycle, the current level of water supply
as well as possible water supply alternatives. However, by the time the council started engaging the public, the Citizens
Against Drinking Sewage group had been communicating with Toowoomba residents for more than half a year, utilizing
stigmatizing language and creating fear about public health. During this period, they continued to use public meetings,
petitions and internet blogs to activate residents to vote “no” at the referendum while the council was hindered by the fact
that the full education and engagement programme they had planned could not be funded until after the referendum.

The end result was telling. A majority 62% of residents voted against the proposed reused water scheme in the referendum
held on 29 July 2006. The Water Futures project was abandoned. According to the media statements made by Citizens
Against Drinking Sewage in the lead up to the referendum, it appeared that Toowoomba did not want to be the first, or
the only, location in Australia to drink reused water. Other compelling factors such as political interests, clashes of strong
personalities on both sides of the debate, mistrust surrounding the public information campaign, timing and the absence
of national guidelines for potable reuse all played a part in influencing public opinion.



                                                                                           APPENDIX 4. ENGAGEMENT CASE STUDIES   75
Of particular note, the solution to the dire water shortage in the greater South East Queensland region, including Toowoomba,
was the development of a water grid connecting a range of supplies, including the Western Corridor potable reuse scheme
in Brisbane which was designed to supply highly treated wastewater to the major water supply dam, Wivenhoe. A pipe was
constructed linking Toowoomba to the grid. While the advanced treatment trains were installed political opposition in
Queensland also had an impact on this project. Ultimately heavy rains leading to major floods have meant that the Western
Corridor scheme has been held in reserve and not used (as of 2016).


A4.4 San Diego, California, United States of America: Where persistence paid off
Although technically neighbours in populous Southern California, San Diego and Orange County have tried to implement
potable reuse to varying degrees of success. While Orange County is an exemplary model of a successful potable reuse
programme, the potable reuse project in the city of San Diego was dogged with negative associations and “toilet to tap”
phrases during its first attempt to propose a reuse project.

Heavily dependent on imported water for 80–90% of its water supply, the city of San Diego began considering potable reuse
in 1984, with a full-scale project approved in 1994. The drivers at that time were drought conditions, as well as the fact that
the Point Loma WWTP was given until 2015 to meet USEPA discharge standards.

The public communications campaign was controversial. Unlike Singapore, there was no consistent political support for
the proposal. There was public mistrust over the project, stemming mainly from the inadequacy of answers in addressing
questions on health and safety issues. The media labelled the project as “toilet to tap”, evoking negative imagery to amplify
public concerns. Although a small group of opinion leaders were involved, the general community had no understanding
that the imported water coming into San Diego was already reused. There was also a perception of bias. The proposed
project was going to use treated wastewater from an affluent area of San Diego as a source (after advanced treatment) of
drinking-water to be provided to a low-income area. Hence, in addition to “toilet to tap”, San Diego was plagued by the
mantra of “the effluent of the affluent”, which created additional outrage that the reuse was unfairly being used in only one
area. In the face of such public resistance, the project was eventually aborted.

By 2004, potable reuse was back on the agenda. With increasing weather variability leading to prolonged drought conditions,
San Diego began looking at potable reuse in 2004 to evaluate all options for increasing its water supply. The city council
commissioned a water reuse study to comprehensively research all opportunities for reusing water, and a second study
was conducted in 2009. Ultimately, one of the key arguments that helped to shift public opinion was that partially treated
wastewater discharges to the ocean would be significantly reduced, which encouraged support from environmental groups.

Around that time, some industries were threatening to move away from San Diego because of the water shortage. Political
support increased to a great degree because of the appreciation that ocean wastewater discharges would be significantly
reduced as a result of the wastewater recycling. The city therefore conducted a demonstration project from 2009 to 2013 to
explore the feasibility of implementing the same water purification process used successfully by OCWD, although San Diego
was planning to discharge the highly treated water into an uncovered reservoir followed by passage through a drinking-water
treatment plant. The compiled data culminated in the Pure Water San Diego programme, a 20-year potable reuse project
that would see up to 57 MLD of reused water by 2023. The long-term hope is that output will be increased to 315 MLD of
purified water by 2035, accounting for over one third of the city’s total supply.

Learning from its past experience, the city is also embarking on an active public communications programme to reach
out to all its stakeholders with materials and information about the project readily available. Tours to the reuse facility are
also facilitated.

CS1 Windhoek, Namibia, Goreangab reclamation plant
CS1.1 Overview and background
When the City of Windhoek decided in 1968 to implement DPR it was a bold step, as at the time, no standards or
guidelines for drinking-water from recycled wastewater were in existence. Windhoek was the first city in the world to
introduce planned potable reuse. It was, however, not a step taken lightly, but was the outcome of years of research and
piloting, starting with pilot plants at the Gammams WWTP (Gammams) in Windhoek and the so-called Stander plant
at Daspoort in Pretoria.

One of the pioneers on the Windhoek plant, the late Dr Lukas van Vuuren, coined the phrase that “Water should be judged
by its quality, not by its history”. However, literature of the time does not seem to provide any quantitative quality targets that
the treated wastewater was to meet, but rather suggested that specific process steps that had the ability to remove specific
constituents of concern be designed and incorporated into the treatment process.

As shown in Table CS1.1, the plant evolved over 40 years of development and 30 years of full-scale operation, with
improvements introduced through six stages, culminating in replacement of the original (old) Goreangab reclamation plant
with the new Goreangab plant in September 2001. The treatment train included in the new plant is shown in Figure CS1.1


CS1.1.1 Drivers for potable reuse in Windhoek
Windhoek is situated on a watershed at the upper end of the Upper Swakop River basin. The first recorded formal settlement
in Windhoek occurred towards the end of 1840 at the hot springs in what is known today as Klein Windhoek. Ironically, the
abundance of water was the reason why Windhoek was chosen as a place to settle. By 1911 the springs and hand dug wells
had become inadequate and the first state owned water scheme was developed by drilling a borehole. A second borehole
was drilled in 1913 and until 1959 groundwater remained the only source of water supply.

Early in the 1950s, it became apparent that within 10 years, serious water problems would arise in Windhoek and that
additional water sources would have to be found. There are no perennial rivers within 750 km of the city. Suitable dam sites
were far from the city and would have resulted in very high pumping costs. The city council approached the South African
National Institute for Water Research (NIWR) for advice. The Director of NIWR (Dr Stander) considered that potable reuse
was a readymade solution to the problem (Scientiae, 1969).

The water crisis of 1957, once again showed the vulnerability of the city when groundwater resources were reported to
be used at a level 57% above safe yield. Water levels dropped by up to 52 m in four months. In a submission to the South
West Africa Administration Water Affairs Branch it was stated that the reuse of suitably treated wastewater for certain
special purposes, such as the power station and cemetery, would appear to be a measure likely to yield positive results
by September 1958.

The 95th percentile safe yield of the three-dam system serving Windhoek and the central areas of Namibia, is 20 gigalitres
(GL) per annum of which 17 GL is available to Windhoek. In 2015, the demand of the city was 26 GL per annum. Without
the contribution of reuse and groundwater, demand could not be met. Direct potable reuse is an indispensable source of
water for Windhoek (Figure CS1.2).

To meet increasing demand for reuse water, it is planned to expand the Gammams plant from 28 MLD to 55 MLD using
a two-train operation (a 20 MLD nutrient removal-activated sludge process train and a 35 MLD MBR train). The treated
wastewater from the ASP plant will remain the feedwater for the new plant, where physical constraints on hydraulic capacity
will not allow significant expansion. The City of Windhoek has called for consulting services for establishing an advanced
treatment drinking-water plant at Gammams to follow the new MBR plant.

CS1.1.2 History and current status
During the mid-1960s, following favourable results from the Gammams pilot plant, the Municipality of Windhoek Council
took a decision to implement potable reuse. Direct potable reuse was officially born at the Goreangab water reclamation
plant on 21 January 1969 when the plant, with an initial capacity of 3.287 MLD (1.2 GL per annum) was inaugurated. The
plant was owned by the Municipality of Windhoek who, with government funding for infrastructure, was solely responsible
for water supply from three sources: groundwater, surface water from the Goreangab Dam, and potable reuse from the
Goreangab plant.

During the period 1969 to 1982, three surface reservoirs were added by the government. These reservoirs, with a total
capacity of 155 GL, were between 70 and 200 km from Windhoek and, being on ephemeral rivers, had a 95th percentile
assured yield of only 20 GL. Semi-purified irrigation and water demand management were introduced between 1993/94.
During the drought of 1996 the city council, resolved to reuse every available cubic metre of wastewater.

The Goreangab plant was upgraded five times over its lifetime and in 2001 a new plant was put into operation with an
initial capacity of 21 MLD.


CS1.1.3 Ownership
The City of Windhoek owns the plant. It is contracted out to Windhoek Goreangab Operating Company, an international
private partnership company. The 20-year contract is managed through a private management agreement.

CS1.2 Development of the potable reuse scheme
CS1.2.1 Sources of water and source control
During the early 1960s, when potable reuse was contemplated, a decision was taken by the then Municipality of Windhoek,
to separate industrial wastewater from domestic wastewater. To enforce this change on existing industry would have been
impractical. A new industrial township was therefore established to the north of the city and outside of the existing Gammams
drainage area. The Goreangab plant uses the secondary wastewater from the Gammams WWTP as source for reuse.

A new industrial wastewater plant was established and as far as possible all industry with industrial wastewater, was
accommodated in the northern industrial area. Even today, there are still a few exceptions that drain to the Gammams
plant, but discharges from these industries are strictly controlled and industrial wastewater charges, inclusive of penalties,
are used to minimize the effect of these on the reuse process. Source control by way of automatic composite sampling at
individual discharge points, is used to ensure compliance.


CS1.2.2 Piloting
In the early 1960s, a pilot scale plant was installed at the Gammams WWTP, (Clayton, 2005). This pilot study was undertaken
jointly between the City Engineer’s Department and the NIWR.

At the time the building of the Windhoek reclamation plant was approved, a similar full-scale research unit with a capacity of
4.8 MLD was built at Daspoort, Pretoria, where all future reuse research would be conducted by the NIWR. Here, extensive
research was conducted to improve the existing treatment process. The biological nutrient removal-activated sludge process
was compared with biological trickling filters. High lime treatment and ammonia stripping, breakpoint chlorination and
activated carbon adsorption were all piloted at Daspoort. Known toxic compounds and organic micro-pollutants were
determined and their removal was established during spiking exercises. Biological surveillance assays and bioassays were
simultaneously conducted to detect any acute or sub-lethal activity. Concentrations of these compounds tested, were removed
by more than 99.9% of their original concentration, to levels below detection limits. No biological activity, bacteria, virus or
coliphages could be detected in the final water. Comparing the treated wastewater quality with conventional drinking-water
sources from surface and boreholes, it was concluded that the treated wastewater was of a better quality. These promising
results led to the upgrade and extension of the Mark I plant. Research continued and many different advanced treatment
processes were tested in the following years. Many of the research efforts received international acclaim.


CS1.2.3 Regulatory context
As discussed in Appendix A3.1, both the old and new plants were introduced in the absence of water quality standards for
potable reuse. In the absence of enforceable guidelines and standards, the City of Windhoek accepted self-regulation by
adopting standards from international drinking-water standards for the design of the new plant.


CS1.3 Control measures
CS1.3.1 Control strategy
Industrial pollution, in particular the practice of releasing synthetic chemical compounds to receiving streams, represents a
potential health hazard. Therefore, it was of paramount importance that these compounds had either to be totally removed
from drinking-water or the concentrations reduced to such a level that the risk of exposure was as low as possible.

When the Mark I plant was established in 1969, it was based on a clearly defined policy of total reclamation and entailed
four integrated lines of defence. These lines of defence included:
     • Wastewater catchment quality control based on the diversion of industrial discharges containing potentially harmful
       chemical compounds from the domestic wastewater collection system.
     • Efficient reclamation technology backed by vigilant control. Aspects of concern were the efficiency of such a plant
       to remove pathogenic microorganisms, toxic metals and organic compounds which may be mutagenic, teratogenic
       or have other detrimental effects.



                                                                                         APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   81
     • Vigilant surveillance of the final water produced, which included a comprehensive determination of the microbial
       and chemical quality of the water as well as the use of early warning systems, based on biological sensors such as fish.
     • Continuous measurement of the chlorine content of the water and those chemical constituents that might be measured
       on a continuous basis such as DOC and the UV absorption of the water.

From the early 1970s, microbiological and chemical quality control studies indicated that the product of the reclamation
plant was of good quality and conformed to generally accepted drinking-water criteria. As shown in Table CS1.1, the plant
has been upgraded over the years, increasing the capacity of the plant to remove chemical and microbial hazards.


CS1.3.2 Identification and monitoring of control measures
Control measures focused on the removal of synthetic detergents and organic pollutants by wastewater treatment and
removal of microbial pathogens with advanced drinking-water treatment unit processes as well as removal of DOC, total
halogenated compounds, metals and aesthetic parameters. Each treatment process had to be operated within defined
operating conditions or parameters to ensure maximum removal of contaminants. Operational analyses ensured that the
treatment objectives were reached. Laboratory analyses were conducted to verify that the water had been treated adequately.
Initially, at least four different institutions were involved in monitoring. Two institutions had the mandate to conduct
unscheduled sampling at least once a month and to analyse mainly for bacteria, virus and chemical substances, whereas
another two were responsible for the scheduled routine monitoring of the full spectrum of water quality parameters. In order
to deal with changes in the raw water, or processes that did not perform adequately, process steps were either improved or
replaced with more appropriate treatment technologies.


CS1.3.3 Verification and epidemiological evidence
In 1976, when the Mark II plant upgrade was commissioned, it was recommended that a general standard for the quality
of the maturation pond effluent should be established. The safety barriers of the Mark I plant had been effective and any
additional safety barriers, which would increase safety, could be implemented immediately. Final water had to comply with
the South African Bureau of Standards drinking-water specification (No. 241-1971), which was slightly refined for DPR.
Standardization of methods for analysis of chemicals, bacteria and viruses between all laboratories was made a priority and
inter-laboratory studies were introduced. Further research was undertaken to define analytical parameters more accurately,
for example free chlorine, total chlorine, chlorine demand, and to develop standardized methods for these. High lime
treatment with ammonia stripping and a further chlorination barrier were introduced.

It was recognized that epidemiologic studies were an imperative requirement (Isaäcson et al, 1987). Therefore, an
epidemiological study was commissioned and the following tests were also carried out:
    • continuous fish bio monitoring
    • mutagenicity testing
    • tissue culture tests for hazardous chemicals
    • mammalian tests for carcinogenicity.

Bioassays of public water were to consider not only lethality but also sub-lethal effects important to the well-being of any
species. Online fish bio monitoring was introduced as a quick, simple and comparatively inexpensive method for assessing
sudden changes in water quality. For long-term exposure tests, the following were considered:
     • change in scope for activity and general health
     • serologic changes
     • pathologic changes.

Studies undertaken by the South African Institute for Medical Research from 1974 to 1983 first dealt with the microbiological
surveillance of the treated wastewater. Based on more than 4000 samples tested it was concluded that treated wastewater
conformed to generally accepted quality standards laid down for domestic water supplies and was fit for human consumption.
From a virological point of view, the source of treated wastewater, i.e. human wastewater, was shown to be consistently




82     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
contaminated with potentially pathogenic viruses, in contrast to untreated conventional surface water sources. The water
was regularly tested at different stages in the reclamation process. Viruses became progressively fewer in number and were
consistently absent from the final stages in the process. The studies were expanded in 1976 and embraced both potential
short-term (mainly infectious) and long-term (mainly non-infectious chronic) effects. The authors of the report further
concluded that, within the limits of the epidemiological studies done, no adverse effects on health attributable to the
consumption of treated wastewater could be demonstrated (Isaacson & Sayed, 1988). This conclusion was further supported
by a study on the health effects of the Montebello Forebay IPR scheme in Los Angeles County, California (Nellor et al, 1984).
This study concluded that no viruses could be detected in chlorinated treated wastewater. An evaluation of health and
vital statistics over a period of 12 years showed that residents of the area that received potable reuse water experienced no
increased rates of infectious diseases, congenital malformations, infant and neonatal mortality, low birth weight, cancer
incidence or deaths due to heart disease, stroke, cancers of the stomach, rectum, bladder or colon, or all cancers combined,
when compared with residents of two control areas that did not receive potable reuse water.


CS1.3.4 Environmental buffer
Windhoek is a DPR scheme and does not have an environmental buffer. The treated water from the WWTP flows through
several maturation ponds before entering the reclamation plant. The volume of these ponds had remained constant, meaning
that the retention time decreased from 14 days for the Mark I plant, to under three days for the new plant, as flows increased.
This loss of security was compensated by technology improvements, online monitoring, automation of plant processes and
faster response times to analysis. Currently, the final treated wastewater is retained in a reservoir to facilitate the maintaining
of the desired blending ratio with surface water at a pump station, from where the blended water is distributed to several
reservoirs in the distribution network. The retention varies from four to eight hours.

In the absence of an environmental buffer, the private management agreement was structured to ensure that the operator
was always incentivized to achieve the prescribed water quality. Payments to the operator are calculated in terms of the
water meeting intermediate standards after every process step as well as final water standards. Failure to meet target values
attracts financial penalties, while failure to meet maximum or absolute values, means putting the plant to recycle mode with
zero output, until the product water complies with specifications. If the operator is unable to meet the absolute values and
zero water is delivered, payment is suspended. It is mandatory for the operator to have all barriers in operation at all times.


CS1.4 Water quality monitoring
CS1.4.1 Operational and verification
Research was conducted to test the reliability of the processes under varying conditions. Each treatment process had to be
operated within defined operating conditions or parameters to ensure maximum removal of contaminants. Operational
analyses ensured that the treatment objectives were reached. Laboratory analyses were conducted to verify that the water
had been treated adequately. As stated, at least four different institutions were involved in monitoring. In the early days,
two institutions had a mandate to undertake surprise sampling at least once a month and to analyse mainly for bacteria,
viruses and chemical substances, whereas two were responsible for conducting scheduled routine monitoring of the full
spectrum of water quality parameters.

During the period 1980–1990 the Mark III and Mark IV plant upgrades were commissioned, which also extended the
production of treated wastewater. An online automatic DOC analyser and UV254 monitor was introduced by the NIWR

The primary objective of research on the microbiological water quality (Grabow, 1984; 1990), was to establish the safety
of the treated wastewater and to develop methods for reliable routine quality surveillance by means of tests which could
be carried out at high frequency and relatively low cost in laboratories with limited expertise and facilities. It included the
selection of practical and reliable indicator organisms that had to be present whenever pathogens are present, specific for
faecal or wastewater pollution, at least as resistant as pathogens to water treatment and disinfection processes, preferably
non-pathogenic, and detectable by simple, rapid and inexpensive methods.




                                                                                            APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   83
At the time the report of this research was written, 13 000 L of final treated wastewater had been filtered for detection of
viruses. Sample volumes were 10 L at the early stages of the research and later 100 L. No viruses had been detected, implying
that the treated wastewater was well within the most stringent virological quality limits recommended for direct reclaimed
drinking-water in the existing international literature.

Clostridium perfringens was found to be a useful indicator, being highly specific for faecal pollution and detection by
relatively practical methods within 24 hours.

Assessment of chlorination indicated that viruses and coliphages tended to be more resistant to combined chlorine than
bacteria, while bacteria tended to be more resistant to free chlorine residuals than viruses and coliphages. This implied
that bacteria such as coliforms were reliable indicators of the inactivation of viruses by free chlorine residuals as applied
in the reclamation plants. It was concluded that the combined effect of the various process units in the multiple-barrier
reclamation system conformed to the most stringent requirements for microbiological safety of directly reclaimed drinking-
water, including the capability of reducing viral counts by 12 log units.

The following criteria were recommended for direct potable drinking-water: absence of viruses from 10 L, heterotrophic
plate count ≤100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, and absence of total coliforms, acid-fast bacteria, P. aeruginosa and
coliphages from 100 ml samples after at least two process units in the treatment train. The bacterial and coliphage tests had
the advantage that, if required for any reason, their sensitivity could easily be increased by testing larger volumes of water. In
view of these findings, the following guidelines were recommended for routine water quality surveillance of an established
multiple-barrier treatment system of proven efficiency such as the Windhoek reclamation plant:
     • In 95% of samples collected daily after at least two treatment stages, a heterotrophic plate count of ≤100/ml, total
       coliforms and coliphages should be absent from 100 ml samples.
     • At least one disinfection process should consistently conform to the following or equivalent specification: a free
       chlorine residual of 1–2 mg/L for retention time of one to two hours at a pH of less than 8.0 and a turbidity of less
       than 1.0 NTU.

It was established that, if drinking-water was disinfected with chlorine with a concentration of 1 mg/L free chlorine residual
at a pH <8 and turbidity <1.0 NTU with a one-hour contact time, the water complied with all microbiological criteria. The
major weakness of the disinfection process was that under certain conditions, organohalogen by-products were formed.
The reduction of these organohalogen by-products became a major research focus in the following years.

Ultimately, final water quality guidelines were defined for the Mark VI plant (Table CS1.2). This table only contains the main
operational test parameters. Other parameters of concern, such as heavy metals, aromatics or pesticides, were specified
according to the Rand Water (1994) or USEPA (1996) guidelines.

CS1.5 Incident management
CS1.5.1 Protocols
The private management agreement with the Windhoek Goreangab Operating Company, specifies the attainment and
maintenance of ISO 9001 certification and hazard analysis and critical control points protocols.

The operations protocol supported by ISO and hazard analysis and critical control points protocols, prescribes the recording of
all incidents. A fully described system of responses is defined and maintained by the operator. The company is audited annually
by ISO to ensure compliance. A monthly management report is given to the City of Windhoek to evaluate the operations and
financial claims. A risk assessment carried out over the full plant to evaluate the adequacy of the different barriers and critical
control points (CCPs) for the removal bacteria, viruses and protozoa resulted in recommendations for an upgrade. During the
annual research meetings, attended by senior researchers and design experts from the city and the operator parent companies,
monitoring reports and research reports are discussed and recommendations made for plant upgrades or improvements.




                                                                                                                   APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   85
CS1.5.2 Experiences
In the early 1990s, a virus breakthrough was recorded. Between 1994 and 1999, breakthrough of Giardia and Cryptosporidium
cysts and oocysts were recorded. In both instances, the acceptable guideline but not the maximum allowable limit was
breached. Changes in the treatment and operations were instituted after the incidents.

Two main problems that have manifested themselves in Windhoek, are rising TDS and bromate formation. It has long been
accepted that some form of desalination would have to be pursued in order to deal with TDS, and if RO were introduced,
it would also resolve the bromate problem. However, Windhoek is in an inland area without any flowing rivers, access to
the ocean or major saline aquifers to dispose of brine.


CS1.6 Public outreach
CS1.6.1 Stakeholder engagement
Piloting of the reclamation process ran from the early 1960s until the Goreangab plant was inaugurated in 1969. Gauging
by newspaper reports at the time, the public of Windhoek and especially school groups, were encouraged to visit the pilot
plant to witness the process. At the time, a structured programme of public engagement was not followed, (at least not
reported on), but the public was represented by the national health and medical fraternity, as is evident from publications.

A liaison committee, formed around 1962, coordinated research, implementation and operation of the first reclamation plant.
A steering committee was formed in 1973, taking over the mandate of the liaison committee. The committees comprised
engineers, health officials from state and local government, scientists, and researchers from the Windhoek Municipality,
NIWR, the Water Research Commission, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Water Affairs, the South African Institute for
Medical Research and South African universities.

The monthly publication Scientiae (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, 1967) reported that: “Extensive tests
have proven that the drinking-water produced by the pilot plant is completely safe for human consumption. For instance,
the Poliomelitus Research Foundation has affirmed the efficiency of the process for removing pathogenic organisms from
the treated wastewater. Under the supervision of some of its research staff, cultures of polio virus and an entero-virus were
introduced into the water flowing through the pilot plant at levels considerably higher than those anticipated in practice.
Examination of the purified water revealed that these viruses had been completely eliminated.”

Free information sharing of this type in the public domain has always been regarded as important and the process has been
conducted in a transparent and open way.

In subsequent years, reclamation in Windhoek had always been highly publicized in scientific journals and on national
and international platforms. The City of Windhoek, through its own publications and all available media platforms, has
always given high levels of visibility to the fact that Windhoek has been and remains a pioneer in DPR. In recognition of
these efforts, the 9th IWA International Water Reuse Conference (October 2013) was awarded to the City of Windhoek.
Over the years, numerous local and overseas students have participated in research work and scholars and students have
been encouraged during vacations to participate in projects to familiarize themselves with the operation and quality control
of the reuse scheme. As part of the private management agreement, the private operator has to engage in social projects
and an annual budget is allocated for this initiative.

The reclamation plant has been and remains a flagship project of the city and country; local and international visitors and
experts, governmental and foreign mission personnel are regular visitors. Local and international students engage in scientific
and social research work on potable reuse. The Goreangab plant is on the fixed list of venues for Ministry of Education
programmes for schools and tertiary education institutions in which scholars are encouraged to engage in programmes
on water and reclamation. There is specific budgetary provision that caters for the support of student and scholar projects.
The media are invited on regular occasions to publish about the plant. A programme is in place to investigate all public
complaints free of charge. Formal feedback is given in every case. Such complaints are evaluated and are part of the annual
improvement programme.


86     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
CS1.7 Governance
During the first part of the planning, piloting, design and operation the City of Windhoek, Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, Department of Water Affairs, Department of Health and Medical Research and universities were partners. Engineers
and scientists visited American institutions involved in potable reuse. The local regional health officer had the authority
to undertake surprise inspections and sampling and close the plant down if not complying with the guidelines. A steering
committee met once or twice annually to review all records and monitoring programmes and to recommend changes.

After Independence from South Africa in 1990, the Department of Water Affairs was restructured, where water supply was
placed in a state owned enterprise, NamWater. The Department of Water Affairs retained the regulatory function. As formal
support from South African governmental institutions was discontinued, the City of Windhoek took over all responsibility for
the reclamation process. In order to maintain objectivity, local and international specialists in various disciplines were invited to
steering committee meetings that were held every five years. They also assisted with the design of the new plant. The National
Chief Forensic Officer was part of the steering committee and represented the public. Verification monitoring had to be done
by at least three independent laboratories that did routine and specialist analysis, of which one always had to be accredited.

In terms of the private management agreement, the private operator is in full operational control of the plant, including
process and quality management. The City of Windhoek buys the treated water from the operator at a tariff that is controlled
through an open book system with a pre-determined fixed profit margin. The tariffs paid are directly linked to meeting all
intermediate and final water quality requirements.

The operator takes all quality control samples, which are analysed by the city’s laboratory and a protocol exists to deal with
quality disputes. The plant is also installed with a high number of online monitoring instrumentation and all operational
and quality information is stored on SCADA, which is open for access by the city.


CS1.8 Conclusions
The City of Windhoek has practised DPR for 45 years and it is fully accepted by consumers. The lack of natural water
resources was the driver for DPR and experience has shown that it has been successful. There has been no need to reconsider
the wisdom of the decision to regard treated wastewater as a safe and reliable source for the production of drinking-water.
In the event of the proposed future implementation of advanced treatment at the Gammams WWTP, the city will have to
reconsider the current limit of 35% treated wastewater in the blend. New guidelines being developed in South Africa might
influence the proposed future process, but in Windhoek, DPR has been in the past and will remain in future, an integral
and indispensable part of water supply.

CS2 Groundwater Replenishment System in Orange County, California,
    United States of America
CS2.1 Introduction: Overview and background
The Groundwater Replenishment System is the world’s largest advanced water purification system for potable reuse.
Launched in 2008, it currently produces 347 MLD of water, with plans to expand to a total production of 492 MLD. In
addition, it provides a water supply that is produced using half the energy required to pump water from Northern California
– saving enough energy to power 30 000 homes each year.

An IPR project, the Groundwater Replenishment System uses a three-step advanced water treatment process consisting of
MF, RO and AOP (UV/H2O2) (Figure CS2.1) to purify secondary-treated wastewater that otherwise would be discharged
into the Pacific Ocean. The treatment train produces high-quality water that exceeds all state and federal drinking-water
standards. After post-treatment stabilization, some of this water is injected into a seawater barrier and the remainder
(approximately two thirds) is pumped to recharge basins, where it naturally percolates into the Orange County Groundwater
Basin.

The Groundwater Replenishment System is operated jointly by the OCWD and OCSD of Fountain Valley, California.

CS2.1.1 Potable reuse to achieve sustainable groundwater supplies
The OCWD was created in 1933 by the State of California’s Legislature to protect its rights to water from the Santa Ana
River and to manage the Orange County groundwater basin, which currently provides 75% of the potable water supply to
2.4 million people in northern and central Orange County.9 The third most populated county in California, Orange County’s
population is still on the rise: the north and central regions are projected to grow by more than 300 000 people by 2035.
The need for clean, reliable water will grow as well.




9
    The Orange County groundwater basin contains approximately 500 000 acre-feet (162.9 billion US gallons; 616.7 GL) of usable storage water and covers 270 square miles
    (699.3 square kilometres).



88          POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
The challenge is that Orange County is located in a semi-arid region of California that receives only about 14 inches (355
mm) of rainfall per year. Local surface water flows from the Santa Ana River traditionally have been used to refill the Orange
County groundwater basin, but have dramatically declined in recent years, making it more difficult to provide a sustainable
source of local groundwater.
Because of recurrent droughts and the variability of the water supply in the region, the OCWD Board of Directors made
the decision to turn to reused water as the primary source of supply for the groundwater basin. Reused water gives OCWD
the water supply reliability its groundwater basin needs for continued sustainability.


CS2.1.2 How the Groundwater Replenishment System works: Management, resources and capabilities
The planning, design and construction of the project spanned 11 years, from the initial concept to the start of operations in
January 2008. The first of two planned phased expansions was completed in 2015. Specifics on management and resources
include:
     • Ownership and management: The Groundwater Replenishment System advanced water treatment facility (see
       Figure CS2.1) and its associated distribution, recharge and injection facilities are owned and operated by OCWD.
       The wastewater collection and treatment facilities that supply secondary treated wastewater to the Groundwater
       Replenishment System are owned and operated by OCSD, including those for the treatment and disposal of residuals
       from the system. A series of joint exercise of powers agreements between OCWD and OCSD have governed the
       cooperative development, financing, construction, operations and maintenance of the scheme. Both OCWD and
       OCSD shared the initial cost of construction (US$ 481 million).
     • Source of water: The system purifies secondary treated wastewater produced by OCSD’s reclamation plant no. 1.
       Approximately 75% of the feedwater for the system is supplied via activated sludge facilities operating in a nitrification-
       partial denitrification mode. The remaining 25% is supplied via trickling filters.
     • Production and capacity: The system originally had a production capacity of 70 MGD (265 MLD), which is enough
       water for 850 000 people, as part of the phased expansion plan. Ultimate capacity is projected to be 130 MGD (492
       MLD) after the advanced water treatment facility is expanded further and additional wastewater flows are rerouted
       from ocean discharge for reuse. Since its inception, the scheme has produced more than 155 billion gallons (587 GL)
       of water. To purchase that same amount in imported water supplies from Northern California or the Colorado River
       would have cost US$ 318 million.


CS2.2 Approach: Establishment of the potable reuse scheme for the Groundwater
     Replenishment System
CS2.2.1 Interagency collaboration
Both OCWD and OCSD have had a long history of collaboration preceding the Groundwater Replenishment System. The
neighbouring utilities initially developed their reuse partnership over 40 years ago with a project called Water Factory
21, which produced treated recycled water for direct injection into coastal wells, forming a barrier to protect the Orange
County groundwater basin from seawater intrusion. Initial planning for Water Factory 21 began in the mid-1960s, and the
project came online in 1976.

The treatment process for Water Factory 21 consisted of lime clarification, recarbonation, chlorination, and multimedia
filtration, followed by parallel trains of GAC and RO, with the combined product blended with deep well water prior to
injection.

By the early 1990s, it had become evident that additional recycled water was needed for the OCWD seawater intrusion
barrier. Furthermore, advancements in treatment technology and process control allowed for more efficient recycled water
purification processes. At the same time, OCSD was facing the prospect of having to build an additional ocean outfall to
contend with increasing wastewater flows and to avoid damage to its existing ocean outfall during peak flow events. It was
the confluence of OCWD and OCSD interests in the mid-1990s that set the groundwork for partnering together on the
Groundwater Replenishment System.




                                                                                           APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   89
CS2.2.2 Pilot testing to determine the treatment train
Pilot testing for the scheme was instigated by the need to increase the amount of recycled water being produced by Water
Factory 21 from 15 MGD (57 MLD) to 35 MGD (133 MLD). Before OCWD expanded Water Factory 21, it was decided to
pilot test newer technologies to optimize treatment plant performance.

The OCWD is located directly adjacent to OCSD, which treats domestic and industrial wastewater. During pilot testing,
OCSD approached OCWD with the suggestion of doubling the size of the new facility to 70 MGD (265 MLD) so that OCSD’s
high-flow events during winter storms also could be treated and either reused or discharged to the Santa Ana River. Doing
so would eliminate the need for OCSD to build a second ocean outfall.

The two agencies agreed to jointly build an expanded facility that would provide 70 MGD (265 MLD) of highly purified
recycled water for OCWD’s seawater barrier and direct recharge into the groundwater basin. The project was named the
Groundwater Replenishment System. Pilot- and demonstration-scale testing was completed from 1997 to 1999, with the
results being incorporated into the full-scale project design.

During the project development phase and based on pilot testing, the advanced treatment train was determined to consist
of the following technologies:
     • microfiltration (to remove bacteria, suspended solids and protozoa);
     • reverse osmosis (to remove dissolved minerals, viruses and pharmaceuticals); and
     • advanced oxidation process (UV) (to provide disinfection and remove low-weight molecular organics, primarily
       aimed at 1,4-dioxane and NDMA).


CS2.2.3 Phased expansions to produce 130 MGD (492 MLD)
Through sound planning and investment, two expansions were planned from the start of the project to keep costs to a
minimum. In fact, a significant portion of the expansion infrastructure was already built into the system when it first came
online in 2008.

After nearly eight years of successful operation, the initial expansion came online in 2015 to provide an additional 30 MGD
(113 MLD) of reliable water for Orange County. The expansion included:
     • 10 new MF cells (bringing the total to 36);
     • six new 5-MGD RO units;
     • four new UV trains (bringing the total to 13); and
     • two 7.5-MG storage tanks to store the overflow of secondary-treated wastewater during daytime peak hours to be
       processed during the low-flow hours at night.

The benefits of the US$ 142 million initial expansion include:
    • increases total output to 100 MGD (379 MLD) at a typical average cost of US$ 520 per acre-foot (US$ 0.42 per kL);
    • decreases Orange County’s dependence on costly imported water;
    • uses half the energy required to move imported water and one third the energy to desalinate seawater;
    • provides reliability in a region plagued by cyclical droughts; and
    • protects the environment by decreasing the amount of wastewater discharged to the Pacific Ocean and by reusing a
      precious resource.

In addition, new energy recovery devices will help capture the 3.5 to 4.0 bar loss experienced during the RO process and
will, in turn, reduce the amount of energy being used during RO. The new energy recovery devices act as turbochargers and
hydraulic pressure boosters, recovering the energy in the concentrate stream and delivering it back to the high-pressure RO
feed pumps. They also allow for flux balancing across the three individual RO stages, permitting better operational control.




90     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Further expansion is under way to provide a total production of 130 MGD (492 MLD), and the Groundwater Replenishment
System will continue to invest in projects that create long-term water reliability for the region.


CS2.3 Control measures
CS2.3.1 Orange County Sanitation District source control programme
Source control for the system is provided by OCSD. The purpose of the source control programme is to manage the quality
of raw wastewater received by OCSD, thereby ensuring pollutants and chemicals of public health concern are not discharged
to local sewers in quantities that would compromise the quality of water produced via unacceptable interference or pass
through of the wastewater and advanced water treatment processes. Both industrial and non-industrial discharges are
regulated and permitted.

The source control programme follows State of California regulations for groundwater recharge reuse projects and includes
the following:
     • Assessing the fate of state-specified contaminants through the wastewater and advanced water treatment processes.
     • Chemical and contaminant source investigations and monitoring focused on state-specified chemicals.
     • Outreach programmes to industrial, commercial, and residential communities to manage and minimize the discharge
       of contaminants at the source.
     • Current inventory of chemicals and contaminants (including new chemicals resulting from new sources or changes
       to existing sources) that may be discharged into the wastewater collection system.


CS2.3.2 Treatment strategy: Multiple barriers
The Groundwater Replenishment System employs the multiple-barrier approach to protect public health from acute health
risks associated with exposure to pathogenic microorganisms, as well as acute and chronic health risks associated with
chemicals.
     • Pathogens: The MF + chloramine process has been credited with a 4-log reduction for Giardia and Cryptosporidium,
       as well as 1-log reduction for viruses. The RO and AOP (UV/H2O2) systems have been granted 2-log and 6-log
       reduction, respectively, for these pathogens.
     • Chemicals: The control of chemical risk begins with the source control programme administered by OCSD. The RO
       system, featuring modern thin film composite polyamide membranes, is a robust chemical barrier, effectively removing
       a broad range of both inorganic and organic chemicals. The AOP (UV/H2O2) system provides a supplementary barrier
       to address low molecular weight, uncharged trace organic compounds that are not completely removed by RO.


CS2.3.3 Advanced treatment process validation
The validation of the advanced treatment processes (i.e. MF, RO, AOP [UV/H2O2]) for the scheme has occurred at different
times using a variety of approaches:
    • Microfiltration: The pathogenic microorganism removals for the MF process have been previously validated through
      a combination of manufacturer testing and documentation of on-site performance for the indigenous removal of
      Giardia, Cryptosporidium and coliphages (as a surrogate for viruses).
    • Reverse osmosis: The bulk feed and permeate from the RO system are continuously monitored for TOC and electrical
      conductivity using online analysers (the real-time TOC removal across the RO process is consistently in excess of 2
      log, providing a validation of the RO pathogen removal credits). RO performance has been validated further using
      indigenous coliphages monitoring, with monthly bulk RO permeate analysis via USEPA methods 1601 and 1602,
      resulting in no quantifiable detections over the first eight years of operations.
    • Advanced oxidation process (ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide): The UV system was validated for pathogen log
      reduction using an MS2 coliphage seeding study conducted in 2004 at a 5 MGD facility operated during the
      interim period between the end of Water Factory 21 operations and the onset of Groundwater Replenishment
      System operations. Additional validation for NDMA and 1,4-dioxane removal were conducted during the start-up
      commissioning of the new facility in late 2007.




                                                                                      APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   91
CS2.3.4 Environmental buffer: Orange County groundwater basin
The Orange County groundwater basin aquifer system acts as the storage and transport system and the environmental
buffer for the Groundwater Replenishment System. There have been indications of at least temporary mobilization of some
contaminants in the aquifer from the highly treated water addition, however, these have become stabilized by:
     • dilution/blending;
     • time to respond to potential treatment plant upsets resulting in the recharge/injection of off-spec water; and
     • additional treatment.

The regulations for groundwater replenishment with recycled water adopted by the State of California require a minimum of
two months of subsurface response retention time within the aquifer prior to extraction for potable use. The Groundwater
Replenishment System has been approved for a response retention time of three months, and also receives a 3-log virus
reduction credit for subsurface retention (1-log reduction per month). Typically, the actual subsurface travel time between
the points of recharge/injection and extraction is in the order of many years.


CS2.4 Water quality monitoring
CS2.4.1 Operational monitoring
The primary measure of the performance of the treatment plant is based on water quality, including:
    • Turbidity: Used as bulk surrogate for suspended solids, turbidity is monitored continuously using online
      instrumentation across the MF and RO processes to help confirm membrane integrity.
    • Total organic carbon: Used as bulk surrogate, TOC monitoring is required to document the effective removal of
      organics of wastewater origin.
    • Total nitrogen: Monitoring is required to demonstrate total nitrogen control, given the prevalence of nitrogen species
      in wastewater.
    • Total dissolved solids: TDS is used as a bulk surrogate to demonstrate the effective control and removal of inorganic
      species, especially salts. Nearly all TDS removal at the Groundwater Replenishment System occurs during the RO
      process, with removal regularly exceeding 95%. Laboratory testing of TDS is supplemented with continuous online
      measurement of conductivity in the feed and permeate flows of each individual RO unit.
    • N-Nitrosodimethylamine: NDMA is the primary chemical target of the UV component of the AOP/UV system,
      which was originally designed for 1.2-log reduction of NDMA via UV photolysis.

These parameters provide an indication of overall treatment plant performance, especially regarding the RO and AOP
processes. Many of the water quality requirements go beyond those for primary and secondary drinking-water standards.
Critical water quality requirements defined in the operating permit include:
     • Turbidity (in RO permeate, less than 0.2 NTU more than 95% of the time in any 24-hour period; and less than 0.5
       NTU at any time).
     • Total organic carbon (in final product water, less than 0.5 mg/L in recycled water over a 20-sample running average,
       with samples collected at least weekly).
     • Total nitrogen (in final product water, less than 5 mg/L, based on twice weekly monitoring).
     • N-Nitrosodimethylamine (in final product water, no formal permit limit, but OCWD maintains a voluntary goal of
       less than 10 ng/L).

The treatment plant also removes CECs. Formal monitoring requirements for CECs in potable reuse projects have been
adopted by the State of California (SWRCB, 2013), and additional future regulations are possible. The CECs most often
found in wastewater include:
    • pharmaceuticals (e.g. acetaminophen, ibuprofen, caffeine, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, primidone, and
      sulfamethoxazole);
    • flame retardants (e.g. tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate); and
    • pesticides (e.g. DEET, diuron and triclosan).




92     POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
None of these chemicals, nor any other CECs tested, are detected in measurable concentrations in the advanced treated
water after AOP/UV.


CS2.4.2 Verification
The OCWD must submit quarterly and annual reports to the regional board, documenting treatment plant performance,
monitoring results, and compliance with permit limits and conditions. Regional board staff also perform periodic
unscheduled on-site inspections and audits of the facilities.

One condition of the regional board permit is the establishment and regular meeting of an expert peer review panel (referred
to as the Groundwater Replenishment System Independent Advisory Panel) to provide regular review of operations and
water quality (see also Section CS2.6). The panel is administered by the NWRI, a non-profit research organization based in
Southern California that specializes in organizing and managing expert panels to address complex projects, policies and
technologies in the water industry. Members of the panel include experts in the fields of toxicology, chemistry, microbiology,
epidemiology, hydrogeology, public health, engineering and environmental protection.

Since its establishment in 2004, the full panel has met annually (with smaller subcommittee meetings on specific topics
held between annual meetings) during the design, start-up and regular operation of the system. Regulators and other
interested parties are invited to attend these meetings. The product of each meeting is a report containing findings and
recommendations of the panel that are transmitted to OCWD, OCSD, regulators and other interested stakeholders.


CS2.5 Incident management: Response plan and critical control points
It is intended that the Groundwater Replenishment System will always operate on the condition that it causes no impairment
to the groundwater basin. The OCWD’s goal is to produce the highest recycled water quality for groundwater recharge in
compliance with the regional board permit.

The primary safeguard is that it is not absolutely necessary to operate the Groundwater Replenishment System for the
production of purified recycled water 100% of the time. Under any emergency condition, the production of purified
recycled water can be suspended until the problem is corrected; under wastewater current flows, the OCSD outfall system
can discharge all non-reclaimed wastewater. Recycled water produced by the Groundwater Replenishment System also can
be diverted and returned to OCSD for discharge to the ocean. If a plant outage did occur for an extended period of time,
then alternate potable supplies are available to supply the seawater intrusion barrier.

Both OCWD and OCSD have developed a joint agency response plan to respond to unexpected water quality results in
feedwater or product water that cause an exceedance of the permit limit or otherwise indicate a significant reduction in
water quality. The response plan sets coordinated actions for multiple departments (e.g. laboratory, process engineers,
permitting specialists, field inspectors) across both agencies to determine the source of the water quality problem and take
appropriate actions.

Furthermore, the CCP for the Groundwater Replenishment System RO permeate TOC is continuously measured and
compared with both the historical average and the 0.5 mg/L regional board permit limit. In the event of a sustained increase
in TOC above the historical norm, a series of investigatory actions are first undertaken to discern the reason for the elevated
trend (e.g. an increase in RO feed TOC, membrane integrity issues), as well to test for the specific organic constituent(s)
responsible. Should TOC reach a level where a violation of the 20-sample running average permit limit of 0.5 mg/L is
imminent, then the facility would be shut down. These protocols are included in the operations optimization plan, which
describes operations, maintenance, monitoring and associated analytical methods, including the use of CCPs. The operation
optimization plan is a requirement of the Groundwater Replenishment System permit and associated regulations.




                                                                                         APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   93
CS2.6 Public outreach and stakeholder engagement
Outreach to the public and stakeholders has been a priority since the beginning of the project. Early on, OCWD and OCSD
formed a joint steering committee to develop policies and make decisions regarding the planning and implementation of
the system. At its first meeting in March 1997, the joint steering committee identified public outreach as a high priority.
The decision to make public outreach a priority at the beginning of the project was one of the keys to the success. The
comprehensive public outreach and education programme for the Groundwater Replenishment System is described in
detail in Appendix 4.


CS2.7 Governance
The Groundwater Replenishment System operates under a permit originally approved by the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region (Regional Board) 2004 and issued to OCWD, with subsequent amendments in
2008 and 2014. The original basis for the permit was the draft groundwater replenishment (GWR) regulations for indirect
potable reuse developed by the State of California,10 which included requirements for treatment, blending, underground
retention time, monitoring control of pathogens, and the control of regulated and unregulated chemicals.

Because the regulations were in draft format at the time and had not been formally adopted by the California Department
of Public Health,11 OCWD worked closely with the Department of Public Health early on in the project to develop criteria
for what chemical and microbial water quality constituents would be tested and the required detection limits. The discharge
permit was then obtained from the Regional Board, which would consult with the California Department of Public Health
to develop the specific requirements.

In response, OCWD engaged an independent advisory panel (Section CS2.4.2) to assist OCWD and the Department of
Public Health in the development of the permit conditions. The activities of the panel assisted in developing the conditions
for the permit and were instrumental in removing some of the regulatory hurdles that could have prevented the system
from being implemented in a timely manner.

Staff from the Department of Public Health reviewed the project during a formal public hearing held in 2003, resulting
in “findings of fact and conditions” that were incorporated into the Regional Board permit. Based on the permit, the final
product water must meet State of California primary drinking-water standards (which are equivalent to or more stringent
than the federal standards set by the USEPA) during required quarterly testing. In addition, quarterly monitoring is required
for unregulated chemicals, with more frequent monitoring required for total coliform bacteria, TOC and total nitrogen.
The State of California later established requirements for monitoring CECs for recycled water recharge/injection projects
via the State Water Resources Control Board’s 2013 Amendment to the 2009 Recycled Water Policy.


CS2.8 Conclusions and lessons learned
      • Establish the need for potable reuse: OCWD had been practising potable reuse for nearly 40 years, but needed to
        expand its efforts to provide a sustainable source of water for the groundwater basin.
      • Develop health-based targets: Health-based targets for the discharge permit were developed by the State of California
        with the advice of an independent advisory panel organized by NWRI.
      • Establish plans to ensure water safety: Both an operation optimization plan and CCPs (i.e. continuous online TOC
        and turbidity testing) were developed.
      • Build credibility through input from independent experts: The NWRI independent advisory panel has met
        annually in person since 2004, with a number of smaller subcommittee meetings in between to provide expert review
        of operations and water quality during the pre-design, start-up and implementation of the project.




10
   Regulations for groundwater replenishment using IPR were finalized and formally adopted by the State of California on 18 July 2014, under “Title 22, Division 4, Chapter
   3: Water Recycling Criteria” of the California Code of Regulations.
11
   As of 1 July 2014, the Drinking-water Program of the California Department of Public Health was officially transferred to the California State Water Resources Control
   Board and renamed the Division of Drinking-water.

    • Work closely with regulators: At the time the Groundwater Replenishment System was implemented, final
      groundwater recharge regulations were not available; however, groundwater regulations now exist for IPR through
      the Division of Drinking-water of the State Water Resources Control Board.
    • Garner public acceptance early and proactively: OCWD implemented a robust public outreach campaign early in
      the project, which resulted in no active opposition. Outreach was a key to the system’s success.
    • Overall conclusion: Potable reuse is necessary to ensure water supply reliability in areas around the world that lack
      adequate water resources.

CS3 Upper Occoquan Service Authority potable reuse project in Virginia,
    United States of America
CS3.1 Introduction
The Occoquan Reservoir is a critical component of the raw water supply for approximately 1.5 million residents of northern
Virginia, a highly urbanized region located on the southwestern periphery of the USA national capital, Washington, DC.
Treated wastewater directed to the reservoir represents a significant supplement to the potable water supply yield. The
project has operated successfully for nearly four decades.

In 1950, a low head dam was constructed on the Occoquan River to serve local water supply needs. In 1957 the low head
dam was replaced with a larger dam which created the Occoquan Reservoir. By 1967 ownership of the system passed to
the Fairfax County Water Authority (now Fairfax Water), which continues to operate the system, including the Occoquan
Reservoir, the dam and outlet works, and the drinking-water treatment facilities.

At the time of the large dam completion, the full pool storage was estimated to be 37 million m3 (37 GL), with a safe water
supply yield of approximately 189 300 m3/d (189.3 MLD).

In the 1960s, a transformation began that changed the watershed from largely rural-agricultural in character to one
of predominantly urban/suburban uses. Unprecedented growth in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington DC,
was accompanied by major expansions of residential and commercial development which extended into the Occoquan
Watershed, and began to impact reservoir water quality (Robbins, 1993).


CS3.1.1 Principal drivers for water reuse
Concern over degradation of reservoir water quality led to a series of scientific studies to determine causes, and to
develop plans to restore and provide for future protection of the water supply. Urban development had already resulted



96      POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
in unplanned indirect potable reuse, and 11 small conventional WWTPs were discharging to reservoir tributaries.
Coupled with the effects of agricultural runoff and increasing urban drainage, poorly treated wastewater threatened the
viability of the Occoquan Reservoir for public water supply. Typical water quality problems included frequent and intense
summer blooms of cyanobacteria, dissolved oxygen depletion and subsequent generation of sulfide during thermal
stratification, and periodic fish kills. Increased costs were incurred in water treatment due to the presence of algal mats
in raw water. In addition, algae-related taste and odours required treatment with powdered activated carbon. Increased
formation of DBPs also occurred. Finally, studies reported enteric viruses in the reservoir, indicating contamination from
wastewater discharges (Robbins, 1979).

Several solutions were proposed, including a conventional approach to treat the wastewater centrally but ultimately export it
outside the watershed. It was concluded that the net loss of water from the watershed would reduce system resilience during
times of drought. A DPR option was considered, in which wastewater would be treated centrally at a (then) state-of-the-art
facility, and pumped directly to the downstream drinking-water treatment plant for additional treatment and distribution.
Although the option would have preserved the treated wastewater for use within the region, it was opposed by public health
officials and received little public support. Another alternative was IPR, where watershed wastewaters would be treated
centrally using the highest performance technologies then available, and subsequently released to a direct tributary of the
Occoquan Reservoir to supplement the raw water supply.

After extensive review, the Virginia State Water Control Board, in consultation with the Virginia Department of Health,
adopted an IPR solution to protect the drinking-water supply and to supplement its yield. The Policy for Wastewater
Treatment and Water Quality Management in the Occoquan Watershed, more commonly known as the “Occoquan Policy”
(SWCB, 1971), mandated a new framework for planned potable reuse. The decision resulted in the first full-scale planned
use of treated wastewater for the purpose of supplementing a surface water supply in the USA. The Occoquan Policy also
established treated wastewater treatment standards that had never been previously achieved by a water reclamation facility.

After nearly four decades of successful operation, the project is seen globally as a pioneering effort in potable reuse. Although
major advances in treatment technology have occurred in the ensuing years, the early application of innovative physical-
chemical-biological treatment processes of the day has stood the test of time. The in-basin solution for the Occoquan
Watershed validated the foresight and vision of early decision-makers, including local governments, water reclamation and
water treatment agencies, and state and federal regulators.


CS3.2 Approach: Establishment of potable reuse
Fairfax Water was already in existence at the adoption of the Occoquan Policy (Fairfax Water, 1975), and provided finished
drinking-water from the Occoquan Reservoir. The Occoquan Policy also mandated the creation of the UOSA, to provide
for collection and reclamation of wastewater; and the OWMP, to continuously monitor the watershed and reservoir with a
view to providing independent water quality assessments and advice on protective measures for the water supply.

In the 1970s UOSA began the design of the new regional reclamation system, and the OWMP began baseline monitoring
in the watershed. In mid-1978, UOSA started up the water reclamation plant (WRP), initially producing about 18 900 m3/d
(18.9 MLD) of treated wastewater. The water quality of the Occoquan Reservoir rapidly exhibited dramatic improvements.

Although the plant was originally constructed with a water reclamation capacity of 56 800 m3/d (56.8 MLD), discharges
were restricted until monitoring results clearly showed the desired improvements in reservoir water quality. By 1985,
watershed growth resulted in an expansion to 85 200 m3/d (85.2 MLD). It was also clear that continued growth, coupled
with confidence in the reuse project, would result in demand for much greater expansion (Robbins, 1993).

Modelling results led to the unanticipated finding that contributions of high-quality treated wastewater would be necessary
to offset anticipated increases in pollution from nonpoint sources and urban runoff. Further, it was concluded that
importing wastewater for treatment at the UOSA plant would be desirable to offset future water quality impacts of non-
point pollution from urban stormwater (Chen & Gomez, 1988). After a decade of operation, the initial solution proposed
to export wastewater from the basin had been supplanted by a recommendation to import wastewater into the watershed


                                                                                          APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   97
for reclamation by UOSA to not only further supplement yield, but to also enhance water quality.
After several expansions, in 2004 the UOSA WRP had a capacity up to 204 400 m3/d (204.4 MLD), with an anticipated
buildout capacity of 246 000 m3/d (246 MLD).


CS.3.3 Control measures for wastewater reclamation and water treatment
The original project and subsequent expansions have all viewed the UOSA WRP within the context of the multiple-barrier
approach to protect the Occoquan drinking-water supply. Within the watershed, practices include wastewater source control
and collection, water reclamation, local storage, environmental buffers and storage, raw water abstraction and treatment,
and management of potable water distribution.

In addition to the conventional and advanced water reclamation processes, the system incorporated a range of reliability
features. Retention basins at pump stations and at the WRP provide storage for high flow conditions, as well as for
emergencies and planned maintenance. All major mechanical and electrical components have at least one backup unit on
ready standby. Electric power is fed from two independent grid sources, and on-site power generation is available to power
the entire plant. Pump stations have similar redundancies, including backup power features. All plant processes and the
collection system are monitored by a computerized supervisory control system, and most pump station and plant processes
are automatically controlled by the computer network (Asano et al, 2007).

An aerial view of the plant is shown below. The process flow diagram for the facility is shown in Figure CS3.1. At the present
time, major treatment processes include (Angelotti, 1995; Angelotti et al, 2005):
    • conventional preliminary and primary treatment;
    • advanced secondary treatment including BNR capabilities;
    • high pH lime clarification for phosphorus and metal removal and virus inactivation;
    • two-stage recarbonation with intermediate settling for metal and hardness removal;
    • multimedia filtration for turbidity, suspended solids and protozoan cyst removal;
    • deep GAC beds for additional filtration and removal of trace organics;
    • free chlorine disinfection for additional pathogen destruction; and
    • dechlorination.

Source: UOSA, USA.                                                                            reuse




Except some changes in nitrogen management strategies to meet water quality management objectives in the Occoquan
Reservoir and ultimately, the Chesapeake Bay, the basic UOSA WRP process configuration is largely unchanged since the
design concept was developed in the mid-1970s. The biological-physical-chemical process train included elements that
were well known in both water treatment and wastewater treatment operations at the time, but had not been integrated
into a full-scale single reclamation facility.

Product water is discharged to a 681 400 m3 (681.4 ML) impoundment on the plant site prior to release into a tributary of
Bull Run Creek, which flows on directly to the Occoquan Reservoir. The on-site reservoir is the first of the natural barriers
of the system, and provides a mixing volume to mediate any short-term variability in the product water.

The Occoquan Reservoir is a run of the river impoundment, and as a result, has high seasonable variability in residence
time, which is further affected by the significant withdrawals for drinking-water production. The average residence time
is less than 30 days, but storm flows, and the combined effects of drought and pool drawdown, can produce very large
departures from that value. For example, 2 cm of runoff over the watershed area would result in a complete replacement of
the reservoir volume (Virginia Tech, 1994).

In 2006, existing treatment facilities using the Occoquan source were replaced by the Frederick P Griffith Jr drinking-water
treatment plant. The new plant represented a major upgrade in both treatment technology and included the following
processes:
     • raw water screening and pumping
     • enhanced metal salt coagulation, flocculation and settling
     • ozonation
     • deep bed BAC filtration
     • chloramination.

The new facility was designed to take advantage of the enhanced yield of the Occoquan system resulting from treated
wastewater contributions. Currently, the drinking-water plant has a treatment capacity of 454 000 m3/day (454 MLD).


CS3.4 Water quality monitoring
The product water from the UOSA WRP must meet performance standards set by the Virginia Department of Environmental
Quality, which are summarized in Table CS3.1, along with typical performance values for the plant.




                                                                                                                                                                APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES                                99
In addition to laboratory analyses required to assess plant performance, continuous analysers are used to provide additional
process information. Filters are equipped with turbidimeters to ensure that particle removal is consistent with good protozoan
cyst removal. Residual analysers and flowmeters are installed at chlorine contact basins to verify that contact times and
chlorine concentrations are adequate for pathogen kill or inactivation (USEPA, 2012a).

Annual acute and chronic bioassays are conducted to verify that the product water has no observed effect on target organisms.
Annual testing is also performed to confirm that product water meets the latest requirements of the USEPA national
primary and secondary drinking-water standards. Periodic evaluations are also performed to determine if pharmaceuticals
and personal care products or other compounds of interest are present at levels of concern in the treated wastewater. More
than 300 trace organic compounds are assayed in both the product water and Occoquan Reservoir tributaries. Over 90%
of the recorded results in the product water are non-detects. The WRP product water consistently meets conventional
drinking-water standards except seasonally for TDS and nitrate. Recent evaluations have also shown that the quality of
the WRP product water with respect to trace organic compounds is consistent with proposed criteria for DPR (WRRF &
NWRI, 2013), supporting the conclusion that no significant risk to public health is imposed by the UOSA contribution
(Angelotti et al, 2014).

In association with the OWMP, a sophisticated, complexly linked watershed and reservoir computer model has been
developed which may be used to predict water quality changes resulting from future changes in land use, character or
quantity of treated wastewater flows, or watershed hydrology (Xu et al, 2007). The modelling system is being adapted to
aid in managing the water supply system under anticipated climate change scenarios.

CS3.4.1 Independent assessment (auditing)
A significant requirement of the Occoquan Policy (SWCB, 1971) was to establish a water quality monitoring programme
independent of both the water reclamation agency and the drinking-water provider. Because of the need to evaluate
water reclamation performance within the context of other watershed activities (e.g. agriculture and urban land uses),
the OWMP operates and maintains a network of nine stream monitoring stations, 14 recording rain gauges, and eight
reservoir monitoring stations. The OWMP also provides an independent review of UOSA facility performance and acts
as a source of independent information and analysis for all watershed stakeholders. Local programmes to manage urban
stormwater pollution were developed well in advance of regulatory requirements in order to protect the investment in high
performance water reclamation.




100        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
CS3.5 Public outreach
When the water reclamation programme was first proposed, public meetings and hearings were conducted to explain the
project, and to provide an opportunity for community feedback. Following start-up of the WRP, UOSA has maintained
an active, tour-based, educational programme to explain the potable reuse strategy. Likewise, Fairfax Water maintains an
active programme of community outreach and provides tours and other educational activities to engage with the public.
Both agencies, along with the OWMP, maintain publicly accessible websites to provide relevant information.

On occasion, issues have arisen that resulted in a need for technical advisory groups, citizen action committees, and other
specialized task forces. These have been variously composed of agency stakeholders, local government officials, community
representatives, water experts and interested citizens (Ruetten, 2004). Examples of issues addressed include: reducing the
zoning density of certain subwatersheds to protect water quality; siting of a major semiconductor fabrication facility within
the WRP service area; and proposals for consumptive uses of treated wastewater for cooling water at a proposed power
generation facility. The last proposal (consumptive use) prompted significant debate about the potential loss of treated
wastewater flow into the drinking-water supply.


CS3.6 Governance
Both Fairfax Water and UOSA are independent public service authorities, and are governed by appointed boards of directors,
who are representatives of their community constituencies.

The OWMP has an oversight committee comprised of members from the USEPA, Virginia Department of Conservation
and Recreation, Virginia Department of Health, an academic expert from a state university in Virginia and an external
consultant. The OWMP oversight committee meets annually to review watershed water quality data, as well as water
reclamation and drinking-water plant operations. The committee maintains an advisory function to the Virginia Department
of Environmental Quality, which is the permitting agency for the WRP.

Because of the importance of the treated wastewater in protecting source water quality and enhancing yield, an operational
framework has evolved that is based on close collaboration among five principal agencies:
    • Upper Occoquan Service Authority: Wastewater Reclamation Authority
    • Fairfax Water: Potable Water Production Authority
    • The Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Program: Independent Assessment Entity
    • The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality: Water Reclamation Regulator
    • The Virginia Department of Health: Drinking-water Regulator.

Each entity has a defined role in the implementation of the Occoquan potable reuse programme. Basic regulation is provided
by the Departments of Environmental Quality and Health, and in accordance with federal requirements. The treatment
authorities, UOSA and Fairfax Water, are responsible for planning, operating and maintaining treatment systems that meet
regulatory requirements, and the independent assessment entity provides process performance oversight and water quality
assessment. Although each entity has its own institutionally defined role, each is also engaged in the overall objective of
protecting and enhancing the Occoquan Reservoir as a raw water supply for the region.


CS3.7 Conclusions
UOSA provides reliable, high-quality treated wastewater to the Occoquan Reservoir, and Fairfax Water relies on that
contribution as a key component of its water supply plan. The UOSA flows are of particular importance during drought
conditions. On average, the treated wastewater represents approximately 9% of the annual average inflows to the reservoir,
but during periods of drought, the contribution may exceed 90%. During such periods, pool drawdowns substantially
shorten the reservoir residence time.




                                                                                       APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   101
The Occoquan IPR programme has been in successful operation for nearly four decades. In the 1960s, it was widely accepted
that the unplanned IPR was a key problem in the historical degradation of the water supply, and had already resulted in a
temporary sewer connection ban in the watershed pending development of a long-term management plan.

The proposal to address the problem with a technically sound planned potable reuse project was readily understood (Ruetten,
2004), and although water quality was a major driver, it was also recognized that directing treated wastewater flows to the
reservoir would be a significant asset for future water supply needs (WEF & AWWA, 2008).

Because of the substantial improvements to the quality of the raw water supply, public opposition was much lower than has
been historically experienced with other potable reuse proposals. There was, however, widespread local concern about the
cost implications for ratepayers, although that has become less prevalent over the decades of successful programme operation.

102    POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
CS4 Water reuse in Singapore – NEWater
CS4.1 Overview and background
Singapore is land scarce and highly urbanized. With about 5.6 million people living on an area spanning just 719 km2
(Department of Statistics, Singapore), there is limited land available for collection and storage of rainwater. Thus, despite
the 2400 mm of rain that it receives annually, Singapore has to depend on diverse water sources to meet its demand of
1.95 million m3/day (1.95 GL/day) (PUB, 2016).

Known as the “four national taps”, these water sources comprise water from local catchment areas; imported water from
Johor, Malaysia; high-grade treated wastewater meeting drinking-water standards, referred to as NEWater; and desalinated
water. The PUB manages the integrated supply system, as well as all other aspects of the water loop, including water demand
management, watershed management and the collection and treatment of sewage, which is termed “used water”.


CS4.2 Approach: Establishment of potable reuse
In 1974, the first water reclamation pilot plant was built to evaluate various technologies for water reuse, including RO, but
this was found to be too costly (Tan et al, 2012). The PUB and what was then the Ministry of the Environment continued
to monitor the technology trends for improvements in reliability and cost-effectiveness. In 1998, two engineers were sent
to the USA to evaluate water reuse projects such as the OCWD (Water Factory 21) and Upper Occoquan Sewage Authority.
Upon finding the water reuse processes viable, a team was formed to pilot test its application in Singapore’s context (Tan
et al, 2012).

The Singapore water reclamation study (NEWater study) was conceptualized in 1998 to determine the suitability of using
treated wastewater for planned IPR (PUB, 2002). A two-year study from 2000 to 2002 was carried out that comprised the
following three main components:
     • 10 000 m3/day (10 MLD) demonstration plant utilizing MF, RO and UV to produce NEWater;
     • sampling and monitoring programme to assess water quality; and
     • health effects testing programme to determine the long-term safety of NEWater.

A panel of local and foreign experts was appointed by the PUB/Ministry of Environment to provide independent advice on
the study and evaluate its findings. In 2002, the panel concluded that NEWater was safe for potable use and recommended
using the IPR approach to provide an environmental buffer which allowed the NEWater to re-naturalize and trace minerals
to be reintroduced, by blending with reservoir water (PUB, 2002).

The first two NEWater plants, in Bedok and Kranji, were commissioned in early 2003, supplying 72 000 m3/day (72 MLD).
Today, the supply capacity of 760 000 m3/day (760 MLD) from four plants can meet up to 40% of Singapore’s total water
demand (PUB, 2017). The two newer plants, located at WRPs in Ulu Pandan and Changi, were developed under the design-
build-own-operate model, where a private company supplies water to PUB, subject to a stringent set of quality standards.

From its earliest days, NEWater has been supplied mainly for direct non-potable use by water-intensive industries such
as wafer fabrication plants and petrochemical industries, as well as in cooling towers of commercial and public buildings.
This frees up potable water for domestic consumption. A small amount of NEWater is injected into water reservoirs and
supplied for IPR. Usually, IPR constitutes about 2–3% of water demand but this can be increased substantially to more than
10% when larger quantities of NEWater are injected to supplement reservoir supply during dry spells.

NEWater is supplied through a dedicated pipeline network. The network began as separate clusters where pipelines were laid
from each NEWater plant to specific groups of water-intensive industries, while supplying other non-domestic users (such as
commercial buildings) along the way. Off-takes were laid to the nearest water reservoir in each cluster for IPR. In 2012, an
island-wide transmission system was completed, linking the four NEWater plants and various supply clusters. This improved
supply reliability and allowed for greater flexibility in managing NEWater supply for both direct non-potable use and IPR.




                                                                                        APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   103
CS4.3 Control measures from source to tap
A system of multiple barriers, comprising source control and treatment, coupled with engineered storage, environmental
buffers and online monitoring is in place to safeguard the quality of NEWater for IPR.


CS4.3.1 Source control
While most of the used water collected is from municipal sources, industries also discharge used water into the sewers,
posing a greater risk to the quality of used water for NEWater production. PUB manages this through a multi-pronged
approach as illustrated below.

Legislative power is an important lever but the key to effective management of used water quality lies in having a
comprehensive understanding of the catchment profile, which can only be achieved through continual engagement of
industries and close monitoring of used water quality throughout the sewer network.

PUB relies on online VOC sensors located at strategic points in the network to provide early warnings of illegal discharges
of VOCs, such as when an industry discharges cleaning agents, used oils or solvents into the sewers. Although infrequent,
such incidents require prompt intervention as most VOCs cannot be effectively removed by the NEWater process. They could
affect water quality and have potentially harmful effects on human health. This early warning allows the WRP downstream
to divert affected treated wastewater away from NEWater production. In addition to VOC sensors, a compact microbial
electrochemical sensor has been successfully developed, after field testing, for online monitoring of used water toxicity. It
has been installed at five factories to further optimize performance.


CS4.3.2 Treatment
Used water undergoes treatment in the WRPs. Primary clarification is followed by secondary treatment, which includes the
ASP and final clarification. The WRPs are critical in providing a consistent supply of good quality wastewater, which not
only leads to good NEWater quality, but also helps to minimize fouling of the membranes used for NEWater production.




104        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
At the NEWater plant, treated wastewater undergoes MF or UF followed by RO and finally UV disinfection. Furthermore,
the pipe and valve configuration allows the permeate from each RO train to be recycled back to the RO feed tank, achieving
different levels of dilution as required to maintain product water quality during instances of usually high salt content in the
source water. Table CS4.1 summarizes the treatment processes involved in NEWater production from used water.
PUB is installing MBRs as part of WRP upgrading. For future expansions of NEWater production, MBR filtrate will be
fed directly to the RO process for NEWater production. The MBR-RO process has been pilot tested and found to be more
robust in handling shock loadings and discharges, while producing better quality NEWater (Tao et al, 2006).

                                                             membrane integrity



CS4.3.3 Storage and conveyance
The NEWater plant design includes a product water storage tank with a minimum nine-hour retention capacity. This provides
adequate response retention time in the event of contamination or a disruption in the treatment process. Water quality in
the tank is continuously monitored online.

Due to its low alkalinity, NEWater is conveyed to non-domestic customers and reservoir injection points in pipes that are
lined with high density polyethylene. The pipeline network includes a system of service reservoirs which further increases
the response retention time. Subsequently, NEWater is stabilized with lime allowing other pipes, like cement lined ductile
iron pipes, to be used.


CS4.3.4 Environmental buffer and blending
NEWater is channelled into reservoirs where it is mixed with rainwater and undergoes further treatment at a water works
before being supplied to households. The reservoir serves as an environmental buffer, providing a long retention time
through its large volume, and allowing for natural attenuation.


CS4.4 Water quality monitoring: Ensuring the quality of NEWater
The system of multiple barriers is complemented by strict operational control and a comprehensive water quality monitoring
programme to ensure that NEWater meets quality standards at all times. This is verified during regular quality audits.


CS4.4.1 Operational control
Operational control based on real-time water quality data is critical to safeguarding NEWater quality. Continuous online
monitoring is achieved with the use of surrogate parameters, which are indicative of water quality and treatment efficacy.
Plant operators monitor the trends of these parameters and take appropriate actions to maintain water quality close to the
baseline performance of the plant, which is more stringent than drinking-water standards. Table CS4.2 shows the parameters
that are typically monitored online at various points in the treatment process.




                                                                                                          APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   105

Online monitoring of ammonia and turbidity levels in the treated wastewater offers a good indication of the conditions of
the WRP treatment processes and quality of feed-stock to the NEWater plant. Total chlorine is monitored at various points
along the treatment train to assess the effectiveness of chloramination in controlling membrane biofouling. Total chlorine
in the product water is also monitored to ensure that a consistent level of residual chlorine is present in NEWater before
distribution for IPR and direct non-potable use.

Total organic carbon is critically monitored, as it is sensitive to any breach in RO membrane integrity and source water
contamination by VOCs. This is measured from the RO permeate and after the product water storage tank. The TOC in
NEWater is typically below 100 μg/L. The operators promptly investigate any rapid increase in the TOC trend as it could
indicate source water contamination. It is thus an effective surrogate parameter to ensure that NEWater meets drinking-
water standards, which is verified after laboratory testing. Laboratory testing is useful for verification but not for operational
control as analysis requires time (up to a month for some parameters).

Conductivity is the other critical online parameter used for operational control as it is indicative of the TDS in the treated
wastewater and product water. If unusually high conductivity is detected in the treated wastewater, the RO permeate can
be recycled back to the RO feed tank to dilute the feedwater and maintain the quality of the product water. Conductivity is
also measured before and after the RO system to determine the membrane salt rejection rate, which is a useful indicator of
membrane effectiveness in removing contaminants. A sudden increase in conductivity may indicate a drop in salt rejection,
suggesting that the RO membranes could have been damaged and require immediate replacement. A gradual drop in salt
rejection over time is indicative of membrane ageing. Scheduled replacement of membranes is carried out.

To verify the accuracy of online instruments, operators collect water samples and perform laboratory analysis once every
eight-hour shift, three times daily. Instruments are serviced if there are significant deviations (more than 5%) between the
laboratory results and online readings.


CS4.4.2 Water quality monitoring programme
In addition to online quality parameters, a comprehensive sampling and monitoring programme is in place to track NEWater
quality over time and ensure its suitability for IPR. The programme covers various sampling points in the entire water
supply chain and is reviewed and updated regularly to keep track of new findings on CECs. To date, more than 330 physical,
microbial, chemical and radiological parameters are monitored under the sampling and monitoring programme. The trends
of the various parameters measured are monitored closely and deviations from baselines are investigated and rectified.




106    POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
Over the past 16 years, more than 140 000 tests have been conducted on NEWater by PUB’s International Organization for
Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 17025 accredited laboratory and all the test results are well
within the respective drinking-water guidelines/standards established by Singapore’s National Environment Agency, USEPA
and WHO. Some examples of the parameters tested are shown in Annex CS4.1.

Both the water quality data from laboratory tests and online monitoring are aggregated in an integrated water management
system equipped with six-sigma process improvement tools and a web-based interface to facilitate analysis and reporting.
The system alerts operators and managers if water quality deviates significantly from baseline performance.


CS4.4.3 Surveillance and audit
The National Environment Agency (2008) regulates drinking-water quality in Singapore according to its Environmental
Public Health (Quality of Piped Drinking-water) Regulations 2008. In addition, NEWater quality is benchmarked against
the following standards:
     • PUB internal operational control limits;
     • USEPA (2014) National Primary Drinking-water Regulations; and
     • WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2017a).

Water quality data, operation and maintenance of plants and staff competence are audited by an internal audit panel and
an independent external audit panel. Each panel convenes twice yearly. The internal audit panel focuses on operational
details such as water quality data integrity, adherence to standard operating procedures and maintenance schedules and
plant staffing needs. The external audit panel comprises local and overseas experts. It examines the overall sampling and
monitoring programme, plant operations and major new projects, and recommends improvements after considering best
practices and emerging concerns for drinking-water.


CS4.5 Incident management
In the event that the NEWater produced does not meet required quality specifications, the incident management approach
is built on the main objectives to:
     • safeguard the quality of water in the product water storage tank;
     • restore production; and
     • investigate and eliminate source of contamination.

For example, in the event of a continuous rise in TOC trend, the critical steps involved are as follows:
     • reverse osmosis permeate sent to waste stream while monitoring TOC trend. Plant shut down if rising trend persist;
     • water samples collected for laboratory analysis to identify contaminant;
     • source control team investigates likely dischargers;
     • feed tanks drained down and replenished with fresh treated wastewater; and
     • NEWater production restored when TOC level subsides.

The NEWater plant operators and source control teams work closely to restore NEWater quality, usually within several
hours. The PUB management is kept informed at critical junctures (e.g. plant shut down, restoration of supply).

CS4.6 Public outreach and stakeholder engagement: Building confidence
Besides having a robust system in place to ensure the quality of NEWater, public confidence in NEWater for IPR was essential for
its implementation to be successful. Learning from the experience of other utilities, Singapore set out to design a comprehensive
education and engagement programme that would gain public trust and acceptance. It was open and transparent in addressing
all the possible health, safety and quality concerns. As part of public outreach a NEWater Visitor Centre integrated with the
treatment plant was established in 2004. Public outreach is discussed in further detail in Appendix A4.1.

CS4.6.1 Assessment and technology demonstration of water safety before implementation
The two-year Singapore water reclamation study (NEWater study) (Section CS4.2), with a 10 000 m3/day (10 MLD)
demonstration plant, allowed the PUB to assess the water reuse technology in Singapore’s environment and fine tune its
application. The quality of NEWater produced was comprehensively tested and monitored for compliance with drinking-
water standards. Under the Health Effects Testing Programme, NEWater was tested for short- and long-term toxic and
carcinogenic effects on mice and fish, as well as estrogenic effects on fish, and found to have no effect (Tan et al, 2008).
The assessments were carried out in collaboration with the National Toxicology Programme and Experimental Pathology
Laboratories in the USA. The results were evaluated by an independent panel of experts, which concluded that NEWater
was safe for potable use. This gave the study greater credibility and provided a solid foundation on which to build the public
education and engagement programme.


CS4.7 Conclusions
Over the past 16 years, NEWater has grown from a demonstration-scale project to a sustainable water source able to meet
40% of Singapore’s water needs today and projected to meet up to 55% of water needs by 2060 (PUB, 2016). It has helped
Singapore to overcome its land constraints for catchment and storage, and increased its resilience against climate change.
IPR has been successfully practised since 2003 and public confidence in NEWater quality remains high owing to continual
public engagement and a strong track record of reliable and constantly high-quality water supply. This can be attributed
not only to a good technical solution, but more importantly to sound governance, strict operating procedures executed by
technically competent, well trained and experienced operators, a comprehensive water quality monitoring programme, and
a system of independent audits to offer further assurance.

CS5 Perth, Australia, groundwater replenishment
CS5.1 Overview and background
The city of Perth has been experiencing the effects of a drying climate with significantly reduced rainfall. Current average
rainfall is 840 mm, with an average rainfall decline of over 30% since the early 1990s. This has had a significant impact
on stream flows, as well as surface and groundwater reserves. A 12% decline in rainfall since 1990 has resulted in a 50%
reduction in stream flows into Perth’s reservoirs. The situation has resulted in a review of the long-term feasibility of
traditional drinking-water sources; a detailed research into water usage; investigations into additional groundwater reserves;
and consideration of alternative supply options, including the first major desalination plant completed in 2006 and IPR
through GWR. The Water Corporation, the major drinking-water provider in Western Australia, has developed a multiple
portfolio of options to drought-proof Perth through its “Water forever” planning process (Water Corporation, 2009).

In 2004, the Water Corporation identified GWR as a potential water source for Perth and in 2005 the Environmental
Protection Authority provided strategic advice on GWR recommending that a trial be undertaken in an area of low risk
to human health and the environment (EPA, 2005). Based on this advice, the Water Corporation performed a three-year
feasibility study and subsequently commenced a three-year GWR trial at its Beenyup WWTP site at Craigie, in Perth’s
northern suburbs.

Groundwater replenishment is an integral component of the Water Corporation’s 50-year plan to secure water supplies
for Perth (Water Corporation, 2009). The aim of GWR is to enhance secondary treatment of wastewater with advanced
processes to produce recycled water which meets Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (NHMRC-NRMMC, 2011) prior
to being recharged to an aquifer for storage and later use as a drinking-water source.

A three-year feasibility study (2005–2008) was conducted to determine the viability of augmenting drinking-water supplies
through GWR using membrane filtration treatment (MF and RO). A research project “Characterising treated wastewater
for drinking purposes following reverse osmosis treatment” was led by the Department of Health in partnership with
regulatory agencies, universities and industry (Buynder et al, 2009). During the study period, secondary wastewater from the
three largest Perth metropolitan WWTPs (Beenyup, Subiaco and Woodman Point) and recycled water from two advanced
WWTPs were analysed (namely, Kwinana water reclamation plant and Beenyup pilot plant).

The feasibility study demonstrated that the advanced treatment using MF and RO was adequate to protect public health and
the study provided valuable information for the selection of pathogen and chemical indicators for monitoring the GWR
scheme (see Section CS5.4).

After completion of the feasibility study, a three-year GWR trial (2010–2012) was conducted. The trial involved an advanced
water recycling plant (AWRP), further treating up to 5 MLD of secondary-treated wastewater from the Beenyup WWTP
using UF, RO and UV disinfection. The water was then recharged into the confined Leederville aquifer at a depth of 120
to 220 m. During the trial, a total of 2533 ML of recycled water was recharged. Water quality was monitored throughout
the treatment process and via 22 groundwater monitoring bores located at the Beenyup site (Water Corporation, 2013).

After successful completion of the trial, construction for the full-scale GWR scheme started in October 2014 and commenced
operation in 2016. The full-scale plant will initially be able to recharge 14 GL/year with capacity to be expanded to 28 GL/
year. On average, Perth uses about 270 billion L of potable water a year and up to 20% of Perth’s drinking-water needs could
be supplied by GWR by 2060.

The scheme is owned and operated by the Water Corporation of Western Australia, a publicly owned water utility. The
estimated cost of the full-scale GWR is Australian $ 124.6 million.

CS5.2 Approach: Establishment of potable reuse scheme
The scheme will accept wastewater from the Beenyup wastewater catchment in the northern suburbs of Perth with a total
inflow of approximately 135 MLD. The majority of wastewater collected in the wastewater catchment is sourced from
households. Trade waste and process wastewater from industrial and commercial customers represents approximately
2.4% by volume of the wastewater flow. By load, trade waste represents about 20% of biochemical oxygen demand, 5% of
suspended solids, 25% of oil and grease, 3% of nitrogen, 2% of phosphorus and 3% of dissolved salts. The largest industrial
and commercial customers are food producers and laundries, but most trade waste is from small commercial businesses.
There are three significant hospitals and a number of smaller facilities that discharge wastewater into the catchment. The
medical facilities’ wastewater undergoes pre-treatment where appropriate and substances incompatible with the Beenyup
system are not accepted.

A comprehensive characterization of the secondary-treated wastewater completed during the feasibility study included testing
for almost 400 chemicals, including pesticides, metals, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, endocrine disruptors and
persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins, furans and PCBs among others. The majority of chemicals analysed were detected
in the secondary wastewater, with some chemical groups, including metals, DBPs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
detected at concentrations above health-based values. Concentrations of radioactive material at the Beenyup WWTP secondary
wastewater were below the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines screening levels of gross alpha and beta radioactivity while
microbiological parameters tested (E. coli, enterococci, coliphages and adenoviruses) were always detectable. Advanced
treatment using UF and RO was able to reduce microbial and chemicals constituents to levels below health significance.

The scheme will be managed through a risk management plan (equivalent to a WSP) as described in the Australian Guidelines
for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2006–2009). The 12 elements of the wastewater quality framework cover
fundamental issues such as system identification, risk assessment, operational procedures, maintenance, monitoring, and
incident and emergency management, and extend to formalizing supporting requirements such as policy development,
employee training, community involvement and research and development.


                                                                                                                                   APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES             111
CS5.3 Control measures
The treatment systems for the GWR scheme will include the Beenyup WWTP, the AWRP and four recharge bores which
recharge approximately 45 MLD of recycled water into the Leederville and Yarragadee aquifers. Groundwater will then be
abstracted and treated before distribution through the Perth Integrated Water Distribution System.

Multiple treatment processes are used in series to minimize the impact that failure or poor performance of a single treatment
process has on the overall ability to meet health and environmental water quality requirements.

The GWR scheme utilizes the following preventative measures to produce recycled water (Figure CS5.1):
    • wastewater catchment management;
    • Beenyup WWTP (primary and secondary treatment);
    • advanced water recycling plant (UF, RO, UV treatment);
    • storage (storage/buffer tank); and
    • aquifer storage.


CS5.3.1 Wastewater catchment management
The proportion of trade waste in the inflow to the Beenyup WWTP is low. However, the following process and procedures
are implemented to mitigate any potential risk in the wastewater catchment:
     • Specification of trade waste acceptance criteria: The trade waste acceptance criteria specify the wastewater quality
       that is allowed into the sewerage system. The criteria preclude amounts of substances which might interfere with
       wastewater collection, treatment, reuse or discharge to the environment. The acceptance criteria include alarm limits
       for loading of substances (by mass), including biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids and nutrients.
     • Permitting (or registering) of commercial and industrial waste customers: All businesses require a permit to
       discharge trade waste to allow discharge into the sewerage system. The wastewater from each business is characterized
       and risks assessed against the end-points relevant to the catchment. Permits specify the allowable waste that may be
       discharged and conditions of discharge, such as pre-treatment and reporting requirements.
     • Response plans for large customers: Permits of large customers or high-risk customers contain requirements for
       real-time notification to the Water Corporation (commercial and industrial services) of process or pre-treatment
       failures which may impact on the quality of the wastewater that is being discharged.
     • Surveillance monitoring of customers with high load discharges or potential quality concern: These customers are
       subject to ongoing surveillance programmes, which involve unannounced compliance inspections, and a programme
       to characterize loadings using automatic samplers to collect flow-weighted composite samples. The frequency of
       compliance inspections is determined from a risk ranking model which considers the size and nature of each business
       and the type of pre-treatment used. The frequency of composite sampling is determined by the size and variability of
       the loading. Loadings from some large customers are determined via self-monitoring to Water Corporation protocols.
     • Response plans for unusual discharges: A procedure exists for responses to unusual discharges recorded in the
       wastewater collection system or at WWTPs.


CS5.3.2 Beenyup WWTP
The Beenyup secondary WWTP incorporates the following treatment steps:
    • screens and grit removal;
    • primary sedimentation; and
    • secondary treatment incorporating biological nutrients via pipeline to an ocean outfall. Part of the discharge from
      the plant (approximately 67 MLD) is supplied as feedwater for the AWRP.


CS5.3.3 Advanced water recycling plant
The AWRP will accept flows from the Beenyup WWTP and then treat the water as follows:
    • turbidity monitoring and ammonia. High turbidity flows are diverted from the AWRP to the ocean outfall;

    • 2.8 ML storage tanks (one-hour storage) to allow for continued operation of the AWRP should turbidity or ammonia
      of feedwater exceed acceptance criteria for short periods;
    • dosing with preformed monochloramine;
    • fine strainers remove particles;
    • microfiltration;
    • reverse osmosis (25% of flow-reject water is discharged through the ocean outfall);
    • ultraviolet disinfection;
    • sodium hydroxide dosing to increase the pH;
    • 1 ML storage tank to buffer flows (three-hour storage) before recharge; and
    • recharge bore network to pump recycled water into the Leederville and Yarragadee aquifers (45 MLD).

The benefit of GWR is that the aquifer provides a significant buffer between the recycled water and its future use as a
drinking-water source. Water is treated to drinking-water standards as required by the health regulators before injection
into the Leederville and/or Yarragadee aquifers to prevent contamination of Perth’s groundwater drinking-water source.

To ensure that adequate treatment is provided, the Department of Health requires a minimum treatment performance to
meet log reductions specified in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (NRMMC-EPHC-NHMRC, 2006–2009):
    • 8.1 log for Campylobacter (bacteria);
    • 9.5 log for adenovirus and rotavirus combination (enteric viruses); and
    • 8 log for Cryptosporidium (protozoa and helminths).

The full treatment train and the equivalent log reduction credits for both the Beenyup WWTP and the AWRP are presented
in Table CS5.1

CS5.4 Water quality monitoring
Monitoring of the scheme is based on operational and verification monitoring. Operational monitoring is used to determine
if each preventative measure is effectively controlling hazards, and provides advance warning if treatment barriers are moving
away from a stable operational state. Online parameters for the Beenyup AWRP are presented in Table CS5.2.

Operational monitoring of the AWRP includes:
    • Continuous online monitoring of the CCPs and many process control points. Any breach of an alert limit will produce
      an alarm to notify operators that manual intervention may be required or that an automated response has occurred.
      Breach of a violation limit will trigger an automatic diversion of recycled water or a shutdown of the AWRP to ensure
      that non-compliant water does not proceed to the next treatment barrier or is not recharged into the Leederville and/
      or Yarragadee aquifers.
    • Observational monitoring undertaken by the GWR process coordinators to check systems prior to taking corrective
      actions or a routine check of systems.

In addition to operational monitoring, verification monitoring through laboratory analysis is used to confirm that the
treated water quality is consistently achieving compliance with the Department of Health recycled water quality parameters.

During the feasibility study a subset of 18 recycled water quality indicators were identified to demonstrate likely compliance
with the much larger set of 292 water quality parameters measured to verify drinking-water quality (Table CS5.3). The
indicators were chosen to:
     • have characteristics linked to a predominant removal mechanism (e.g. filtration, adsorption or oxidation);
     • be present in concentrations representative of a broader class of compounds and that are sufficiently high to determine
       a meaningful degree of reduction through a unit process or a sequence of processes; and
     • be quantifiable using an established, and preferably accredited, analytical method.

The key physico-chemical properties that determine chemical rejection by MF/RO are size (molecular weight, width and
length), hydrophobicity (log Kow , log D), and acidic/basic character (pKa). Log Kow also provides information on polarity
(dipole moment) and solubility in water (associated with chemical charge). The recycled water quality indicators include
chemical groups with different:
     • molecular weights (ranged from 10.8 to 296 g/mol);
     • hydrophobicity properties (log Kow ranged from -0.64 to 3.4); and
     • acidic/basic characteristics (pKa ranged from 2.13 to 10.4).

Some of the indicator parameters were not consistently found in the secondary wastewater during the monitoring programme
but allow demonstration of the safety of the treated water with respect to specific chemical groups, and provide additional
confidence that all chemical hazards are being mitigated. MS2 coliphage was selected as the key microbial indicator to be
used to measure the effectiveness of the advanced water treatment plant to remove microorganisms.

The indicator parameters are monitored at a higher frequency than the full set of recycled water quality parameters.


CS5.4.1 Audits
A review of the effectiveness of the risk management plan for the GWR trial was undertaken annually by the Water
Corporation. The results demonstrated >90% compliance with the requirements of the Australian Guidelines for Water
Recycling risk management plan framework. An external audit by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu concluded that the systems
and processes used to manage the GWR trial were suitable to deliver a safe, reliable and sustainable drinking-water source
option that adequately protects human health and the environment (Water Corporation, 2013).




                                                                                                                    APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   115
CS5.5 Incident management
Any recycled water quality event as defined by the memorandum of understanding will trigger an incident as defined in the
GWR incident and emergency management plan. Any serious water quality event requires notification to the Department
of Health within 24 hours.

The Department of Environment Regulation licence requires the Water Corporation to notify the Department of
Environment Regulation within 24 hours if sample results indicate that recycled water exceeds a limit specified in the GWR
discharge licence.

For the GWR trial, the treatment process operated within CCP limits 99.93% of the time. There were three instances where
the CCPs did not meet specifications whilst recharge continued. These events did not pose a risk to the environment or
human health.


CS5.6 Public outreach
During the feasibility study and before commencement of the GWR trial numerous activities were undertaken to consult and
engage key stakeholders, including community groups. Stakeholder engagement has continued throughout implementation
of the GWR scheme working with key stakeholders and influencers of opinion to build credibility and trust (and therefore
third-party advocacy) and engaging with the broader community.

The community and stakeholder engagement strategy employed a two-step communication theory of informing opinion
leaders first and then continuing to inform the broader community. In order to build trust, the strategy was primarily
based on a face-to-face approach, rather than relying solely on mass communication methods. These activities were
supported by advertising, media relations, social media communication channels and other traditional public relations tools
where appropriate. A community advisory panel, representing various sectors of the community including public health,
environment, business and the interests of local residents, met regularly throughout the trial and they provided independent
advice regarding operations and community sentiment on GWR. In addition, a trial website page was created, including
regular water quality reports, and more than 11 000 people toured the plant site and visitor centre.

Presentations and briefings to over 160 health, environment and local government stakeholder groups, including local
councils and other decision-making authorities, local Aboriginal groups and community groups, occurred throughout
the GWR trial.

The GWR trial was positively received and publicly supported by all political groups with community support for GWR
remaining steady at between 70 and 76%.

By proactively engaging with stakeholders, the Water Corporation has been able to address any concerns, perceptions or
possible misconceptions about GWR. This approach has proven successful in minimizing time spent on reactive methods
to correct misinformation about GWR and reinstate trust. During the GWR trial, a stakeholder database was developed
and this will continue to be used during implementation of the GWR scheme.


CS5.7 Governance
The following regulatory authorities are key stakeholders in providing the regulatory and formal requirements of the GRW
scheme:
     • Department of Water
     • Department of Health
     • Department of Environment Regulation
     • Environmental Protection Authority.




116    POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
An interagency agreement between the Water Corporation and these regulatory agencies was executed in March 2007 to
develop policy and regulation for GWR and assess its feasibility as a sustainable water source.

An interagency working group was established to progress regulatory requirements. The working group developed the
trial’s regulatory framework, which defined the requirements for the ongoing regulation of GWR, using existing statutory
processes where possible, and following national guidelines to assess unique aspects (IAWG, 2008). Among gaps identified,
the minimum distance between the recharge zone and abstraction for drinking (known as the recharge management zones)
was later defined as 250 m for future GWR schemes at the Beenyup site. The GWR regulatory framework was signed by
all agencies in December 2012.

A memorandum of understanding between the Department of Health and the Water Corporation for the GWR trial was
established in July 2010, which formalized the relationship between the parties for the GWR trial (Department of Health &
Water Corporation, 2010). This describes the regulatory approval and operational requirements of the GWR trial, including
water quality and reporting requirements, notification of water quality events and communications protocols.


CS5.8    Conclusions, challenges and lessons learned
The GWR as a rainfall independent source of water for Perth has proven to be successful. A key aspect to the successful
implementation of the project was the early engagement of the community and the clear communications between

CS6 Direct potable water reuse in Texas, United States of America
CS6.1 Overview and background
The Permian Basin, like much of the western United States, has been subjected to an unprecedented period of drought.
While rains have recently provided some relief from the current drought in Texas, reservoir levels remain low in the basin;
and some reservoir yields have been shown to have declined. As a result, drinking-water providers have needed to consider
new water supply sources.

A summary is provided of two utilities that are looking to potable water reuse to augment their supplies.


CS6.2 Approach
As part of its mission statement “to protect our state’s public health and natural resources consistent with economic
development”, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulates public health and the environment in Texas,
including all aspects of wastewater treatment and disposal, and water supply and treatment. Faced with an urgent need
for additional water supplies in many parts of the state, the commission has been approving DPR projects on a case-by-
case basis in accordance with an innovative/alternative treatment clause in state regulations (30 TAC 290) that allows “any
treatment process that does not have specific design requirements” listed in that chapter to still be permitted on the basis of
a case-by-case review. The commission regulates DPR as a special type of raw water source mainly under existing drinking-
water regulations. This means water from DPR projects must meet all existing drinking-water quality requirements such
as USEPA maximum contaminant levels. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality also encourages monitoring
for unregulated constituents such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products.

Consistent with the starting point taken by others in determining regulatory requirements for potable reuse (CDPH, 2014;
Trussell et al, 2013), the commission requires that DPR systems demonstrate that they will achieve finished water quality
goals for enteric virus (2.2 × 10-7 MPN/L), Giardia (6.8 × 10-6 cysts/L) and Cryptosporidium (3.0 × 10-5 oocysts/L) (Table
CS6.1) (TWDB, 2015). The justification for these numbers is based upon meeting the 1 in 10 000 per capita risk of infection
(USEPA, 2006b; Regli et al, 1991), which is the governing paradigm underlying the Surface Water Treatment Rule and its
relevant amendments (USEPA, 2010).

    Pathogen                                        Concentration                   Reference
    Virusesa                                          2.2 × 10-7/L                  Regli et al (1991)
    Giardia                                        6.8 × 10-6 cysts/L               Regli et al (1991)
    Cryptosporidium                                3 × 10-5 oocysts/L               Haas et al (1996)
    Total coliformsb                                    1 CFU/L                     Trussell et al (2013)
a
    Acceptable concentration depends strongly on the virus selected, with rotavirus showing the lowest concentration of the viruses examined (2.2 × 10-7/L).
b
    Bacterial removal requirements based on Salmonella enterica which require 9-log reduction to achieve 10-5 risk level. Total coliform used as an indicator in place of S. enterica with assumption that
    9-log reduction would reduce levels from 109 CFU/L to 100 (1) CFU/L.



These finished water pathogen concentrations are too small to be directly measurable, so the LRV concept is applied to
DPR the same way it is applied under existing surface water treatment regulations. A similar approach has been adopted
by others (CDPH, 2014; Trussell et al, 2013). One difference adopted by the commission is that the starting point for LRV
treatment requirements is treated wastewater rather than raw wastewater. The baseline targets adopted (Table CS6.2) are
used in conjunction with a case-by-case evaluation of the pathogen loads in the specific wastewater that is to be used for
DPR to determine required LRVs (TWDB, 2015). This means that each DPR project in Texas is assigned individualized
treatment requirements and that these might change over time if warranted by ongoing monitoring programmes. This
regulatory approach has allowed the commission to adapt its approach to a number of different scenarios that have been
proposed by utilities across the state.

CS6.3 The Colorado River Municipal Water District
The Colorado River Municipal Water District (CRMWD) supplies water to its member cities of Big Spring, Snyder and
Odessa, as well as several customer cities, including Midland, San Angelo and Abilene. Most of the water supplied is raw
surface water from the three reservoirs that CRMWD has constructed on the Colorado River: JB Thomas, EV Spence and
OH Ivie. These sources are supplemented by groundwater reserves in the western portion of the CRMWD service area,
but additional supplies are expected to be needed to meet growing needs and to offset apparent losses in reservoir yields.

The district continues seeking new supplies and alternatives to continue providing a water supply to its member and
customer cities. A source of supplementary supply originates from the treated wastewater currently discharged by cities in
the CRMWD service area. This new supply and connection to the system is shown in Figure CS6.1.

The DPR project in Big Spring supplements the raw groundwater and surface water sources for up to five other public water
systems by introducing a purified treated wastewater as alternate raw source water. The advanced treatment plant is known as
the raw water production facility as it is creating a source with the same or better water quality than the natural surface water.
The water from the reclamation facility is blended with raw surface water and then treated further in conventional drinking-
water treatment plants before it is delivered to customers. The raw water production facility is permitted to provide up to
50% of the raw water piped to the various water treatment plants. The facility has been producing water since spring 2013.

This potable water reuse application is characterized as DPR, as there is no environmental buffer (surface water reservoir or
groundwater basin) that provides an extended amount of time between the treatment of the water and the use of the water.



                                                                                                          APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   119
CS6.3.1 Control measures: Treatment processes
The raw water production facility takes the treated wastewater from the city of Big Spring WWTP, treats it with MF
membranes, RO and AOP (UV/H2O2) before the product water is discharged into the raw water pipeline.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality assigned the log reduction values for each unit process based on the
methodology used for drinking-water facilities prescribed in the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule
(USEPA 2006a; 2010). Figure CS6.2 shows the treatment credits assigned to each unit for the CRMWD raw water production
facility. Expected performance of the listed technologies provides a water quality that meets the pathogen risk levels listed
in Table CS6.1.
      • Microfiltration: The MF supplier has completed the necessary third-party challenge study to show the log reductions
        of protozoa (Giardia and Cryptosporidium) that can be achieved. As prescribed in the USEPA Membrane Filtration
        Guidance Manual (USEPA, 2005), daily testing of the MF membranes, using a pressure decay test is used to validate
        the integrity of the MF membranes and the LRV credits.
      • Reverse osmosis: For this project, the RO membranes are not granted any pathogen removal credit.
      • Advanced oxidation process (ultraviolet): The commission provided 4-log virus credits and 8-log protozoa credits.
      • Downstream water treatment plants: The downstream surface water treatment plants, based on the USEPA Surface
        Water Treatment Rule (USEPA 2006a; 2010) must also achieve specified minimum virus and pathogen removal or
        inactivation levels; with 4-log virus credits and 3-log protozoa credits assigned for this project.

CS6.3.2 Water quality monitoring
The commission requires monitoring of the WWTP effluent, each of the unit process and the finished water of the raw water
production facility. The commission set monitoring levels at which actions must be taken, including diverting the WWTP
effluent from the entering the facility, turning off specific units or turning off the entire plant. Additionally, the Texas Water
Development Board and the WateReuse Research Foundation (WRRF) have funded an extensive analysis of water quality
through the facility’s treatment processes and a comparative analysis of the existing raw surface water supply. The results from
the ongoing study demonstrate that it produces a high-quality water that is protective of public health and easily surpasses
the existing raw water quality of the conventional raw surface water with which it is blended (Steinle-Darling et al, 2015).

CS6.4 The Laguna Madre Water District
The Laguna Madre Water District (LMWD) is located in Cameron County, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. The district provides
water and wastewater services to Port Isabel, South Padre Island, Laguna Heights, Long Island Village and Laguna Vista,
and has approximately 6200 customers. The LMWD, like many small communities, has one main water supply source, the
Rio Grande; with a water right from the Rio Grande of 7378 acre-feet per year, which is equivalent to 24.9 MLD. This right
is subject to curtailment during periods of drought. If the LMWD allotment was fully curtailed, the amount of water that
could be withdrawn would be only 5628 acre-feet (19 MLD), representing an increasing water shortage on current and
projected demands (Figure CS6.3).

Potable water reuse presents a cost-efficient option to provide a renewable and resilient potable water supply. As part of
detailed investigations, the LMWD drafted a plan to capture 1 MGD, equivalent to 3.79 MLD, of treated wastewater from
their Port Isabel WWTP, purify the water through advanced treatment, and feed that water to a storage reservoir and then to
the LMWD water treatment plant 2, as shown in Figure CS6.4. A second phase will add wastewater from the Laguna Vista
WWTP. The benefit of these projects is that the new water will meet projected demands while providing a more reliable
water supply with greater drought resilience (Figure CS6.5).

122        POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
CS6.4.1 Treatment alternatives
The treatment goals for the LMWD were based on the targets identified by NWRI (2013) and using the log reduction
value credit approach adopted for CRMWD. The analysis was expanded with an inclusion of CCP-based monitoring and
an engineered storage (Salveson et al, 2015). A range of technologies was considered in several configurations, including

trains 1 and 2 provide the necessary pathogen credits (based on goals from NWRI, 2013), salt removal, reduction of trace
pollutants (CECs) and nitrate, as well as all other conventionally regulated chemicals. Treatment train 3 falls short in two

CS6.4.2 Next steps for Laguna Madre Water District
The LMWD is now moving ahead with the design and upgrade of their secondary treatment process, which will provide
a high-quality feedwater for future potable reuse. Often improperly seen as a lower priority for potable reuse projects, a
high-quality secondary wastewater results in improved overall water quality and reduced operational expenses for advanced
treatment systems (NWRI, 2015).

After the secondary upgrades are complete, the LMWD will continue to track the drought and water supply conditions and
seek grant funding for a future potable water reuse project.

CS7 Water reuse in South Africa: The eMalahleni water reclamation plant
CS7.1 Overview and background
CS7.1.1 Drivers for potable reuse at eMalahleni, South Africa
South Africa is a semi-arid country and has suffered several severe droughts in the past few decades. The government has
a formal plan in place for implementing water reuse, but has yet to apply it on a national or regional level. This has led to
opportunities for the private sector to grow in the field of water reuse as well as aiding areas suffering from water shortages.

eMalahleni is an industrial town to the east of the Johannesburg-Pretoria metropole and is surrounded by coal producing
mines, steel manufacture and coal-fired power stations. The entire area is known for its numerous mining practices and
the adverse effect of AMD on local ground and surface water sources.

Anglo American is one of the mining companies that owns and operates numerous coal mines near eMalahleni. The town
has a population of approximately 510 000 people (2012) and receives most of its water from the Witbank Dam, with a
capacity of 104 000 ML. At least five mining operations are located in the catchment area, known as the Upper Olifants
River Catchment (Naidu, 2012).

The water security of the town was threatened not only by water shortages, but also low water quality due to high amounts
of dissolved metals and salts accumulating in the catchment. Anglo American decided to commission a state-of-the-art
advanced water treatment plant in order to treat the acid mine water that has been accumulating in the mines, which is
estimated to be over 100 GL, similar to the Witbank Dam (Naidu, 2012).


CS7.1.2 History and current status
The original plant, located at the Navigation coal processing plant of Landau colliery, only consisted of a lime neutralization
treatment step. The water quality was not well understood at the time, and after only a short period of operation (1994–1995),
the plant had to replace almost 70% of the steel piping and other equipment due to the acidity of the water (Gunther &
Mey, 2006).

After consulting the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the lime neutralization plant was modified and its
operation improved, now making use of limestone rather than lime. This resulted in a new challenge in the form of heavy
gypsum precipitation and scaling of the coal plant equipment and pipelines.

It was subsequently decided to consider various technologies capable of either metal removal or sulfate removal, or both.
After 10 years, several pilot studies were performed of these technologies until the final process configuration was identified.

The first phase of the plant was commissioned in 2007 with a capacity of 20 MLD (Hutton et al, 2009). The second phase of
the plant extended the capacity with 8–10 MLD intended for industrial use, and was completed in 2010 (Bhagwan, 2012).
In 2013, the plant was further upgraded in order to add a further 20 MLD to its capacity. This upgrade is currently being
commissioned and will result in a total capacity of 50 MLD.


CS7.1.3 Plant ownership
The development of the eMalahleni water reclamation plant, at a cost of Rand 296 million, was well beyond the capability of
the eMalahleni Municipality to fund (Bhagwan, 2012). The municipality therefore entered into a public-private partnership
agreement between themselves, Anglo American Thermal Coal and BHP Billiton (Bhagwan, 2012). The plant is owned by
Anglo American Thermal Coal. The plant was contracted under a design, build, operate and maintain contract, which is
currently with Aveng Water. The eMalahleni Municipality, in turn, buys the water supplied by the plant to the local water
distribution network.

CS7.2 Establishment of the potable reuse scheme
CS7.2.1 Feedwater source
The feed to the plant comes from four different mines, Greenside, Kleinkopje, South Witbank and Landau. These mines all
lie within the catchment area from which the eMalahleni Municipality abstracts water for the town. The catchment area
receives an average annual rainfall of 800 mm (Naidu, 2012). Combined, these mines have accumulated more than 100 GL
of AMD, which is a major environmental risk due to uncontrolled discharge. The water received from the four mines have
different qualities; therefore, a feedwater pond was constructed (two-day retention time) which receives all the feeds from
the mines before it is pumped to the plant (Hutton et al, 2009).


CS7.2.2 Stakeholders
The area surrounding the plant is well-known for its large number of mines and mining activities. Apart from the mines,
there are also many power stations in the area, responsible for generating approximately 70% of South Africa’s electricity.

The mine closure operations of BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa have been responsible for closing several defunct
collieries in the area surrounding eMalahleni. The company is responsible for the rehabilitation and sustainable closure of
selected mines, including the Witbank South colliery (located 4 km from eMalahleni) (Mey et al, 2008). After a groundwater
study by the Institute of Groundwater Studies indicated that the AMD entrapped in the Witbank South colliery would soon
have started to seep into surface water sources, a mitigation plan was needed (Mey et al, 2008).

Unlike most potable reuse projects that are motivated by water shortages, the plant was built with the primary aim of reducing
the amount of AMD in the mines, thus reducing the risk of contaminating the catchment area. The decision to produce
potable water from the AMD was only made since the technology applied for treating the AMD also produced water suitable
for potable reclamation. However, the availability of the new resource provided a response to threats to drinking-water
security due to the effects of climate change on available conventional water sources (Mey et al, 2008).

The plant, therefore, has stakeholders from both the mining industry and the water supply industry. The municipality and
inhabitants of eMalahleni all support this innovative use of advanced water treatment technology.


CS7.2.3 Assessment and technology demonstration before implementation
Since the initial water treatment process proved inadequate during 1994–1995, extensive pilot plant studies have been
conducted in the search for treatment technologies that can provide a cost-effective solution for treating the AMD. The
pilot plant studies started as early as 1994 and lasted up to 2006 and covered many technology suppliers as well as treatment
processes. A summary of the pilot studies that were performed can be seen in Table CS7.1.

Several factors were identified as being keys to success for performing 10 years piloting work (Gunther & Mey, 2006):
    • all the pilot plants were fully automatic
    • all the pilot plants were operated 24 hours a day
    • all the pilot plants had a capacity of at least 200 kL per day.

In 2004, the list of 13 heavy metal and sulfate removing technologies were reduced to a shortlist of seven technologies. The
technology suppliers were then asked to provide an estimate for treating AMD. The treatment process had the following
requirements and guarantees:
     • 10–20 MLD treatment capacity
     • full redundancy
     • water recovery >95%
     • engineering availability >95%
     • plant utilization >95%.

The technology suppliers were asked to provide the estimate assuming a water quality derived from historical data (the 95th
percentile of the worst AMD source) and capable of producing water of a very high quality (Table CS7.2).

In the end, there were two technologies that stood out, namely the biological sulfate removal process of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the high recovery precipitating RO membrane process. Despite having high
water recoveries, the cost of waste disposal was still significant and an additional waste disposal cost-benefit analysis was
performed to provide the most cost-effective technology supplier for this application (Gunther & Mey, 2006). The decision
to go forward with the high recovery precipitating RO treatment process was mainly due to low life-cycle costs, high water
recoveries (more than 99%) and manageable waste streams (Bhagwan, 2012).

In 2004/2005, a final demonstration plant was commissioned; it showed that the process was successful for treating the AMD,
and led to a commercial agreement with Anglo Coal. The full-scale plant was constructed and commissioned two years later.

CS7.3 Control measures
The eMalahleni plant makes use of a state-of-the-art three-stage high recovery precipitating RO process capable of achieving
recoveries as high as 99.7% (Hutton et al, 2009).

As shown in the treatment process flow diagram (Figure CS7.2), the first step in the treatment configuration is responsible
for neutralizing the AMD, followed by clarification, UF and RO. The concentrate from the primary RO membranes is further
treated by the secondary stage. The secondary and third stages both consists of precipitation reactors, hydro cyclones,
clarifiers, UF and RO. Again, the concentrate from the secondary RO membranes is further treated in the third stage. The
only surplus brine produced by the plant is from the tertiary RO treatment.

Permeate from each of the three RO stages are combined and chlorinated for final disinfection, followed by on-site storage
in an engineered buffer. The treated water is then pumped to the potable water reservoir of the eMalahleni municipal water
distribution system as well as to local mining operations. The potable water produced by the plant accounts for approximately
20% of the total demand of the eMalahleni Municipality (Lazenby, 2011).

CS7.3.1 Plant control and treatment philosophy
Plant control is of major importance when it comes to operating and maintaining a plant running at more than 99% water
recoveries. It is for this reason that the treatment plant is situated between two large engineered buffers. The first is the raw
water pond, which has a retention time of two days. The second engineered buffer is two final water reservoirs that are used
in addition to the municipal reservoir which feeds the distribution network of the town.

It is therefore clear that careful control of the whole water supply system, from source to clean water storage, is of great
importance to the plant operators. The plant itself makes use of a multiple-barrier process with six treatment barriers. The
plant uses real-time process monitoring, on-site quality control, as well as external quality analysis from a South African
National Accreditation System accredited laboratory (Naidu, 2012).

Integrity testing is one of the most important aspects of the operation and maintenance of the plant. Since the plant makes
use of three stages of both UF and RO membranes, the validation of these membranes is critical. In order to protect the
membranes from scaling, a monitoring programme for the calcium sulfate saturators was established. A comprehensive
UF membrane performance monitoring programme is in place to minimize the risk of suspended solids breakthrough.
The RO membranes are also monitored for flux, differential pressure and recovery ration, to have a clear understanding of
the status of the membranes at all times (Hutton et al, 2009).




                                                                                           APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES     127
From the onset of the project, it was clear that sufficient redundancy should be built into the system. The tender for the plant
stipulated that there should be at least two identical treatment trains, with a 20 MLD capacity, as well as a standby unit for
each of the critical mechanical and electrical components of the plant (Gunther & Mey, 2006).


CS7.4 Water quality monitoring
CS7.4.1 Operational control monitoring
The entire treatment system is controlled using an SCADA system. The following advantages are provided by the SCADA
system (Hutton et al, 2009):
     • Provides pre-programmed operational modes that can be activated safely by the plant operator.
     • Visual signals and confirmation are provided to the plant operator regarding the status of specific equipment (valves,
       pumps, etc.).
     • The measurements from online instruments (sensors and probes) for plant variables are displayed to the plant operator.
     • Critical process parameters are recorded and accessible for manipulation (trending, etc.).
     • Abnormal conditions and faults are indicated by alarms and warnings.
     • In the event of a sequence step failure, thorough feedback is provided to understand why the failure occurred.

The operational control provided by the SCADA system allows the entire plant to be run automatically. Certain sections of
the plant, if they are independent from the other sections of the plant, can also be run automatically in isolation.

Plant personnel are trained in operating each of the treatment units in manual mode in case the SCADA system fails. The
on-site personnel are also responsible for taking and analysing samples at the on-site laboratory in order to verify the online
measurements.

A specialized maintenance information system is also available for optimizing and recording the various maintenance
activities that take place on site. In addition, the system provides reports (updated weekly) important for legal compliance,
work schedules and even unplanned breakdown work (Hutton et al, 2009).


CS7.4.2 Water quality monitoring
Monitoring of water quality is done daily on site to understand the process chemistry and to make process changes as
required. In addition, water samples are also sent to a nearby accredited laboratory for full inductively coupled plasma
analysis according to the South African national standard for potable water (SANS 241) on a monthly basis to confirm site
analyses, as well as, for contractual purposes with the various clients.

Over and above the regular sampling programme, a series of eco-toxicity tests were carried out to determine if the treated
water had any acute toxicity or presence of carcinogens. The results indicated that the water was not toxic to drink or had
any carcinogens present.


CS7.5 Public outreach
When the initial plant was built, careful consideration was taken to employ local labour and a daily register was kept for
the duration of construction. Up to 63% of the labour used on site was attributed to local labour. Any incidents or queries
from the community were given serious attention and were handled with care and respect.


CS7.6 Governance
The plant was constructed, commissioned and operated with strict adherence to the Mine Health and Safety Act as well as the
Occupational Health and Safety Act. In terms of the final water quality produced by the plant, the water fully complies with
(SANS 241). Since the plant produces potable water to the public, it is also included in the national Blue Drop programme
(Naidu, 2012).




128    POTABLE REUSE: GUIDANCE FOR PRODUCING SAFE DRINKING-WATER
SANS 241 provides limits for five categories of constituents which have been shown to impact health, acutely or chronically,
as well as the aesthetics of the water (Tables CS7.3 and CS7.4).

SANS 241 also includes a variety of macro and micro chemicals (phosphates, nitrates, heavy metals, etc.) as well as DBPs
(trihalomethanes) and other organic chemicals (TOC, phenol, microcystin, etc.).

In its strive towards continuous improvement of drinking-water management practices, the Department of Water and
Sanitation Drinking-water Quality Regulation Unit is applying increasingly comprehensive criteria for water services
authorities to meet during the annual assessment of water supply systems (catchment to consumer). These assessments
are performed by means of the Blue Drop programme, in which a number of specific criteria are set with which the water
services authorities need to comply in order to obtain Blue Drop Certification.

Blue Drop Certification criteria consist of the following sections:
     • water safety plans;
     • process control and maintenance programmes and documentation, including operation and maintenance manuals;
     • operational and compliance water quality monitoring programmes;
     • evidence of credibility of water quality results (accreditation/proficiency scheme);
     • water quality results submitted to the Department of Water and Sanitation during the previous 12 months;
     • compliance data (tables/graphs) of the above water quality results;
     • protocols for drinking-water quality failure response management, and implementation thereof;
     • publication of drinking-water quality results in newspapers, newsletters, etc.; and
     • evidence of asset registers, annual process audits and maintenance.

Apart from the external regulations there are also numerous in-house regulations regarding the operation and maintenance
of the various treatment units.


                                                                                         APPENDIX 5. POTABLE REUSE CASE STUDIES   129
CS7.7 Conclusions, challenges and lessons learned
The plant has now been operational for several years and continues to produce safe, potable water to the eMalahleni
community as well as reducing the risk of environmental contamination from uncontrolled discharge of AMD. The plant
was the first of its kind in the world, and as such, there were many unforeseen situations, and challenges to overcome
(Gunther & Mey, 2006). Fortunately, the challenges now serve as valuable lessons learned by those involved in the project,
as well as those that study it.

When it comes to commissioning a plant with this design, it is important that it is not prematurely commissioned. Involving
the operation and maintenance team members in the commissioning proved to be of the utmost value since they formed
part of the early stage problem-solving team (Gunther & Mey, 2006). The plant hinges on the membrane treatment processes
and any risk to the membranes should be carefully considered. With the exceptional recovery achieved by the plant, there
are many risks factors that need to be accounted for. A thorough monitoring plan, as well as operational and emergency
guidelines, is critically important (Gunther & Mey, 2006).

In conclusion, it should be noted that the plant is very sensitive and requires constant care, monitoring and operational
adjustments, but if this is done correctly, by qualified personnel, the plant will be very reliable.
