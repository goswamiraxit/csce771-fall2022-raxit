ยง 49-1016. Responsibilities of owners and operators

A. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the responsibilities of this chapter
are imposed on the owner and the operator of an underground storage tank.
If the owner and operator of an underground storage tank are separate
persons, only one person is required to discharge any specific responsibility.
Both persons are liable in the event of noncompliance.

B. The liabilities and responsibilities for releases of regulated substances
imposed pursuant to this chapter shall apply even if the conduct that
resulted in the release or the release itself occurred before August 13, 1986.

C. If a person comes into the possession or control of property where an
underground storage tank is located and the person is not the owner as
defined in section 49-1001.01, the person shall:

1. Notify the department in writing specifying the tank's location, size and
use, if known, if the owner has failed to do so.

2. Notify the department of each release or suspected release from the tank
as soon as practicable if the owner or operator has failed to do so.

3. If the person voluntarily undertakes to remove or otherwise close the
tank, do so in a safe and secure manner which prevents releases of regulated
substances and in accordance with standards prescribed by the director
pursuant to section 49-1008, except for the requirement to perform
corrective action.

4. If the person voluntarily undertakes corrective action, take corrective
action in a manner consistent with federal regulations and rules adopted by
the director pursuant to section 49-1005.

D. A person acting under subsection C of this section shall not incur the
liability of an owner.

E. No agreement or conveyance shall be effective to transfer the obligations
imposed by this chapter from the owner or operator of any underground
storage tank, or from any person who may be liable for a release or threat of
release under this chapter, to any other person. Nothing in this section shall
bar any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to such
agreement for any liability under this chapter nor shall it bar a cause of
action that an owner or operator or any other person has or would have
against any person.

F. In any action brought by the department under section 49-1013, the state
bears the burden of establishing that an owner or operator has violated the
 ARS 49-1016 Responsibilities of owners and operators (Arizona
               Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


requirements of this chapter. An owner or operator is responsible for only
the owner's or operator's contribution to any contamination that creates
liability under this chapter. No party bears the burden of proving any
person's contribution to the contamination in any informal or formal appeal
pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection D, section 49-1019, subsection D or
section 49-1091.

G. If there is prima facie evidence that other identified or unidentified
persons not at the owner's or operator's facility have contributed to the
contamination, the owner or operator shall be responsible to take corrective
action only to the extent, by area, of the owner's or operator's release. The
owner or operator shall not be required to identify or to prove the
contribution of any contributing persons in order to limit the owner's or
operator's own liability, but the owner or operator shall provide to the
department any information the owner or operator knows regarding the
identity or contribution of any other contributing persons. If the owner or
operator does not disclose the information prior to the owner's or operator's
formal appeal of a decision by the department, upon the department's
request, the administrative hearing shall be continued for no more than
thirty days from the scheduled hearing date. If who contributed to the
contamination cannot be determined by a preponderance of evidence, or if
an allocation for some or all of the contamination cannot be established by a
preponderance of evidence, the liability that is not established to be the
owner's or operator's by a preponderance of the evidence shall not be
allocated to the owner or operator.

H. The department may issue a written interim decision or determination
compelling owners and operators to allocate liability in accordance with
section 49-1019, subsection D if either of the following conditions are met:

1. The owners and operators agree that no other owners or operators are
liable for the contamination.

2. The contamination is from a single underground storage tank facility.

                Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-1017. Powers of director; corrective actions

A. The director may take corrective action with respect to a release of a
regulated substance that is petroleum into the environment from an
underground storage tank if the director determines that action is necessary
to protect human health, safety or the environment and any of the following
conditions exist:

1. The department cannot locate, within ninety days or a shorter period
necessary to protect human health or the environment, a person who is all of
the following:

(a) An owner or operator of the tank concerned.

(b) Subject to the corrective action requirements of section 49-1005.

(c) Financially or technically capable of properly carrying out the corrective
action required by section 49-1005. If the owner or operator and the
department jointly determine that the owner or operator is not financially or
technically able to carry out the corrective action , the department and the
owner may enter into a contract under which the department acts as
manager of the corrective action on behalf of the owner or operator. The
existence of a management contract with the department does not relieve
the owner of any liability for costs that are not payable by the department
under this chapter .

2. Corrective action costs at a facility exceed the amount of coverage
required by section 49-1006 and expenditures from the underground
storage tank revolving fund are necessary to ensure effective corrective
action.

B. In determining whether to take a corrective action pursuant to subsection
A of this section, the director shall consider and make written findings
regarding all of the following factors:

1. The physical and chemical characteristics of the type of petroleum
released, including its toxicity, persistence and potential for migration.

2. The hydrogeologic characteristics of the site where the underground
storage tank is located and the surrounding area.

3. The proximity, quality and current and future uses of nearby surface
water and groundwater.

4. The potential effects of residual contamination on nearby surface water
and groundwater.
   ARS 49-1017 Powers of director; corrective actions (Arizona

5. The degree of exposure.

6. The need for financial assistance.

C. If direct costs are incurred by the director for undertaking corrective
action with respect to a release of a regulated substance that is petroleum,
the owner and operator are liable to this state for these direct costs. Liability
imposed pursuant to this subsection is strict. For the purposes of this
subsection, "direct costs" means the cost of the corrective actions,
investigations, enforcement and litigation except for those amounts that are
not allocated to the owner or operator pursuant to subsection d of this
section .

D. If there is more than one responsible person, liability under this section
shall be equitably allocated on a case-by-case basis according to section 49-
1016, subsection F, and using the following factors as those factors are
appropriate under the circumstances:

1. The duration and percentage of ownership or operation of the
underground storage tank during a release of regulated substances from the
tank.

2. The amount and nature of the regulated substances released.

3. The degree of care exercised by each person with respect to the regulated
substances released.

4. The ability to distinguish between the respective releases of more than
one responsible person.

5. Other factors that are appropriate under the circumstances.

E. The allocation of liability under this section shall be promptly determined
by one or more mediators who shall be selected by the responsible persons
within sixty days after the responsible persons are identified by the director.
The director may select a mediator and convene a mediation on the failure of
the responsible persons to select one or more mediators. The mediator shall
not have a conflict of interest with the responsible persons. A mediation
convened by the director shall be held within sixty days after the mediator
being selected. The director shall provide notice to the responsible persons
of the time and place for the mediation and the name of the mediator or
mediators. This notice shall be provided at least forty-five days prior to the
date scheduled for mediation. Costs of mediation shall be eligible for
payment and shall be allocated to participants in the mediation in the same
proportion as the costs of corrective action. Nothing in this section shall
excuse the obligations of an owner or operator to take timely and adequate
   ARS 49-1017 Powers of director; corrective actions (Arizona
                Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


action in response to a release of regulated substances as required in this
chapter. Nothing in this section shall diminish the right of any person to
bring an action against any other person as provided in section 49-1019 for
contribution or reimbursement for the reasonable costs of corrective action
that person has been allocated pursuant to this section.

F. The director may take a corrective action with respect to a release of a
regulated substance that is not petroleum only as a remedial action subject
to chapter 2, article 5 of this title, and the rules adopted pursuant to that
article. If the director takes a corrective action for the release of a regulated
substance that is not petroleum, all of the rights, duties and responsibilities
of a person associated with the release shall be determined pursuant to that
article.

G. An owner, operator or other person that meets the requirements of
section 49-1016, subsection C may request that the department conduct
corrective action under this section. Subject to the availability of monies
allocated and the priority assigned to the site pursuant to subsection B of
this section, the department may conduct the corrective action.

H. A request for corrective action pursuant to subsection G of this section
shall be on a form provided by the department and shall contain sufficient
information related to the site and the factors prescribed in subsection B of
this section to allow the director to make a determination of priority for that
request.

A. The director shall consider any offer by an owner or operator who is
potentially liable for direct costs incurred by the director pursuant to section
49-1017, subsection C, without regard to the extent of that owner's or
operator's liability, if the owner or operator is unable to pay for the direct
costs. An owner or operator whose liability for direct costs arose from a
criminal act is not eligible to enter into a settlement agreement pursuant to
this section. An owner's or operator's decision to enter into a settlement
agreement pursuant to this section is not an admission in a judicial
proceeding as to the fact or extent of that owner's or operator's liability with
respect to releases or threatened releases that are covered by the settlement.
An owner or operator who is a party to a settlement pursuant to this section
is not required to participate in allocation proceedings pursuant to section
49-1017, subsections D and E. Any settlement approved by the department
does not release the owner or operator from any responsibility or duty
imposed pursuant to this chapter other than liability for direct costs
incurred pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection C.

B. Any settlement approved by the department does not increase the liability
of any other owner or operator pursuant to this chapter and does not create
any liability for the department or this state.

C. The director shall consider all of the following factors in considering an
owner's or operator's ability to pay for the direct costs:

1. The financial resources of the owner or operator, including available
financial assurance mechanisms other than the underground storage tank
revolving fund .

2. The amount of coverage available to the owner or operator from the
underground storage tank revolving fund for the direct costs. As a condition
of settlement, the owner or operator shall apply to the underground storage
tank revolving fund and any applicable grant program for coverage of the
direct costs before requesting settlement pursuant to this section.

3. The owner's or operator's ability to continue in business after payment of
the owner's or operator's liability for direct costs as defined in section 49-
1017, subsection C.

4. Whether payment of the owner's or operator's liability for direct costs as
defined in section 49-1017, subsection C would require the owner or
operator to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy law or render the
owner or operator insolvent.

5. The financial resources of all concerns in which the owner or operator
maintains ownership, control or management.

D. An owner or operator seeking settlement pursuant to subsection A of this
section shall submit a letter requesting a financial hardship settlement and
shall include the owner's or operator's tax returns and all schedules,
financial statements, balance statements and other information concerning
the owner's or operator's gross income and net worth for the five years
immediately preceding the date of the application. Within ninety days after
the receipt of the application, the director may require additional
information to verify the owner's or operator's eligibility for settlement
pursuant to subsection A of this section. The owner or operator may provide
any additional information the owner or operator believes to be relevant to
the application. The director shall keep confidential any financial
information submitted by the owner or operator pursuant to this subsection.
If the director or the attorney general disputes a claim of confidentiality, the
director or the attorney general shall provide written notice that the claim is
disputed to the owner or operator claiming the confidentiality. The
information shall be made available to the public if the owner or operator
claiming confidentiality does not file an action for declaratory relief in
superior court within thirty days after receiving the notice.

E. The owner or operator shall cooperate with the director in providing
reasonable access and information for the director to carry out the
requirements of this section as a condition of the settlement.

F. If the director verifies that the owner or operator is unable to pay the
direct costs incurred by the director pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection
C, the director shall enter into a settlement within ninety days after receipt
of the application and any other information required pursuant to this
section. The director shall allow the settlement amount to be paid over a
period of time that does not exceed ten years. Settlement payments over a
period of time are subject to the payment of interest at the rate of six percent
a year, except that payments are not subject to interest if the entire
settlement amount is paid within five years. The owner or operator may file
a petition with the director to modify the payment schedule on a showing of
good cause that the payment schedule cannot be met.

G. The director may require that notice of the terms of the settlement
agreement be provided to the public to allow for comment for a period of
thirty days before the department enters into a settlement agreement. Any
interested person may comment on the settlement agreement in writing to
the director. The director may withdraw from a settlement agreement after
considering the comments.

a settlement pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the owner or
operator in writing within ninety days after the receipt of all information
required pursuant to this section stating the reasons for ineligibility. The
application for settlement is deemed denied if the director does not notify
the owner or operator within ninety days after the director's receipt of all

A. The director may undertake corrective action in response to a release
from an underground storage tank that migrates on or under a person's
property as the result of an occurrence at another property or that the
department determines is likely to migrate on or under a person's property,
if all of the following occur:

1. The person has authority to allow access to the property so that corrective
action may be taken on the person's property.

2. The owner or operator of the underground storage tank that is the source
of the release makes a written request that the department attempt to obtain
access to the property. As part of the written request, the owner or operator
shall demonstrate to the department the following before the department
attempts to obtain access to the property:

(a) The owner or operator has sent and the person has received at least two
written requests to allow the owner or operator to have access to the
property at reasonable times and under reasonable conditions.

(b) The owner or operator has made an offer of reasonable compensation to
the person.

(c) Contamination is likely to spread or increase in severity if access to the
property is not obtained.

3. The person has received a written request from the department to have
access to the property, at reasonable times and under reasonable conditions
in a manner that does not constitute a taking as provided by law, to take
corrective action with respect to only the release that has migrated on that
person's property.

4. The person has refused to allow the owner or operator or the department
to have access to the property or does not respond to the department within
sixty days after receiving the request for access.

B. The department shall issue a notice describing the proposed corrective
action to the owner or operator and the person on whose property the
department will undertake corrective action if it elects to undertake
corrective action pursuant to subsection A of this section. The owner or
operator or the person on whose property the department undertakes
corrective action may appeal pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, within
thirty days after the notice or within thirty days after the performance of the
corrective action. If, after an appeal, it is determined that the department

was in before being accessed, the person on whose property the department
undertakes the corrective action may be eligible for payment from the
underground storage tank revolving fund only to the extent the department
failed to return the property to substantially the same condition the property
was in before being accessed.

C. The owner or operator shall reimburse the department for any costs paid
from the underground storage tank revolving fund pursuant to this section.

D. The department shall promptly provide to a person whose property is
accessed under this section a copy of the results of any analysis of the soil or
groundwater relating to the accessed property arising from the department's
access or corrective action undertaken at the property. The department shall
not sue the person for any secondary contamination created by the access or
corrective action.

E. If a release of a regulated substance has migrated on or under a person's
property, the department shall relieve the owner or operator of the
underground storage tank from responsibility from performing corrective
action at the property where the release has migrated or where the
department has determined it is likely to have migrated, if the owner or
operator is unable to gain access to the property after complying with
subsection A, paragraph 2, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. Nothing
in this section relieves the owner or operator from liability for completing
the requirements of section 49-1005 relating to the owner's or operator's
property or any other property to which the contamination may have
migrated. The department may require that the owner or operator
investigate any other properties potentially impacted by the release in order
to complete the requirements of section 49-1005.

A. From and after July 1, 1990, there is imposed and the director shall
collect an excise tax on the operation of underground storage tanks
regulated under this chapter measured by the quantity of regulated
substances placed in a tank in any calendar year. The tax is levied at the rate
of one cent per gallon of regulated substance.

B. For proper administration of this article, and to prevent the evasion of the
tax imposed by this article, it shall be presumed until the contrary is
established by competent proof under rules and procedures adopted by the
director that all regulated substances that are motor vehicle fuel as defined
in section 28-101, aviation fuel as defined in section 28-101 and diesel as
defined in section 28-6001, subsection B and that are refined,
manufactured, produced, compounded or blended in this state, or imported
into this state, will be placed in an underground storage tank from which the
fuel is dispensed to users who consume the fuel and do not further distribute
it. Under this presumption, the owner and operator of an underground
storage tank from which motor vehicle fuel, aviation fuel or diesel is
dispensed and from which no further bulk distribution will be made, shall be
considered to have paid the tax collected under title 28, chapter 16, article 6.

C. The tax imposed by this article does not apply to underground storage
tanks operated by the United States or this state or agencies of the United
States or this state or to any of the following substances placed in
underground storage tanks:

1. Naphtha-type jet fuel or kerosene-type jet fuel.

2. Regulated substances as defined in section 49-1001, paragraph 16,
subdivision (b), unless such regulated substances were placed in an
underground storage tank prior to July 1, 1997, and the owner or operator of
the underground storage tank has paid prior to July 1, 1997 all taxes
imposed by this article applicable to such regulated substances. If the owner
or operator has paid those taxes, the owner or operator may elect to
continue to pay the tax imposed by this article regarding such regulated
substances.

D. The owner and operator of an underground storage tank regulated under
this chapter are jointly and severally liable for the tax, but the owner and
operator may agree between themselves and file a notarized affidavit with
the director designating either the owner or operator as primarily
responsible for the tax under this article.

paid and which fuel has been placed in a tank which is not subject to the
underground storage tank tax imposed by this section and from which no
further bulk distribution of the fuel will be made, may claim a refund of the
tax levied. Refunds shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the director
and shall be supported by substantiation for the amount of the tax paid.

administering the tax imposed by this article and specifying the forms of the
return and of the certification provided for in sections 28-6003 and 28-

manner in which refunds may be claimed and refund claims assigned
pursuant to subsection F of this section, shall specify the circumstances in
which fuel may be excluded from the quantity of fuel used to measure the
tax pursuant to title 28, chapter 16, article 6, and shall prescribe the forms
for and manner which the certification provided in title 28, chapter 16,
article 6 shall be made.

I. Title 41, chapter 6 shall not apply to the temporary rules adopted pursuant
to this section. The temporary rules shall be filed with the secretary of state
and shall be effective for a period of one hundred eighty days after the date
of filing with the secretary of state. The temporary rules may be renewed

ยง 49-1051. Preapproval process; requirements; corrective action
priority

A. An owner, an operator, the designated representative of the owner or
operator or a person that meets the requirements of section 49-1016,
subsection C must follow the preapproval process pursuant to this section to
be eligible for reimbursement from the underground storage tank revolving
fund for corrective actions taken pursuant to section 49-1053, subsection A.
Preapproval applications must include a detailed scope of work that
conforms to the requirements of sections 49-1005 and 49-1053, a schedule
for conducting corrective actions and a cost sheet. Beginning January 1,
2016 and except as prescribed in subsection J of this section , corrective
actions and costs for activities that were completed before departmental
approval of the scope of work are not eligible for reimbursement under
section 49-1054. If the preapproved scope of work cannot be implemented
as approved, the person seeking reimbursement shall submit a change
notice to the department. To be eligible for reimbursement, a change notice
must be approved by the department before implementation of the change
notice.

B. This section does not relieve an owner, an operator or the designated
representative of the owner or operator from any of the requirements of this
chapter.

C. While the application for preapproval is pending, the department may not
take enforcement action or impose penalties against the owner, operator or
designated representative who submitted the application for preapproval.
The department may not consider the passage of time while the preapproval
application is pending to be a basis for taking an enforcement action. For
any corrective action submitted for preapproval pursuant to rule, the period
of time for compliance with corrective actions associated with that
preapproval begins to run after the date of preapproval of the corrective
action.

D. On determination by the department or its designated contractor that the
application for preapproval is complete, the department or its designated
contractor shall determine whether the owner or operator was a small owner
at the time of the application. For the purposes of this subsection, "small
owner" means an owner that owns fewer than twenty underground storage
tank facilities in this state.

E. In processing the application for preapproval, the department shall
determine the corrective action priority of the release within ninety days
after the receipt of the materials required by this section. The corrective
action priority shall be based on all of the following:
   ARS 49-1051 Preapproval process; requirements; corrective
    action priority (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


1. The need for financial assistance, including the availability of coverage
under insurance or other financial assurance mechanisms.

2. The extent to which a delay in reimbursement will affect the ability to
conduct corrective actions.

3. The risk to human health and the environment.

4. The presence of preexisting contamination of groundwater by a hazardous
substance as defined in section 49-281.

F. An owner, operator or person who meets the requirements of section 49-
1016, subsection C may request reimbursement under section 49-1053.
Subject to the availability of monies allocated and the assigned priority of
the site pursuant to subsection E of this section, the department may make
reimbursements from the underground storage tank revolving fund.

G. An application for preapproval and reimbursement pursuant to this
section shall be on a form provided by the department and shall contain
sufficient information to allow the director to make a determination of
priority for that request.

H. Any determination made by the department pursuant to this section
constitutes a written interim determination relating to preapproval pursuant
to section 49-1091.

I. The department may alter the corrective action priority of the release at
any time based on the results of sampling and monitoring conducted
pursuant to this section or any other information obtained by the
department.

J. Corrective actions and costs for activities that were completed before the
department's approval of the scope of work are eligible for reimbursement
under section 49-1054 if the applicant otherwise complies with subsection A
of this section, the corrective actions and costs for activities could not
reasonably have been incurred through the preapproval process and any of
the following apply:

1. For corrective actions and costs for activities that are completed from and
after december 31, 2015 through december 31, 2019 and that are not the
subject of a preapproval or reimbursement under time-barred claims
provisions because the applicant's financial responsibility mechanism was
defective at the time of the release or the release occurred before financial
responsibility was in place, the applicant is eligible for reimbursement for
those corrective actions and costs for activities that are incurred from and
after the date the applicant demonstrates to the department that the
   ARS 49-1051 Preapproval process; requirements; corrective

applicant is in compliance with financial responsibility requirements and the
financial responsibility is demonstrated to the department before january 1,
2019. From and after december 31, 2018, the applicant is only eligible for
reimbursement for corrective actions and costs incurred in response to
releases confirmed after the date the applicant has demonstrated
compliance with financial responsibility requirements.

2. For corrective actions and costs for activities completed from and after
december 31, 2015 through december 31, 2019, and for which the applicant's
compliance with the preapproval process was impracticable due to:

(a) The urgency of the corrective action to address newly discovered
contamination.

(b) The need for corrective action to avoid risk to public health and the
environment.

3. For corrective actions and costs for activities completed from and after
december 31, 2015 through december 31, 2018, the corrective actions and
costs are not the subject of a time-barred claim or were not otherwise
reimbursed by the department.

4. Only for corrective actions and costs of activities completed before
january 1, 2019, the claim for reimbursement is received by the department
before january 1, 2020 and paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection applies.

K. The department shall develop an expedited preapproval process not later
than december 31, 2019 to address those corrective action costs incurred for
newly discovered contamination and to address those corrective action costs
necessary to avoid risk to public health and the environment.

L. Direct costs incurred by the department in conducting corrective action
pursuant to section 49-1017 that are in excess of the coverage limits
applicable to time-barred claims as otherwise provided by law shall reduce
the amount otherwise payable to an owner or operator pursuant to section
49-1054 but any amount remaining under section 49-1054 shall be available
to the owner or operator for additional corrective action costs.

M. For direct costs incurred by the department in conducting corrective
action pursuant to section 49-1017 after december 31, 2016, the owner or
operator is liable to the department for any amount incurred except for the
amount that is eligible and within the amount allowable under section 49-
