Table 1: WSP modules as described in the WSP manual (WHO/IWA, 2009)

 Module 1     Assemble team
              Set up a team and decide on a methodology by which a WSP will be developed.
 Module 2     Describe the water supply system
              Visit and thoroughly describe the complete water supply system, from catchment to consumer.
 Module 3     Identify the hazards and assess the risks
              Identify all the hazards and hazardous events that could aﬀect the safety of a water supply from the catchment, through abstraction,
              treatment, storage, distribution and point-of-use practices to the point of consumption, and assess the risks associated with each hazardous
              event.
 Module 4     Determine and validate control measures, re-assess and prioritize risks
              Consider if controls or barriers are in place for each hazardous event, check if these controls are eﬀective and re-assess the risks in light of
              these controls and their eﬀectiveness.
 Module 5     Develop, implement and maintain an improvement plan
              Implement an incremental improvement and upgrade plan where necessary.
 Module 6     Define monitoring of control measures
              Implement plans for ongoing monitoring of controls or barriers to ensure that they continue to work eﬀectively.
 Module 7     Verify the effectiveness of the WSP
              Verify that the WSP as a whole is working eﬀectively to support the consistent delivery of safe and acceptable drinking-water.
 Module 8     Prepare management procedures
              Establish and document management procedures, including standard operating procedures (SOPs) and emergency response plans.
 Module 9     Develop supporting programmes
              Establish and document supporting programmes such as operator training, consumer education, optimization of processes and research and
              development.
 Module 10    Plan and carry out periodic WSP review
              Regularly review and update the complete WSP.
 Module 11    Revise WSP following an incident
              Following any incident or event, consider if it could have been prevented or the impact reduced, determine whether the response was
              suﬃcient and eﬀective, and update the WSP to incorporate any identified areas for improvement.

       CERTIFICATION FOR REGULATORY AUDITORS IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA

       The state of Victoria in Australia has stringent requirements for auditors who audit the water utilities’ RMPs (or WSPs) required by its Safe Drinking Water
       Act 2003 and associated regulations, including:
       • knowledge of the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines framework for drinking-water quality (assessed by examination);
       • education and work experience confirmed by:
          – evidence of a relevant degree or diploma in engineering, science or medicine; and
          – evidence of seven years’ work experience in two of three areas – water industry, management systems or auditing;
       • appropriate personal attributes (examined by standard psychometric testing); and
       • skill competency (demonstrated through observational examination by skill examiners).

       As there was no pre-existing auditor certification process that dealt directly with the auditing of WSPs, Victoria’s Department of Health & Human Services
       (prior to 2015 called the Department of Health) approached a private company specializing in international training certification services to develop a
       specific audit certification scheme for auditors of drinking-water quality management systems with assistance from the Water Services Association of
       Australia and VicWater (the Victorian Water Industry Association).

       The result is a water quality management systems auditor certification scheme conforming to an internationally recognized standard for certifying bodies
       (ISO/IEC 17024:2012) with key competencies based on ISO 19011:2011 (Guidelines for auditing management systems) and Chapters 2 and 3 of the
       Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.

       This competency-based scheme was launched in 2007 and there are now approximately 20 drinking-water auditors certified under the scheme.
       Certification applies to individuals and there are two grades of auditor: drinking-water quality management systems (DW QMS) auditor and DW QMS lead
       auditor. Applicants are responsible for the fees and must be re-certified every four years.

  AUDIT FORM FROM LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

  In October and November 2011, three WSPs in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic were externally, informally audited by a small team of national and
  international WSP experts in order to strengthen the individual WSPs and provide feedback on the progress of the national WSP programme. Prior to
  the audit, the audit team developed an audit form based on the structure of the WSP manual (WHO/IWA, 2009) (which was adopted by the national
  government). For each of the 11 WSP modules, a number of criteria were defined as indicators that the module had been successfully addressed, and fields
  were created to record WSP strengths and weaknesses against the various criteria. The portion of the audit form covering Module 7 is provided below as an
  example, including auditor notes from one of the sites audited. (The full audit form includes 28 criteria covering all 11 WSP modules, but only one module
  is shown here for brevity.)

  Following the initial round of audits using the audit form below, the audit criteria were revised to place more emphasis on WSP implementation rather
  than focusing solely on WSP development and documentation, which was a valuable lesson learned. (Refer to Appendix B for the revised audit criteria
  currently used in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.)

     12. List of considerations for
     developing an auditing scheme
     This section provides a checklist of key considerations                            may apply only to internal audits within a water supply
     for those responsible for developing a WSP auditing                                system. The checklist builds on the information provided
     programme. The auditing programme may be national                                  in the previous sections and presents some additional key
     or sub-national, as in the case of regulatory audits, or it                        points for consideration.



      List of key considerations for developing an auditing scheme

      ✔ What is the purpose of the audit?
        As discussed in Section 4, WSP audits may have a number of objectives, from mentoring and supporting WSP teams to ensuring compliance with
        regulatory requirements. It is important to bear in mind the particular audit goals in order to design the most appropriate scheme.

      ✔ How will audits be financed?
        All audits require resources – personnel, time, accommodation, equipment, transport – and all of these must be financed. Larger water suppliers are
        likely to have to bear all the audit costs. Internal audits may not require direct financing, but consideration will need to be given to how the auditor’s
        day-to-day responsibilities will be covered whilst they are undertaking audits. Funding of audits for small supplies tends to be much more of a challenge
        as local authorities, government departments and funding agencies have many competing demands on their limited resources and personnel.

      ✔ When should audits be carried out?
        The timing of the initial audit and frequency of subsequent audits should be established, balancing the benefits of auditing with due consideration of the
        resources required, as discussed in Section 6.

      ✔ How will sites be prioritized for auditing?
        When planning external audit schemes for a large number of supplies where human and financial resources are limited, it may be necessary to devise a
        system of audit site prioritization. This may be particularly relevant for small supplies and will enable all supplies to be audited over an extended time
        period. Prioritization may involve selecting sites based on the population supplied, water quality results or population health data. In such cases, it may
        also be useful to conduct short, simplified audits concentrating on WSP elements vital for protecting public health, such as hazard identification and
        water treatment. Although the aim should always be to carry out comprehensive and regular WSP audits, the realities of resource constraints must be
        practically considered, and any kind of WSP audit is better than no audit.

      ✔ What skills and experience should auditors have?
        The audit scheme should set out the skills and experience required of auditors (or audit teams), as discussed in Section 7.

      ✔ How will auditors be trained, certified and appointed?
        The audit scheme should establish systems for auditor training and certification (as appropriate), as discussed in Section 8. For external audit schemes,
        another consideration that may be relevant is how auditors should be appointed to avoid any conflicts of interest.

      ✔ What audit criteria will be used?
        Defining clear audit criteria that reflect the locally relevant WSP approach and, where appropriate, providing qualitative or quantitative evaluation
        guidance will facilitate the audit process and contribute to audit consistency. Ensuring audit consistency is particularly important in the case of
        regulatory audits, and regulatory frameworks will generally set out the WSP requirements that will form the basis of any audit criteria. Audit criteria and
        evaluation guidance are discussed in Sections 9 and 10, respectively.
                                                                                                   List of considerations for developing an auditing scheme          31



List of key considerations for developing an auditing scheme (cont.)

✔ How will audit results be reported and followed up?
  Reporting is an important part of all types of auditing. For external audits, the audit scheme should establish how audit results will be externally
  reported, giving due consideration to any legal, political or reputational implications of the report. In the case of regulatory audits, it will be important to
  consider how non-compliance will be reported and how corrections or improvements will be followed up. Regulatory frameworks should set out relevant
  requirements. Reporting is discussed in Section 11.

✔ How to continuously improve the auditing scheme and WSP implementation?
  It is worthwhile to consider how auditing experiences can be documented and shared to support revisions and improvements to the audit process,
  particularly when an audit scheme is newly developed and implemented. Audit experiences should be evaluated to ensure they are meeting the
  objectives of the auditing programme, including the strengthening of WSP implementation and national or sub-national WSP programmes, where
  applicable.

✔ Is WSP auditing supported by regulatory requirements?
  WSP audits may be legally required by legislation, regulations or technical standards, or they may be addressed less formally in guidelines. Audit
  requirements or guidelines may address the considerations listed here and serve to establish consistent criteria for conducting audits, thereby creating a
  basis for comparing results nationally or sub-nationally.

      List of considerations for undertaking an audit

      PRIOR TO THE AUDIT

      ✔ Scheduling the audit
        Once the audit has been initiated, for example by the regulator or the WSP team, the auditor should schedule the audit. For external audits, typically the
        senior management or the WSP team leader will be the auditor’s point of contact with the water supplier. Internal auditors will usually liaise directly with
        the WSP team. Audit initiation and scheduling are discussed in Section 6.

      ✔ Allowing sufficient time
        The auditor should take care to plan suﬃcient time for the audit so that it is not rushed. While a larger system will generally have more elements to
        audit, a smaller system WSP team may have mentoring needs that will also take time. The audit scope should take time into account, considering the
        parts of the water supply system to be covered by the audit and the required travel time between locations. The audit can consider the whole WSP from
        catchment to the point of consumption, or it can concentrate on one or more specific aspects, depending on the audit objectives, the remit of the water
        supplier and the time available. (See the case studies in Appendix A for examples of the duration of various audits.)

      ✔ Supporting water supplier or WSP team preparation
        The auditor should provide information to help the water supplier or WSP team prepare for the audit in respect of sites to be visited, staﬀ to be
        interviewed and documents to be made available for review. For audit inception and exit meetings, the auditor should provide advice on expected
        meeting participants so that plans can be made accordingly. Providing this information in advance of the site visit demonstrates due consideration of
        people’s time and will help ensure that the audit runs smoothly and eﬃciently.

      ✔ Reviewing documents in advance
        Reviewing some documents in advance of the audit may benefit the audit process. For example, the auditor may review water supply system schematics,
        the WSP document or water quality monitoring records. Questions arising from the advanced paperwork review can be addressed during the audit. This
        up-front work will limit the amount of time required on site at the water supplier’s facilities for the audit and will increase the auditor’s knowledge, which
        can facilitate audit activities and build credibility amongst water supplier staﬀ or WSP team members.

List of considerations for undertaking an audit (cont.)

DURING THE AUDIT

✔ Communicating audit aim and methodology
  At the outset of an audit, the auditor should ensure that everyone involved in the audit understands how the audit will be carried out and what is to
  be achieved. The auditor should make it clear that the audit is an opportunity for learning and improvement and should be carried out in an open,
  cooperative and transparent manner. Audit inception meetings provide a good opportunity to communicate these messages and answer any initial
  questions.

✔ Undertake field- and desk-based investigations
  A successful audit will have field- and desk-based components. The audit will need to assess the water supplier’s level of understanding of the WSP
  process. This will require face-to-face discussions with members of staﬀ about the WSP process, and their roles and responsibilities, as well as spot
  checks on whether or not operators follow WSP procedures in their day-to-day jobs. Field visits will confirm the accuracy of system descriptions, and the
  plausibility and adequacy of risk assessments, control measures and operational procedures. Paperwork (methods and procedures, records and results)
  will also need to be examined. (See page 32 for a practical example from Portugal of the distribution of audit time between desk studies, field visits and
  staﬀ interviews.)

✔ Using clear audit criteria and forms
  The auditor should use forms with clearly defined audit criteria (and evaluation guidance, where appropriate) to support the audit process and record
  keeping, as discussed in Sections 9 and 10. In some cases, audit criteria will be established by those responsible for developing the broader audit scheme,
  and in other cases the auditor will need to develop the criteria. In all cases, the audit criteria should be carefully worded, using local language and the
  locally relevant WSP approach.

✔ Conducting an exit meeting
  As discussed in Section 11, the auditor should always aim to conduct an exit meeting with the WSP team and water supplier management to discuss
  major audit findings and impressions. This brings closure to the audit process and provides an important opportunity to sort out any misunderstandings
  prior to reporting.

FOLLOWING THE AUDIT

✔ Reporting and follow up
  Every audit should result in a written report reflecting the type, scope and purpose of the audit, and documenting audit activities, findings and any
  follow-up requirements. Guidance for developing the audit report is provided in Section 11, and auditors may find it useful to develop a standard
  reporting template to ensure that key content is included in all reports. Prior to finalizing the report, the auditor should always give the water supplier an
  opportunity to review and comment to clarify any misunderstandings or provide additional information.

A.1 Nepal
(External informal auditing)

The Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS) began leading the development and implementation of
WSPs in Nepal in 2010 with support from the WHO/Australian Government Water Quality Partnership. To gain an
understanding of the quality and completeness of WSPs that had been implemented, WSPs were assessed (audited) in
November 2011 in three communities, including Amarapuri (southern Nepal).


The Amarapuri water supply project was managed by an 11-member water users’ committee and it provided service to
8 500 people in 1 331 households. There were 1 050 private tap connections with flow meters. The project supplied
about 1 000 m3 of treated water over a period of six hours per day. The WSP concept was introduced in Amarapuri in
August 2010 and an improvement programme had been recently completed.


The WSP audit was supported financially by the Water Quality Partnership and was undertaken by a small audit team
comprising an international WSP expert with auditing experience and two national WSP consultants. The audit team
developed an audit form with criteria that reflected the national 10-step WSP approach as outlined in the Nepal WSP
Handbook (which has since been revised with some minor changes in the steps). The audit was informal in nature
and was intended to acknowledge WSP team members’ efforts and successes as well as improvement opportunities.
Therefore, the audit form included fields for recording both strengths and improvement opportunities. (See
Amarapuri’s completed audit form – Table 7.)


The WSP audit in Amarapuri involved a desktop review of the existing WSP document (completed prior to the site
visit) and an on-site evaluation. The on-site portion of the audit was carried out over one full day and involved field
visits to intakes, treatment works and storage reservoirs as well as review and discussion of WSP-related activities and
records.


The audit found that the WSP team and the water users’ committee understood well the WSP concept and that WSP
activities had been fully integrated into the overall water supply system operation and management. Effort was given to
keeping the WSP current and effective, and the WSP had resulted in many improvements to management of the water
supply system, treatment infrastructure, water quality and consumer awareness.


The WSP audit also found several opportunities to improve the WSP, including WSP documentation. A number of
important hazards had been identified and managed through the WSP process (for example open defecation in the
village upstream of the water intake) but had not been documented in the WSP. The development and implementation
of an effective community education programme had also not been documented in the WSP.


The audit process and findings were documented in a written audit report that was shared with the Amarapuri WSP
team and water users’ group and with DWSS at the national and sub-national levels. The audit report included:
• audit scope and purpose
• audit process (duration, overview of desktop review versus on-site evaluation)
• audit team member names and designations
• photographs and descriptions of all sites visited
• summary of major strengths and improvement opportunities noted
• recommended next steps
• detailed findings against specific criteria (i.e. the completed audit form).
36   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     The findings from the WSP audit in Amarapuri and the other two communities audited were considered collectively by
     DWSS in order to identify common improvement opportunities, and DWSS translated these findings into opportunities
     to improve national WSP guidance. DWSS subsequently revised the Nepal WSP Handbook accordingly in order to
     strengthen the national WSP programme.

     A.2 Portugal
     (Internal and external, formal and informal auditing)

     Águas do Algarve (AdA) is a public-private water supplier serving a population of around 410 000 people (up to
     1 200 000 people during the peak season) in 16 municipalities in Portugal. AdA has about 160 employees supporting
     water and wastewater services. In 2007, AdA established the WSP auditing scheme outlined in Table 8 below. All
     audits are voluntary and seen as a strong tool to keep the WSP working routinely and to improve system performance.
     Each year, WSP objectives are set with top management to improve performance, and the accomplishment of these
     objectives is verified through auditing. The first audit was undertaken about six months after the start of WSP
     implementation, and audits are staggered such that some form of audit is being undertaken every three months.

     At AdA, the WSP team leads the internal informal audits, which is a modified approach to internal auditing. Ideally,
     WSP auditors will not be part of WSP development and implementation for objectivity and to distinguish WSP audit
     from WSP review. However, AdA’s robust WSP auditing scheme ensures ample unbiased feedback through their formal
     audits (both internal and external). The internal informal audits are a key driver for ‘maintaining the pressure’ to keep
     the WSP working well all year round, and not only in the lead up to the formal audits.


     External auditors must be officially recognized as qualified to perform ISO 22000 audits and be able to demonstrate
     their independence from the water supplier. Internal auditors should meet the following criteria:
     • experience in auditing (for example QMS or training in HACCP auditing)
     • experience in WSP implementation
     • field experience in the operations, maintenance or laboratory fields.


     All audits are pre-arranged. Since audits are performed every three months, the different areas of the organization are
     always ready to be audited, although preparation will be given more detailed attention in the two weeks prior to the
     external audit.


     Prior to the audit, the auditor must prepare and submit a general audit plan outlining the scope, infrastructure to be
     audited and general questions to be answered. (See Appendix B           for an example audit plan.) Internal and external
     audits use a list of audit criteria produced by the WSP team that was compiled from the WSP manual (WHO/
     IWA, 2009), the WSP Quality Assurance Tool (WHO/IWA, 2013) and site-specific considerations. All areas of the
     organization are audited including operations and maintenance, human resources, laboratories and planning. Legal

compliance with water quality standards is always checked, particularly those associated with hazards identified in the
WSP. Also, a strong focus is made on how the control measures are being monitored, verifying data and effectiveness.
Consumer complaints are also evaluated, and staff training is checked. Checks on when and how the WSP is reviewed
and kept up to date are included and considered critical to maintaining WSP evolution and implementation. For all
documents reviewed, original records must be audited rather than summary reports. The credibility of water sample
results is tested by examining all the paperwork covering the sampling, analysis and reporting from three or four
examples.


An internal WSP team audit involves the following checks on each significant hazardous event:
• risk assessment
• control measures
• monitoring
• presence of hazard
• emergency plan
• improvements.


In the internal audits performed by the WSP team, around 50 people (about 33% of the staff) are involved in the audit.
In the audits performed by external auditors (internal and external), usually around 25 people are involved. Table 9
indicates the length of time taken for a typical internal audit performed by the WSP team.


Table 9: Typical internal audit duration

 Area                      Duration
 Operations                2–4 hours for each water treatment plant depending on the size of the plant; 8 hours for distribution
 Maintenance               8 hours
 Laboratory                4 hours
 Planning                  2 hours
 Construction              2 hours
 Planning                  2 hours
 External relations        2 hours



External audit by a team of two auditors usually takes two days.


Generally, the time allocation of all audits is:
• desk study: 50%
• field visits: 40%
• interviews: 10%.


The auditors give advice to the water supplier on WSP implementation throughout the audit and in the audit report.
(The frequency of advice is much greater than during ISO 22000 audits.) Audit reports are developed for all types of
audits, and non-conformities are documented. Each non-conformity must have a cause analysis and defined actions.
For the external audit, the actions required to overcome the non-conformity must be communicated to the auditor to
receive their approval. In the next audit, the auditor verifies the effectiveness of those actions. Strong and weak points
are identified.
40   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     A total of 24 internal and external audits have been performed since the audit scheme was established. From AdA’s
     perspective, the main benefit of WSP auditing is the opportunity to:
     • formally assess the WSP;
     • properly review if the plan is in line with the organization’s operations and procedures;
     • improve and discuss new solutions;
     • verify if improvement actions are being updated; and
     • use internal audits made by the WSP team as internal ‘consultancy’.


     AdA also notes the following WSP auditing challenges:
     • an external auditor’s views are not always in line with the organization’s strategy; and
     • internal audits carried out by the WSP team may generate internal human resource conflicts.

A.3 Victoria, Australia
(External regulatory/formal auditing)

Audits of RMPs (equivalent to WSPs) are a regulatory requirement under Victoria’s Safe Drinking Water Act 2003. The
purpose of the audit is to determine if a water agency has prepared, implemented, reviewed and revised an RMP that
complies with the legal requirements.


The regulator (Department of Health & Human Services, Victoria) initiates the audit process through a written notice
to a water agency to undertake an audit. The water agency then engages an independent regulator-approved auditor to
carry out the audit at the water agency’s own expense. The regulator determines the time period in which the audits
are to be completed. The water agency is encouraged to consider changing auditors after three consecutive audits, and
auditors are required to sign a declaration that they have no conflict of interest that would prevent them from carrying
out an unbiased audit.


Prior to each audit period, the regulator produces guidance material on the audit process and audit criteria (or
‘auditable elements’), and provides briefing sessions for auditors covering the broad audit framework. Auditor training
is arranged independently and the audit methodology is up to the auditor.


Audits take two to four days to complete, depending on the size and number of water supplies being audited, and will
generally involve between two and 10 water agency staff. Audits consist of reviews of documents, procedures and
on-site practices as well as interviews with staff. The regulatory audit requirement is quite prescriptive regarding the
documents to be examined:
• the RMP;
• any document or operating manual, procedure or protocol relating to the RMP; and
• any training and competency manual relating to the responsibilities of staff to manage and deal with risks identified in
  the RMP and emergencies, incidents or events that may adversely affect the quality of raw and treated drinking-water.


The credibility of the documentation is determined by the auditor’s training and experience.


The regulator’s audit guidance stipulates that in order for an RMP to be assessed as compliant, there must be evidence
that each auditable element has been developed, has been effectively implemented, reviewed and amended where
required and the RMP is aligned with good risk management practice. However, auditors have been given the freedom
to assign a compliant score to an auditable element while also identifying opportunities for improvement, which has
helped engender positive feedback from the water suppliers on the audits and audit process. Non-compliant findings
are rated as minor, major or critical non-compliance, as outlined in Table 10.


The conclusions and findings of each audit are communicated during a meeting at the end of the audit between the
auditor and water agency staff, and formalized in a report and an audit certificate. The report and certificate are
provided to the water agency and the regulator. If a water agency is found to comply with regulatory requirements, it
receives a letter of congratulations from the regulator. If a water agency is found to be non-compliant, issues of non-
compliance are discussed with the regulator and the water agency gives a commitment on how it will address those
issues.


The first audits under the Safe Drinking Water Act 2003 were conducted in 2008. Of the 25 water agencies that were
audited, 15 were found to have RMPs that complied fully with the legislative requirements of the Act, whereas 10 did not.
42   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     Since 2008, audits have been conducted on three further occasions (2009, 2011–12 and 2013–14), and in each of these
     audit periods 23 water agencies have been assessed as being compliant, with two being found to be non-compliant. The
     water agencies found to be non-compliant in each of the audit periods were different to those in the previous audit
     period.


     Feedback from auditors suggests that water agencies generally have a good understanding of RMP concepts and
     terminology, the audits are carried out in an open and cooperative way and information is provided readily.

A.4 New Zealand
(External regulatory/formal auditing)

Community and Public Health (CPH) is a division of the Canterbury District Health Board providing regional public
health services. CPH includes a drinking-water auditing body contracted by New Zealand’s Ministry of Health and is
accredited as an AS/NZS ISO/IEC 17020:2013 (incorporating ISO/IEC 17020:2012) inspection body by International
Accreditation New Zealand. CPH has 30 years’ experience in the public health sector, including 10 years’ experience in
the drinking-water regulatory field. The division has significant experience in the preparation approval and auditing (or
‘assessment’, which is the terminology in New Zealand) of WSPs in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, with 150–200
audits undertaken.


CPH uses a specified auditing method included within nationally controlled procedures, which has been in use since
2008 and consists of a checklist and standard reporting template. The checklist involves assessing the critical control
points of the water supply system and any critical improvements that the water supplier had indicated would be carried
out. The audit aims to assess evidence and make observations that controls and associated monitoring are effectively in
place and that there is evidence that improvements have been completed or are under way. The audit also reviews any
events that have occurred since the last audit and checks how well the WSP dealt with them. There is also a check on
any changes to the water supply to see if they present any additional risks and if the WSP has been updated accordingly.


The audit consists of a desk review of documents, interviewing staff on site and direct observation of plant processes
and environs. The documentation examined can include water quality data, WSP methodology, external reports
commissioned by the supplier, operating instructions, emergency procedures, standard operating records, incident
reports and follow-up actions, supporting programmes such as catchment assessment, asset management software and
database records, and on-line supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) results.


The drinking-water auditor (or ‘assessor’) adopts an open questions approach, providing feedback and commentary
throughout the audit and any findings are reiterated in the audit report. (Note that auditors are not to provide
operational solutions or advice. The auditor may identify gaps or issues but should not prescribe how they should
be fixed.) Recommendations are areas where the auditor has identified that improvement could be made but do not
amount to non-conformance with the WSP. Handwritten notes are recorded at the time of the audit on the checklist.
This is scanned and retained electronically by CPH. A meeting is normally held at the end of the audit and the audit
findings are discussed.


This case study describes a standardized WSP audit conducted by CPH as part of contracted services to the Ministry
of Health. The audited water supply is owned by a local authority and run by a contractor. It provides ultraviolet (UV)
treated surface water to a population of about 450 people. The water is sourced from two shallow river gravel wells,
there is no filtration and the performance of two UV treatment units has not been validated. The water supply has
never achieved protozoa compliance due to a lack of appropriate treatment and it is occasionally non-compliant for
Escherichia coli, usually after heavy rainfall.


The WSP was originally approved in 2010. It was developed by a consultancy company, which wrote the WSP after
spending some time with the supplier and participating in site visits with the operator. The supplier reviewed the WSP
before submitting it to CPH for ‘approval’, which is a desk exercise. The first WSP audit was carried out within a year
of the start of WSP implementation; this case study describes the second audit.
44   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     The audit was pre-arranged six weeks in advance. Prior to the audit, the auditor reviewed public health files to check
     for any relevant events or incidents and reviewed the WSP and previous audit result. The water supplier assembled
     documentation requested by the auditor (a consultant’s report on reservoir condition and an asset management
     assessment) and organized having appropriate staff on site for the audit. The audit took nine hours (preparation time,
     three hours; on site and travel, four hours; and reporting, two hours). Audit participants were the CPH auditor, a
     trainee auditor, two representatives of the local authority (the water supplier) and two contracted operators of the
     supply.


     The audit found that concepts and terms such as hazard and risk, risk assessment and prioritizing risk were well
     understood by the water supplier, and that less well understood were terms like validation, verification and control
     measures (the last better understood as ‘multi-barrier’). The audit also found the WSP to be easy to understand and
     thorough in identifying risks and priorities according to public health significance. However, a weakness noted was that
     the water supplier, responsible for a number of water supplies, did not provide a method for prioritizing improvements
     across all supplies, nor did it provide a clear indication of how funds were going to be made available for all the
     necessary improvements.


     The meeting normally held at the end of the audit to discuss audit findings was not held, as some staff were absent
     on this occasion. Therefore a provisional report was sent to the water supplier for comment before a final report
     was sent. The audit concluded that reasonable progress was being made towards implementation of the WSP but the
     supplier was not well positioned to be fully compliant with their WSP by the five-year statutory lead-in period allowed
     for smaller suppliers.


     The auditor reported that the audit was friendly, cooperative, open and transparent. Those taking part had met during
     the previous audit. All the information requested by the auditor was provided by the water supplier, some subsequent
     to the audit but the majority at the time of audit. The overall impression was that the audit was useful, helping staff who
     were not involved in the original drafting of the WSP to understand more about the process and helping staff to focus
     on the aspects of the supply system that needed more attention to protect public health.

A.5 Singapore
(External formal/regulatory audit)

In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has mandated the requirement for preparation of drinking-water
safety plans by piped drinking-water suppliers under its Environmental Public Health (Quality of Piped Drinking Water)
Regulations 2008. The water suppliers are required to prepare the WSP in accordance with NEA’s Code of Practice on
Piped Drinking Water Sampling and Safety Plans, which takes reference from WHO’s Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality
(WHO, 1997). The water suppliers are also required to submit their WSP to the NEA’s Director-General of Public
Health for approval, and after seeking the approval, carry out subsequent reviews of the WSP on an annual basis.


In May 2013, a team of officers from the Drinking Water Unit (DWU) of NEA undertook a regulatory audit of
particular aspects of the WSP implemented by a water supplier at one of its water treatment plants. This WSP had
been audited eight times, and thus this was a regular audit, conducted at a frequency of once every six months. The
area of the WSP to be audited was selected on a random basis during the audit, as a full audit of all aspects of the WSP
was carried out earlier during the approval of the WSP.


The aim of the audit was to verify the treatment process outlined within the WSP, discuss the potential water quality
issues, and audit various documents and records relating to calibration of equipment and on-site testing carried out
by the water supplier to verify that the WSP was current and effectively implemented. The audit methodology was as
specified by the regulator, which was based on DWU’s internal procedure and a checklist.


The audit was pre-arranged by the regulator, owing to the security clearance that was required before the audit, and
undertaken by a team of three DWU officers with scientific or engineering backgrounds and trained in auditing. Four
key staff and other relevant staff from the water supplier were involved in the audit, including the plant manager. The
audit included review of the approved WSP documentation and records endorsed by the water supplier’s management,
which took about three hours to carry out. The auditors were supplied with everything they requested at the time of
the audit or it was supplied subsequently, and the regulator described the relationship between the auditors and water
supplier as cooperative and helpful. The audit was described as open and transparent.


The audit concluded that there was no breach of the requirements prescribed under the 2008 regulations and that the
water supplier had a good understanding of the WSP concept and terminology. In addition, the following points were
noted:
• No changes to the water treatment process had been made since the last audit.
• There were no raw water quality issues relating to algal blooms and chironomid larvae.
• No customer complaints regarding the quality of water produced were received by the water treatment plant (WTP).
• No upgrades had been carried out since the last audit, although the water supplier briefly mentioned that sand filter
  refurbishment would commence towards the end of the year.
• The general sanitation and hygiene conditions of the areas inspected within the WTP were satisfactory.
• Water samples from the clear water tank and pumping main had been tested for various water quality parameters
  (turbidity, fluoride and free chlorine) and values were in accordance with the WTP’s internal limits and NEA’s
  regulatory standards.
• The daily water treatment logs were inspected and the results were well within the WTP’s internal limits and NEA’s
  regulatory standards. Based on the records, it was noted that lime was not added during the jar test as efficient
  coagulation could be achieved with the addition of alum and polymer.
46   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     • The maintenance and calibration records for both the on-line and off-line equipment and monitoring systems were
       also reviewed and no unsatisfactory results were noted.


     A formal audit report was produced following the audit and was sent to the water supplier and was stored
     electronically on the regulator’s computer system. The water supplier acknowledged the audit report and, where
     appropriate, provided feedback on the audit findings and process. Plans for follow up on actions required by the water
     supplier have been established.

A.6 South Africa
(External formal/regulatory auditing)

Following a major waterborne disease outbreak in 2005 and the reoccurrence of major drinking-water quality failures in
five towns in 2007, it was concluded that endpoint monitoring alone would be inadequate to manage all risks associated
with the supply of safe drinking-water. The country consequently adopted the WHO WSP concept as the basis for
its Drinking Water Quality Framework, which was released in 2007. The regulation of drinking-water quality was
further intensified with the introduction of the Blue Drop Certification programme. This was the first incentive-based
regulation programme of its kind, with the primary objective of promoting risk-based management of potable water.


In 2010, WSPs accounted for 5% of the Blue Drop score, and at present WSPs account for 35%. As water quality
compliance, process control and asset management contain a strong element of water safety planning, WSPs influence
about 70% of the Blue Drop programme.


The Department of Water and Sanitation (the sector regulator) commenced with audits as part of its Blue Drop
Certification programme in 2008. To date, the department has conducted three annual Blue Drop audits on 152 water
services authorities (municipalities). Over this period, at least 742 WSPs were assessed.


The Blue Drop audits are conducted by a panel of inspectors (or audit team) who are trained on all aspects of the
regulatory requirements (WSPs, process control, water quality compliance, management accountability and asset
management). The inspectors (auditors) include departmental officials from various relevant educational backgrounds
such as engineering and science. Even though an annual training programme ensures uniform application of regulatory
judgment, the department periodically augments its skills base with private specialists to enhance capability. The
credibility of the process can be tarnished if the audit team is not sufficiently skilled since some of the municipal and
water board officials are highly experienced in their field.


All municipalities are consulted on the requirements of the annual audit up to six months in advance of the
commencement of the audit cycle, and the audit schedule is published up to two months prior to commencing. This
approach is followed to allow sufficient time for audit preparation.


The audit is carried out in three phases:


1. An on-site detailed assessment of both documents and implemented processes (two days), which includes:
   • interviewing staff
   • assessing monitoring records
   • assessing the WSP
   • assessing evidence of WSP implementation, e.g. water treatment processes, laboratory work.


2. An off-site assessment of monitoring, compliance and content of WSPs (about one month).
   The auditors collect data and information to determine credibility of the water safety planning process. Section
   81 of the Water Services Act compels municipalities to furnish the Department of Water and Sanitation with
   information required for (regulatory) performance monitoring processes. A scorecard detailing very specific
   questions has to be completed for every water supply system audited to confirm the WSP is being implemented and
   the water supplier is not just presenting information in a document. Information related to water safety planning,
   risk assessment, risk-based monitoring, drinking-water quality data credibility and incident management has to be
48   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



         furnished. As of 2014, the weighting of the WSP requirement for Blue Drop Certification (35% of the total) is as
         follows:
         • WSP process (10%): skills diversity of WSP team, indication that the WSP is a process rather than simply a
           document, and applicability of WSP to the specific water supply system;
         • risk assessment (35%): adequate coverage of catchment, treatment and reticulation, risk prioritization
           methodology, adequacy of identified control measures and treatment efficacy (as per water quality assessment);
         • risk-based monitoring (30%): adequacy of operational and compliance monitoring;
         • drinking-water quality data credibility (15%): laboratory accreditation and proficiency; and
         • incident management (10%): incident management protocol and incident management register and report.


     3. Confirmation sessions following official audit feedback where the water supplier can present evidence should there
         be any points of dispute. Interaction between the audit team and water supplier (and water board) is encouraged to
         ensure the improvement of the WSP in general.


     Blue Drop audit results are published in a Blue Drop report, which is a public document. However, the public report
     does not reveal any specific risk details of the water supply system, but rather comments on any process shortcomings.
     The reason for this is to avoid an unfavourable situation when confidential information is published through a regulatory
     report. Specifics are discussed and reported during the confirmation sessions.


     The release of this report forms the pinnacle of the incentive-based regulation programme since it either provides
     public recognition for those doing well or discomfort for those under-performing. Reporting serves to apply pressure
     to improve drinking-water quality management in a constructive manner.


     The whole audit process (from phase 1 to report publication) takes about five to six months.

A.7 England and Wales
(External formal/regulatory auditing)

The public water industry in England and Wales comprises 27 water companies (or water suppliers) operating 1 249
works, 4 430 service reservoirs and over 347 500 km of mains providing about 14 490 million litres of water to 57
million customers every day. The Chief Inspector of Drinking Water for England and Wales regulates the quality of
water supplied by these water companies and also carries out checks to ensure that local authorities are meeting their
responsibilities for the regulation of small private water supplies. The powers of the Chief Inspector (and inspectors)
are set out in the Water Industry Act 1991 and amended by the Water Act 2003. Inspectors are collectively known
as the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI), a government organization that came into being in 1990. The inspectorate
has various powers to obtain information as part of any investigation, including the right of entry, and is able to take
enforcement action by putting in place legally binding agreements for remedial action such as notices and orders or by
initiating prosecution proceedings in the courts. Until recently DWI was funded directly by the government, now it
recovers its operating costs related to regulatory activities from public water suppliers.


Drinking-water quality standards are set out in separate regulations covering public and private water supplies and
must be met at the point where consumers draw off water for use. These regulations include a requirement for public
water suppliers (and local authorities in respect of small private water supplies) to have the WSP approach in place
covering all their water supply systems. The legal requirement for the WSP approach takes the form of a duty to
comprehensively risk assess a water supply and to keep this risk assessment under review. When public water suppliers
do not comply with these requirements, DWI can follow up with several levels of enforcement.


DWI encouraged the water industry to adopt the WSP approach from 2006 onwards. Initially they carried out
site-based informal audits to check on progress and offer advice. In 2008, the WSP approach became a regulatory
requirement, and after three years, DWI conducted a formal external audit on WSP implementation. This consisted
of public water suppliers providing DWI with the outputs of the WSP approach such as the suppliers’ water safety
planning methodology, extracts of health risk assessments, risk assessment outcomes and conclusions, and actions for
implementing further risk mitigation. DWI did not specify a standard approach or requirement for the documentation
of the approach, allowing suppliers to develop their own methodology in accordance with WHO Guidelines for Drinking-
water Quality (2011).


This initial formal external audit focused on risk management outputs and outcomes, with particular reference to
ensuring that water companies had included these in their business plans. The results of the audit generally showed
good progress in the development of the approach. There was no clear pattern of a common weakness but validation
of controls was seen as having the biggest scope for improvement in terms of collecting data to inform risk assessments.


Since this time, WSP auditing has become a rolling process informed particularly by water quality or sufficiency events,
consumer complaints, compliance results and risk assessment conclusions. In addition, DWI’s approach to technical
audit is fully risk-based whereby a wide range of technical and other information about the water companies is brought
together and analysed to identify where a site visit is likely to add the greatest benefit in terms of reducing risk to water
quality through advice, recommendations or enforcement. In 2014, DWI carried out 468 technical audits, of which 31
were deemed unsatisfactory.

     B.1 List of threats to water safety
     Below is a list of possible water safety threats at various points along the water supply chain. Auditors may find it useful
     to take this list to the field to support the challenging task of determining whether the WSP reflects due consideration
     of the most relevant hazards and hazardous events.


     The list is not comprehensive and not all concerns listed below will apply in all situations. It is also important to note
     that the examples below are not fully developed hazardous events. In the WSP, hazardous events should always clearly
     describe the impact on water quality and the cause.


     For auditors of small water supplies, sanitary inspection forms can be used instead of, or in addition to, this list when
     considering whether or not the WSP addresses the most significant hazards and hazardous events.

     B.2 Audit criteria and evaluation guidance
     This section contains examples of audit criteria and/or evaluation guidance from Australia, South Africa, Bhutan and the
     Lao People’s Democratic Republic. It also contains a general audit (or ‘assessment’) form designed specifically for small
     systems.


     B.2.i Victoria, Australia
     In Victoria, Australia, the various audit criteria are assigned one of the following codes indicating the degree of
     compliance with each audit criterion.



      A: Compliance
      Indicates conformance of the RMP and/or drinking-water quality management system elements with one or more of the auditable elements, legislative
      requirements or risk management activities.

      OFI: Opportunity for improvement
      This comment may relate to a conforming or non-conforming clause of the RMP or drinking-water quality management system that does not contravene a
      legislative requirement. It is not itself a non-conformance. It may include opportunities for improvement, comments that may be relevant to the next audit
      or against best practice considerations, or incidental or isolated discrepancies.

      Mi: Minor non-conformance
      A minor non-conformance is defined as a non-compliance with one or more of the auditable elements, legislative requirements or risk management
      activities where the potential impact of the non-conformance is not likely to be a serious or imminent risk to public health.

      Ma: Major non-conformance
      A major non-conformance is defined as a non-compliance with one or more of the auditable elements, legislative requirements or risk management
      activities where there is a high potential for a risk situation and that risk situation is likely to compromise public health if the non-conformance is not
      rectified.

      C: Critical non-conformance
      A critical non-conformance is defined as a non-compliance with one or more of the auditable elements, legislative requirements or risk management
      activities where a serious or imminent risk to public health is indicated.

56   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     B.2.iii Bhutan and Lao People’s Democratic Republic
     Below is the audit guidance note used in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Bhutan for internal and external/
     regulatory audits. The guidance note contains audit criteria and detailed scoring guidance. The audit criteria reflect
     the major elements of the nationally adopted WSP approach and have been designed to gauge the quality of WSP
     development and the degree of implementation. Note that due to local preferences and convention, the audit guidance
     note uses ‘assess’ and ‘assessor’ rather than ‘audit’ and ‘auditor’.


     Audit criteria are scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating full compliance or achievement and 0 indicating little or no
     compliance. (The scoring scale used in Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Bhutan is in fact 1–5 rather than 0–4.
     However, due to an observed tendency for auditors to instinctively assign a score of 0 for complete non-compliance
     with a question or criterion, the scale has been changed from 0–4 for this document.) In most cases, scenarios that
     warrant a score of 0, 2 and 4 have been provided, with room for auditors to assign scores of 1 or 3 using their own
     discretion for situations that fall in between the pre-defined reference scenarios. Scores are totalled at the end of
     each section, and each section is assigned a qualitative rating as shown in Figure 2. Ultimately, all section scores are
     summed and an overall audit score and associated qualitative rating are assigned for the WSP. For the sake of brevity,
     the scoring boxes at the end of each WSP section have been omitted from this document such that only the scoring
     summary table at the end of the form is provided here.


     Figure 2: Qualitative ratings



             >95%              85–95%             75–85%     65–75%         50–65%           50%




                                                                                            PRIORITY
                                                                             BELOW
           EXCELLENT          VERY GOOD             GOOD     AVERAGE                       ATTENTION
                                                                            AVERAGE
                                                                                             NEEDED




     The qualitative ratings above indicate the following:
     • Excellent: highest achievement. WSP is thorough, up to date and fully implemented. Water quality risks are well
       managed.
     • Very good: WSP is generally complete, up to date and well implemented. Some opportunities exist to strengthen the
       WSP, its implementation and/or record keeping.
     • Good: major WSP elements have been generally addressed and good progress has been made to implement the
       WSP. Several opportunities exist to strengthen the WSP, its implementation and/or record keeping.
     • Average: major WSP elements have been generally addressed and some progress has been made to implement
       the WSP. Focused efforts by the WSP team are needed to strengthen the WSP, its implementation and/or record
       keeping to lift WSP quality above average.
     • Below average: the WSP is not sufficiently complete, up to date and/or implemented. Attention is needed to
       improve water quality risk management.
     • Priority attention needed: there are a number of critical gaps in the WSP and/or its implementation indicating
       insufficient water quality risk management. Priority attention is needed to ensure water safety.

      meetings held and      should review these records for the audit period (or for a period of at least one
      recorded?              year). Score 4 only if target frequency is documented in the WSP and there is
                             evidence that meetings are held at this frequency; score 2 if there is partial

68   A practical guide to auditing water safety plans



     B.2.iv Water safety plan assessment form for small water supplies
     The purpose of this form is to guide the assessment or audit of a WSP for a small water supply system, whether it is
     managed by a community, the local government or an institution (school or health care facility), for example. The form
     was developed for use by surveillance authorities or others providing ongoing monitoring of, or support for, WSP
     implementation.


     There are a number of considerations the assessor should bear in mind:


     Setting the right tone: It is important to approach the WSP assessment as a learning opportunity for the WSP team
     and for you, the assessor. Making clear the spirit of the assessment and helping the WSP team to feel comfortable
     should be one of your highest priorities. The WSP team should understand that you are there to provide guidance
     and support, not to ‘police’ their WSP activities. The ultimate goal of the assessment is to improve management of the
     water supply and thereby drinking-water safety.


     Scheduling the assessment: You will need to visit the scheme to carry out the assessment, and you should plan a
     meeting with the WSP team in advance of your visit. When scheduling your visit, be sure to allow plenty of time for a
     walk through the scheme to see, for instance, the spring box, the well, the reservoir and a few tap stands. This field visit
     will be necessary to answer a number of the questions on this form. You may want to take your camera or smartphone
     along with you to take a few pictures as well.


     Using the assessment table:
     • Column A – discussion questions
       These are the questions for you to ask the WSP team directly to initiate a conversation about various WSP activities.
       There are no ‘yes/no’ questions in column A, but rather more open questions that are intended to encourage
       discussion.
     • Column B – what to look for
       These questions are for your consideration as you explore WSP strengths and improvement opportunities.
       Wherever possible, you should look for evidence related to the various questions or activities to be sure you fully
       understand the situation. You may elect not to ask the WSP team directly all of the questions in column B, but rather
       use them as an internal guide for conducting the assessment. Where a WSP is at an early stage of development, for
       example, it may be best not to emphasize WSP shortcomings by reading all questions aloud, so as not to discourage
       the WSP team.
     • Column C – assessor observations
       For each question, you should record the strengths and successes of the WSP, as well as key shortcomings and
       opportunities for improvement. It is important to provide balanced feedback that reflects the local context and the
       feasibility of improvements.
     • Column D – agreed follow-up actions for improvement
       For each question, you and the WSP team should review the improvement opportunities noted, as well as the
       WSP team’s response to the question, ‘Do you face challenges with this task?’ You should then lead a discussion on
       appropriate follow-up actions and record recommendations.


     Reporting assessment findings: It is important that you provide the WSP team with a written summary of the
     assessment findings, indicating the assessment date, general impressions, key discoveries and agreements for follow
     up. It may be appropriate for you to enter the summary into a meeting minutes register so that the record is readily
     available for the WSP team.
