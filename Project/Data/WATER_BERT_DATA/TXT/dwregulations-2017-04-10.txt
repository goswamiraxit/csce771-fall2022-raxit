ARTICLE 2.5. Point-of-Use Treatment
§64417. Definitions.
“Point-of-use treatment device” or “POU” means a treatment device applied to a single
tap for the purpose of reducing contaminants in drinking water at that tap.

§64418. General Provisions.
    (a) With State Board approval, a public water system may be permitted to use point-
of-use treatment devices (POUs) in lieu of centralized treatment for the purpose of
reducing contaminants to achieve compliance with one or more maximum contaminant
levels in this Chapter, other than for microbial contaminants, volatile organic chemicals,
or radon, if:
        (1) the water system meets the requirements of this Article and any applicable
statutory requirements;
        (2) the water system has demonstrated to the State Board that centralized
treatment for achieving compliance is not economically feasible;
        (3) the water system has applied for a permit or permit amendment to use POUs;
        (4) following a public hearing, the State Board determines pursuant to section
64418.6 that there is no substantial community opposition;
        (5) the water system has a State Board-approved:
        (A) POU Treatment Strategy,
        (B) POU Operations and Maintenance Program, and
        (C) POU Monitoring Program; and
        (6) the water system ensures that each residential unit, dwelling unit, commercial
building or other establishment or institution, served by the water system, has a POU
installed pursuant to this Article.

     (b) With State Board approval and without having to meet the requirement of
subsection (a)(6), a public water system may utilize POUs in lieu of centralized treatment
for the purpose of reducing contaminants, other than microbial contaminants, volatile
organic chemicals, or radon, to levels at or below one or more of the maximum
contaminant levels established in this Chapter, in the water it supplies to some or all of
the persons it serves, but the water system will not be deemed in compliance without
meeting the requirement of subsection (a)(6). A water system’s application for a permit to
utilize POU’s pursuant to this subsection may include a request that one or more of the
requirements of this article be amended or eliminated to address the water system’s
specific utilization, and such request may be granted or denied by the State Board.

§64418.1. Economic Feasibility of Centralized Treatment.
   (a) To meet the requirements of section 64418(a)(2), a community water system shall
submit to the State Board information demonstrating that the:
       (1) estimated cost of centralized treatment, per household, is more than one
percent (1%) of the median household income (MHI) of the customers served by the
community water system; or
                                                                                                            64

        (2) estimated cost of centralized treatment, per household, plus the median water
bill from the most recent 12 months is:
            (A) if the community’s MHI is equal to or less than the statewide MHI, more
than 1.5 percent (1.5%) of the MHI of the customers served by the community water
system, or
            (B) if the community’s MHI is greater than the statewide MHI, more than two
percent (2%) of the MHI of the customers served by the community water system.

    (b) The estimated cost of centralized treatment may include, but is not limited to, the
costs associated with equipment, design and construction, residual disposal, monitoring,
and operation and maintenance.

    (c) The public water system shall submit to the State Board the supporting
documentation, assumptions, and calculations used to determine any anticipated increase
in water bills to be presented pursuant to section 64418.6(a)(4).

    (a) As ensured by the public water system, each POU shall:
        (1) If the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) has issued a product
standard applicable to the specific type of POU, be independently certified in accordance
with the standard;
        (2) If ANSI has not issued a product standard applicable to the specific type of
proposed POU, be approved by the State Board;
        (3) If an ANSI-issued standard does not adequately address a California drinking
water standard or if a POU has not been independently certified for a specific
contaminant, be approved by the State Board;
        (4) Be owned, controlled, operated, and maintained by the public water system
and/or a person(s) under contract with the water system, to ensure proper operation,
maintenance, monitoring, and compliance with this Article and applicable drinking water
standards;
        (5) Be equipped with a mechanical warning (e.g. alarm, light, etc.) that alerts
users when a unit needs maintenance or is no longer operating in a manner that assures
the unit is producing effluent meeting state and federal drinking water standards, unless
the device is equipped with an automatic shut-off mechanism that prevents the flow of
water under such circumstances; and
        (6) If requested by the State Board, be equipped with a totalizing flow meter.

   (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), pilot testing shall be performed by the public
water system, and/or a person(s) under contract with the water system, on each proposed

§64423. Routine Sampling.
    (a) Each water supplier shall collect routine bacteriological water samples as follows:
        (1) The minimum number of samples for community water systems shall be based
on the known population served or the total number of service connections, whichever
results in the greater number of samples, as shown in Table 64423-A. A community
water system using groundwater which serves 25-1000 persons may request from the
State Board a reduction in monitoring frequency. The minimum reduced frequency shall
not be less than one sample per quarter.
        (2) The minimum number of samples for nontransient-noncommunity water
systems shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A
during those months when the system is operating. A nontransient-noncommunity water
system using groundwater which serves 25-1000 persons may request from the State
Board a reduction in monitoring frequency if it has not violated the requirements in this
article during the past twelve months. The minimum reduced frequency shall not be less
than one sample per quarter.
        (3) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems
using groundwater and serving 1000 or fewer persons a month shall be one in each
calendar quarter during which the system provides water to the public.
        (4) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems
using groundwater and serving more than 1000 persons during any month shall be based
on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A, except that the water
supplier may request from the State Board a reduction in monitoring for any month the
system serves 1000 persons or fewer. The minimum reduced frequency shall not be less
than one sample in each calendar quarter during which the system provides water to the
public.
        (5) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems
using approved surface water shall be based on the population served as shown in Table
                                                                                                            80

begin monitoring at this frequency by the end of the sixth month after the State Board has
designated the source to be approved surface water.
        (6) A public water system shall collect samples at regular time intervals
throughout the month, except that a system using groundwater which serves 4,900
persons or fewer may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from
different sites.

    (b) In addition to the minimum sampling requirements, all water suppliers using
approved surface water which do not practice treatment in compliance with Sections
64650 through 64666, shall collect a minimum of one sample before or at the first service
connection each day during which the turbidity level of the water delivered to the system
exceeds 1 NTU. The sample shall be collected within 24 hours of the exceedance and
shall be analyzed for total coliforms. If the water supplier is unable to collect and/or
analyze the sample within the 24-hour time period because of extenuating circumstances
beyond its control, the supplier shall notify the State Board within the 24-hour time
period and may request an extension. Sample results shall be included in determining
compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Section 64426.1.

   (c) If any routine, repeat, or replacement sample is total coliform-positive, then the
water supplier shall collect repeat samples in accordance with Section 64424 and comply
with the reporting requirements specified in Sections 64426 and 64426.1.

§64423.1. Sample Analysis and Reporting of Results.
     (a) The water supplier shall designate (label) each sample as routine, repeat,
replacement, or “other” pursuant to Section 64421(b), and have each sample analyzed for
total coliforms. The supplier also shall require the laboratory to analyze the same sample
for fecal coliforms or Escherichia coli (E. coli) whenever the presence of total coliforms
is indicated. As a minimum, the analytical results shall be reported in terms of the
presence or absence of total or fecal coliforms, or E. coli in the sample, whichever is
appropriate.

    (b) The water supplier shall require the laboratory to notify the supplier within 24
hours, whenever the presence of total coliforms, fecal coliforms or E. coli is
demonstrated in a sample or a sample is invalidated due to interference problems,
pursuant to Section 64425(b), and shall ensure that a contact person is available to
receive these analytical results 24-hours a day. The water supplier shall also require the
laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of any positive bacteriological results if
the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the designated contact person within 24
hours.

    (c) Analytical results of all required samples collected for a system in a calendar
month shall be reported to the State Board not later than the tenth day of the following
month, as follows:
        (1) The water supplier shall submit a monthly summary of the bacteriological
monitoring results to the State Board.
        (2) For systems serving fewer than 10,000 service connections or 33,000 persons,
the water supplier shall require the laboratory to submit copies of all required
bacteriological monitoring results directly to the State Board.
        (3) For systems serving more than 10,000 service connections, or 33,000 persons,
the water supplier shall require the laboratory to submit copies of bacteriological
monitoring results for all positive routine samples and all repeat samples directly to the
State Board.

    (d) Laboratory reports shall be retained by the water supplier for a period of at least
five years and shall be made available to the State Board upon request.




                                                                                                            83

§64424. Repeat Sampling.
    (a) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, the water supplier shall collect a
repeat sample set as described in paragraph (1) within 24 hours of being notified of the
positive result. The repeat samples shall all be collected within the same 24 hour time
period. A single service connection system may request that the State Board allow the
collection of the repeat sample set over a four-day period.
        (1) For a water supplier that normally collects more than one routine sample a
month, a repeat sample set shall be at least three samples for each total coliform-positive
sample. For a water supplier that normally collects one or fewer samples per month, a
repeat sample set shall be at least four samples for each total coliform-positive sample.
        (2) If the water supplier is unable to collect the samples within the 24-hour time
period specified in subsection (a) or deliver the samples to the laboratory within 24 hours
after collection because of circumstances beyond its control, the water supplier shall
notify the State Board within 24 hours. The State Board will then determine how much
time the supplier will have to collect the repeat samples.

   (b) When collecting the repeat sample set, the water supplier shall collect at least one
repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample
was taken. Other repeat samples shall be collected within five service connections
upstream or downstream of the original site. At least one sample shall be from upstream
and one from downstream unless there is no upstream and/or downstream service
connection.

    (c) If one or more samples in the repeat sample set is total coliform-positive, the
water supplier shall collect and have analyzed an additional set of repeat samples as
specified in subsections (a) and (b). The supplier shall repeat this process until either no
coliforms are detected in one complete repeat sample set or the supplier determines that
the MCL for total coliforms specified in Section 64426.1 has been exceeded and notifies
the State Board.

     (d) If a public water system for which fewer than five routine samples/month are
collected has one or more total coliform-positive samples, the water supplier shall collect
at least five routine samples the following month. If the supplier stops supplying water
during the month after the total coliform-positive(s), at least five samples shall be
collected during the first month the system resumes operation. A water supplier may
request the State Board waive the requirement to collect at least five routine samples the
following month, but a waiver will not be granted solely on the basis that all repeat
samples are total coliform-negative. To request a waiver, one of the following conditions
shall be met:
         (1) The State Board conducts a site visit before the end of the next month the
system provides water to the public to determine whether additional monitoring and/or
corrective action is necessary to protect public health.

                                                                                                            84

        (2) The State Board determines why the sample was total coliform-positive and
establishes that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before
the end of the next month the system serves water to the public. If a waiver is granted, a
system shall collect at least one routine sample before the end of the next month it serves
water to the public and use it to determine compliance with Section 64426.1.

§64425. Sample Invalidation.
    (a) A water supplier may request the State Board to invalidate a sample for which a
total coliform-positive result has been reported if the supplier demonstrates:
        (1) All repeat sample(s) collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-
positive sample also are total coliform- positive and all repeat samples collected within
five service connections of the original tap are not total coliform-positive; or
        (2) The laboratory did not follow the prescribed analytical methods pursuant to
Section 64415(a), based on a review of laboratory documentation by the State Board.
The supplier shall submit to the State Board a written request for invalidation along with
the laboratory documentation, the supplier's sample collection records and any
observations noted during sample collection and delivery. The water supplier shall
require the laboratory to provide the supplier with documentation which shall include, but
not be limited to:
            (A) A letter from the director of the laboratory having generated the data,
confirming the invalidation request by reason of laboratory accident or error;
            (B) Complete sample identification, laboratory sample log number (if used),
date and time of collection, date and time of receipt by the laboratory, date and time of
analysis for the sample(s) in question;
            (C) Complete description of the accident or error alleged to have invalidated
the result(s);
            (D) Copies of all analytical, operating, and quality assurance records
pertaining to the incident in question; and
            (E) Any observations noted by laboratory personnel when receiving and
analyzing the sample(s) in question.

    (b) Whenever any total coliform sample result indicative of the absence of total
coliforms has been declared invalid by the laboratory due to interference problems as
specified at 40 Code Federal Regulations, Section 141.21(c)(2), the supplier shall collect
a replacement sample from the same location as the original sample within 24 hours of
being notified of the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of total
coliforms. The supplier shall continue to re-sample at the original site within 24 hours
and have the samples analyzed until a valid result is obtained.

§64426. Significant Rise in Bacterial Count.
   (a) Any of the following criteria shall indicate a possible significant rise in bacterial
count:

                                                                                                            85

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        (1) A system collecting at least 40 samples per month has a total coliform-positive
routine sample followed by two total coliform-positive repeat samples in the repeat
sample set;
        (2) A system has a sample which is positive for fecal coliform or E. coli; or
        (3) A system fails the total coliform Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) as
defined in Section 64426.1.

    (b) When the coliform levels specified in subsection (a) are reached or exceeded, the
water supplier shall:
        (1) Contact the State Board by the end of the day on which the system is notified
of the test result or the system determines that it has exceeded the MCL, unless the
notification or determination occurs after the State Board office is closed, in which case
the supplier shall notify the State Board within 24 hours; and
        (2) Submit to the State Board information on the current status of physical works
and operating procedures which may have caused the elevated bacteriological findings, or
any information on community illness suspected of being waterborne. This shall include,
but not be limited to:
             (A) Current operating procedures that are or could potentially be related to the
increase in bacterial count;
             (B) Any interruptions in the treatment process;
             (C) System pressure loss to less than 5 psi;
             (D) Vandalism and/or unauthorized access to facilities;
             (E) Physical evidence indicating bacteriological contamination of facilities;
             (F) Analytical results of any additional samples collected, including source
samples;
             (G) Community illness suspected of being waterborne; and
             (H) Records of the investigation and any action taken.

   (c) Upon receiving notification from the State Board of a significant rise in bacterial
count, the water supplier shall implement the emergency notification plan required by
Section 116460, Health and Safety Code.

§64426.1. Total Coliform Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL).
    (a) Results of all samples collected in a calendar month pursuant to Sections 64423,
64424, and 64425 that are not invalidated by the State Board or the laboratory shall be
included in determining compliance with the total coliform MCL. Special purpose
samples such as those listed in section 64421(b) and samples collected by the water
supplier during special investigations shall not be used to determine compliance with the
total coliform MCL.

    (b) A public water system is in violation of the total coliform MCL when any of the
following occurs:

                                                                                                            86

        (1) For a public water system which collects at least 40 samples per month, more
than 5.0 percent of the samples collected during any month are total coliform-positive; or
        (2) For a public water system which collects fewer than 40 samples per month,
more than one sample collected during any month is total coliform-positive; or
        (3) Any repeat sample is fecal coliform-positive or E. coli-positive; or
        (4) Any repeat sample following a fecal coliform-positive or E. coli-positive
routine sample is total coliform-positive.

     (c) If a public water system is not in compliance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (4),
during any month in which it supplies water to the public, the water supplier shall notify
the State Board by the end of the business day on which this is determined, unless the
determination occurs after the State Board office is closed, in which case the supplier
shall notify the State Board within 24 hours of the determination. The water supplier shall
also notify the consumers served by the water system. A Tier 2 Public Notice shall be
given for violations of paragraph (b)(1) or (2), pursuant to section 64463.4. A Tier 1
Public Notice shall be given for violations of paragraph (b)(3) or (4), pursuant to section
64463.1.

§64426.5. Variance from Total Coliform Maximum Contaminant Level.
A water system may apply to the State Board for a variance from the total coliform MCL
in section 64426.1(b)(1) or (2). To be eligible for a variance, the water system shall
demonstrate that it meets the following criteria:
    (a) During the thirty days prior to application for a variance, water entering the
distribution system has:
        (1) Been free from fecal coliform or E. coli occurrence based on at least daily
sampling;
        (2) Contained less than one total coliform per hundred milliliters of water in at
least ninety-five percent of all samples based on at least daily sampling;
        (3) Complied with the turbidity requirements of section 64653, if approved
surface water; and

Board that the occurrence is not due to contamination entering the distribution system;

    (e) The system has undergone a sanitary survey conducted by the State Board within
the past twelve months;

    (f) The system maintains a cross-connection control program in accordance with
sections 7583 through 7605, title 17 of the California Code of Regulations;

   (g) The system agrees to submit a biofilm control plan to the State Board within
twelve months of the granting of the first request for a variance;

     (h) The system monitors general distribution system bacterial quality by conducting
heterotrophic bacteria plate counts on at least a weekly basis at a minimum of ten percent
of the number of total coliform sites specified in the approved sample siting plan
(preferably using the methods in section 9215(a), 18th edition of Standard Methods for
the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 1992, American Public Health Association,
et. al); and

    (i) The system conducts daily monitoring at distribution system total coliform
monitoring sites approved by the State Board and maintains a detectable disinfectant
residual at a minimum of ninety-five percent of those points and a heterotrophic plate
count of less than 500 colonies per mL at sites without a disinfectant residual.

    (j) No water system shall be eligible for a variance or exemption from the MCL for
total coliforms unless it demonstrates that the violation of the total coliform MCL is due
to a persistent growth of total coliforms in the distribution system pursuant to section
64426.5, rather than to fecal or pathogenic contamination, a treatment lapse or deficiency,
or a problem in the operation or maintenance of the distribution system.

§64427. Sanitary Survey.

§64432. Monitoring and Compliance--Inorganic Chemicals.
    (a) All public water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the nitrate
and nitrite MCLs in table 64431-A, pursuant to subsections (d) through (f) and Section
64432.1. All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor to
determine compliance with the perchlorate MCL, pursuant to subsections (d), (e), and (l),
and section 64432.3. All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems
shall also monitor to determine compliance with the other MCLs in table 64431-A,
pursuant to subsections (b) through (n) and, for asbestos, section 64432.2. Monitoring
shall be conducted in the year designated by the State Board of each compliance period
beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993.

    (b) Unless directed otherwise by the State Board, each community and nontransient-
noncommunity water system shall initiate monitoring for an inorganic chemical within
six months following the effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL for the
chemical and the addition of the chemical to table 64431-A.
                                                                                                            90

        (1) If otherwise performed in accordance with this section, groundwater
monitoring for an inorganic chemical performed no more than two years prior to the
effective date of the regulation establishing the MCL may be used to satisfy the
requirement for initiating monitoring within six months following such effective date.
        (2) For routine monitoring required in subsection (c), chromium monitoring may
be used in lieu of hexavalent chromium monitoring if the chromium results are less than
the chromium DLR set forth in table 64432-A.

    (c) Unless more frequent monitoring is required pursuant to this Chapter, the
frequency of monitoring for the inorganic chemicals listed in table 64431-A, except for
asbestos, nitrate/nitrite, and perchlorate, shall be as follows:
            (1) Each compliance period, all community and nontransient-noncommunity
systems using groundwater shall monitor once during the year designated by the State
Board. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency
and laboratory capacity. All community and nontransient-noncommunity systems using
approved surface water shall monitor annually. All systems monitoring at distribution
entry points which have combined surface and groundwater sources shall monitor
annually.
            (2) Quarterly samples shall be collected and analyzed for any chemical if
analyses of such samples indicate a continuous or persistent trend toward higher levels of
that chemical, based on an evaluation of previous data.

    (d) For the purposes of sections 64432, 64432.1, 64432.2, and 64432.3, detection
shall be defined by the detection limits for purposes of reporting (DLRs) in table 64432-
A.

    (e) Samples shall be collected from each water source or a supplier may collect a
minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system which is
representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the
same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.

    (f) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples
from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of sites to be composited is less
than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR. Approval will be based on a review of three years
of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for groundwater, and intake
location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for surface water.
Compositing shall be done in the laboratory.
            (1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from
sampling sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may
composite among different systems up to the 5-sample limit.
            (2) If any inorganic chemical is detected in the composite sample at a level
equal to or greater than one fifth of the MCL, a follow-up sample shall be analyzed                         92

within 14 days from each sampling site included in the composite for the contaminants
which exceeded the one-fifth-MCL level. If available, duplicates of the original sample
taken from each sampling site used in the composite may be used instead of resampling;
the analytical results shall be reported within 14 days. The water supplier may collect up
to two additional samples each from one or more of the sources to confirm the result(s).
            (3) Compliance for each site shall be determined on the basis of the individual
follow-up samples, or on the average of the follow-up and confirmation sample(s) if the
supplier collects confirmation sample(s) for each detection.

    (g) If the level of any inorganic chemical, except for nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite,
or perchlorate, exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall do one of the following:
             (1) Inform the State Board within 48 hours and monitor quarterly beginning in
the next quarter after the exceedance occurred; or
             (2) Inform the State Board within seven days from the receipt of the analysis
and, as confirmation, collect one additional sample within 14 days from receipt of the
analysis. If the average of the two samples collected exceeds the MCL, this information
shall be reported to the State Board within 48 hours and the water supplier shall monitor
quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the exceedance occurred.

    (h) If the concentration of an inorganic chemical exceeds ten times the MCL, within
48 hours of receipt of the result the water supplier shall notify the State Board and
resample as confirmation. The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result(s)
of the confirmation sample(s) within 24 hours of receipt of the confirmation result(s).
             (1) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is
less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall monitor quarterly
beginning in the quarter following the quarter in which the exceedance occurred.
             (2) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s)
exceeds ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall, if directed by the State Board;
                 (A) Immediately discontinue use of the contaminated water source; and
                 (B) Not return the source to service without written approval from the
State Board.

   (i) Compliance with the MCLs shall be determined by a running annual average; if
any one sample would cause the annual average to exceed the MCL, the system is
immediately in violation. If a system takes more than one sample in a quarter, the
average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when calculating the running
annual average. If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the
running annual average shall be based on an average of the available data.

    (j) If a system using groundwater has collected a minimum of two quarterly samples
or a system using approved surface water has collected a minimum of four quarterly
samples and the sample results have been below the MCL, the system may apply to the
State Board for a reduction in monitoring frequency.
                                                                                                            93

   (k) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1990, and/or data collected in a
manner inconsistent with this section shall not be used in the determination of
compliance with the monitoring requirements for inorganic chemicals.

    (l) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of
this section by a wholesaler providing water to a public water system shall be acceptable
for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this section.

    (m) A water system may apply to the State Board for a waiver from the monitoring
frequencies specified in subsection (c)(1), if the system has conducted at least three
rounds of monitoring (three periods for groundwater sources or three years for approved
surface water sources) and all previous analytical results are less than the MCL. The
water system shall specify the basis for its request. If granted a waiver, a system shall
collect a minimum of one sample per source while the waiver is in effect and the term of
the waiver shall not exceed one compliance cycle (i.e., nine years).

    (n) A water system may be eligible for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies for
cyanide specified in subsection (c)(1) without any prior monitoring if it is able to
document that it is not vulnerable to cyanide contamination pursuant to the requirements
in §64445(d)(1) or (d)(2).

    (o) Transient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor for the inorganic chemicals
in table 64431-A as follows:
        (1) All sources shall be monitored at least once for fluoride; and
        (2) Surface water sources for parks and other facilities with an average daily
population use of more than 1,000 people and/or which are determined to be subject to
potential contamination based on a sanitary survey shall be monitored at the same
frequency as community water systems.

§64432.1. Monitoring and Compliance--Nitrate and Nitrite.
    (a) To determine compliance with the MCL for nitrate in Table 64431-A, all public
water systems using groundwater and transient-noncommunity systems using approved
surface water shall monitor annually, and all community and nontransient-noncommunity
systems using approved surface water shall monitor quarterly.
        (1) The water supplier shall require the laboratory to notify the supplier within 24
hours whenever the level of nitrate in a single sample exceeds the MCL, and shall ensure
that a contact person is available to receive such analytical results 24-hours a day. The
water supplier shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of
any acute nitrate MCL exceedance if the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the
designated contact person within 24 hours. Within 24 hours of notification, the water
supplier shall:
            (A) Collect another sample, and
                                                                                                            94

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

             (B) Analyze the new sample; if the average of the two nitrate sample results
exceeds the MCL, report the result to the State Board within 24 hours. If the average does
not exceed the MCL, inform the State Board of the results within seven days from the
receipt of the original analysis.
             (C) If a system is unable to resample within 24 hours, it shall notify the
consumers by issuing a Tier 1 Public Notice pursuant to section 64463.1 and shall collect
and analyze a confirmation sample within two weeks of notification of the results of the
first sample.
         (2) For public water systems using groundwater, the repeat monitoring frequency
shall be quarterly for at least one year following any one sample in which the
concentration is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL. After four consecutive
quarterly samples are less than the MCL, a system may request that the State Board
reduce monitoring frequency to annual sampling.
         (3) For public water systems using approved surface water, the repeat monitoring
frequency shall be quarterly following any one sample in which the concentration is
greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL. After four consecutive quarterly samples
are less than 50 percent of the MCL, a system may request that the State Board reduce
monitoring frequency to annual sampling. A system using approved surface water shall
return to quarterly monitoring if any one sample is greater than or equal to 50 percent of
the MCL.
         (4) After any round of quarterly sampling is completed, each community and
nontransient-noncommunity system which initiates annual monitoring shall take
subsequent samples during the quarter which previously resulted in the highest analytical
results.

    (b) All public water systems shall monitor to determine compliance with the MCL for
nitrite in Table 64431-A, by taking one sample at each sampling site during the
compliance period beginning January 1, 1993.
         (1) If the level of nitrite in a single sample is greater than the MCL, the water
supplier shall proceed as for nitrate in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
         (2) The repeat monitoring frequency for systems with an analytical result for
nitrite that is greater than or equal to 50 percent of the MCL shall be quarterly monitoring
for at least one year. After four consecutive quarterly samples are less than the MCL, a
system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring frequency to annual
sampling, collecting subsequent samples during the quarter which previously resulted in
the highest analytical results.
         (3) The repeat monitoring frequency for systems with an analytical result for
nitrite that is less than 50 percent of the MCL shall be one sample during each
compliance period (every three years).

    (c) All public water systems shall determine compliance with the MCL for nitrate
plus nitrite in Table 64431-A. If the level exceeds the MCL, the water supplier shall
proceed as for nitrate in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
                                                                                                            95

§64432.2. Monitoring and Compliance - Asbestos.
   (a) All community and nontransient-noncommunity water systems are required to
monitor to determine compliance with the MCL for asbestos in Table 64431-A during the
year designated by the State Board of the first compliance period of each nine-year
compliance cycle, beginning in the compliance period starting January 1, 1993. The State
Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring frequency and laboratory
capacity.
       (1) If a groundwater system is vulnerable to asbestos contamination solely in its
source water, it shall collect one sample at every entry point to the distribution system
which is representative of each water source after treatment and proceed in accordance
with Subsections 64432(c)(2) through (e) and Subsections 64432(g) through (l).
       (2) All approved surface water systems shall be designated vulnerable to asbestos
contamination in their source waters. If a surface water system is vulnerable solely in its
source water, it shall proceed as in paragraph (1) above.
       (3) If a system is vulnerable to asbestos contamination due to leaching of
asbestos-cement pipe, with or without vulnerability to asbestos contamination in its
source water, it shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe under
conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur.

   (b) If the level of asbestos exceeds the MCL in Table 64431-A, the supplier shall
report to the State Board within 48 hours and monitor quarterly beginning in the next
quarter after the violation occurred. A system may request that the State Board reduce
monitoring frequency to one sample every compliance cycle, pursuant to §64432(j).

    (c) If a system is not vulnerable either to asbestos contamination in its source water or
due to leaching of asbestos-cement pipe, it may apply to the State Board for a waiver of
the monitoring requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. The State
Board will determine the vulnerability of groundwater sources on the basis of historical
monitoring data and possible influence of serpentine formations. Vulnerability due to
leaching of asbestos-cement pipe will be determined by the State Board on the basis of
the presence of such pipe in the distribution system and evaluation of the corrosivity of
the water. The period of the waiver shall be three years.

§64432.3. Monitoring and Compliance - Perchlorate.
     (a) For initial monitoring for the perchlorate MCL, each community and
nontransient-noncommunity water system shall collect two samples at each source in a
year, five to seven months apart. At least one of the samples shall be collected during the
period from May 1 through September 30 (vulnerable time), unless the State Board
specifies a different vulnerable time for the water system due to seasonal conditions
related to use, manufacture and/or weather.


                                                                                                            96

   (b) Data collected since January 3, 2001, that is in conformance with subsection (a)
may be used to comply with the initial monitoring requirement.

     (c) After meeting the initial monitoring requirements in subsection (a) and if no
perchlorate is detected, during each compliance period each water system:
          (1) Using groundwater, shall monitor once during the year designated by the
State Board;
          (2) Using approved surface water, shall monitor annually; and
          (3) Monitoring at distribution entry points that have combined surface and
groundwater sources, shall monitor annually; if perchlorate is detected in the water from
the combined sources, the water system shall sample each source individually to
determine which is contaminated.

      (d) The water supplier shall require the laboratory to notify the supplier within 48
hours of the result whenever the level of perchlorate in a single sample exceeds the MCL,
and shall ensure that a contact person is available to receive such analytical results 24-
hours a day. The water supplier shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify
the State Board of any perchlorate MCL exceedance if the laboratory cannot make direct
contact with the designated contact person within 48 hours. Within 48 hours of
notification of the result, the water supplier shall:
           (1) Collect and analyze a confirmation sample, and
           (2) If the average of the two perchlorate sample results exceeds the MCL, report
the result to the State Board within 48 hours. If the average does not exceed the MCL,
inform the State Board of the results within seven days from the receipt of the original
analytical result.
           (3) If a system is unable to resample within 48 hours, it shall issue a Tier 1
notice to the consumers in accordance with sections 64463 and 64463.1 and shall collect
and analyze a confirmation sample within two weeks of notification of the results of the
first sample.

     (e) A water system shall monitor quarterly any source in which perchlorate has been
detected. After four consecutive quarterly samples indicate that perchlorate is not present
at or above the DLR, a system may request that the State Board reduce monitoring to the
frequencies specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3).

     (f) A water system serving less than 10,000 persons may apply to the State Board for
a variance from the perchlorate MCL if it can demonstrate that the estimated annualized
cost per household for treatment to comply with the MCL exceeds 1% of the median
household income in the community within which the customers served by the water
system reside.



                                                                                                            97

§64432.8. Sampling of Treated Water Sources.
     (a) Each water supplier utilizing treatment to comply with one or more MCL(s) in
Table 64431-A shall collect monthly samples of the treated water at a site prior to the
distribution system and analyze for the chemical(s) for which treatment is being applied.
If the treated water exceeds an MCL, other than a nitrate, nitrite, nitrate plus nitrite, or
perchlorate MCL, within 48 hours of receipt of the result the water supplier shall
resample the treated water to confirm the result and report the initial result to the State
Board. The result of the analysis of the confirmation sample shall be reported to the State
Board within 24 hours of receipt of the confirmation result. For nitrate, nitrite, nitrate
plus nitrite, or perchlorate treated water monitoring, the water supplier shall comply with
the requirements of section 64432.1(a)(1) for nitrate, section 64432.1(b)(1) for nitrite,
section 64432.1(c) for nitrate plus nitrite, and section 64432.3(d) for perchlorate.

     (b) The State Board may require more frequent monitoring based on an evaluation of
the treatment process used, the treatment effectiveness and efficiency, and the
concentration of the inorganic chemical in the water source.

Article 4.1. Fluoridation
§64433. System Requirements and Exemptions.
    (a) Any public water system with 10,000 service connections or more that does not
have a fluoridation system shall install such a system pursuant to the requirements in this
article if the State Board identifies a source of sufficient funds not excluded by Health
and Safety Code section 116415 to cover capital and any associated costs necessary to
install such a system. Installation shall be completed within two years of the date the
funds are received by the water system; the water system may apply to the State Board
for an extension of the deadline. Following installation, if the State Board identifies a
source of sufficient funds not excluded by Health and Safety Code section 116415 to
cover the noncapital operations and maintenance costs for the period of a year or more,
the system shall fluoridate within three months of receiving the funds and shall continue
fluoridating so long as such funds are received.

    (b) Any public water system with 10,000 service connections or more that has a
fluoridation system but ceased fluoridating prior to December 31, 1995 shall fluoridate
the drinking water if its fluoridation system is determined to be capable of fluoridating
the drinking water in compliance with §64433.2, based on a State Board review, and the
State Board identifies a source of sufficient funds not excluded by Health and Safety
Code section 116415 to cover the noncapital operations and maintenance costs for the
period of a year or more. Such a system shall fluoridate within one month of receiving
the funds and shall continue fluoridating so long as such funds are received.

    (c) Any public water system required to install a fluoridation system pursuant to
subsection (a) or required to fluoridate pursuant to subsection (b) shall annually submit
an estimate of anticipated fluoridation operations and maintenance costs for the next

§64433.3. Monitoring and Compliance--Fluoride Levels.
    (a) If a water system has a single fluoridation system which treats all the water
distributed to consumers, the supplier shall collect a daily sample for fluoride analysis,
pursuant to §64415(b), either in the distribution system or at the entry point. If a water
system does not fluoridate all its water and/or has more than one fluoridation system, the
supplier shall collect one sample daily in the distribution system and rotate the sample
sites in order to be representative of the water throughout the distribution system
according to a monitoring plan the State Board has determined to be representative. For
water systems fluoridating as of January 1, 1997, the plan shall be submitted by July 1,
1998. For all others, the plan shall be submitted prior to initiating fluoridation treatment.
A water system shall monitor only when it is operating its fluoridation system.

    (b) If more than 20 percent of the daily fluoride samples collected in a month by a
water system pursuant to subsection (a) fall outside the control range of optimal levels as
determined by temperature for that system pursuant to §64433.2, the system shall be out
of compliance with §64433.2.

    (c) At least once a month, any water supplier with an operating fluoridation system
shall divide one sample and have one portion analyzed for fluoride by water system
personnel and the other portion analyzed pursuant to §64415(a).

   (d) Any water system with an operating fluoridation system shall sample the raw
source waters annually and analyze for fluoride pursuant to §64415(a); samples collected
pursuant to §64432(c)(1) may be used toward satisfying this requirement. All raw source
water samples collected under this subsection are subject to compliance with the fluoride
MCL in Table 64431-A.

   (e) If any sample result obtained pursuant to subsection (a) does not fall within the
temperature-appropriate fluoride level control range in Table 64433.2-A, the water

Article 5. Radioactivity
§64442. MCLs and Monitoring - Gross Alpha Particle Activity, Radium-226,
Radium-228, and Uranium
   (a) Each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system (system) shall
comply with the primary MCLs in Table 64442 in the drinking water supplied to the
public and use the DLRs for reporting monitoring results:

                                       Table 64442
                   Radionuclide Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)
                  and Detection Levels for Purposes of Reporting (DLRs)

                    Radionuclide                                 MCL                       DLR
   Radium-226                                                                             1 pCi/L
                                                         5 pCi/L (combined
   Radium–228                                           radium-226 & -228)                1 pCi/L
   Gross Alpha particle activity (excluding                  15 pCi/L                     3 pCi/L
   radon and uranium)
   Uranium                                                    20 pCi/L                    1 pCi/L

    (b) Each system shall monitor to determine compliance with the MCLs in table
64442, as follows:
         (1) Monitor at each water source, or every entry point to the distribution system
that is representative of all sources being used under normal operating conditions;
conduct all monitoring at the same sample site(s) unless a change is approved by the
State Board, based on a review of the system and its historical water quality data;
         (2) For quarterly monitoring, monitor during the same month (first, second or
third) of each quarter during each quarter monitored;
         (3) By December 31, 2007, complete initial monitoring that consists of four
consecutive quarterly samples at each sampling site for each radionuclide in table 64442,
except that nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall not be required to monitor
radium-228 as a separate analyte, but shall monitor for compliance with the combined                        107

radium MCL using the analytical method described in Prescribed Procedures for
Measurement of Radioactivity in Drinking Water, Section 6, Alpha-emitting Radium
Isotopes in Drinking Water, Method 903.0 (EPA/600/4-80-032, August 1980):
             (A) Data collected for a sampling site between January 1, 2001, and
December 31, 2004, may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring requirement, subject to
the State Board’s approval based on whether the analytical methods, DLRs, sampling
sites, and the frequency of monitoring used were consistent with this article.
             (B) For gross alpha particle activity, uranium, radium-226 and radium-228,
the State Board may waive the final two quarters of initial monitoring at a sampling site if
the results from the previous two quarters are below the DLR(s) and the sources are not
known to be vulnerable to contamination.

   (c) Any new system or new source for an existing system shall begin monitoring
pursuant to Subsection (b) within the first quarter after initiating water service to the
public.

    (d) After initial monitoring, each system shall monitor for each radionuclide at each
sampling site at a frequency determined by the monitoring result(s) [single sample result
or average of sample results if more than one sample collected] from the most recent
compliance period as follows:
        (1) For nontransient-noncommunity water systems, the results for the total radium
analyses shall be averaged.
        (2) For community water systems, the results of radium-226 and radium-228
analyses shall be added and the average calculated.
        (3) The values used for the radionuclide MCLs and DLRs shall be as specified in
Table 64442.
        (4) If the single sample result or average is:
            A. Below the DLR, the system shall collect and analyze at least one sample
every nine years (3 compliance periods).
            B. At or above the DLR, but at or below ½ the MCL, the system shall collect
and analyze at least one sample every six years.
            C. Above ½ the MCL, but not above the MCL, the system shall collect and
analyze at least one sample every three years.

    (e) A system that monitors quarterly may composite up to four consecutive samples
from a single sampling site if analysis is done within a year of the first sample’s
collection. If the result of the composited sample is greater than ½ the MCL, at least one
additional quarterly sample shall be analyzed to evaluate the range and trend of results
over time before allowing the system to reduce the monitoring frequency.

   (f) A gross alpha particle activity measurement may be substituted for other
measurements by adding the 95% confidence interval (1.65σ, where σ is the standard
deviation of the net counting rate of the sample) to it; and if,
                                                                                                            108

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

       (1) For uranium and radium measurements (after initial radium-228 monitoring
has been completed), the gross alpha measurement does not exceed 5 pCi/L; or
       (2) For radium measurements (after initial radium-228 monitoring has been
completed), the result obtained from subtracting the uranium measurement from the gross
alpha measurement does not exceed 5 pCi/L.

    (g) If any sample result is greater than an MCL:
        (1) For a system monitoring less than quarterly, quarterly samples shall be
collected and analyzed to determine compliance, pursuant to subsection (h);
        (2) For a system that already has four consecutive quarterly results, compliance
shall be determined pursuant to subsection (h).
        (3) The system shall monitor quarterly until the results of four consecutive
quarterly sample results do not exceed the MCL.

    (h) A system with one or more sample results greater than an MCL shall determine
compliance with the MCL as follows:
         (1) At each sampling site, based on the analytical results for that site. Any
confirmation sample result shall be averaged with the initial result.
         (2) Using all monitoring results collected under this section during the previous
12 months, even if more than the minimum required number of samples was collected.
         (3) By a running annual average of four consecutive quarters of sampling results.
Averages shall be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the MCL for
which compliance is being determined.
             (A) If any sample result will cause the annual average at any sample site to
exceed the MCL, the system shall be out of compliance immediately upon receiving the
result;
             (B) If a system has not analyzed the required number of samples, compliance
shall be determined by the average of the samples collected at the site during the most
recent 12 months; and
             (C) If a sample result is less than the DLR in table 64442, zero shall be used to
calculate the annual average, unless a gross alpha particle activity is being used in lieu of
radium-226, total radium, and/or uranium. In that case, if the gross alpha particle activity
result is less than the DLR, ½ the DLR shall be used to calculate the annual average.
         (4) If compositing is allowed at a sampling site, by the results of a composite of
four consecutive quarterly samples.
         (5) If the system can provide documentation that a sample was subject to
sampling or analytical errors, the State Board may invalidate the result based on its
review of the documentation, the sampling result, and the historical sampling data.
         (6) Each system shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing its samples collected
for compliance with this article calculates and reports the sample-specific Minimum
Detectable Activity at the 95% confidence level (MDA95) along with the sample results.
The MDA95 shall not exceed the DLR and shall be calculated as described in ANSI

                                                                                                            109

     (b) Each system designated by the State Board as vulnerable to contamination by
nuclear facilities and/or a determination of vulnerability by a Source Water Assessment,
as defined in section 63000.84, shall monitor to determine compliance with the MCLs in
table 64443, as follows:
         (1) Beginning within one quarter after being notified by the State Board that the
system is vulnerable, quarterly for beta/photon emitters and annually for tritium and
strontium-90 at each water source, or every entry point to the distribution system that is
representative of all sources being used under normal operating conditions, and shall
conduct all monitoring at the same sample site(s) unless a change is approved by the
State Board, based on a review of the system and its historical water quality data;
         (2) For quarterly monitoring, during the same month (first, second or third) of
each quarter during each quarter monitored; and
         (3) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally-occurring potassium-40
beta particle activity at a sampling site has a running annual average less than or equal to
50 pCi/L (screening level), reduce monitoring to a single sample for beta/photon emitters,
tritium and strontium-90 once every three years (compliance monitoring period).

    (c) Each system designated by the State Board as utilizing waters contaminated by
effluents from nuclear facilities on the basis of analytical data and/or a Source Water
Assessment, shall:
        (1) Beginning within one quarter after being notified by the State Board of the
above designation, monitor on an ongoing basis pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through
(C) at each sampling site:
                                                                                                            110

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

            (A) For beta/photon emitters, quarterly by analyzing three monthly samples
and averaging the results or by analyzing a composite of three monthly samples;
            (B) For iodine-131, quarterly by analyzing a composite of five consecutive
daily samples, unless the State Board has directed the system to do more frequent
monitoring based on a detection of iodine-131 in the sampled water; and
            (C) For strontium-90 and tritium, annually by analyzing four quarterly
samples and averaging the results or by analyzing a composite of four quarterly samples.
        (2) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally-occurring potassium-40
beta particle activity at a sampling site has a running annual average (computed
quarterly) less than or equal to 15 pCi/L (screening level), reduce the frequency of
monitoring to a single sample for beta/photon emitters, iodine-131, strontium-90 and
tritium once every three years (compliance monitoring period).

    (d) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta
particle activity exceeds a system’s screening level pursuant to Subsection (b)(3) or
(c)(2):
        (1) The sample shall be analyzed to identify the primary radionuclides present and
the doses shall be calculated and summed to determine compliance with the MCL for
beta particle/photon radioactivity; and
        (2) Except for strontium-90 and tritium for which the MCLs provide the average
annual concentrations assumed to produce a total body or organ dose equivalent to 4
millirem/year, the concentration of manmade radionuclides shall be calculated using the
168 hour data list in “Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible
Concentrations of Radionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure,” NBS
(National Bureau of Standards) Handbook 69 as amended August 1963, U.S. Department
of Commerce. (See Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, section 141.66(d)(2).)

    (e) If a system analyzes for naturally-occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity
from the same or equivalent samples used for the gross beta particle activity analysis,
the potassium-40 beta particle activity shall be calculated by multiplying elemental
potassium concentrations (in mg/L) by a factor of 0.82 pCi/mg.

    (f) A system required to monitor under this section may use environmental
surveillance data (collected by the nuclear facility to detect any radionuclide
contamination) in lieu of monitoring, subject to the State Board’s determination that the
data is applicable to the system based on a review of the data and the hydrogeology of the
area. In the event that there is a release of radioactivity or radioactive contaminants from
the nuclear facility, a system using environmental surveillance data shall begin the
monitoring in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1)(A) through (C), whichever is most applicable.

    (g) If a sample result is greater than an MCL:
        (1) Compliance shall be determined as follows:

                                                                                                            111

             (A) At each sampling site, based on the analytical results for that site. Any
confirmation sample result shall be averaged with the initial result.
             (B) Using all monitoring results collected under this article during the
previous 12 months, even if more than the minimum required number of samples was
collected.
             (C) By a running annual average of four consecutive quarters of sampling
results where quarterly monitoring is required, or by an annual sample when applicable
for tritium and strontium-90. Averages shall be rounded to the same number of
significant figures as the MCL for which compliance is being determined.
                  1. If any sample result will cause the annual average at any sample site to
exceed the MCL, the system shall be out of compliance immediately after being notified
of the result;
                  2. If a system has not analyzed the required number of samples,
compliance shall be determined by the average of the samples collected at the site during
the most recent 12 months; and
                  3. If a sample result is less than the DLR in 64443, zero shall be used to
calculate the annual average.
             (D) If the system can provide documentation that a sample was subject to
sampling or analytical errors, the State Board may invalidate the result based on its
review of the documentation, the sampling result, and the historical sampling data.
             (E) Each system shall ensure that the laboratory analyzing its samples
collected for compliance with this article calculates and reports the sample-specific
Minimum Detectable Activity at the 95% confidence level (MDA95) along with the
sample results. The MDA95 shall not exceed the DLR and is calculated as described in
ANSI N42.23 Measurement and Associated Instrumentation Quality Assurance for
Radiobioassay Laboratories, Appendix A.7.6 (September 10, 1995). (See Title 40, Code
of Federal Regulations, section 141.66(d)(2).)
         (2) If a sample has a gross beta/photon radioactivity level greater than the MCL:
             (A) A system shall monitor monthly beginning the month after receiving a
result greater than the MCL and continue monthly monitoring until an average of three
consecutive monthly sample results does not exceed the MCL ;
             (B) The system shall then monitor quarterly until the average of four
consecutive quarterly sample results does not exceed the MCL; and
             (C) Subsequently, the system shall conduct the monitoring in paragraph (b)(1)
or (c)(1)(A) through (C), whichever is most applicable.

§64445. Initial sampling - organic chemicals.
    (a) Each community and nontransient-noncommunity water system shall collect four
quarterly samples during the year designated by the State Board of each compliance
period beginning with the compliance period starting January 1, 1993, from each water
source at a site prior to any treatment and test for all applicable organic chemicals listed
in Table 64444-A. The State Board will designate the year based on historical monitoring
frequency and laboratory capacity. For surface sources, the samples shall be taken at
each water intake. For groundwater sources, the samples shall be taken at each well head.
Where multiple intakes or wells draw from the same water supply, the State Board will
consider sampling of representative sources as a means of complying with this section.
Selection of representative sources shall be based on evidence which includes a
hydrogeological survey and sampling results. Wells shall be allowed to flow for a
minimum of 15 minutes before sampling to insure that the samples reflect the water
quality of the source. In place of water source samples, a supplier may collect samples at
sites located at the entry points to the distribution system. The samples shall be
representative of each source after treatment. The system shall collect each sample at the
same sampling site, unless a change is approved by the State Board.

    (b) For any organic chemical added to Table 64444-A, the water system shall initiate
the quarterly monitoring for that chemical in January of the calendar year after the
effective date of the MCL.

    (c) A water system may request approval from the State Board to composite samples
from up to five sampling sites, provided that the number of the sites to be composited is
less than the ratio of the MCL to the DLR in §64445.1. Approval will be based on a
review of three years of historical data, well construction and aquifer information for
groundwater, and intake location, similarity of sources, and watershed characteristics for
surface water. Compositing shall be done in the laboratory and analyses shall be
conducted within 14 days of sample collection.
        (1) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall composite only from sampling
sites within a single system. Systems serving 3,300 persons or less may composite among
different systems up to the 5-sample limit.
        (2) If any organic chemical is detected in the composite sample, a follow-up
sample shall be analyzed within 14 days from each sampling site included in the
composite for the contaminants which were detected. The water supplier shall report the
results to the State Board within 14 days of the follow-up sample collection. If available,
duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling site used in the composite
may be used instead of resampling.

   (d) A water system may apply to the State Board for a monitoring waiver for one or
more of the organic chemicals on Table 64444-A in accordance with the following:

                                                                                                            115

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        (1) A source may be eligible for a waiver if it can be documented that the
chemical has not been previously used, manufactured, transported, stored, or disposed of
within the watershed or zone of influence and therefore, that the source can be designated
nonvulnerable.
        (2) If previous use of the chemical locally is unknown or the chemical is known to
have been used previously and the source cannot be designated nonvulnerable pursuant to
Paragraph (d)(1), it may still be eligible for a waiver based on a review related to
susceptibility to contamination. The application to the State Board for a waiver based on
susceptibility shall include the following:
            (A) previous monitoring results;
            (B) user population characteristics;
            (C) proximity to sources of contamination;
            (D) surrounding land uses;
            (E) degree of protection of the water source;
            (F) environmental persistence and transport of the chemical in water, soil and
air;
            (G) elevated nitrate levels at the water supply source; and
            (H) historical system operation and maintenance data including previous State
Board inspection results.
        (3) To apply for a monitoring waiver for VOCs, the water system shall have
completed the initial four quarters of monitoring pursuant to subsection (a) or three
consecutive years of monitoring with no VOCs detected. If granted a waiver for VOC
monitoring, a system using groundwater shall collect a minimum of one sample from
every sampling site every six years and a system using surface water shall not be required
to monitor for the term of the waiver. The term of a VOC waiver shall not exceed three
years.
        (4) To obtain a monitoring waiver for one or more of the SOCs, the water system
may apply before doing the initial round of monitoring or shall have completed three
consecutive years of annual monitoring with no detection of the SOC(s) listed. If the
system is granted a waiver for monitoring for one or more SOC(s), no monitoring for the
waived SOC(s) shall be required for the term of the waiver, which shall not exceed three
years.

    (e) For water sources designated by a water supplier as standby sources, the water
supplier shall sample each source for any organic chemical added to Table 64444-A once
within the three-year period beginning in January of the calendar year after the effective
date of the MCL.

    (f) Water quality data collected prior to January 1, 1988, for VOCs, or January 1,
1990, for SOCs, and/or data collected in a manner inconsistent with this section shall not
be used in the determination of compliance with the monitoring requirements for organic
chemicals.

                                                                                                            116

    (g) Data (i.e., a single sample) collected in a manner consistent with this section after
January 1, 1998 in which no MTBE is detected, along with a designation of
nonvulnerability pursuant to subsection (d), may be used to satisfy the initial monitoring
requirements in subsection (a). If the requirements are satisfied in this way by a water
system, the system shall begin annual monitoring pursuant to Section 64445.1(b)(1).

    (h) Water quality data collected in compliance with the monitoring requirements of
this section by a wholesaler agency providing water to a public water system shall be
acceptable for use by that system for compliance with the monitoring requirements of this
section.

and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in
this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

         (1) Prior to proceeding with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) through (7), the
water supplier may first confirm the analytical result, as follows: Within seven days from
the notification of an initial finding from a laboratory reporting the presence of one or
more organic chemicals in a water sample, the water supplier shall collect one or two
additional sample(s) to confirm the initial finding. Confirmation of the initial finding
shall be shown by the presence of the organic chemical in either the first or second
additional sample, and the detected level of the contaminant for compliance purposes
shall be the average of the initial and confirmation sample(s). The initial finding shall be
disregarded if two additional samples do not show the presence of the organic chemical.
         (2) If one or both of the related organic chemicals heptachlor and heptachlor
epoxide are detected, subsequent monitoring shall analyze for both chemicals until there
has been no detection of either chemical for one compliance period.
         (3) A groundwater sampling site at which one or more of the following chemicals
has been detected shall be monitored quarterly for vinyl chloride: trichloroethylene,
tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene,
trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, or 1,1-dichloroethylene. If vinyl chloride is not detected in the
first quarterly sample, the sampling site shall be monitored once for vinyl chloride during
each compliance period.
         (4) If the detected level of organic chemicals for any sampling site does not
exceed any shown in Table 64444-A, the water source shall be resampled every three
months and the samples analyzed for the detected chemicals. After one year of sampling
an approved surface water system or two quarters of sampling a groundwater system, the
State Board will consider allowing the water supplier to reduce the sampling to once per
year upon request, based on a review of previous sampling data. Systems shall monitor
during the quarter(s) which previously yielded the highest analytical results.
         (5) If the detected level of an organic chemical for any sampling site exceeds that
listed in Table 64444-A, the water supplier shall report this information to the State
Board within 48 hours of receipt of the result. Unless use of the contaminated source is
discontinued, the water supplier shall resample the contaminated source and compliance
shall be determined as follows:
             (A) Water systems serving more than 3,300 persons shall sample monthly for
six months and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in §64469. If the
average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and six subsequent
monthly samples does not exceed the MCL shown in Table 64444-A the water supplier
may reduce the sampling frequency to once every three months. If the running annual
average or the average concentration of the initial finding, confirmation sample(s), and
six subsequent monthly samples exceeds the MCL shown in Table 64444-A, the water
system shall be deemed to be in violation of Section 64444.
             (B) Water systems serving 3,300 persons or less shall sample quarterly for a
minimum of one year and shall submit the results to the State Board as specified in
§64469. If the running annual average concentration does not exceed the MCL in Table
64444-A, the water supplier may reduce the sampling frequency to once every year
during the quarter that previously yielded the highest analytical result. Quarterly
                                                                                                            119

monitoring shall resume if any reduced frequency sample result exceeds the MCL. If the
running annual average concentration exceeds the MCL in Table 64444-A, the water
system shall be deemed to be in violation of §64444.
            (C) If any sample would cause the running annual average to exceed the
MCL, the water system is immediately in violation. If a system takes more than one
sample in a quarter, the average of all the results for that quarter shall be used when
calculating the running annual average. If a system fails to complete four consecutive
quarters of monitoring, the running annual average shall be based on an average of the
available data.
        (6) If any resample, other than those taken in accordance with (c)(5) of this
section, of a water sampling site shows that the concentration of any organic chemical
exceeds a MCL shown in Table 64444-A, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance
with (c)(1) and (c)(4), or (c)(5).
        (7) If an organic chemical is detected and the concentration exceeds ten times the
MCL, the water supplier shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the receipt of the
results and the contaminated site shall be resampled within 48 hours to confirm the result.
The water supplier shall notify the State Board of the result of the confirmation sample(s)
within 24 hours of the receipt of the confirmation result(s).
            (A) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation sample(s) is
less than or equal to ten times the MCL, the water supplier shall proceed in accordance
with subsection (c)(5).
            (B) If the average concentration of the original and confirmation samples
exceeds ten times the MCL, use of the contaminated water source shall immediately be
discontinued, if directed by the State Board. Such a water source shall not be returned to
service without written approval from the State Board.

§64445.2. Sampling of Treated Water Sources.
    (a) Each water supplier utilizing treatment to comply with any MCL for an organic
chemical listed in Table 64444-A shall collect monthly samples of the treated water at a
site prior to the distribution system. If the treated water exceeds the MCL, the water
supplier shall resample the treated water to confirm the result and report the result to the
State Board within 48 hours of the confirmation.

    (b) The State Board will consider requiring more frequent monitoring based on an
evaluation of (1) the treatment process used, (2) the treatment effectiveness and
efficiency, and (3) the concentration of the organic chemical in the water source.

    Limitation Footnotes:
   a
     The regeneration solution contains high concentrations of the contaminant ions, which could result in
   disposal issues.
   b
     When point of use devices are used for compliance, programs for long-term operation, maintenance, and
   monitoring shall be provided by systems to ensure proper performance.
   c
     Reject water disposal may be an issue.
   d
     The combination of variable source water quality and the complexity of the water chemistry involved may
   make this technology too complex for small systems.
   e
     Removal efficiencies can vary depending on water quality.
   f
     Since the process requires static mixing, detention basins, and filtration, this technology is most applicable
   to systems with sufficiently high sulfate levels that already have a suitable filtration treatment train in place.
   g
     Applies to ionized radionuclides only.

   h
     This technology is most applicable to small systems with filtration already in place.
   i
     Chemical handling during regeneration and pH adjustment may be too difficult for small systems without
   an operator trained in these procedures.

      (1) Secondary MCLs listed in Tables 64449-A and 64449-B; and
      (2) Bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide alkalinity, calcium, magnesium,
sodium, pH, and total hardness.

    (c) If the level of any constituent in Table 64449-A exceeds an MCL, the community
water system shall proceed as follows:
        (1) If monitoring quarterly, determine compliance by a running annual average of
four quarterly samples;
        (2) If monitoring less than quarterly, initiate quarterly monitoring and determine
compliance on the basis of an average of the initial sample and the next three consecutive
quarterly samples collected;
        (3) If a violation has occurred (average of four consecutive quarterly samples
exceeds an MCL), inform the State Board when reporting pursuant to Section 64469;
        (4) After one year of quarterly monitoring during which all the results are below
the MCL and the results do not indicate any trend toward exceeding the MCL, the system
may request the State Board to allow a reduced monitoring frequency.

    (d) For the constituents shown on Table 64449-B, no fixed consumer acceptance
contaminant level has been established.
        (1) Constituent concentrations lower than the Recommended contaminant level
are desirable for a higher degree of consumer acceptance.
        (2) Constituent concentrations ranging to the Upper contaminant level are
acceptable if it is neither reasonable nor feasible to provide more suitable waters.

       (3) Constituent concentrations ranging to the short term contaminant levelare
acceptable only for existing community water systems on a temporary basis pending
construction of treatment facilities or development of acceptable new water sources.

   (e) New services from community water systems serving water which carries
constituent concentrations between the Upper and Short Term contaminant levels shall be
approved only:
        (1) If adequate progress is being demonstrated toward providing water of
improved mineral quality.
        (2) For other compelling reasons approved by the State Board.

    (f) A community water system may apply to the State Board for a waiver from the
monitoring frequencies specified in subsection (b), if the system has conducted at least
three rounds of monitoring (three periods for groundwater sources or three years for
approved surface water sources) and these analytical results are less than the MCLs. The
water system shall specify the basis for its request. A system with a waiver shall collect a
minimum of one sample per source while the waiver is in effect and the term of the
waiver shall not exceed one compliance cycle (i.e., nine years).

                                                                                                            128

   (g) Nontransient-noncommunity and transient-noncommunity water systems shall
monitor their sources or distribution system entry points representative of the effluent of
source treatment for bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide alkalinity, calcium, iron,
magnesium, manganese, pH, specific conductance, sodium, and total hardness at least
once. In addition, nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall monitor for the
constituents in Tables 64449-A and B at least once.

§64449.2. Waivers for Secondary MCL Compliance.
    (a) If the average of four consecutive quarters of sample results for a constituent that
does not have a primary MCL is not greater than three times the secondary MCL or
greater than the State Notification Level, an existing community water system is eligible
to apply for a nine-year waiver of a secondary MCL in Table 64449-A, for the following:
        (1) An existing source; or
        (2) A new source that is being added to the existing water system, as long as:
             (A) The source is not being added to expand system capacity for further
development; and
             (B) The concentration of the constituent of concern in the new source would
not cause the average value of the constituent’s concentration at any point in the water
delivered by the system to increase by more than 20%.

    (b) To apply for a waiver of a secondary MCL, the community water system shall
conduct and submit a study to the State Board within one year of violating the MCL that
includes the following:
        (1) The water system complaint log, maintained pursuant to section 64470(a),
along with any other evidence of customer dissatisfaction, such as a log of calls to the
county health department;
        (2) An engineering report, prepared by an engineer registered in California with
experience in drinking water treatment, that evaluates all reasonable alternatives and
costs for bringing the water system into MCL compliance and includes a
recommendation for the most cost-effective and feasible approach;
        (3) The results of a customer survey distributed to all the water system’s billed
customers that has first been approved by the State Board based on whether it includes:
            (A) Estimated costs to individual customers of the most cost-effective
alternatives presented in the engineering report that are acceptable to the State Board
based on its review of their effectiveness and feasibility;
            (B) The query: “Are you willing to pay for (identify constituent) reduction
treatment?”;
            (C) The query: “Do you prefer to avoid the cost of treatment and live with the
current water quality situation?”
            (D) The statement: “If you do not respond to this survey, (insert system
name) will assume that you are in support of the reduction treatment recommended by the
engineering report.”
        (4) A brief report (agenda, list of attendees, and transcript) of a public
                                                                                                            129

meeting held by the water system to which customers were invited, and at which both the
tabulated results of the customer survey and the engineering report were presented with a
request for input from the public.

    (c) A community water system may apply for a waiver for iron and/or manganese if,
in addition to meeting the requirements in Subsection (b), an average of four consecutive
quarter results for the source has not exceeded a State Notification Level for iron and/or
manganese. In addition, the system shall include sequestering, as follows:
        (1) As one of the alternatives evaluated in the Engineering Report;
        (2) In the customer survey as a query: “Are you willing to pay for iron and/or
manganese sequestering treatment?”

    (d) Unless 50% or more of the billed customers respond to the survey, the community
water system shall conduct another survey pursuant to Subsections (b) or (c) within three
months from the date of the survey by sending the survey out to either all the customers
again, or only the customers that did not respond to the survey. The water system shall
not be eligible for a waiver until it achieves at least a 50% response rate on the survey.

    (e) If the customer survey indicates that the percentage of billed customers that voted
for constituent reduction treatment and the number of billed customers that did not
respond to the survey at all exceeds 50% of the total number of billed customers, the
community water system shall install treatment, except as provided in Subsection (f),
within three years from the date the system completed the customer survey, pursuant to a
schedule established by the State Board.

    (f) For iron and/or manganese MCL waiver applications, if the percentage of survey
respondents that voted for constituent reduction treatment plus the percentage of survey
respondents that voted for sequestering exceeds the percentage that voted to avoid the
cost and maintain the current water quality situation, the community water system shall
implement either constituent reduction treatment or sequestering, on the basis of which
was associated with the higher percentage result. If the highest percentage result is for
sequestering, the system shall submit a sequestering implementation and assessment plan
to the State Board that includes:
        (1) A description of the pilot testing or other type of evaluation performed to
determine the most effective sequestering agent for use in the system’s water;
        (2) The sequestering agent feed rate and the equipment to be used to insure that
the rate is maintained for each source;
        (3) An operations plan; and
        (4) The projected cost of sequestering including capital, operations and
maintenance costs.

   (g) To apply for renewal of a waiver for a subsequent nine years, the system shall
request approval from the State Board at least six months prior to the end of the current
                                                                                                            130

waiver period. The renewal request shall include all monitoring and treatment operations
data for the constituent for which the waiver had been granted and any related customer
complaints submitted to the water system. Based on its review of the data and customer
complaints, the State Board may require the water system to conduct another customer
survey pursuant to this section before making a determination on the waiver renewal.

§64449.4. Use of Sources that Exceed a Secondary MCL and Do Not Have a Waiver.
A source that exceeds one or more of the secondary MCLs in Table 64449-A and does
not have a waiver may be used only if the source meets the requirements in Section
64414, and the community water system:
    (a) Meters the source's monthly production and submits the results to the State Board
by the 10th day of the next month;

   (b) Counts any part of a day as a full day for purposes of determining compliance
with Section 64414(c);

   (c) As a minimum, conducts public notification by including information on the
source's use (dates, constituent levels, and reasons) in the Consumer Confidence Report
(Sections 64480 through 64483);

    (d) Provides public notice prior to use of the source by electronic media, publication
in a local newspaper, and/or information in the customer billing, if the situation is such
that the water system can anticipate the use of the source (e.g., to perform water system
maintenance); and

   (e) Takes corrective measures such as flushing after the source is used to minimize
any residual levels of the constituent in the water distribution system.

§64449.5. Distribution System Physical Water Quality.
    (a) The water supplier shall determine the physical water quality in the distribution
system. This determination shall be based on one or more of the following:
        (1) Main flushing operations and flushing records.
        (2) Consumer complaint records showing location, nature and duration of the
physical water quality problem.
        (3) Other pertinent data relative to physical water quality in the distribution
system.

    (b) If the State Board determines that a water system does not have sufficient data on
physical water quality in the distribution system to make the determination required in
paragraph (a), the water supplier shall collect samples for the following general physical
analyses: color, odor, and turbidity. Samples shall be collected from representative points
in the distribution system:

                                                                                                            131

noncommunity) water system shall give public notice to persons served by the water
system pursuant to this article.

     (b) Each water system required to give public notice shall submit the notice to the
State Board, in English, for approval prior to distribution or posting, unless otherwise
directed by the State Board.

     (c) Each wholesaler shall give public notice to the owner or operator of each of its
retailer systems. A retailer is responsible for providing public notice to the persons it
serves. If the retailer arranges for the wholesaler to provide the notification, the retailer
shall notify the State Board prior to the notice being given.

     (d) Each water system that has a violation of any of the regulatory requirements
specified in section 64463.1(a), 64463.4(a), or 64463.7(a) in a portion of the distribution
system that is physically or hydraulically isolated from other parts of the distribution
system may limit distribution of the notice to only persons served by that portion of the
system that is out of compliance, if the State Board has granted written approval on the
basis of a review of the water system and the data leading to the violation or occurrence
for which notice is being given.

     (e) Each water system shall give new customers public notice of any acute violation
as specified in section 64463.1(a) that occurred within the previous thirty days, any
continuing violation, the existence of a variance or exemption, and/or any other ongoing
occurrence that the State Board has determined poses a potential risk of adverse effects
on human health [based on a review of estimated exposures and toxicological data
associated with the contaminant(s)] and requires a public notice. Notice to new customers
shall be given as follows:

place or distributing copies by hand or mail.”; and
        (11) For a water system with a monitoring and testing procedure violation, this
language shall be included: “We are required to monitor your drinking water for specific
contaminants on a regular basis. Results of regular monitoring are an indicator of
whether or not your drinking water meets health standards. During [compliance period
dates], we [‘did not monitor or test’ or ‘did not complete all monitoring or testing’] for
[contaminant(s)], and therefore, cannot be sure of the quality of your drinking water

     Contaminant                                     Health Effects Language
Total Coliform                 Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the environment
                               and are used as an indicator that other, potentially-harmful, bacteria
                               may be present. Coliforms were found in more samples than
                               allowed and this was a warning of potential problems.
Fecal coliform/E. coli         Fecal coliforms and E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates
                               that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes.
                               Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as
                               diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may
                               pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the
                               elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
Turbidity                      Turbidity has no health effects. However, high levels of turbidity
                               can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial
                               growth. Turbidity may indicate the presence of disease-causing
                               organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites
                               that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and
                               associated headaches.

                     drinking water or water that has been treated to remove the fluoride to avoid
                     the possibility of staining and pitting of their permanent teeth. You may also
                     want to contact your dentist about proper use by young children of fluoride-
                     containing products. Older children and adults may safely drink the water.
                     Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride can increase your risk
                     of developing bone disease.

Hexavalent           Some people who drink water containing hexavalent chromium in excess of
chromium             the MCL over many years may have an increased risk of getting cancer.
Lead                 Infants and children who drink water containing lead in excess of the action
                     level may experience delays in their physical or mental development. Children
                     may show slight deficits in attention span and learning abilities. Adults who
                     drink this water over many years may develop kidney problems or high blood
                     pressure.
Mercury              Some people who drink water containing mercury in excess of the MCL over
                     many years may experience mental disturbances, or impaired physical

                     many years may experience liver and heart effects.
Nitrate              Infants below the age of six months who drink water containing nitrate in
                     excess of the MCL may quickly become seriously ill and, if untreated, may die
                     because high nitrate levels can interfere with the capacity of the infant’s blood
                     to carry oxygen. Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the
                     skin. High nitrate levels may also affect the oxygen-carrying ability of the
                     blood of pregnant women.
Nitrite              Infants below the age of six months who drink water containing nitrite in
                     excess of the MCL may become seriously ill and, if untreated, may die.
                     Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin.
Perchlorate          Perchlorate has been shown to interfere with uptake of iodide by the thyroid
                     gland, and to thereby reduce the production of thyroid hormones, leading to
                     adverse effects associated with inadequate hormone levels. Thyroid hormones
                     are needed for normal prenatal growth and development of the fetus, as well as
                     for normal growth and development in the infant and child. In adults, thyroid
                     hormones are needed for normal metabolism and mental function.
Selenium             Selenium is an essential nutrient. However, some people who drink water
                     containing selenium in excess of the MCL over many years may experience

that is allowed in drinking water. Primary MCLs are set as close to the PHGs (or
MCLGs) as is economically and technologically feasible. Secondary MCLs are set to
protect the odor, taste, and appearance of drinking water.”
         (3) Maximum Contaminant Level Goal or MCLG: “The level of a contaminant in
drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs are set
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.”
         (4) Public Health Goal or PHG: “The level of a contaminant in drinking water
below which there is no known or expected risk to health. PHGs are set by the California
Environmental Protection Agency.”
         (5) Primary Drinking Water Standard or PDWS: “MCLs, MRDLs, and treatment
techniques for contaminants that affect health, along with their monitoring and reporting
requirements.”
         (6) Treatment technique: “A required process intended to reduce the level of a
contaminant in drinking water.”
         (7) Variances and exemptions: “State Board permission to exceed an MCL or not
comply with a treatment technique under certain conditions.”

drinking water disinfectant below which there is no known or expected risk to health.
MRDLGs do not reflect the benefits of the use of disinfectants to control microbial
contaminants.”

    (c) If any of the following are detected, information for each pursuant to subsection
(d) shall be included in the Consumer Confidence Report:
        (1) Contaminants subject to an MCL, regulatory action level, MRDL, or treatment
technique (regulated contaminants), as specified in sections 64426.1, 64431, 64442,
64443, 64444, 64448, 64449, 64533, 64533.5, 64536, 64536.2, 64653 and 64678;

     (d) For contaminants identified in subsection (c), the water system shall include in the
Consumer Confidence Report one table or several adjacent tables that have been
developed pursuant to this subsection. Any additional monitoring results that a water
system chooses to include in its Consumer Confidence Report shall be displayed
separately.
         (1) The data in the table(s) shall be derived from data collected to comply with
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and State Board monitoring and
analytical requirements during calendar year 2000 for the first Consumer Confidence
Report and subsequent calendar years thereafter. Where a system is allowed to monitor
for regulated contaminants less often than once a year, the table(s) shall include the date
and results of the most recent sampling and the Consumer Confidence Report shall
include a brief statement indicating that the data presented in the table(s) are from the
most recent testing done in accordance with the regulations. No data older than 9 years
need be included.

             (B) For a primary MCL, the public health goal (PHG) in the same units as the
MCL; or if no PHG has been set for the contaminant, the table shall include the USEPA
maximum contaminant level goal in the same units as the MCL;
             (C) For a detected contaminant that does not have an MCL, the table(s) shall
indicate whether there is a treatment technique or specify the regulatory action level or
MRDL (and MRDLG) applicable to that contaminant, and the Consumer Confidence
Report shall include the appropriate language specified in subsection (b);
             (D) For detected contaminants subject to an MCL, except turbidity and total
coliforms, the sample result(s) collected at compliance monitoring sampling points shall
be reported in the same units as the MCL as follows:
                 1. When compliance is determined by the results of a single sample, an
initial sample averaged with one or two confirmation sample(s), or an average of four
quarterly or six monthly samples, results shall be reported as follows:
                     A. For a single sampling point, or multiple sampling points for which
data is being individually listed on the Consumer Confidence Report: the sample result
and, if more than one sample was collected, the average and range of the sample results;
                     B. For multiple sampling points, each of which has been sampled only
once and for which data is being summarized together on the Consumer Confidence
Report: the average and range of the sample results. If the waters from the sampling
points are entering the distribution system at the same point, a flow-weighted average
may be reported; and
                     C. For multiple sampling points, one or more of which has been
sampled more than once and for which data is being summarized together on the
Consumer Confidence Report: the average of the individual sampling point averages and
range of all the sample results. If the waters from the sampling points are entering the
distribution system at the same point, a flow-weighted average may be reported.
                                                                                                            152

                 2. When compliance with the MCL is determined by calculating a running
annual average of all samples taken at a monitoring location:
                     A. The highest running annual average of the monitoring location and
the range of sample results or, if monitoring locations are summarized together for the
Consumer Confidence Report, the highest running annual average of any of the
monitoring locations and the range of sample results from all the monitoring locations;
and
                     B. For TTHM and HAA5 monitored pursuant to section 64534.2(d):
the highest locational running annual average (LRAA) for TTHM and HAA5 and the
range of individual sample results for all monitoring locations. If more than one location
exceeds the TTHM or HAA5 MCL, include the LRAA for all locations that exceed the
MCL.
                 3. When compliance with the MCL is determined on a system-wide basis
by calculating a running annual average of all monitoring location averages: the highest
running annual average and the range of sample results from all the sampling points.
                 4. When compliance with the MCL is determined on the basis of
monitoring after treatment installed to remove a contaminant: the average level detected
in the water entering the distribution system and the range of sample results; and
                 5. If an MCL compliance determination was made in the year for which
sample results are being reported and that determination was based on an average of
results from both the previous and reporting years, then the compliance determination
average shall be reported, but the range shall be based only on results from the year for
which data is being reported.
             (E) For turbidity:
                 1. When it is reported pursuant to the requirements of section 64652.5
(filtration avoidance): the highest value; and
                 2. When it is reported pursuant to section 64653 (filtration): the highest
single measurement based on compliance reporting and the lowest monthly percentage of
samples meeting the turbidity limits specified in section 64653 for the filtration
technology being used;
             (F) For lead and copper: the 90th percentile value of the most recent round of
sampling, the number of sites sampled, and the number of sampling sites exceeding the
action level;
             (G) For total coliform:
                 1. The highest monthly number of positive samples for systems collecting
fewer than 40 samples per month; or
                 2. The highest monthly percentage of positive samples for systems
collecting at least 40 samples per month.
             (H) For fecal coliform or E. coli: the total number of positive samples during
the year; and
             (I) The likely source(s) of any detected contaminants having an MCL, MRDL,
regulatory action level, or treatment technique. If the water system lacks specific
information on the likely source, the table(s) shall include one or more of the typical
                                                                                                            153

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

    (h) If a system is operating under the terms of a variance or an exemption issued
under section 116430 or 116425 of the Health and Safety Code, the Consumer
Confidence Report shall contain:
        (1) An explanation of the reasons for the variance or exemption;
        (2) The date on which the variance or exemption was issued;
        (3) A brief status report on the steps the system is taking to install treatment, find
alternative sources of water, or otherwise comply with the terms and schedules of the
variance or exemption; and
        (4) A notice of any opportunity for public input in the review, or renewal, of the
variance or exemption.

    (i) A Consumer Confidence Report shall contain the language in paragraphs (1)
through (4).
         (1) “The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include
rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the
surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and,
in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the
presence of animals or from human activity.”
         (2) “Contaminants that may be present in source water include:
      Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, that may come from sewage
treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.
      Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, that can be naturally-occurring or
result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil
and gas production, mining, or farming.
      Pesticides and herbicides, that may come from a variety of sources such as
agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.
      Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals,
that are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come
from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural application, and septic systems.
      Radioactive contaminants, that can be naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and
gas production and mining activities.”
         (3) “In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) and the State Water Resources Control Board (State Board)
prescribe regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by
public water systems. State Board regulations also establish limits for contaminants in
bottled water that provide the same protection for public health.”
         (4) “Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to
contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does
not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about
contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the USEPA's Safe
Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791).”


                                                                                                            155

    (j) A Consumer Confidence Report shall prominently display the following
language: “Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than
the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer
undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with
HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be
particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking
water from their health care providers. USEPA/Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and
other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-
426-4791).”

   (k) A Consumer Confidence Report shall include the telephone number of the owner,
operator, or designee of the water system as a source of additional information
concerning the report.

    (l) A Consumer Confidence Report shall contain information in Spanish regarding the
importance of the report or contain a telephone number or address where Spanish-
speaking residents may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the report or
assistance in Spanish. For each non-English speaking group other than Spanish-speaking
that exceeds 1,000 residents or 10% of the residents in a community, the Consumer
Confidence Report shall contain information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the
importance of the report or contain a telephone number or address where such residents
may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the report or assistance in the
appropriate language.

   (m) A Consumer Confidence Report shall include information (e.g., time and place of
regularly scheduled board meetings) about opportunities for public participation in
decisions that may affect the quality of the water.

§64482. Required Additional Health Information.
     (a) A system that detects arsenic at levels above 0.005 mg/L, but below or equal to
the MCL, shall include the following in its Consumer Confidence Report: "While your
drinking water meets the federal and state standard for arsenic, it does contain low levels
of arsenic. The arsenic standard balances the current understanding of arsenic's possible
health effects against the costs of removing arsenic from drinking water. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency continues to research the health effects of low levels of
arsenic, which is a mineral known to cause cancer in humans at high concentrations and
is linked to other health effects such as skin damage and circulatory problems.”
                                                                                                            162

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

    (b) A system that detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/L (as nitrogen), but below the
MCL, shall include the following in its Consumer Confidence Report: “Nitrate in
drinking water at levels above 10 mg/L is a health risk for infants of less than six months
of age. Such nitrate levels in drinking water can interfere with the capacity of the infant's
blood to carry oxygen, resulting in a serious illness; symptoms include shortness of
breath and blueness of the skin. Nitrate levels above 10 mg/L may also affect the ability
of the blood to carry oxygen in other individuals, such as pregnant women and those with
certain specific enzyme deficiencies. If you are caring for an infant, or you are pregnant,
you should ask advice from your health care provider. If a system cannot demonstrate to
the State Board with at least five years of the most current monitoring data that its nitrate
levels are stable, it shall also add the following language to the preceding statement on
nitrate: “Nitrate levels may rise quickly for short periods of time because of rainfall or
agricultural activity.”

    (c) A system that detects lead above the action level in more than 5%, and up to and
including 10%, of sites sampled, shall include the following in its Consumer Confidence
Report: “Infants and young children are typically more vulnerable to lead in drinking
water than the general population. It is possible that lead levels at your home may be
higher than at other homes in the community as a result of materials used in your home's
plumbing. If you are concerned about elevated lead levels in your home's water, you may
wish to have your water tested and/or flush your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before
using tap water. Additional information is available from the USEPA Safe Drinking
Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791).”

§64483. Consumer Confidence Report Delivery and Recordkeeping.
   (a) Each water system shall mail or directly deliver one copy of the Consumer
Confidence Report to each customer.

    (b) The system shall make a good faith effort to reach consumers who are served by
the water system but are not bill-paying customers, such as renters or workers, using a
mix of methods appropriate to the particular system such as: Posting the Consumer
Confidence Reports on the Internet; mailing to postal patrons in metropolitan areas;
advertising the availability of the Consumer Confidence Report in the news media;
publication in a local newspaper; posting in public places such as cafeterias or lunch
rooms of public buildings; delivery of multiple copies for distribution by single-biller
customers such as apartment buildings or large private employers; and delivery to
community organizations.

    (c) No later than the date the water system is required to distribute the Consumer
Confidence Report to its customers, each water system shall mail a copy of the report to
the State Board, followed within 3 months by a certification that the report has been
distributed to customers, and that the information is correct and consistent with the
compliance monitoring data previously submitted to the State Board.
                                                                                                            163

Confidence Report to its customers, each privately-owned water system shall mail a copy
of the report to the California Public Utilities Commission.

   (e) Each water system shall make its Consumer Confidence Report available to the
public upon request.

   (f) Each water system serving 100,000 or more persons shall post its current year's
Consumer Confidence Report on a publicly-accessible site on the Internet.

    (g) Each water system shall retain copies of its Consumer Confidence Reports for no
less than 3 years.

        (2) Systems on reduced monitoring shall resume monitoring at the frequency
specified in column C of table 64534.2-A in the quarter immediately following the
quarter in which the system exceeds 0.060 mg/L for the TTHM annual average or 0.045
mg/L for the HAA5 annual average, or 4.0 mg/L for the source water TOC annual
average. For systems using only ground water not under the direct influence of surface
water and serving fewer than 10,000 persons or for systems using approved surface water
and serving fewer than 500 persons, if either the TTHM annual average is >0.080 mg/L
or the HAA5 annual average is >0.060 mg/L, the system shall go to increased monitoring
identified in column D of table 64534.2-A in the quarter immediately following the
quarter in which the system exceeds 0.080 mg/L or 0.060 mg/L for the TTHM and HAA5
annual averages, respectively; and
        (3) Systems on increased monitoring pursuant to column D of table 64534.2-A
may return to routine monitoring specified in column C of table 64534.2-A if, after at
least one year of monitoring, TTHM annual average is ≤0.060 mg/L and HAA5 annual
average is ≤0.045 mg/L.

    (b) Community and nontransient noncommunity water systems using chlorine dioxide
shall conduct monitoring for chlorite as follows:
        (1) Systems shall take daily samples at the entrance to the distribution system and
analyze the samples the same day the samples are taken. For any daily sample that
exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system shall take three additional chlorite distribution
system samples the following day (in addition to the daily sample required at the entrance
to the distribution system) at these locations: as close to the first customer as possible, at
a location representative of average residence time, and at a location reflecting maximum
residence time in the distribution system. The system shall analyze the additional
samples within 48 hours of being notified pursuant to section 64537(b) of the
exceedance;
        (2) Systems shall take a three-sample set each month in the distribution system.
The system shall take one sample at each of the following locations: as close to the first
customer as possible, at a location representative of average residence time, and at a
location reflecting maximum residence time in the distribution system. Any additional
routine sampling shall be conducted in the same manner (as three-sample sets, at the
specified locations). The system may use the results of additional monitoring conducted
under paragraph (1) to meet the monitoring requirement in this paragraph;
        (3) Systems may apply to the State Board to reduce monthly chlorite monitoring
in the distribution system pursuant to paragraph (2) to one three-sample set per quarter
after one year of monitoring during which no individual chlorite sample taken in the
distribution system has exceeded the chlorite MCL and the system has not been required
to conduct additional monitoring under paragraph (1). The application shall include the
results of all chlorite monitoring conducted in the previous 12 months and the proposed
revised monitoring plan as required by section 64534.8. The State Board will evaluate
data submitted with the application and determine whether or not the system is eligible to
reduce monitoring to one three-sample set per quarter. The system may remain on the
                                                                                                            174

taken quarterly in the distribution system under paragraph (2) exceeds the chlorite MCL
or the system is required to conduct additional monitoring under paragraph (1), at which
time the system shall revert to routine monitoring; and
        (4) If a distribution system sample taken pursuant to paragraph (2) exceeds the
chlorite MCL, the system shall take and analyze a confirmation sample within 48 hours
of being notified pursuant to section 64537(c) of the exceedance. If the system fails to
take a confirmation sample pursuant to this paragraph, it shall take and analyze a
confirmation sample within two weeks of notification of the results of the first sample.

    (c) Community and nontransient noncommunity systems using ozone shall monitor
for bromate as follows:
        (1) Systems shall take one sample per month for each treatment plant in the
system using ozone. Samples shall be taken at the entrance to the distribution system
while the ozonation system is operating under normal conditions;
        (2) Systems may reduce bromate monitoring from monthly to once per quarter, if
the system’s running annual average bromate concentration is ≤0.0025 mg/L based on
monthly bromate measurements under paragraph (1) for the most recent four quarters,
with samples analyzed using Method 317.0 Revision 2.0, 321.8, or 326.0. The system
shall notify the State Board in writing within 30 days of the change in monitoring
frequency; and

the applicable dates in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part 141.600 (71 Fed. Reg. 388
January 4, 2006), which is incorporated by reference, shall consult with the State Board
to identify compliance monitoring locations for this subsection. Systems shall then
develop a monitoring plan in accordance with section 64534.8 that includes those
monitoring locations;
        (3) Systems may apply to the State Board to monitor at a reduced frequency in
accordance with table 64534.2-D, any time the LRAA is ≤0.040 mg/L for TTHM and
≤0.030 mg/L for HAA5 at all monitoring locations. In addition, the source water annual
average TOC level, before any treatment shall be ≤4.0 mg/L at each treatment plant
treating approved surface water, based on source water TOC monitoring conducted
pursuant to section 64534.6. The application shall include the results of all TOC, TTHM,
and HAA5 monitoring conducted in the previous 12 months and the proposed revised
monitoring plan as required by section 64534.8. The State Board will evaluate data
submitted with the application to determine whether or not the system is eligible for the
reduced monitoring specified in table 64534.2-D;

Systems on increased monitoring may return to routine monitoring specified in table
64534.2-C if, after at least four consecutive quarters of monitoring, the LRAA for every
monitoring location is ≤0.060 mg/L for TTHM and ≤0.045 mg/L for HAA5;
        (6) If the operational evaluation level (OEL) exceeds 0.080 mg/L for TTHM or
0.060 mg/L for HAA5 at any monitoring location, systems shall conduct an operational
evaluation. The operational evaluation shall include the examination of system treatment
and distribution operational practices, including storage tank operations, excess storage
capacity, distribution system flushing, changes in sources or source water quality, and
treatment changes or problems that may contribute to TTHM and HAA5 formation and
what steps could be considered to minimize future exceedances. Systems that are able to
identify the cause of the OEL exceedance may submit a written request to the State Board
to limit the scope of the evaluation. The request to limit the scope of the evaluation shall
not extend the schedule in section 64537(d) for submitting the written report to the State
Board;
        (7) Systems on reduced monitoring pursuant to table 64534.2-B may remain on
reduced monitoring after the applicable date in table 64530-A for compliance with this
subsection provided the system meets IDSE requirements under section 64530(c) by
qualifying for a 40/30 certification (40 CFR part 141.603) or receiving a very small
system waiver (40 CFR part 141.604), meets the reduced monitoring criteria in
paragraphs (3) and (4), and does not change or add monitoring locations from those used
for compliance monitoring under subsection (a); and
        (8) Systems on increased monitoring pursuant to table 64534.2-A shall remain on
increased monitoring and conduct increased monitoring pursuant to paragraph (5) at the
locations in the monitoring plan developed under section 64534.8 beginning at the
applicable date in table 64530-A for compliance with this subsection. Systems on
increased monitoring may return to routine monitoring specified in table 64534.2-C
pursuant to paragraph (5).

§64534.4. Disinfectant Residuals Monitoring.
    (a) Community and nontransient noncommunity water systems that use chlorine or
chloramines shall measure the residual disinfectant levels at the same points in the
distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in
section 64421. Systems using approved surface water may use the results of residual
disinfectant concentration sampling conducted under section 64656, in lieu of taking
separate samples.

    (b) Public water systems that use chlorine dioxide shall monitor for chlorine dioxide
daily at the entrance to the distribution system. For any daily sample that exceeds the
MRDL, the system shall take three chlorine dioxide distribution system samples the
following day, as follows:
        (1) If chlorine dioxide or chloramines are used to maintain a disinfectant residual
in the distribution system, or if chlorine is used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the
distribution system and there are no disinfection addition points after the entrance to the
                                                                                                            180

close to the first customer as possible, at intervals of at least six hours; and
        (2) If chlorine is used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system
and there are one or more disinfection addition points after the entrance to the distribution
system (i.e., booster chlorination), the system shall take one sample at each of the
following locations: as close to the first customer as possible, in a location representative
of average residence time, and as close to the furthest customer as possible (reflecting
maximum residence time in the distribution system).

§64534.6. Disinfection Byproduct Precursors Monitoring.
    (a) Systems that use approved surface water and conventional filtration treatment (as
defined in section 64651.23) shall take one paired TOC sample (source water and treated
water) and one source water alkalinity sample per month per treatment plant at a time
representative of normal operating conditions and influent water quality. TOC and
alkalinity in the source water shall be monitored prior to any treatment and at the same
time as TOC monitoring in the treated water. TOC in the treated water shall be
monitored no later than the point of combined filter effluent turbidity monitoring and
shall be representative of the treated water.

    (b) Systems using approved surface water with an annual average treated water TOC
of less than 2.0 mg/L for two consecutive years, or less than 1.0 mg/L for one year, may
reduce monitoring for both TOC and alkalinity to one paired sample and one source
water alkalinity sample per plant per quarter. The system shall revert to monitoring
pursuant to subsection (a) in the first month following the quarter that the annual average
treated water TOC is equal to or greater than 2.0 mg/L.

    (c) Systems using approved surface water and not monitoring pursuant to subsection
(a) or (b):
        (1) To qualify for reduced TTHM and HAA5 monitoring pursuant to table
64534.2-B or 64534.2-D, shall take monthly TOC samples every 30 days at a location
prior to any treatment; and
        (2) Once qualified for reduced TTHM and HAA5 monitoring pursuant to table
64534.2-B or 64534.2-D, may reduce source water TOC monitoring to quarterly TOC
samples taken every 90 days at a location prior to any treatment. The system shall revert
to source water TOC monitoring pursuant to paragraph (1) in the first month following
the quarter that the annual average source water TOC is greater than 4.0 mg/L.

§64534.8. Monitoring Plans.
    (a) A system shall develop and submit to the State Board a monitoring plan. The
system shall implement the plan after State Board review and approval. The system shall
maintain the plan and make it available for inspection by the general public no later than
30 days following the applicable compliance date in sections 64530(a) or (b), and (d).

                                                                                                            181

    (b) The State Board will evaluate the plan based on the following required elements:
        (1) Specific locations and schedules for collecting samples for any parameters
included in this chapter, including seasonal variations if applicable;
        (2) How the system will calculate compliance with MCLs, MRDLs, and treatment
techniques; and
        (3) For compliance monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(d), monitoring dates
and the elements specified in paragraphs (1) and (2).

    (c) Systems that submitted an IDSE report pursuant to section 64530(c) shall monitor
for TTHM and HAA5 under section 64534.2(d) at the locations and months
recommended in the IDSE report, unless the State Board requires other locations or
additional locations after its review of the IDSE report.

    (d) Systems not required to submit an IDSE report pursuant to section 64530(c) and
that:
        (1) Do not have sufficient TTHM and HAA5 compliance monitoring locations
under section 64534.2(a) to identify the required number of TTHM and HAA5
compliance monitoring locations indicated in 40 Code of Federal Regulations part
141.605(b) (71 Fed. Reg. 388 (January 4, 2006)), as amended at 74 Fed. Reg. 30953
(June 29, 2009)), which is incorporated by reference, shall:
            (A) Identify additional locations by alternating selection of locations
representing high TTHM levels and high HAA5 levels until the required number of
compliance monitoring locations have been identified; and
            (B) Provide the rationale in the plan for identifying the locations as having
high levels of TTHM or HAA5.
        (2) Have more TTHM and HAA5 compliance monitoring locations under section
64534.2(a) than required for TTHM and HAA5 compliance monitoring indicated in 40
Code of Federal Regulations part 141.605(b) (71 Fed. Reg. 388 (January 4, 2006)), as
amended at 74 Fed. Reg. 30953 (June 29, 2009)), which is incorporated by reference,
shall identify the locations to use by alternating selection of locations representing high
TTHM levels and high HAA5 levels until the required number of compliance monitoring
locations have been identified.

        (e) The plan developed for compliance monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(d)
may be revised to reflect changes in treatment, distribution system operations and layout
(including new service areas), or other factors that may affect TTHM or HAA5
formation, or for State Board -approved reasons, after consultation with the State Board
regarding the need for changes and the appropriateness of changes. Systems shall
comply with the requirements of subsection (a) for the revised plan. If monitoring
locations are changed, systems shall replace existing compliance monitoring locations
having the lowest LRAA with new locations that reflect the current distribution system
locations having expected high TTHM or HAA5 levels.

                                                                                                            182

Article 4. Compliance requirements
§64535. General Requirements for Determining Compliance.
    (a) All samples taken and analyzed in accordance with section 64534.8 shall be
included in determining compliance, pursuant to sections 64535.2, 64535.4, and 64536.4.

   (b) For violations of the MCLs in section 64533 or MRDLs in section 64533.5 that
may pose an acute risk to human health, notification shall be pursuant to sections 64463,
64463.1, and 64465.

§64535.2. Determining Disinfection Byproducts Compliance.
    (a) During the first year of monitoring for disinfection byproducts under sections
64534.2(a), (b), and (c), the system shall comply with paragraphs (1) through (3). During
the first year of monitoring for TTHM and HAA5 under section 64534.2(d), the system
shall comply with paragraphs (1) through (3) at each monitoring location:
         (1) The sum of the first quarter’s results, divided by four, shall not exceed the
MCLs specified in section 64533.
         (2) The sum of the first and second quarter’s results, divided by four, shall not
exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533.
         (3) The sum of the first, second, and third quarter’s results, divided by four, shall
not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533.

    (b) TTHM and HAA5 MCL compliance, as monitored pursuant to section 64534.2(a),
shall be determined as follows:
        (1) For systems monitoring quarterly, the running annual arithmetic average,
computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples collected pursuant to
section 64534.2(a) shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533;
        (2) For systems monitoring less frequently than quarterly, the average of samples
collected that calendar year pursuant to section 64534.2(a) shall not exceed the MCLs
specified in section 64533. If the average of the samples collected under section
64534.2(a) exceeds the MCL, the system shall increase monitoring to once per quarter
per treatment plant. Compliance with the MCL shall then be determined by the average
of the sample that triggered the quarterly monitoring and the following three quarters of
monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the
running annual average to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation
immediately. After monitoring quarterly for four consecutive quarters (including the
quarter that triggered the quarterly monitoring), and until such time as monitoring returns
to routine monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(a)(3), compliance shall be determined
pursuant to paragraph (1);
        (3) If the running annual arithmetic average of quarterly averages covering any
consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL
and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including
language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to
sections 64537 through 64537.6; and
                                                                                                            183

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

       (4) If a public water system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of
monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall
be based on an average of the available data.

    (c) Compliance for bromate shall be based on a running annual arithmetic average,
computed quarterly, of monthly samples (or, for months in which the system takes more
than one sample, the average of all samples taken during the month) collected by the
system as prescribed by section 64534.2(c). If the average of samples covering any
consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL
and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including
language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to
sections 64537 through 64537.6. If a public water system fails to complete 12
consecutive months of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter
compliance period shall be based on an average of the available data.

    (d) Compliance for chlorite shall be based on the results of samples collected by the
system pursuant to section 64534.2(b).
        (1) If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the
chlorite MCL and one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system
pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(1) exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of
the MCL and shall take immediate corrective action to reduce the concentration of
chlorite to a level below the MCL. The system shall notify the State Board within 48
hours of the determination and notify the public pursuant to the procedures for acute
health risks in sections 64463, 64463.1, and 64465, including language in appendix
64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through
64537.6. Failure to take samples in the distribution system the day following an
exceedance of the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MCL
violation and the system shall notify and report as described in this paragraph;
        (2) If the average of an individual sample from the three-sample set taken
pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(2) and its confirmation sample taken pursuant to section
64634.2(b)(4) exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and shall
take the corrective action and notify and report as described in paragraph (1). If the
average of the individual sample and its confirmation does not exceed the MCL, the
system shall inform the State Board of the results within seven days from receipt of the
original analysis. Failure to take a confirmation sample pursuant to section 64534.2(b)(4)
is also an MCL violation and the system shall notify and report as described in paragraph
(1); and
        (3) If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution
system exceed the chlorite MCL and all distribution system samples taken pursuant to
section 64534.2(b)(1) are less than or equal to the chlorite MCL, the system is in
violation of the MCL and shall take corrective action to reduce the concentration of
chlorite to a level below the MCL at the point of sampling. The system shall notify the
public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute health risks in sections 64463, 64463.4,
                                                                                                            184

        (1) For systems monitoring quarterly, each locational running annual average
(LRAA), computed quarterly, shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533;
        (2) For systems monitoring annually or less frequently, each sample collected
shall not exceed the MCLs specified in section 64533. If no sample exceeds the MCL,
the sample result for each monitoring location shall be considered the LRAA for the
monitoring location. If any sample exceeds the MCL, systems shall increase monitoring
pursuant to section 64534.2(d)(5). Compliance with the MCL shall then be determined
by the average of the sample that triggered the quarterly monitoring and the following
three quarters of monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring
will cause the LRAA to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation
immediately. After monitoring quarterly for four consecutive quarters (including the
quarter that triggered the quarterly monitoring), and until such time as monitoring returns
to routine monitoring pursuant to section 64534.2(d)(5), compliance shall be determined
pursuant to paragraph (1);
        (3) If a system fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring,
compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period shall be based on
an average of the available data. If more than one sample per quarter is taken at a
monitoring location, all the samples taken in the quarter at that monitoring location shall
be averaged to determine a quarterly average to be used in the LRAA calculation; and
        (4) If the LRAA exceeds the MCL, calculated based on four consecutive quarters
of monitoring (or the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data if the
MCL would be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters), the
system is in violation of the MCL and shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463,
64463.4, and 64465, including the language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to
reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6.

§64535.4. Determining Disinfectant Residuals Compliance.
    (a) During the first year of monitoring for disinfection residuals under section
64534.4 the system shall comply with the following:
        (1) The sum of the first quarter’s results, divided by four, shall not exceed the
MRDLs specified in section 64533.5;
        (2) The sum of the first and second quarter’s results, divided by four, shall not
exceed the MRDLs specified in section 64533.5; and
        (3) The sum of the first, second, and third quarter’s results, divided by four, shall
not exceed the MRDLs specified in section 64533.5.
                                                                                                            185

    (b) Chlorine and chloramines MRDL compliance is determined as follows:
        (1) Compliance shall be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed
quarterly, of monthly averages of all samples collected by the system under section
64534.4(a). If the average covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the
MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and shall notify the public pursuant to
sections 64463, 64463.4, and 64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in
addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6; and
        (2) In cases where systems switch between the use of chlorine and chloramines
for residual disinfection during the year, compliance shall be determined by including
together all monitoring results of both chlorine and chloramines. Reports submitted
pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6 shall clearly indicate which residual
disinfectant was analyzed for each sample.

    (c) Compliance for chlorine dioxide shall be based on consecutive daily samples
collected by the system under section 64534.4(b).
        (1) If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the
MRDL, and one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system exceed
the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and shall take immediate corrective
action to reduce the concentration of chlorine dioxide to a level below the MRDL. The
system shall notify the State Board within 48 hours of the determination, notify the public
pursuant to the procedures for acute health risks in sections 64463, 64463.1, and 64465,
including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board
pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6. Failure to take samples in the distribution
system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to
the distribution system is also an MRDL violation and the system shall notify and report
as described in this paragraph;
        (2) If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution
system exceed the MRDL and all distribution system samples taken are less than or equal
to the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and shall take corrective action to
reduce the concentration of chlorine dioxide to a level below the MRDL at the point of
sampling. The system shall notify the public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute
health risks in sections 64463, 64463.4. and 64465, including language in appendix
64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State Board pursuant to sections 64537 through
64537.6. Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following
an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at this site is also an MRDL violation and
the system shall notify and report as described in this paragraph.

removal requirements. If the State Board approves the Step 2 removal requirements
pursuant to subsection (d), and the system conducted monthly TOC monitoring beginning
one year prior to the compliance date specified in section 64530, the Step 2 removal
requirements will be retroactive to the compliance date for the purposes of determining
compliance.

    (d) Applications made to the State Board by systems using enhanced coagulation for
approval of Step 2 removal requirements under subsection (c) shall include, as a
minimum, results of bench-scale or pilot-scale testing conducted under paragraph (1) of
this subsection that were used to determine the alternate enhanced coagulation level.
        (1) Alternate enhanced coagulation level is defined as coagulation at a coagulant
dose and pH as determined by the method described in paragraphs (1) through (4) such
that an incremental addition of 10 mg/L of alum (or equivalent addition of iron
coagulant) results in a TOC removal of ≤ 0.3 mg/L. The percent removal of TOC at this
point on the "TOC removal versus coagulant dose" curve is then defined as the Step 2
removal requirement for the system. Once approved by the State Board, this Step 2
removal requirement supersedes the minimum TOC removal required by section
64536.2(b). This requirement shall be effective until such time as the State Board
approves a new value based on the results of a new bench-scale or pilot-scale test.
        (2) Bench-scale or pilot-scale testing of enhanced coagulation shall be conducted
by using representative water samples and adding 10 mg/L increments of alum (or
equivalent addition of iron coagulant) until the pH is reduced to a level less than or equal
to the enhanced coagulation Step 2 target pH shown in table 64536.2-B.

        (3) For waters with alkalinities of less than 60 mg/L for which the addition of
small amounts of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) drives the pH below 5.5
before significant TOC removal occurs, the system shall add necessary chemicals to
maintain the pH between 5.3 and 5.7 in samples until the TOC removal of 0.3 mg/L per
10 mg/L alum added (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) is reached.
        (4) If the TOC removal is consistently less than 0.3 mg/L of TOC per 10 mg/L of
incremental alum dose at all dosages of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant),
the system is eligible to apply for a waiver of enhanced coagulation requirements. The

§64536.4. Disinfection Byproduct Precursor Compliance Calculations.
    (a) Systems not meeting any of the criteria identified in sections 64536(a) or (b) shall
comply with requirements contained in sections 64536.2(a) or (b) and shall calculate
compliance quarterly, beginning after the system has collected 12 months of data, by
determining an annual average using the following method:
        (1) Determine actual monthly TOC percent removal, equal to:
            (1 - [treated water TOC/source water TOC]) x 100.
        (2) Determine the required monthly TOC percent removal (from either table
64536.2-A or from section 64536.2(c)).
        (3) Divide the value in paragraph(a)(1) by the value in paragraph(a)(2).
        (4) Add together the results of paragraph(a)(3) for the last 12 months and divide
by 12.
        (5) If the value calculated in paragraph(a)(4) is less than 1.00, the system is not in
compliance with the TOC percent removal requirements.

    (b) In any month that one or more of the conditions of sections 64536.4(b)(1) through
(b)(6) are met, the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value
calculated in section 64536.4(a)(3)) when calculating compliance under the provisions of
subsection (a).
        (1) The system's source water TOC level, prior to any treatment, is less than or
equal to 2.0 mg/L.
        (2) The system's treated water TOC level is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/L.
        (3) The system’s source water SUVA, prior to any treatment, is less than or equal
to 2.0 L/mg-m.
        (4) The system’s finished water SUVA is less than or equal to 2.0 L/mg-m.
        (5) A system practicing softening removes at least 10 mg/L of magnesium
hardness (as CaCO3).
        (6) A system practicing enhanced softening lowers alkalinity below 60 mg/L (as
CaCO3).

§64536.6. Disinfection Byproduct Precursors Public Notification Requirements.
For systems using conventional treatment, enhanced coagulation or enhanced softening
are identified as treatment techniques to control the level of disinfection byproduct
precursors in drinking water treatment and distribution systems. If a system fails to
comply with the enhanced coagulation or enhanced softening requirements established in
this article, the system shall notify the public pursuant to sections 64463, 64463.4, and
64465, including language in appendix 64465-G, in addition to reporting to the State
Board pursuant to sections 64537 through 64537.6.

adequate to do so, such as, but not limited to, well pump tests, the capacities of all
pumping facilities, and the hydraulic capacity of surface water treatment facilities,
            (A) If the system plans to use surface water, the system shall demonstrate that
it holds a valid water right to that amount of water including any allowable reductions or
limitations on its availability, as stated in the water rights contract;
            (B) If groundwater is to be used, the system shall demonstrate that the
groundwater aquifer is sufficient, or in the case of adjudicated groundwater basins, that
approval has been obtained to allow that amount of sustained withdrawal including any
allowable reductions or limitations on its availability, as stated in the water rights
contract;
            (C) If purchased water is to be used, the system shall provide contracted
amount and the hydraulic capacity at each turnout and any allowable reductions or
limitations on its availability, as stated in the purchased water contract; and
        (7) Information that demonstrates how the system proposes to reliably meet four
hours of PHD using, but not limited to, available source capacity and distribution
reservoirs.

   (b) The information in subsection (a) shall be prepared by a professional civil
engineer registered in the State of California with experience in water supply
engineering.

§64554. New and Existing Source Capacity.
    (a) At all times, a public water system’s water source(s) shall have the capacity to
meet the system’s maximum day demand (MDD). MDD shall be determined pursuant to
subsection (b).
        (1) For systems with 1,000 or more service connections, the system shall be able
to meet four hours of peak hourly demand (PHD) with source capacity, storage capacity,
and/or emergency source connections.
        (2) For systems with less than 1,000 service connections, the system shall have
storage capacity equal to or greater than MDD, unless the system can demonstrate that it
has an additional source of supply or has an emergency source connection that can meet
the MDD requirement.
        (3) Both the MDD and PHD requirements shall be met in the system as a whole
and in each individual pressure zone.

    (b) A system shall estimate MDD and PHD for the water system as a whole (total
source capacity and number of service connections) and for each pressure zone within the
system (total water supply available from the water sources and interzonal transfers
directly supplying the zone and number of service connections within the zone), as
follows:
        (1) If daily water usage data are available, identify the day with the highest usage
during the past ten years to obtain MDD; determine the average hourly flow during MDD
and multiply by a peaking factor of at least 1.5 to obtain the PHD.
                                                                                                            198

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

         (2) If no daily water usage data are available and monthly water usage data are
available:
             (A) Identify the month with the highest water usage (maximum month) during
at least the most recent ten years of operation or, if the system has been operating for less
than ten years, during its period of operation;
             (B) To calculate average daily usage during maximum month, divide the total
water usage during the maximum month by the number of days in that month; and
             (C) To calculate the MDD, multiply the average daily usage by a peaking
factor that is a minimum of 1.5; and
             (D) To calculate the PHD, determine the average hourly flow during MDD
and multiply by a peaking factor that is a minimum of 1.5.
         (3) If only annual water usage data are available:
             (A) Identify the year with the highest water usage during at least the most
recent ten years of operation or, if the system has been operating for less than ten years,
during its years of operation;
             (B) To calculate the average daily use, divide the total annual water usage for
the year with the highest use by 365 days; and
             (C) To calculate the MDD, multiply the average daily usage by a peaking
factor of 2.25.
             (D) To calculate the PHD, determine the average hourly flow during MDD
and multiply by a peaking factor that is a minimum of 1.5.
         (4) If no water usage data are available, utilize records from a system that is
similar in size, elevation, climate, demography, residential property size, and metering to
determine the average water usage per service connection. From the average water usage
per service connection, calculate the average daily demand and follow the steps in
paragraph (3) to calculate the MDD and PHD.

   (c) Community water systems using only groundwater shall have a minimum of two
approved sources before being granted an initial permit. The system shall be capable of
meeting MDD with the highest-capacity source off line.

    (d) A public water system shall determine the total capacity of its groundwater
sources by summing the capacity of its individual active sources. If a source is
influenced by concurrent operation of another source, the total capacity shall be reduced
to account for such influence. Where the capacity of a source varies seasonally, it shall
be determined at the time of MDD.

    (e) The capacity of a well shall be determined from pumping data existing prior to
March 9, 2008, or in accordance with subsection (f) or (g). Prior to conducting a well
capacity test pursuant to subsection (g), a system shall submit the information listed
below to the State Board for review and approval. For well capacity tests conducted
pursuant to subsection (f), the information shall be submitted to the State Board if
requested by the State Board.
                                                                                                            199

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        (2) For fecal or total coliform density, once every day the turbidity of the source
water exceeds 1 NTU unless the State Board determines that the system, for logistical
reasons outside the system's control, is unable to have the sample analyzed within 30
hours of collection. If collected, these samples count toward the weekly coliform
sampling requirement; and
        (3) For turbidity at a minimum frequency of once every four hours. A supplier
may substitute continuous turbidity monitoring for grab sample monitoring if, at regular
intervals, it validates the accuracy of the continuous measurement using a protocol
approved by the State Board.

    (c) The approved surface water quality monitored pursuant to subsection (b) shall
meet the following criteria:
        (1) The fecal coliform concentration shall be equal to or less than 20/100 mL, or
the total coliform concentration shall be equal to or less than 100/100 mL, in
representative samples of the approved surface water in at least 90 percent of the
measurements made for the six previous months that the system served unfiltered
approved surface water to the public on an ongoing basis. If a system measures both fecal
and total coliforms, the fecal coliform criterion, not the total coliform criterion, in this
paragraph shall be met; and
        (2) The turbidity level shall not exceed 5 NTU in representative samples of the
approved surface water unless:
            (A) The State Board determines that any such event was caused by
circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable; and
            (B) As a result of any such event, there have not been more than two events in
the past 12 months the system served unfiltered approved surface water to the public, or
more than five events in the past 120 months the system served unfiltered approved
surface water to the public, in which the turbidity level exceeded 5 NTU. An “event” is
one day or a series of consecutive days during which at least one turbidity measurement
each day exceeds 5 NTU.

    (d) Water quality information collected pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reported to
the State Board in conformance with the requirements of 40 CFR section 141.75(a)(1)
(54 Fed. Reg. 27486, (June 29, 1989)), which is incorporated by reference.

    (e) The supplier shall maintain a watershed control program which minimizes the
potential for contamination by Giardia lamblia cysts, viruses, and Cryptosporidium
oocysts in the source water. The adequacy of the program to limit potential
contamination by Giardia lamblia cysts, viruses, and Cryptosporidium oocysts shall be
determined by: the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the
supplier's program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the
watershed; and the extent to which the water system has maximized land ownership
and/or controlled land use within the watershed. At a minimum, the watershed control
program shall:
                                                                                                            225

         (2) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse
effect on source water quality;
         (3) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on
source water quality. The supplier shall demonstrate through ownership and/or written
agreements with landowners within the watershed that it can control all human activities
which may have an adverse impact on the microbiological quality of the water. The
supplier shall submit an annual report to the State Board that identifies any special
concerns about the watershed and how they are being handled; describes activities in the
watershed that affect water quality; and projects what adverse activities are expected to
occur in the future and how the public water system expects to address them; and
         (4) Monitor the presence of Giardia lamblia cysts in the approved surface water
whenever agricultural grazing, water oriented recreation, or point source domestic
wastewater discharges occur on the watershed. At a minimum the monitoring shall
measure the Giardia lamblia cyst concentration monthly at a point immediately prior to
the first or only point of disinfectant application. The monitoring results shall be included
in an annual report to the State Board. This monitoring requirement may be waived after
one year for a supplier serving fewer than 500 persons when the monitoring results
indicate a mean Giardia lamblia cyst concentration of 1 cyst per 100 liters or less.

    (f) The water system shall be subject to an annual on-site inspection to assess the
watershed control program and disinfection treatment process. Either the State Board or a
party approved by the State Board shall conduct the on-site inspection. The inspection
shall be conducted by competent individuals who have a sound understanding of public
health principles and waterborne diseases, such as sanitary engineers, civil engineers,
environmental health specialists, or technicians who have experience and knowledge
about the operation and maintenance of a public water system. A report of the on-site
inspection summarizing all findings shall be prepared every calendar year and submitted
to the State Board, if not conducted by the State Board, by December 31 of that year. The
on-site inspection shall be comprehensive to enable the State Board to determine whether
the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process are adequately
designed and maintained. The on-site inspection shall include:
        (1) A review of the effectiveness of the watershed control program;
        (2) A review of the physical condition of the source intake and how well it is
protected;
        (3) A review of the supplier's equipment maintenance program to ensure there is
low probability for failure of the disinfection process;
        (4) An inspection of the disinfection equipment for physical deterioration;
        (5) A review of operating procedures;
        (6) A review of data records to ensure that all required tests are being conducted
and recorded and disinfection is effectively practiced; and
        (7) Identification of any improvements which are needed in the equipment,
system maintenance and operation, or data collection.

distribution system to determine the construction materials (lead, copper, and galvanized
steel) exposed to the water. If necessary to ensure the sample site criteria is met, the
system shall collect additional information during the course of its normal operations
(e.g., checking service line materials when reading water meters, or performance
maintenance activities) and from the following:
         (1) All plumbing codes, permits, and records in the files of the building
department(s) that indicate the plumbing materials installed within publicly and privately
owned structures connected to the distribution system;
         (2) All inspections and records of the distribution system that indicate the material
composition of the service connections connecting a structure to the distribution system;
and
         (3) All existing water quality information, which includes the results of prior
analyses of the system or individual structures connected to the system, indicating
locations that may be particularly susceptible to high lead or copper concentrations.

    (c) Each community water system shall:
         (1) Identify a sampling pool of “tier 1” sampling sites consisting of single-family
structures except that, when multiple-family residences comprise at least 20 percent of
the structures served by a water system, the system may include these types of structures
as “tier 1” sites in its sampling pool. The “tier 1” sampling sites shall
             (A) Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982; or
             (B) Contain lead pipes; or
             (C) Be served by a lead service line.


                                                                                                            255

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        (2) If there is an insufficient number of “tier 1” sites, complete its sampling pool
with “tier 2” sampling sites, consisting of buildings, including multiple-family residences
that:
            (A) Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982; or
            (B) Contain lead pipes; or
            (C) Are served by a lead service line.
        (3) If there is an insufficient number of “tier 1” and “tier 2” sampling sites,
complete its sampling pool with "tier 3” sampling sites, consisting of single-family
structures that contain copper pipes with lead solder installed before 1983. A system
with an insufficient number of tier 1, 2 and 3 sites shall complete its sampling pool with
representative sites (i.e., plumbing materials commonly found at other sites) throughout
the distribution system.

    (d) Each nontransient-noncommunity water system shall:
        (1) Identify a pool of "tier 1” sampling sites consisting of buildings that:
            (A) Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982; or
            (B) Contain lead pipes; or
            (C) Are served by a lead service line.
        (2) If there is an insufficient number of “tier 1” sites that meet the criteria in
paragraph (1), complete its sampling pool with sites that contain copper pipes with lead
solder installed before 1983. If additional sites are needed to complete the sampling pool,
the system shall use representative sites (i.e., plumbing materials commonly found at
other sites) throughout the distribution system.

    (e) Each system whose distribution system contains lead service lines shall draw 50
percent of the samples it collects during each period from sites that contain lead pipes, or
copper pipes with lead solder, and 50 percent of the samples from sites served by a lead
service line. A system that cannot identify a sufficient number of sites served by a lead
service line shall collect first draw samples from all of the sites identified as being served
by such lines.

    (f) A system that does not have enough taps that can provide first-draw samples shall
submit written documentation to the Department identifying standing times and locations
for enough non-first-draw samples to make up its sampling pool by the start of its next
monitoring period.

§64677. Sample Collection Methods for Taps.
   (a) All tap samples for lead and copper collected pursuant to this chapter, with the
exception of lead service line samples collected under section 64689 (Lead Service Line
Sampling) and samples collected under subsection (d), shall be first-draw samples,
pursuant to subsection (b).


                                                                                                            256

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

    (b) A first-draw sample shall be one liter in volume and have stood motionless in the
plumbing system of each site for at least six hours, but not more than twelve. Samples
from residential housing shall be collected from the cold-water kitchen tap or bathroom
sink tap. Samples from a non-residential building shall be collected at an interior tap
from which water is typically drawn for consumption. Samples may be collected by the
system or the system may allow residents to collect tap samples after instructing the
residents of the sampling procedures specified in this section. To avoid problems of
residents handling nitric acid, acidification of samples may be done up to 14 days after
collection. After acidification to resolubilize the metals, the sample shall stand in the
original container for the time specified by the method used pursuant to section 64670(c)
before it can be analyzed. If a system allows residents to perform sampling, the system
may not challenge, based on alleged errors in sample collection, the accuracy of sampling
results.

    (c) A system shall collect each tap sample from the same site from which it collected
a sample during the previous period. If the system cannot gain entry to a site in order to
collect a tap sample, it may collect the tap sample from another site in its sampling pool
as long as the new site meets the same criteria, and is as close as possible to the original
site.

    (d) A system that does not have enough taps to supply first-draw samples may apply
to the Department in writing to substitute non-first-draw samples. Such systems shall
collect as many first-draw samples as possible and identify sampling times and locations
that would likely result in the longest standing time for the remaining sites.

§64677.5. Sample Invalidation.
    (a) A lead or copper sample may be invalidated by the Department if at least one of
the following conditions is met and documented in writing:
         (1) The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused erroneous
results;
         (2) The Department determines that the sample was taken from a site that did not
meet the site selection criteria in section 64676 (Sample Site Selection);
         (3) The sample container was damaged in transit;
         (4) The Department determines the sample does not meet the requirements in
section 64677(Sample Collection Methods for Taps); or
         (5) There is substantial reason to believe that the sample was subject to
tampering.

    (b) To apply for invalidation of one or more samples, a system shall report the results
of all samples for the period to the Department, including written documentation to
support the system’s belief that one or more samples should be invalidated.


                                                                                                            257

    (c) A sample invalidated pursuant to subsection (a) shall not count toward
determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels or toward meeting any monitoring
requirements in this chapter.

    (d) The system shall collect replacement samples for any invalidated samples if, after
the invalidation of one or more samples, the system has too few samples to meet the
monitoring requirements of this chapter. Replacement samples taken after the end of the
applicable period shall not be used to meet the monitoring requirements of a subsequent
period. Replacement samples shall be collected as follows:
        (1) As soon as possible, but no later than 20 days after the system receives
notification from the Department that it has invalidated the sample, or by the end of the
applicable period, whichever occurs later; and
        (2) At the same locations as the invalidated samples or, if that is not possible, at
locations other than those already used for sampling during the monitoring period.

§64678. Determination of Exceedances of Lead and Copper Action Levels.
    (a) The detection limits for purposes of reporting (DLRs) for lead and copper are as
follows:

                         Table 64678-A. DLRs for Lead and Copper

                          Contaminant                              DLR (mg/L)
                              Lead . . . . . . . .... . . . . . . . . . . 0.005
                             Copper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.050

    (b) For purposes of determining the difference in concentration between the source
water and the 90th percentile tap results, the following shall apply:
        (1) Analytical results for lead greater than or equal to 0.001 mg/L and less than
0.005 mg/L shall be as measured or 0.0025 mg/L, whichever is greater.
        (2) Analytical results for copper greater than or equal to 0.001 mg/L and less than
0.050 mg/L shall be as measured or 0.025 mg/L, whichever is greater.
        (3) Analytical results below 0.001 mg/L for lead and copper shall be considered
zero.

    (c) Analytical results below the DLRs for lead and copper specified shall be reported
as zero.

     (d) The lead action level is exceeded if the concentration of lead in more than 10
percent of the tap water samples collected during any period is greater than 0.015 mg/L
(i.e., if the "90th percentile" lead level is greater than 0.015 mg/L).



                                                                                                            258

     (e) The copper action level is exceeded if the concentration of copper in more than 10
percent of the tap water samples collected during any period is greater than 1.3 mg/L
(i.e., if the "90th percentile" copper level is greater than 1.3 mg/L).

    (f) The 90th percentile lead and copper levels shall be computed as follows:
        (1) The results of all lead or copper samples collected during a period shall be
placed in ascending order from the sample with the lowest concentration to the sample
with the highest concentration. Each sampling result shall be assigned a number,
ascending by single integers beginning with the number 1 for the sample with the lowest
contaminant level. The number assigned to the sample with the highest contaminant
level shall be equal to the total number of samples taken.
        (2) The number of samples taken during the period shall be multiplied by 0.9.
        (3) The contaminant concentration in the numbered sample identified by the
calculation in paragraph (f)(2) is the 90th percentile contaminant level.
        (4) For water systems serving less than or equal to 100 people that collect 5
samples per period, the 90th percentile is computed by taking the average of the highest
and second highest concentrations.

    (g) The results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the minimum requirements
of this section shall be considered by the system and submitted to the department for
making any determinations.

§64678.5. Monitoring Waivers for Small Systems.
   (a) A small water system may apply to the Department for a waiver to reduce the tap
sampling frequency for lead and copper to once every nine years, and shall continue tap
sampling as required by this chapter until it receives written notification from the
Department that the waiver has been approved.

    (b) A system that meets the following materials and monitoring criteria for both lead
and copper will be granted a full waiver, while a system that meets both sets of criteria
for only one of the chemicals will be granted a partial waiver that covers only that
chemical.
        (1) To meet the materials criteria, a system shall provide certification and
documentation that its distribution system and service lines and all drinking water supply
plumbing, including plumbing conveying drinking water within all residences and
buildings connected to the system, satisfy the following:
            (A) For lead, the system shall be free of the following lead-containing
materials:
               1. Plastic pipes that contain lead plasticizers, or plastic service lines that
contain lead plasticizers; and
               2. Lead service lines, lead pipes, lead soldered pipe joints, and leaded
brass or bronze alloy fittings and fixtures, unless the utility can demonstrate to the
Department that such fittings and fixtures will not leach lead into the drinking water.
                                                                                                            259

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

             (B) For copper, the system shall be free of copper pipes and copper service
lines.
       (2) To meet the monitoring criteria, the system shall have completed at least one
period of standard tap sampling and demonstrate that the 90th percentile levels for all
periods of tap sampling conducted since the system became free of all lead-containing
and/or copper-containing materials, as appropriate, do not exceed the following:
            (A) For lead, 0.005 mg/L.
            (B) For copper, 0.65 mg/L.

    (c) If granted a waiver, the system shall
         (1) Comply with any requirements that the Department includes as conditions of
the waiver, such as limited monitoring, periodic outreach to customers to remind them to
avoid installation of materials that might void the waiver;
         (2) Conduct tap sampling at the reduced number of sites for one period every nine
years for the chemical(s) for which the waiver has been granted;
         (3) Provide the materials certification specified in paragraph (b)(1) for the
chemical(s) for which the waiver has been granted, along with the monitoring results; and
         (4) If the waiver was granted for only one chemical, continue to monitor pursuant
to this chapter for the other chemical.

    (d) If the system continues to satisfy the requirements of subsections (b) and (c), the
waiver will be renewed automatically, unless the Department notifies the system in
writing that the waiver has been revoked and why. A system whose waiver has been
revoked may re-apply for a waiver at such time as it again meets the appropriate
materials and monitoring criteria in subsection (b) and (c).

    (e) If a system with a waiver adds a new source of water or changes any water
treatment, the Department may require the system to add or modify waiver conditions
(e.g., require recertification that the system is free of lead-containing and/or copper-
containing materials, require additional tap sampling periods), if it deems such
modifications are necessary to address treatment or source water changes at the system.

    (f) If a system with a waiver becomes aware that it is no longer free of lead-
containing or copper-containing materials, it shall notify the Department in writing no
later than 60 days after becoming aware of such a change.

   (g) If a system with a waiver that has been collecting samples during the months of
June, July, August and September receives Department approval for an alternate set of
months pursuant to section 64675(b)(2) (General Requirements for Tap Sampling for
Lead and Copper), it shall conduct its next tap sampling before the waiver expires.



                                                                                                            260

any customer who requests it. The system is not required to pay for collecting or
analyzing the sample.

Article 4. Water Quality Parameter (WQP) Monitoring
§64680. General WQP Monitoring Requirements.
    (a) WQP tap monitoring shall be:
        (1) Representative of water quality throughout the distribution system, by
considering the number of persons served, the different sources of water and treatment
methods employed, and seasonal variability;
        (2) Not restricted to sites targeted for lead and copper sampling; and
        (3) Include two samples for each applicable WQP during each period, from the
standard number of sites, based on the number of persons served, specified in table

   (b) Initial WQP monitoring at the entry point(s) to the distribution system shall be
two samples for each applicable WQP at each entry point from locations representative of
each source after treatment. After the installation of CCT, only one sample is required at
each entry point. If a system draws water from more than one source and the sources are
combined before distribution, the system shall sample at each entry point during normal
operating conditions.

§64681. Initial WQP Monitoring.
For initial WQP monitoring, each system shall monitor for the following WQPs, pursuant
to section 64680 (General WQP Monitoring Requirements):

rate of the inhibitor used, and the concentration of the active ingredient(s).

    (b) A ground water system may use entry points that are representative of water
quality and treatment conditions throughout the system for the monitoring required in
paragraph (a)(2) as follows:
        (1) If waters from untreated and treated groundwater sources mix, the system
shall monitor entry points representative of each;
        (2) Prior to monitoring, the system shall submit written documentation to the
Department identifying the sites and demonstrating that they are representative.

    (c) Subject to the Department’s written approval, a system that has no action level
exceedance and meets the Department-specified WQP values or ranges may reduce tap
monitoring as follows:
        (1) After two consecutive periods during which it has met the WQP values or

        (3) Measure the following WQPs in any tests conducted under this subsection
before and after evaluating the corrosion control treatments listed above:
             (A) Lead;
             (B) Copper;
             (C) pH;
             (D) Alkalinity;
             (E) Calcium;
             (F) Conductivity;
             (G) Corrosion control inhibitor active ingredient (when an inhibitor is used);
             (H) Water temperature.
        (4) Identify all chemical or physical constraints that limit or prohibit the use of a
particular corrosion control treatment and document such constraints with at least one of
the following:
             (A) Data and documentation showing that a particular corrosion control
treatment has adversely affected other water treatment processes when used by another
water system with comparable water quality characteristics; and/or
             (B) Data and documentation demonstrating that the water system has
previously attempted to evaluate a particular corrosion control treatment and has found
that the treatment is ineffective or adversely affects other water quality treatment
processes.
        (5) Evaluate the effect of the chemicals used for corrosion control treatment on
other water treatment processes.
                                                                                                            263

        (6) Recommend to the Department in writing the treatment option that the
corrosion control studies indicate constitutes CCT for that system on the basis of an
analysis of the data generated during each evaluation. The water system shall provide a
rationale for its recommendation along with all supporting documentation specified in
paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.

    (b) Based on the study conducted pursuant to subsection (a), and a system's
recommended treatment alternative, the Department will either approve the corrosion
control treatment option recommended by the system, or designate alternative corrosion
control treatment(s) from among those listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, notify the
system of its decision on CCT in writing and explain the basis for its determination. If
the Department requests additional information to aid its review, the water system shall
provide the information.

§64684. CCT Installation and Operation.
    (a) Each system shall install and operate throughout its distribution system the CCT
designated by the Department in subsection 64683(b) (Corrosion Control Studies) or
paragraph 64673(c)(3) (Small and Medium-size Water System Requirements) and
monitor WQPs pursuant to section 64682 (WQP Monitoring After CCT Installation).
When the system completes its installation of CCT, it shall submit a letter to the
Department certifying that it has done so.

    (b) After the system installs CCT, the Department will review the treatment and pre-
and post-treatment tap sampling and WQP monitoring data and specify WQPs in writing
within 42 months of its CCT designation as follows:
         (1) A minimum value or a range of values for pH measured at each entry point to
the distribution system;
         (2) A minimum pH value of 7.0 or greater, measured in all tap samples, unless the
Department determines that meeting a pH level of 7.0 is not technologically feasible or is
not necessary for the system to optimize corrosion control;
         (3) If a corrosion inhibitor is used, a minimum concentration or a range of
concentrations for the inhibitor, measured at each entry point to the distribution system
and in all tap samples, that the Department determines is necessary to maintain a
passivating film on the interior walls of the pipes of the distribution system;
         (4) If alkalinity is adjusted as part of CCT, a minimum concentration or a range of
concentrations for alkalinity, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and
in all tap samples;
         (5) If calcium carbonate stabilization is used as part of corrosion control, a
minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for calcium, measured in all tap
samples; and
         (6) Values for additional WQPs determined by the Department to reflect CCT for
the system.

                                                                                                            264

    (c) After the Department specifies WQP values and ranges, each system shall monitor
pursuant to section 64680 (General WQP Monitoring Requirements) and maintain WQPs
as specified by the Department.

    (d) A system shall be out of compliance with the WQP values and ranges specified by
the Department pursuant to subsection (b) for any period during which it has excursions
for more than nine days.
         (1) An excursion occurs when a “daily value” at one or more sample sites for one
or more WQPs in a day is below the minimum value or outside the range of Department-
specified WQPs.
         (2) A “daily value” for a WQP at a site is determined as follows:
             (A) If sampling is more than once a day by continuous monitoring, grab
sampling or both, the daily value shall be the average of all the day’s results at the
sampling site.
             (B) If sampling is once a day, the daily value shall be the day’s result.
             (C) If sampling is less than once a day, the daily value shall apply to the day
that the water supplier receives the result from the laboratory or the 30th day after the
sample is collected, whichever comes first.
         (3) When an excursion occurs, within 48 hours of being notified of the results of
the initial sample(s), the system shall investigate the cause and collect a followup sample
at each affected site for each WQP that did not meet the Department-specified values.
The criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) shall be applied to the followup sample results to
determine if another excursion has occurred.

    (e) A system conducting reduced WQP tap monitoring that fails to meet the
Department-specified WQPs shall resume standard WQP tap monitoring pursuant to
section 64680 (General WQP Monitoring Requirements).

    (f) The results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the minimum requirements
of this section shall be considered by the system and submitted to the Department for
making any determinations (i.e., determining concentrations of WQPs).

    (g) Upon its own initiative or in response to a request by a system, the Department
may modify in writing its designation of CCT or its specified WQP values and ranges if it
determines that modification is necessary to ensure that the system continues to maintain
CCT. Any request shall be in writing, explain the reason for the requested modification,
and include supporting documentation.

        (1) Collect one lead and copper source water sample from each entry point to the
distribution system that is representative of the source or combined sources and is
collected after any treatment, if treatment is applied before distribution;
        (2) In writing, either recommend to the Department the installation and operation
of a source water treatment (ion exchange, reverse osmosis, lime softening, or
coagulation/filtration) or demonstrate that source water treatment is not needed to
minimize lead and copper levels at users’ taps; and
        (3) Submit any additional information requested by the Department to aid in its
determination of whether source water treatment is necessary to minimize lead and
copper levels in water delivered to users' taps.

   (b) The Department will make a determination regarding source water treatment
within six months after submission of monitoring results under subsection (a).

§64686. Requirements Subsequent to the Department’s Designation.
    (a) If the Department determines that source water treatment is required pursuant to
subsection 64685(b), the system shall comply with the following within the specified
timeframes that begin with the Department’s determination regarding source water
treatment:
        (1) Install the treatment within 24 months and submit a letter to the Department
certifying that installation has been completed;
        (2) Collect an additional source water sample from each entry point to the
distribution system during two consecutive periods within 36 months;
        (3) Complete two consecutive periods of standard monitoring for lead and copper
pursuant to section 64675 (General Requirements for Tap Sampling for Lead and
Copper) within 36 months.

    (b) Within 6 months after the system installs source water treatment, based on its
review of the data collected pursuant to subsection (a) and the contaminant removal
capability of the installed treatment when properly operated, the Department will specify
maximum permissible lead and copper levels for water entering the distribution system.
The water system shall comply with these maximum permissible levels.

    (c) After the Department specifies maximum permissible levels or determines that
source water treatment is not needed, the system shall conduct standard monitoring
related to source water pursuant to table 64686-A, according to source water type. If
approved by the Department based on a review of source water data, the system may
reduce monitoring pursuant to table 64686-A.

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), a community water system shall include
the following text in all of the printed materials it distributes through its lead public
education program:
            (A) INTRODUCTION. The California Department of Health Services
(DHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and [insert name of water supplier]
are concerned about lead in your drinking water. Although most homes have very low
levels of lead in their drinking water, some homes in the community have lead levels
above the state and federal action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb), or 0.015 milligrams
of lead per liter of water (mg/L). Under state and federal law we are required to have a
program in place to minimize lead in your drinking water by [insert date when corrosion
control will be completed for your system]. This program includes corrosion control
treatment, source water treatment, and public education. We are also required to replace
the portion of each lead service line that we own if the line contributes lead
concentrations of 15 ppb or more after we have completed the comprehensive treatment
program. If you have any questions about how we are carrying out the requirements of
the lead regulation please give us a call at [insert water system's phone number]. This
brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect you and your family by
reducing your exposure to lead in drinking water.
            (B) HEALTH EFFECTS OF LEAD. Lead is a common metal found
throughout the environment in lead-based paint, air, soil, household dust, food, certain
types of pottery porcelain and pewter, and water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your
health if too much of it enters your body. Lead builds up in the body over many years and
can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young
children and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down
normal mental and physical development of growing bodies. In addition, a child at play
often comes into contact with sources of lead contamination -- like dirt and dust -- that
rarely affect an adult. It is important to wash children's hands and toys often, and to try
to make sure they only put food in their mouths.
            (C) LEAD IN DRINKING WATER
                 1. Lead in drinking water, although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning,
can significantly increase a person's total lead exposure, particularly the exposure of
infants who drink baby formulas and concentrated juices that are mixed with water. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that drinking water can make up 20
percent or more of a person's total exposure to lead.
                 2. Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom
occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes. Lead enters drinking water
primarily as a result of the corrosion, or wearing away, of materials containing lead in the
water distribution system and household plumbing. These materials include lead-based
solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome plated brass faucets, and in some cases,
pipes made of lead that connect your house to the water main (service lines). In 1986,
Congress banned the use of lead solder containing greater than 0.2% lead, and restricted
the lead content of faucets, pipes and other plumbing materials to 8.0%. In California, a
similar law prohibiting the use of both lead solder and lead pipe was enacted in 1985.
                                                                                                            268

and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in

                3. When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead
for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water. This means the
first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon after returning
from work or school, can contain fairly high levels of lead.
             (D) STEPS YOU CAN TAKE IN THE HOME TO REDUCE EXPOSURE
TO LEAD IN DRINKING WATER
                1. Despite our best efforts mentioned earlier to control water corrosivity
and remove lead from the water supply, lead levels in some homes or buildings can be
high. To find out whether you need to take action in your own home, have your drinking
water tested to determine if it contains excessive concentrations of lead. Testing the
water is essential because you cannot see, taste, or smell lead in drinking water. Some
local laboratories that can provide this service are listed at the end of this booklet. For
more information on having your water tested, please call [insert phone number of water
system].
                2. If a water test indicates that the drinking water drawn from a tap in your
home contains lead above 15 ppb, then you should take the following precautions:
                     A. Let the water run from the tap before using it for drinking or
cooking any time the water in a faucet has gone unused for more than six hours. The
longer water resides in your home's plumbing the more lead it may contain. Flushing the
tap means running the cold water faucet until the water gets noticeably colder, usually
about 15 to 30 seconds. If your house has a lead service line to the water main, you may
have to flush the water for a longer time, perhaps one minute, before drinking. Although
toilet flushing or showering flushes water through a portion of your home's plumbing
system, you still need to flush the water in each faucet before using it for drinking or
cooking. Flushing tap water is a simple and inexpensive measure you can take to protect
your family's health. It usually uses less than one or two gallons of water and costs less
than [insert a cost estimate based on flushing two times a day for 30 days] per month. To
conserve water, fill a couple of bottles for drinking water after flushing the tap, and
whenever possible use the first flush water to wash the dishes or water the plants. If you
live in a high-rise building, letting the water flow before using it may not work to lessen
your risk from lead. The plumbing systems have more, and sometimes larger pipes than
smaller buildings. Ask your landlord for help in locating the source of the lead and for
advice on reducing the lead level.
                     B. Try not to cook with, or drink water from the hot water tap. Hot
water can dissolve more lead more quickly than cold water. If you need hot water, draw
water from the cold tap and heat it on the stove.
                     C. Remove loose lead solder and debris from the plumbing materials
installed in newly constructed homes, or homes in which the plumbing has recently been
replaced, by removing the faucet strainers from all taps and running the water from 3 to 5
minutes. Thereafter, periodically remove the strainers and flush out any debris that has
accumulated over time.
                     D. If your copper pipes are joined with lead solder that has been
installed illegally since it was banned in 1986, notify the plumber who did the work and
                                                                                                            269

request that he or she replace the lead solder with lead-free solder. Lead solder looks dull
gray, and when scratched with a key looks shiny. In addition, notify the California
Department of Health Services and your local environmental health department about the
violation.
                     E. Determine whether or not the service line that connects your home
or apartment to the water main is made of lead. The best way to determine if your
service line is made of lead is by either hiring a licensed plumber to inspect the line or by
contacting the plumbing contractor who installed the line. You can identify the plumbing
contractor by checking the record of building permits which should be maintained in the
files of the [insert name of department that issues building permits]. A licensed plumber
can at the same time check to see if your home's plumbing contains lead solder, lead
pipes, or pipe fittings that contain lead. The public water system that delivers water to
your home should also maintain records of the materials located in the distribution
system. If the service line that connects your dwelling to the water main contributes
more than 15 ppb to drinking water, after our comprehensive treatment program is in
place, we are required to replace the portion of the line we own. If the line is only
partially owned by the [insert name of the city, county, or water system that owns the
line], we are required to provide the owner of the privately-owned portion of the service
line with information on how to replace the privately-owned portion of the service line,
and offer to replace that portion of the line at the owner’s expense. If we replace only the
portion of the line that we own, we also are required to notify you in advance and provide
you with information on the steps you can take to minimize exposure to any temporary
increase in lead levels that may result from the partial replacement, to take a follow-up
sample at our expense from the line within 72 hours after the partial replacement, and to
mail or otherwise provide you with the results of that sample within three business days
of receiving the results. Acceptable replacement alternatives include copper, stainless
steel, and plastic pipes. Partial replacement should avoid the creation of mixed piping
systems and include the installation of approved dielectric couplings at all dissimilar
metal interfaces.
                     F. Have an electrician check your wiring. If grounding wires from the
electrical system are attached to your pipes, corrosion may be greater. Check with a
licensed electrician or your local electrical code to determine if your wiring can be
grounded elsewhere. DO NOT attempt to change the wiring yourself because improper
grounding can cause electrical shock and fire hazards.
                 3. The steps described above will reduce the lead concentrations in your
drinking water. However, if a water test indicates that the drinking water coming from
your tap contains lead concentrations in excess of 15 ppb after flushing, or after we have
completed our actions to minimize lead levels, then you may want to take the following
additional measures:
                     A. Purchase or lease a home treatment device. Home treatment
devices are limited in that each unit treats only the water that flows from the faucet to
which it is connected, and all of the devices require periodic maintenance and
replacement. Devices such as reverse osmosis systems or distillers can effectively
                                                                                                            270

remove lead from your drinking water. Since these treatments remove dissolved
minerals, water treated by these devices will have a greater tendency to leach lead from
brass faucets or fittings which the water contacts after treatment. Some activated carbon
filters may reduce lead levels at the tap, however all lead reduction claims should be
investigated. Be sure to check the actual performance of a specific home treatment
device before and after installing the unit. The California Department of Health Services

             (A) INTRODUCTION. The California Department of Health Services, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and [insert name of water
supplier] are concerned about lead in your drinking water. Some drinking water samples
taken from this facility have lead levels above the EPA action level of 15 parts per billion
(ppb), or 0.015 milligrams of lead per liter of water (mg/L). Under Federal law we are
required to have a program in place to minimize lead in your drinking water by [insert
date when corrosion control will be completed for your system]. This program includes
corrosion control treatment, source water treatment, and public education. We are also
required to replace the portion of each lead service line that we own if the line contributes
lead concentrations of more than 15 ppb after we have completed the comprehensive
treatment program. If you have any questions about how we are carrying out the
                                                                                                            271

requirements of the lead regulation please give us a call at [insert water system's phone
number]. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect yourself by
reducing your exposure to lead in drinking water.
            (B) HEALTH EFFECTS OF LEAD. Lead is found throughout the
environment in lead-based paint, air, soil, household dust, food, certain types of pottery
porcelain and pewter, and water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your health if too
much of it enters your body. Lead builds up in the body over many years and can cause
damage to the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The greatest risk is to young children
and pregnant women. Amounts of lead that won't hurt adults can slow down normal
mental and physical development of growing bodies. In addition, a child at play often
comes into contact with sources of lead contamination - like dirt and dust - that rarely
affect an adult. It is important to wash children's hands and toys often, and to try to make
sure they only put food in their mouths.
                 1. Lead in drinking water, although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning,
can significantly increase a person's total lead exposure, particularly the exposure of
infants who drink baby formulas and concentrated juices that are mixed with water. The
EPA estimates that drinking water can make up 20 percent or more of a person's total
exposure to lead.
                 2. Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants in that it seldom
occurs naturally in water supplies like rivers and lakes. Lead enters drinking water
primarily as a result of the corrosion, or wearing away, of materials containing lead in the
water distribution system and household plumbing. These materials include lead-based
solder used to join copper pipe, brass and chrome-plated brass faucets, and in some cases,
pipes made of lead that connect houses and buildings to water mains (service lines). In
1986, Congress banned the use of lead solder containing greater than 0.2% lead, and
restricted the lead content of faucets, pipes and other plumbing materials to 8.0%.
                 3. When water stands in lead pipes or plumbing systems containing lead
for several hours or more, the lead may dissolve into your drinking water. This means
the first water drawn from the tap in the morning, or later in the afternoon if the water has
not been used all day, can contain fairly high levels of lead.
            (D) STEPS YOU CAN TAKE. Steps you can take to reduce exposure to lead
in drinking water include:
                 1. Let the water run from the tap before using it for drinking or cooking
any time the water in a faucet has gone unused for more than six hours. The longer water
resides in plumbing the more lead it may contain. Flushing the tap means running the
cold water faucet for about 15-30 seconds. Although toilet flushing or showering flushes
water through a portion of the plumbing system, you still need to flush the water in each
faucet before using it for drinking or cooking. Flushing tap water is a simple and
inexpensive measure you can take to protect your health. It usually uses less than one
gallon of water.
                 2. Do not cook with, or drink water from the hot water tap. Hot water can
dissolve more lead more quickly than cold water. If you need hot water, draw water from
the cold tap and then heat it.
                                                                                                            272

resident(s) of all buildings served by the line that they may experience a temporary
increase of lead levels in their drinking water, along with guidance on measures they may
take to minimize their exposure. If the replacement is in conjunction with emergency
repairs, the Department will allow a shorter notice, depending on the nature of the
emergency and the timing involved. The notice shall be mailed unless an alternate
method is approved by the Department, based on the feasibility of insuring that all
consumers receive the notice; and
            (B) Inform the resident(s) that the system will collect a first flush tap water
sample within 72 hours after the partial replacement of the service line has been
completed if the resident(s) so desire. If the resident(s) accept the offer, the system shall
collect the sample and report the results to the resident(s) and the owner within three
business days of receiving the results and to the Department.

     (d) Within 12 months after the lead action level exceedance, and every 12 months
thereafter, the system shall submit in writing to the Department the number of lead
service lines scheduled to be replaced during the previous year of the system's
replacement schedule, along with the following information to the Department:
         (1) The number and location of each lead service line replaced during the
previous year of the system's replacement schedule to demonstrate that it has replaced at
least 7 percent of the initial lead service lines within the previous 12 months, or a greater
number of lines if required by the Department; or
         (2) Lead service line sampling results that demonstrate that the lead level from an
individual line(s) is less than or equal to 0.015 mg/L, pursuant to section 64689 (Lead
Service Line Sampling). The system shall submit the results of the lead service line
sampling including the lead levels, location of each lead service line sampled, the
sampling method, and the date of sampling. It shall also include the number and location
of each lead service line replaced during the previous year. In such cases, the total
number of lines replaced and/or that meet the criteria shall equal at least 7 percent of the
initial number of lead lines identified or the percentage required by the Department.

   (e) A system shall replace lead service lines at a faster rate than that required by
subsection (b), taking into account the number of lead service lines in the system, if the
                                                                                                            276

§141.153. Content of the reports.
     (h)(6) Systems required to comply with subpart S.
          (i) Any ground water system that receives notice from the State of a significant
deficiency or notice from a laboratory of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample
that is not invalidated by the State under §141.402(d) must inform its customers of any significant
deficiency that is uncorrected at the time of the next report or of any fecal indicator-positive
ground water source sample in the next report. The system must continue to inform the public
annually until the State determines that particular significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal
contamination in the ground water source is addressed under §141.403(a). Each report must
include the following elements.
               (A) The nature of the particular significant deficiency or the source of the fecal
contamination (if the source is known) and the date the significant deficiency was identified by
the State or the dates of the fecal indicator-positive ground water source samples;
               (B) If the fecal contamination in the ground water source has been addressed under
§141.403(a) and the date of such action;
               (C) For each significant deficiency or fecal contamination in the ground water source
that has not been addressed under §141.403(a), the State-approved plan and schedule for
correction, including interim measures, progress to date, and any interim measures completed;
and
               (D) If the system receives notice of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source
sample that is not invalidated by the State under §141.402(d), the potential health effects using
the health effects language of Appendix A of subpart O.
     (ii) If directed by the State, a system with significant deficiencies that have been corrected
before the next report is issued must inform its customers of the significant deficiency, how the
deficiency was corrected, and the date of correction under paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section.

                                       Ground Water Rule
§141.400. General requirements and applicability.
    (a) Scope of this subpart. The requirements of this subpart S constitute National Primary
Drinking Water Regulations.

     (b) Applicability. This subpart applies to all public water systems that use ground water
except that it does not apply to public water systems that combine all of their ground water with
surface water or with ground water under the direct influence of surface water prior to treatment
under subpart H. For the purposes of this subpart, “ground water system” is defined as any public
water system meeting this applicability statement, including consecutive systems receiving
finished ground water.

     (c) General requirements. Systems subject to this subpart must comply with the following
requirements:
          (1) Sanitary survey information requirements for all ground water systems as described in
§141.401.
          (2) Microbial source water monitoring requirements for ground water systems that do not
treat all of their ground water to at least 99.99 percent (4-log) treatment of viruses (using
inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)
before or at the first customer as described in §141.402.
          (3) Treatment technique requirements, described in §141.403, that apply to ground water
systems that have fecally contaminated source waters, as determined by source water monitoring
conducted under §141.402, or that have significant deficiencies that are identified by the State or
that are identified by EPA under SDWA section 1445. A ground water system with fecally
contaminated source water or with significant deficiencies subject to the treatment technique
requirements of this subpart must implement one or more of the following corrective action
options: correct all significant deficiencies; provide an alternate source of water; eliminate the
source of contamination; or provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of
viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation
and removal) before or at the first customer.
          (4) Ground water systems that provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using
inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)
before or at the first customer are required to conduct compliance monitoring to demonstrate
treatment effectiveness, as described in §141.403(b).
          (5) If requested by the State, ground water systems must provide the State with any
existing information that will enable the State to perform a hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment.
For the purposes of this subpart, “hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment” is a determination of
whether ground water systems obtain water from hydrogeologically sensitive settings.

    (d) Compliance date. Ground water systems must comply, unless otherwise noted, with the
requirements of this subpart beginning December 1, 2009.




                                                                                                            282

§141.401. Sanitary surveys for ground water systems.
    (a) Ground water systems must provide the State, at the State's request, any existing
information that will enable the State to conduct a sanitary survey.

     (b) For the purposes of this subpart, a “sanitary survey,” as conducted by the State, includes
but is not limited to, an onsite review of the water source(s) (identifying sources of contamination
by using results of source water assessments or other relevant information where available),
facilities, equipment, operation, maintenance, and monitoring compliance of a public water
system to evaluate the adequacy of the system, its sources and operations and the distribution of
safe drinking water.

    (c) The sanitary survey must include an evaluation of the applicable components listed in
paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section:
        (1) Source,
        (2) Treatment,
        (3) Distribution system,
        (4) Finished water storage,
        (5) Pumps, pump facilities, and controls,
        (6) Monitoring, reporting, and data verification,
        (7) System management and operation, and
        (8) Operator compliance with State requirements.

§141.402. Ground water source microbial monitoring and analytical methods.
    (a) Triggered source water monitoring —
          (1) General requirements. A ground water system must conduct triggered source water
monitoring if the conditions identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section exist.
              (i) The system does not provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation,
removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at
the first customer for each ground water source; and
              (ii) The system is notified that a sample collected under 22 California Code of
Regulations sections 64422 and 64423 is total coliform-positive and the sample is not invalidated
under 22 California Code of Regulations section 64425.
          (2) Sampling requirements. A ground water system must collect, within 24 hours of
notification of the total coliform-positive sample, at least one ground water source sample from
each ground water source in use at the time the total coliform-positive sample was collected
under 22 California Code of Regulations sections 64422 and 64423, except as provided in
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (i) The State may extend the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis if the system
cannot collect the ground water source water sample within 24 hours due to circumstances
beyond its control. In the case of an extension, the State must specify how much time the system
has to collect the sample.
              (ii) If approved by the State, systems with more than one ground water source may
meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) by sampling a representative ground water source
or sources. If directed by the State, systems must submit for State approval a triggered source
water monitoring plan that identifies one or more ground water sources that are representative of
each monitoring site in the system's sample siting plan under 22 California Code of Regulations
                                                                                                            283

sections 64422 and 64423 and that the system intends to use for representative sampling under
this paragraph.
              (iii) A ground water system serving 1,000 people or fewer may use a repeat sample
collected from a ground water source to meet both the requirements of 22 California Code of
Regulations section 64424 and to satisfy the monitoring requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this
section for that ground water source only if the State approves the use of E. coli as a fecal
indicator for source water monitoring under this paragraph (a). If the repeat sample collected
from the ground water source is E.coli positive, the system must comply with paragraph (a)(3) of
this section.
         (3) Additional requirements. If the State does not require corrective action under
§141.403(a)(2) for a fecal indicator-positive source water sample collected under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section that is not invalidated under paragraph (d) of this section, the system must collect
five additional source water samples from the same source within 24 hours of being notified of
the fecal indicator-positive sample.
         (4) Consecutive and wholesale systems —
              (i) In addition to the other requirements of this paragraph (a), a consecutive ground
water system that has a total coliform-positive sample collected under 22 California Code of
Regulations sections 64422 and 64423 must notify the wholesale system(s) within 24 hours of
being notified of the total coliform-positive sample.
              (ii) In addition to the other requirements of this paragraph (a), a wholesale ground
water system must comply with paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) and (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
                    (A) A wholesale ground water system that receives notice from a consecutive
system it serves that a sample collected under 22 California Code of Regulations sections 64422
and 64423 is total coliform-positive must, within 24 hours of being notified, collect a sample
from its ground water source(s) under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and analyze it for a fecal
indicator under paragraph (c) of this section.
                    (B) If the sample collected under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is fecal
indicator-positive, the wholesale ground water system must notify all consecutive systems served
by that ground water source of the fecal indicator source water positive within 24 hours of being
notified of the ground water source sample monitoring result and must meet the requirements of
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
         (5) Exceptions to the triggered source water monitoring requirements. A ground water
system is not required to comply with the source water monitoring requirements of paragraph (a)
of this section if either of the following conditions exists:
              (i) The State determines, and documents in writing, that the total coliform-positive
sample collected under 22 California Code of Regulations sections 64422 and 64423 is caused by
a distribution system deficiency; or
              (ii) The total coliform-positive sample collected under 22 California Code of
Regulations sections 64422 and 64423 is collected at a location that meets State criteria for
distribution system conditions that will cause total coliform-positive samples.

    (b) Assessment source water monitoring. If directed by the State, ground water systems must
conduct assessment source water monitoring that meets State-determined requirements for such
monitoring. A ground water system conducting assessment source water monitoring may use a
triggered source water sample collected under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to meet the

     (d) Invalidation of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample .
          (1) A ground water system may obtain State invalidation of a fecal indicator-positive
ground water source sample collected under paragraph (a) of this section only under the
conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
               (i) The system provides the State with written notice from the laboratory that
improper sample analysis occurred; or
               (ii) The State determines and documents in writing that there is substantial evidence
that a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample is not related to source water quality.
          (2) If the State invalidates a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample, the
ground water system must collect another source water sample under paragraph (a) of this section
within 24 hours of being notified by the State of its invalidation decision and have it analyzed for
the same fecal indicator using the analytical methods in paragraph (c) of this section. The State
may extend the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis if the system cannot collect the source
water sample within 24 hours due to circumstances beyond its control. In the case of an
extension, the State must specify how much time the system has to collect the sample.

    (e) Sampling location.
         (1) Any ground water source sample required under paragraph (a) of this section must be
collected at a location prior to any treatment of the ground water source unless the State approves
a sampling location after treatment.
                                                                                                                                         286

and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in
this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

         (2) If the system's configuration does not allow for sampling at the well itself, the system
may collect a sample at a State-approved location to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of
this section if the sample is representative of the water quality of that well.

   (f) New sources. If directed by the State, a ground water system that places a new ground
water source into service after November 30, 2009, must conduct assessment source water
monitoring under paragraph (b) of this section. If directed by the State, the system must begin
monitoring before the ground water source is used to provide water to the public.

    (g) Public notification. A ground water system with a ground water source sample collected
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section that is fecal indicator-positive and that is not invalidated
under paragraph (d) of this section, including consecutive systems served by the ground water
source, must conduct public notification under §141.202.

    (h) Monitoring violations. Failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)–(f) of this
section is a monitoring violation and requires the ground water system to provide public
notification under §141.204.

§141.403. Treatment technique requirements for ground water systems.
     (a) Ground water systems with significant deficiencies or source water fecal contamination.
         (1) The treatment technique requirements of this section must be met by ground water
systems when a significant deficiency is identified or when a ground water source sample
collected under §141.402(a)(3) is fecal indicator-positive.
         (2) If directed by the State, a ground water system with a ground water source sample
collected under §141.402(a)(2), §141.402(a)(4), or §141.402(b) that is fecal indicator-positive
must comply with the treatment technique requirements of this section.
         (3) When a significant deficiency is identified at a Subpart H public water system that
uses both ground water and surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface
water, the system must comply with provisions of this paragraph except in cases where the State
determines that the significant deficiency is in a portion of the distribution system that is served
solely by surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water.
         (4) Unless the State directs the ground water system to implement a specific corrective
action, the ground water system must consult with the State regarding the appropriate corrective
action within 30 days of receiving written notice from the State of a significant deficiency,
written notice from a laboratory that a ground water source sample collected under
§141.402(a)(3) was found to be fecal indicator-positive, or direction from the State that a fecal
indicator positive collected under §141.402(a)(2), §141.402(a)(4), or §141.402(b) requires
corrective action. For the purposes of this subpart, significant deficiencies include, but are not
limited to, defects in design, operation, or maintenance, or a failure or malfunction of the sources,
treatment, storage, or distribution system that the State determines to be causing, or have potential
for causing, the introduction of contamination into the water delivered to consumers.
         (5) Within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the State) of receiving written notification
from the State of a significant deficiency, written notice from a laboratory that a ground water
source sample collected under §141.402(a)(3) was found to be fecal indicator-positive, or
direction from the State that a fecal indicator-positive sample collected under §141.402(a)(2),
§141.402(a)(4), or §141.402(b) requires corrective action, the ground water system must either:

                                                                                                            287

              (i) Have completed corrective action in accordance with applicable State plan review
processes or other State guidance or direction, if any, including State-specified interim measures;
or
              (ii) Be in compliance with a State-approved corrective action plan and schedule
subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(A) and (a)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.
                    (A) Any subsequent modifications to a State-approved corrective action plan and
schedule must also be approved by the State.
                    (B) If the State specifies interim measures for protection of the public health
pending State approval of the corrective action plan and schedule or pending completion of the
corrective action plan, the system must comply with these interim measures as well as with any
schedule specified by the State.
         (6) Corrective action alternatives. Ground water systems that meet the conditions of
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section must implement one or more of the following corrective
action alternatives:
              (i) Correct all significant deficiencies;
              (ii) Provide an alternate source of water;
              (iii) Eliminate the source of contamination; or
              (iv) Provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using
inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)
before or at the first customer for the ground water source.
         (7) Special notice to the public of significant deficiencies or source water fecal
contamination.
              (i) In addition to the applicable public notification requirements of §141.202, a
community ground water system that receives notice from the State of a significant deficiency or
notification of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated by the
State under §141.402(d) must inform the public served by the water system under §141.153(h)(6)
of the fecal indicator-positive source sample or of any significant deficiency that has not been
corrected. The system must continue to inform the public annually until the significant deficiency
is corrected or the fecal contamination in the ground water source is determined by the State to be
corrected under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
              (ii) In addition to the applicable public notification requirements of §141.202, a non-
community ground water system that receives notice from the State of a significant deficiency
must inform the public served by the water system in a manner approved by the State of any
significant deficiency that has not been corrected within 12 months of being notified by the State,
or earlier if directed by the State. The system must continue to inform the public annually until
the significant deficiency is corrected. The information must include:
                    (A) The nature of the significant deficiency and the date the significant
deficiency was identified by the State;
                    (B) The State-approved plan and schedule for correction of the significant
deficiency, including interim measures, progress to date, and any interim measures completed;
and
                    (C) For systems with a large proportion of non-English speaking consumers, as
determined by the State, information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance of
the notice or a telephone number or address where consumers may contact the system to obtain a
translated copy of the notice or assistance in the appropriate language.
              (iii) If directed by the State, a non-community water system with significant
deficiencies that have been corrected must inform its customers of the significant deficiencies,
                                                                                                            288

how the deficiencies were corrected, and the dates of correction under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this
section.

     (b) Compliance monitoring —
         (1) Existing ground water sources. A ground water system that is not required to meet the
source water monitoring requirements of this subpart for any ground water source because it
provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved
combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for any
ground water source before December 1, 2009, must notify the State in writing that it provides at
least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of
4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for the specified ground
water source and begin compliance monitoring in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this
section by December 1, 2009. Notification to the State must include engineering, operational, or
other information that the State requests to evaluate the submission. If the system subsequently
discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved
combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for a ground
water source, the system must conduct ground water source monitoring as required under
§141.402.
         (2) New ground water sources. A ground water system that places a ground water source
in service after November 30, 2009, that is not required to meet the source water monitoring
requirements of this subpart because the system provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using
inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)
before or at the first customer for the ground water source must comply with the requirements of
paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
              (i) The system must notify the State in writing that it provides at least 4-log treatment
of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus
inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for the ground water source. Notification
to the State must include engineering, operational, or other information that the State requests to
evaluate the submission.
              (ii) The system must conduct compliance monitoring as required under
§141.403(b)(3) of this subpart within 30 days of placing the source in service.
              (iii) The system must conduct ground water source monitoring under §141.402 if the
system subsequently discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a
State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first
customer for the ground water source.
         (3) Monitoring requirements. A ground water system subject to the requirements of
paragraphs (a), (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section must monitor the effectiveness and reliability of
treatment for that ground water source before or at the first customer as follows:
              (i) Chemical disinfection —
                    (A) Ground water systems serving greater than 3,300 people. A ground water
system that serves greater than 3,300 people must continuously monitor the residual disinfectant
concentration using analytical methods specified in §141.74(a)(2) at a location approved by the
State and must record the lowest residual disinfectant concentration each day that water from the
ground water source is served to the public. The ground water system must maintain the State-
determined residual disinfectant concentration every day the ground water system serves water
from the ground water source to the public. If there is a failure in the continuous monitoring
equipment, the ground water system must conduct grab sampling every four hours until the
                                                                                                            289

continuous monitoring equipment is returned to service. The system must resume continuous
residual disinfectant monitoring within 14 days.
                   (B) Ground water systems serving 3,300 or fewer people. A ground water system
that serves 3,300 or fewer people must monitor the residual disinfectant concentration using
analytical methods specified in §141.74(a)(2) at a location approved by the State and record the
residual disinfection concentration each day that water from the ground water source is served to
the public. The ground water system must maintain the State-determined residual disinfectant
concentration every day the ground water system serves water from the ground water source to
the public. The ground water system must take a daily grab sample during the hour of peak flow
or at another time specified by the State. If any daily grab sample measurement falls below the
State-determined residual disinfectant concentration, the ground water system must take follow-
up samples every four hours until the residual disinfectant concentration is restored to the State-
determined level. Alternatively, a ground water system that serves 3,300 or fewer people may
monitor continuously and meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
             (ii) Membrane filtration. A ground water system that uses membrane filtration to
meet the requirements of this subpart must monitor the membrane filtration process in accordance
with all State-specified monitoring requirements and must operate the membrane filtration in
accordance with all State-specified compliance requirements. A ground water system that uses
membrane filtration is in compliance with the requirement to achieve at least 4-log removal of
viruses when:
                   (A) The membrane has an absolute molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), or an
alternate parameter that describes the exclusion characteristics of the membrane, that can reliably
achieve at least 4-log removal of viruses;
                   (B) The membrane process is operated in accordance with State-specified
compliance requirements; and
                   (C) The integrity of the membrane is intact.
             (iii) Alternative treatment. A ground water system that uses a State-approved
alternative treatment to meet the requirements of this subpart by providing at least 4-log treatment
of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus
inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer must:
                   (A) Monitor the alternative treatment in accordance with all State-specified
monitoring requirements; and
                   (B) Operate the alternative treatment in accordance with all compliance
requirements that the State determines to be necessary to achieve at least 4-log treatment of
viruses.

    (c) Discontinuing treatment. A ground water system may discontinue 4-log treatment of
viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation
and removal) before or at the first customer for a ground water source if the State determines and
documents in writing that 4-log treatment of viruses is no longer necessary for that ground water
source. A system that discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses is subject to the source water
monitoring and analytical methods requirements of §141.402 of this subpart.

   (d) Failure to meet the monitoring requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is a
monitoring violation and requires the ground water system to provide public notification under
§141.204.

§141.404. Treatment technique violations for ground water systems.
    (a) A ground water system with a significant deficiency is in violation of the treatment
technique requirement if, within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the State) of receiving written
notice from the State of the significant deficiency, the system:
         (1) Does not complete corrective action in accordance with any applicable State plan
review processes or other State guidance and direction, including State specified interim actions
and measures, or
         (2) Is not in compliance with a State-approved corrective action plan and schedule.

    (b) Unless the State invalidates a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample under
§141.402(d), a ground water system is in violation of the treatment technique requirement if,
within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the State) of meeting the conditions of §141.403(a)(1) or
§141.403(a)(2), the system:
        (1) Does not complete corrective action in accordance with any applicable State plan
review processes or other State guidance and direction, including State-specified interim
measures, or
        (2) Is not in compliance with a State-approved corrective action plan and schedule.

     (c) A ground water system subject to the requirements of §141.403(b)(3) that fails to maintain
at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination
of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for a ground water source
is in violation of the treatment technique requirement if the failure is not corrected within four
hours of determining the system is not maintaining at least 4-log treatment of viruses before or at
the first customer.

    (d) Ground water system must give public notification under §141.203 for the treatment
technique violations specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.

notify the State any time the system fails to meet any State-specified requirements including, but
not limited to, minimum residual disinfectant concentration, membrane operating criteria or
membrane integrity, and alternative treatment operating criteria, if operation in accordance with
the criteria or requirements is not restored within four hours. The ground water system must
notify the State as soon as possible, but in no case later than the end of the next business day.
         (2) After completing any corrective action under §141.403(a), a ground water system
must notify the State within 30 days of completion of the corrective action.
         (3) If a ground water system subject to the requirements of §141.402(a) does not conduct
source water monitoring under §141.402(a)(5)(ii), the system must provide documentation to the
State within 30 days of the total coliform positive sample that it met the State criteria.

     (b) Recordkeeping. In addition to the requirements of §141.33, a ground water system
regulated under this subpart must maintain the following information in its records:
         (1) Documentation of corrective actions. Documentation shall be kept for a period of not
less than ten years.
                                                                                                            291

§ 141.211. Special notice for repeated failure to conduct monitoring of the source
water for Cryptosporidium and for failure to determine bin classification or mean
Cryptosporidium level.
    (a) When is the special notice for repeated failure to monitor to be given? The owner or
operator of a community or non-community water system that is required to monitor source water
under § 141.701 must notify persons served by the water system that monitoring has not been
completed as specified no later than 30 days after the system has failed to collect any 3 months of
monitoring as specified in § 141.701(c). The notice must be repeated as specified in section
64463.4(b)(2).

     (b) When is the special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean
Cryptosporidium level to be given? The owner or operator of a community or non-community
water system that is required to determine a bin classification under § 141.710, or to determine
mean Cryptosporidium level under § 141.712, must notify persons served by the water system
that the determination has not been made as required no later than 30 days after the system has
failed report the determination as specified in § 141.710(e) or § 141.712(a), respectively. The
notice must be repeated as specified in section 64463.4(b)(2). The notice is not required if the
system is complying with a State-approved schedule to address the violation.

    (c) What is the form and manner of the special notice? The form and manner of the public
notice must follow the requirements for a Tier 2 public notice prescribed in section 64463.4(c).
The public notice must be presented as required in section 64463.4(c).

     (d) What mandatory language must be contained in the special notice? The notice must
contain the following language, including the language necessary to fill in the blanks.
         (1) The special notice for repeated failure to conduct monitoring must contain the
following language:
We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for Cryptosporidium. Results of the
monitoring are to be used to determine whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is
sufficient to adequately remove Cryptosporidium from your drinking water. We are required to
complete this monitoring and make this determination by (required bin determination date). We
“did not monitor or test” or “did not complete all monitoring or testing” on schedule and,
therefore, we may not be able to determine by the required date what treatment modifications, if
any, must be made to ensure adequate Cryptosporidium removal. Missing this deadline may, in
turn, jeopardize our ability to have the required treatment modifications, if any, completed by the
deadline required, (date).
For more information, please call (name of water system contact) of (name of water system) at
(phone number).
         (2) The special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean Cryptosporidium
level must contain the following language:
We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for Cryptosporidium in order to
determine by (date) whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is sufficient to
adequately remove Cryptosporidium from your drinking water. We have not made this
determination by the required date. Our failure to do this may jeopardize our ability to have the           293

G. Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs),
Byproduct Precursors, Disinfectant
Residuals. Where disinfection is used in
the treatment of drinking water,
disinfectants combine with organic and
inorganic matter present in water to form
chemicals called disinfection byproducts
(DBPs). EPA sets standards for controlling
the levels of disinfectants and DBPs in
drinking water, including trihalomethanes
(THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). 13

Last updated April 10, 2017—from Titles 17 and 22 California Code of Regulations
California Regulations Related to Drinking Water
NOTE: This publication is meant to be an aid to the staff of the State Board’s Division of Drinking Water
and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in
this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        1. Violations and other situations not listed in this table (e.g., failure to prepare Consumer Confidence Reports), do
not require notice, unless otherwise determined by the primacy agency. Primacy agencies may, at their option, also
require a more stringent public notice tier (e.g., Tier 1 instead of Tier 2 or Tier 2 instead of Tier 3) for specific violations
and situations listed in this Appendix, as authorized under sections 64463.1 and 64463.4.
        2. MCL—Maximum contaminant level, MRDL—Maximum residual disinfectant level, TT—Treatment technique
        3. The term Violations of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) is used here to include violations
of MCL, MRDL, treatment technique, monitoring, and testing procedure requirements.
        4. Failure to test for fecal coliform or E. coli is a Tier 1 violation if testing is not done after any repeat sample tests
positive for coliform. All other total coliform monitoring and testing procedure violations are Tier 3.
        5. Systems that violate the turbidity MCL of 5 NTU based on an average of measurements over two consecutive
days must consult with the primacy agency within 24 hours after learning of the violation. Based on this consultation, the
primacy agency may subsequently decide to elevate the violation to Tier 1. If a system is unable to make contact with the
primacy agency in the 24-hour period, the violation is automatically elevated to Tier 1.
        6. Systems with treatment technique violations involving a single exceedance of a maximum turbidity limit under
the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR), the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR), or the Long
Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR) are required to consult with the primacy agency within 24
hours after learning of the violation. Based on this consultation, the primacy agency may subsequently decide to elevate
the violation to Tier 1. If a system is unable to make contact with the primacy agency in the 24-hour period, the violation is
automatically elevated to Tier 1.
        7. Most of the requirements of the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (63 FR 69477) (§§ 141.170-
141.171, 141.173-141.174) become effective January 1, 2002 for Subpart H systems (surface water systems and ground
water systems under the direct influence of surface water) serving at least 10,000 persons. However, § 141.172 has some
requirements that become effective as early as April 16, 1999. The Surface Water Treatment Rule remains in effect for
systems serving at least 10,000 persons even after 2002; the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule adds
additional requirements and does not in many cases supercede the SWTR.
        8. The arsenic MCL citations are effective January 23, 2006. Until then, the citations are § 141.11(b) and
§ 141.23(n).
        9. The uranium MCL Tier 2 violation citations are effective December 8, 2003 for all community water systems.
        10. The uranium Tier 3 violation citations are effective December 8, 2000 for all community water systems.
        11. The arsenic Tier 3 violation MCL citations are effective January 23, 2006. Until then, the citations are
§ 141.23(a), (l).
        12. Failure to take a confirmation sample within 24 hours for nitrate or nitrite after an initial sample exceeds the
MCL is a Tier 1 violation. Other monitoring violations for nitrate are Tier 3.
        13. Subpart H community and non-transient non-community systems serving ≥10,000 must comply with new DBP
MCLs, disinfectant MRDLs, and related monitoring requirements beginning January 1, 2002. All other community and
non-transient non-community systems must meet the MCLs and MRDLs beginning January 1, 2004. Subpart H transient
non-community systems serving 10,000 or more persons and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must
comply with the chlorine dioxide MRDL beginning January 1, 2002. Subpart H transient non-community systems serving
fewer than 10,000 persons and using only ground water not under the direct influence of surface water and using chlorine
dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must comply with the chlorine dioxide MRDL beginning January 1, 2004.
        14. §§ 141.64(b)(1) 141.132(a)-(b) apply until §§ 141.620-141.630 take effect under the schedule in § 141.620(c).
        15. Failure to monitor for chlorine dioxide at the entrance to the distribution system the day after exceeding the
MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is a Tier 2 violation.
        16. If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL for chlorine dioxide and
one or more samples taken in the distribution system the next day exceed the MRDL, Tier 1 notification is required.
Failure to take the required samples in the distribution system after the MRDL is exceeded at the entry point also triggers
Tier 1 notification.
        17. Some water systems must monitor for certain unregulated contaminants listed in § 141.40.
        18. This citation refers to §§ 1415 and 1416 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. §§ 1415 and 1416 require that “a
schedule prescribed. . . for a public water system granted a variance [or exemption] shall require compliance by the
system. . .”
        19. In addition to §§ 1415 and 1416 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 40 CFR 142.307 specifies the items and
schedule milestones that must be included in a variance for small systems.
        20. Other waterborne emergencies require a Tier 1 public notice under § 141.202(a) for situations that do not meet
the definition of a waterborne disease outbreak given in 40 CFR 141.2 but that still have the potential to have serious
adverse effects on health as a result of short-term exposure. These could include outbreaks not related to treatment
deficiencies, as well as situations that have the potential to cause outbreaks, such as failures or significant interruption in
water treatment processes, natural disasters that disrupt the water supply or distribution system, chemical spills, or
unexpected loading of possible pathogens into the source water.
        21. Primacy agencies may place other situations in any tier they believe appropriate, based on threat to public
health.
        22. Failure to collect three or more samples for Cryptosporidium analysis is a Tier 2 violation requiring special
notice as specified in § 141.211. All other monitoring and testing procedure violations are Tier 3.

       (7) Systems must address significant deficiencies identified in sanitary surveys performed
by EPA as described in § 141.723.

§ 141.701. Source water monitoring.
     (a) Initial round of source water monitoring. Systems must conduct the following monitoring
on the schedule in paragraph (c) of this section unless they meet the monitoring exemption
criteria in paragraph (d) of this section.
          (1) Filtered systems serving at least 10,000 people must sample their source water for
Cryptosporidium, E. coli, and turbidity at least monthly for 24 months.
          (2) Unfiltered systems serving at least 10,000 people must sample their source water for
Cryptosporidium at least monthly for 24 months.
          (3)
              (i) Filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample their source water
for E. coli at least once every two weeks for 12 months.
              (ii) A filtered system serving fewer than 10,000 people may avoid E. coli monitoring
if the system notifies the State that it will monitor for Cryptosporidium as described in paragraph
(a)(4) of this section. The system must notify the State no later than 3 months prior to the date the
system is otherwise required to start E. coli monitoring under § 141.701(c).
          (4) Filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample their source water for
Cryptosporidium at least twice per month for 12 months or at least monthly for 24 months if they
meet one of the following, based on monitoring conducted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section:
              (i) For systems using lake/reservoir sources, the annual mean E. coli concentration is
greater than 10 E. coli /100 mL.
              (ii) For systems using flowing stream sources, the annual mean E. coli concentration
is greater than 50 E. coli /100 mL.
              (iii) The system does not conduct E. coli monitoring as described in paragraph (a)(3)
of this section.
              (iv) Systems using ground water under the direct influence of surface water
(GWUDI) must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section based on the E.
coli level that applies to the nearest surface water body. If no surface water body is nearby, the
system must comply based on the requirements that apply to systems using lake/reservoir sources.
          (5) For filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people, the State may approve
monitoring for an indicator other than E. coli under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The State
also may approve an alternative to the E. coli concentration in paragraph (a)(4)(i), (ii) or (iv) of
this section to trigger Cryptosporidium monitoring. This approval by the State must be provided
to the system in writing and must include the basis for the State's determination that the
alternative indicator and/or trigger level will provide a more accurate identification of whether a
system will exceed the Bin 1 Cryptosporidium level in § 141.710.
          (6) Unfiltered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample their source water
for Cryptosporidium at least twice per month for 12 months or at least monthly for 24 months.
          (7) Systems may sample more frequently than required under this section if the sampling
frequency is evenly spaced throughout the monitoring period.

     a
         Applies only to filtered systems.
     b
         Applies to filtered systems that meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section and unfiltered systems.


     (d) Monitoring avoidance.
          (1) Filtered systems are not required to conduct source water monitoring under this
subpart if the system will provide a total of at least 5.5-log of treatment for Cryptosporidium,
equivalent to meeting the treatment requirements of Bin 4 in § 141.711.
          (2) Unfiltered systems are not required to conduct source water monitoring under this
subpart if the system will provide a total of at least 3-log Cryptosporidium inactivation,
equivalent to meeting the treatment requirements for unfiltered systems with a mean
Cryptosporidium concentration of greater than 0.01 oocysts/L in § 141.712.
          (3) If a system chooses to provide the level of treatment in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this
section, as applicable, rather than start source water monitoring, the system must notify the State
in writing no later than the date the system is otherwise required to submit a sampling schedule
for monitoring under § 141.702. Alternatively, a system may choose to stop sampling at any point
after it has initiated monitoring if it notifies the State in writing that it will provide this level of
treatment. Systems must install and operate technologies to provide this level of treatment by the
applicable treatment compliance date in § 141.713.

    (e) Plants operating only part of the year. Systems with Title 22, Division 4, Chapter 17,
California Code of Regulations plants that operate for only part of the year must conduct source
water monitoring in accordance with this subpart, but with the following modifications:

                                                                                                                            303

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

        (1) Systems must sample their source water only during the months that the plant
operates unless the State specifies another monitoring period based on plant operating practices.
        (2) Systems with plants that operate less than six months per year and that monitor for
Cryptosporidium must collect at least six Cryptosporidium samples per year during each of two
years of monitoring. Samples must be evenly spaced throughout the period the plant operates.

    (f)
         (1) New sources. A system that begins using a new source of surface water or GWUDI
after the system is required to begin monitoring under paragraph (c) of this section must monitor
the new source on a schedule the State approves. Source water monitoring must meet the
requirements of this subpart. The system must also meet the bin classification and
Cryptosporidium treatment requirements of §§ 141.710 and 141.711 or § 141.712, as applicable,
for the new source on a schedule the State approves.
         (2) The requirements of § 141.701(f) apply to Title 22, Division 4, Chapter 17, California
Code of Regulations systems that begin operation after the monitoring start date applicable to the
system's size under paragraph (c) of this section.
         (3) The system must begin a second round of source water monitoring no later than 6
years following initial bin classification under § 141.710 or determination of the mean
Cryptosporidium level under § 141.712, as applicable.

    (g) Failure to collect any source water sample required under this section in accordance with
the sampling schedule, sampling location, analytical method, approved laboratory, and reporting
requirements of §§ 141.702 through 141.706 is a monitoring violation.

     (h) Grandfathering monitoring data. Systems may use (grandfather) monitoring data
collected prior to the applicable monitoring start date in paragraph (c) of this section to meet the
initial source water monitoring requirements in paragraph (a) of this section. Grandfathered data
may substitute for an equivalent number of months at the end of the monitoring period. All data
submitted under this paragraph must meet the requirements in § 141.707.

§ 141.702. Sampling schedules.
     (a) Systems required to conduct source water monitoring under § 141.701 must submit a
sampling schedule that specifies the calendar dates when the system will collect each required
sample.
          (1) Systems must submit sampling schedules no later than 3 months prior to the
applicable date listed in § 141.701(c) for each round of required monitoring.
          (2)
              (i) Systems serving at least 10,000 people must submit their sampling schedule for
the initial round of source water monitoring under § 141.701(a) to EPA electronically at
https://intranet.epa.gov/lt2/ .
              (ii) If a system is unable to submit the sampling schedule electronically, the system
may use an alternative approach for submitting the sampling schedule that EPA approves.
          (3) Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must submit their sampling schedules for
the initial round of source water monitoring § 141.701(a) to the State.
          (4) Systems must submit sampling schedules for the second round of source water
monitoring § 141.701(b) to the State.

                                                                                                            304

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

       (5) If EPA or the State does not respond to a system regarding its sampling schedule, the
system must sample at the reported schedule.

     (b) Systems must collect samples within two days before or two days after the dates indicated
in their sampling schedule ( i.e. , within a five-day period around the schedule date) unless one of
the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section applies.
         (1) If an extreme condition or situation exists that may pose danger to the sample
collector, or that cannot be avoided and causes the system to be unable to sample in the scheduled
five-day period, the system must sample as close to the scheduled date as is feasible unless the
State approves an alternative sampling date. The system must submit an explanation for the
delayed sampling date to the State concurrent with the shipment of the sample to the laboratory.
         (2)
              (i) If a system is unable to report a valid analytical result for a scheduled sampling
date due to equipment failure, loss of or damage to the sample, failure to comply with the
analytical method requirements, including the quality control requirements in § 141.704, or the
failure of an approved laboratory to analyze the sample, then the system must collect a
replacement sample.
              (ii) The system must collect the replacement sample not later than 21 days after
receiving information that an analytical result cannot be reported for the scheduled date unless the
system demonstrates that collecting a replacement sample within this time frame is not feasible or
the State approves an alternative resampling date. The system must submit an explanation for the
delayed sampling date to the State concurrent with the shipment of the sample to the laboratory.

    (c) Systems that fail to meet the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section for any source water
sample required under § 141.701 must revise their sampling schedules to add dates for collecting
all missed samples. Systems must submit the revised schedule to the State for approval prior to
when the system begins collecting the missed samples.

§ 141.703. Sampling locations.
   (a) Systems required to conduct source water monitoring under § 141.701 must collect
samples for each plant that treats a surface water or GWUDI source. Where multiple plants draw
water from the same influent, such as the same pipe or intake, the State may approve one set of
monitoring results to be used to satisfy the requirements of § 141.701 for all plants.

    (b)
         (1) Systems must collect source water samples prior to chemical treatment, such as
coagulants, oxidants and disinfectants, unless the system meets the condition of paragraph (b)(2)
of this section.
         (2) The State may approve a system to collect a source water sample after chemical
treatment. To grant this approval, the State must determine that collecting a sample prior to
chemical treatment is not feasible for the system and that the chemical treatment is unlikely to
have a significant adverse effect on the analysis of the sample.

    (c) Systems that recycle filter backwash water must collect source water samples prior to the
point of filter backwash water addition.


                                                                                                            305

    (d) Bank filtration.
         (1) Systems that receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit for bank filtration under
sections 64653(e) and (f), as applicable, must collect source water samples in the surface water
prior to bank filtration.
         (2) Systems that use bank filtration as pretreatment to a filtration plant must collect
source water samples from the well ( i.e. , after bank filtration). Use of bank filtration during
monitoring must be consistent with routine operational practice. Systems collecting samples after
a bank filtration process may not receive treatment credit for the bank filtration under §
141.717(c).

     (e) Multiple sources. Systems with plants that use multiple water sources, including multiple
surface water sources and blended surface water and ground water sources, must collect samples
as specified in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section. The use of multiple sources during
monitoring must be consistent with routine operational practice.
         (1) If a sampling tap is available where the sources are combined prior to treatment,
systems must collect samples from the tap.
         (2) If a sampling tap where the sources are combined prior to treatment is not available,
systems must collect samples at each source near the intake on the same day and must follow
either paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section for sample analysis.
              (i) Systems may composite samples from each source into one sample prior to
analysis. The volume of sample from each source must be weighted according to the proportion
of the source in the total plant flow at the time the sample is collected.
              (ii) Systems may analyze samples from each source separately and calculate a
weighted average of the analysis results for each sampling date. The weighted average must be
calculated by multiplying the analysis result for each source by the fraction the source contributed
to total plant flow at the time the sample was collected and then summing these values.

     (f) Additional Requirements. Systems must submit a description of their sampling location(s)
to the State at the same time as the sampling schedule required under § 141.702. This description
must address the position of the sampling location in relation to the system's water source(s) and
treatment processes, including pretreatment, points of chemical treatment, and filter backwash
recycle. If the State does not respond to a system regarding sampling location(s), the system must
sample at the reported location(s).

§ 141.704. Analytical methods.
     (a) Cryptosporidium. Systems must analyze for Cryptosporidium using Method 1623:
Cryptosporidium and Giardia in Water by Filtration/IMS/FA, 2005, United States Environmental
Protection Agency, EPA-815-R-05-002 or Method 1622: Cryptosporidium in Water by

       Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people that are not required to monitor for turbidity under
§ 141.701 are not required to report turbidity with their E. coli results.


§ 141.707. Grandfathering previously collected data.
    (a)
        (1) Systems may comply with the initial source water monitoring requirements of §
141.701(a) by grandfathering sample results collected before the system is required to begin
monitoring ( i.e. , previously collected data). To be grandfathered, the sample results and analysis
must meet the criteria in this section and the State must approve.
        (2) A filtered system may grandfather Cryptosporidium samples to meet the requirements
of § 141.701(a) when the system does not have corresponding E. coli and turbidity samples. A
system that grandfathers Cryptosporidium samples without E. coli and turbidity samples is not
required to collect E. coli and turbidity samples when the system completes the requirements for
Cryptosporidium monitoring under § 141.701(a).

    (b) E. coli sample analysis. The analysis of E. coli samples must meet the analytical method
and approved laboratory requirements of §§ 141.704 through 141.705.

    (c) Cryptosporidium sample analysis. The analysis of Cryptosporidium samples must meet
the criteria in this paragraph.
         (1) Laboratories analyzed Cryptosporidium samples using one of the analytical methods
in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, which are incorporated by reference. The
Director of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. You may obtain a copy of these methods on-line from the

             (vi) Method 1622: Cryptosporidium in Water by Filtration/IMS/FA, 1999, United
States Environmental Protection Agency, EPA-821-R-99-001.
         (2) For each Cryptosporidium sample, the laboratory analyzed at least 10 L of sample or
at least 2 mL of packed pellet or as much volume as could be filtered by 2 filters that EPA
approved for the methods listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    (d) Sampling location. The sampling location must meet the conditions in § 141.703.

    (e) Sampling frequency. Cryptosporidium samples were collected no less frequently than each
calendar month on a regular schedule, beginning no earlier than January 1999. Sample collection
intervals may vary for the conditions specified in § 141.702(b)(1) and (2) if the system provides
documentation of the condition when reporting monitoring results.
         (1) The State may approve grandfathering of previously collected data where there are
time gaps in the sampling frequency if the system conducts additional monitoring the State
specifies to ensure that the data used to comply with the initial source water monitoring
requirements of § 141.701(a) are seasonally representative and unbiased.
         (2) Systems may grandfather previously collected data where the sampling frequency
within each month varied. If the Cryptosporidium sampling frequency varied, systems must
follow the monthly averaging procedure in § 141.710(b)(5) or § 141.712(a)(3), as applicable,
when calculating the bin classification for filtered systems or the mean Cryptosporidium
concentration for unfiltered systems.

     (f) Reporting monitoring results for grandfathering. Systems that request to grandfather
previously collected monitoring results must report the following information by the applicable
dates listed in this paragraph. Systems serving at least 10,000 people must report this information
to EPA unless the State approves reporting to the State rather than EPA. Systems serving fewer
than 10,000 people must report this information to the State.
          (1) Systems must report that they intend to submit previously collected monitoring results
for grandfathering. This report must specify the number of previously collected results the system
will submit, the dates of the first and last sample, and whether a system will conduct additional
source water monitoring to meet the requirements of § 141.701(a). Systems must report this
information no later than the date the sampling schedule under § 141.702 is required.
          (2) Systems must report previously collected monitoring results for grandfathering, along
with the associated documentation listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, no
later than two months after the applicable date listed in § 141.701(c).
              (i) For each sample result, systems must report the applicable data elements in §
141.706.
              (ii) Systems must certify that the reported monitoring results include all results the
system generated during the time period beginning with the first reported result and ending with
                                                                                                            310

the final reported result. This applies to samples that were collected from the sampling location
specified for source water monitoring under this subpart, not spiked, and analyzed using the
laboratory's routine process for the analytical methods listed in this section.
             (iii) Systems must certify that the samples were representative of a plant's source
water(s) and the source water(s) have not changed. Systems must report a description of the
sampling location(s), which must address the position of the sampling location in relation to the
system's water source(s) and treatment processes, including points of chemical addition and filter
backwash recycle.
             (iv) For Cryptosporidium samples, the laboratory or laboratories that analyzed the
samples must provide a letter certifying that the quality control criteria specified in the methods
listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section were met for each sample batch associated with the
reported results. Alternatively, the laboratory may provide bench sheets and sample examination
report forms for each field, matrix spike, IPR, OPR, and method blank sample associated with the
reported results.

    (g) If the State determines that a previously collected data set submitted for grandfathering
was generated during source water conditions that were not normal for the system, such as a
drought, the State may disapprove the data. Alternatively, the State may approve the previously
collected data if the system reports additional source water monitoring data, as determined by the
State, to ensure that the data set used under § 141.710 or § 141.712 represents average source
water conditions for the system.

     (h) If a system submits previously collected data that fully meet the number of samples
required for initial source water monitoring under § 141.701(a) and some of the data are rejected
due to not meeting the requirements of this section, systems must conduct additional monitoring
to replace rejected data on a schedule the State approves. Systems are not required to begin this
additional monitoring until two months after notification that data have been rejected and
additional monitoring is necessary.

§ 141.708. Requirements when making a significant change in disinfection practice.
     (a) Following the completion of initial source water monitoring under § 141.701(a), a system
that plans to make a significant change to its disinfection practice, as defined in paragraph (b) of
this section, must develop disinfection profiles and calculate disinfection benchmarks for Giardia
lamblia and viruses as described in § 141.709. Prior to changing the disinfection practice, the
system must notify the State and must include in this notice the information in paragraphs (a)(1)
through (3) of this section.
          (1) A completed disinfection profile and disinfection benchmark for Giardia lamblia and
viruses as described in § 141.709.
         (2) A description of the proposed change in disinfection practice.
          (3) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current level of disinfection.

    (b) Significant changes to disinfection practice are defined as follows:
        (1) Changes to the point of disinfection;
        (2) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;
        (3) Changes to the disinfection process; or
        (4) Any other modification identified by the State as a significant change to disinfection
practice.
                                                                                                            311

§ 141.709. Developing the disinfection profile and benchmark.
    (a) Systems required to develop disinfection profiles under § 141.708 must follow the
requirements of this section. Systems must monitor at least weekly for a period of 12 consecutive
months to determine the total log inactivation for Giardia lamblia and viruses. If systems monitor
more frequently, the monitoring frequency must be evenly spaced. Systems that operate for fewer
than 12 months per year must monitor weekly during the period of operation. Systems must
determine log inactivation for Giardia lamblia through the entire plant, based on CT99.9 values
in Tables 1.1 through 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1 of § 141.74(b) as applicable. Systems must determine log
inactivation for viruses through the entire treatment plant based on a protocol approved by the
State.

     (b) Systems with a single point of disinfectant application prior to the entrance to the
distribution system must conduct the monitoring in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
Systems with more than one point of disinfectant application must conduct the monitoring in
paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section for each disinfection segment. Systems must monitor
the parameters necessary to determine the total inactivation ratio, using analytical methods in §
141.74(a).
         (1) For systems using a disinfectant other than UV, the temperature of the disinfected
water must be measured at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak
hourly flow or at an alternative location approved by the State.
         (2) For systems using chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water must be measured at each
chlorine residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow or at an
alternative location approved by the State.
         (3) The disinfectant contact time(s) (t) must be determined during peak hourly flow.
         (4) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (C) of the water before or at the first
customer and prior to each additional point of disinfectant application must be measured during
peak hourly flow.

    (c) In lieu of conducting new monitoring under paragraph (b) of this section, systems may
elect to meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
         (1) Systems that have at least one year of existing data that are substantially equivalent to
data collected under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may use these data to develop
disinfection profiles as specified in this section if the system has neither made a significant
change to its treatment practice nor changed sources since the data were collected. Systems may
develop disinfection profiles using up to three years of existing data.
         (2) Systems may use disinfection profile(s) developed under section 64656.5(a) in lieu of
developing a new profile if the system has neither made a significant change to its treatment
practice nor changed sources since the profile was developed. Systems that have not developed a
virus profile under section 64656.5(a) must develop a virus profile using the same monitoring
data on which the Giardia lamblia profile is based.

    (d) Systems must calculate the total inactivation ratio for Giardia lamblia as specified in
paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
         (1) Systems using only one point of disinfectant application may determine the total
inactivation ratio for the disinfection segment based on either of the methods in paragraph
(d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
                                                                                                            312

             (i) Determine one inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT99.9 ) before or at the first customer
during peak hourly flow.
             (ii) Determine successive CTcalc/CT99.9 values, representing sequential inactivation
ratios, between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer
during peak hourly flow. The system must calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining
(CTcalc/CT99.9 ) for each sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/CT99.9 ) values together to
determine (Σ (CTcalc/CT99.9 )).
         (2) Systems using more than one point of disinfectant application before the first
customer must determine the CT value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next
point of disinfectant application, or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during
peak hourly flow. The (CTcalc/CT99.9 ) value of each segment and (Σ (CTcalc/CT99.9 )) must
be calculated using the method in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
         (3) The system must determine the total logs of inactivation by multiplying the value
calculated in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section by 3.0.
         (4) Systems must calculate the log of inactivation for viruses using a protocol approved
by the State.

    (e) Systems must use the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section to
calculate a disinfection benchmark.
         (1) For each year of profiling data collected and calculated under paragraphs (a) through
(d) of this section, systems must determine the lowest mean monthly level of both Giardia
lamblia and virus inactivation. Systems must determine the mean Giardia lamblia and virus
inactivation for each calendar month for each year of profiling data by dividing the sum of daily
or weekly Giardia lamblia and virus log inactivation by the number of values calculated for that
month.
         (2) The disinfection benchmark is the lowest monthly mean value (for systems with one
year of profiling data) or the mean of the lowest monthly mean values (for systems with more
than one year of profiling data) of Giardia lamblia and virus log inactivation in each year of
profiling data.

§ 141.710. Bin classification for filtered systems.
    (a) Following completion of the initial round of source water monitoring required under §
141.701(a), filtered systems must calculate an initial Cryptosporidium bin concentration for each
plant for which monitoring was required. Calculation of the bin concentration must use the
Cryptosporidium results reported under § 141.701(a) and must follow the procedures in
paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.

    (b)
         (1) For systems that collect a total of at least 48 samples, the bin concentration is equal to
the arithmetic mean of all sample concentrations.
         (2) For systems that collect a total of at least 24 samples, but not more than 47 samples,
the bin concentration is equal to the highest arithmetic mean of all sample concentrations in any
12 consecutive months during which Cryptosporidium samples were collected.
         (3) For systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people and monitor for Cryptosporidium for

         (4) For systems with plants operating only part of the year that monitor fewer than 12
months per year under § 141.701(e), the bin concentration is equal to the highest arithmetic mean
of all sample concentrations during any year of Cryptosporidium monitoring.
         (5) If the monthly Cryptosporidium sampling frequency varies, systems must first
calculate a monthly average for each month of monitoring. Systems must then use these monthly
average concentrations, rather than individual sample concentrations, in the applicable calculation
for bin classification in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.

    (c) Filtered systems must determine their initial bin classification from the following table
and using the Cryptosporidium bin concentration calculated under paragraphs (a)-(b) of this
section:

§ 141.716. Source toolbox components.
     (a) Watershed control program. Systems receive 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit
for implementing a watershed control program that meets the requirements of this section.
         (1) Systems that intend to apply for the watershed control program credit must notify the
State of this intent no later than two years prior to the treatment compliance date applicable to the
system in § 141.713.
         (2) Systems must submit to the State a proposed watershed control plan no later than one
year before the applicable treatment compliance date in § 141.713. The State must approve the
watershed control plan for the system to receive watershed control program treatment credit. The
watershed control plan must include the elements in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this
section.
              (i) Identification of an “area of influence” outside of which the likelihood of
Cryptosporidium or fecal contamination affecting the treatment plant intake is not significant.
This is the area to be evaluated in future watershed surveys under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this
section.
              (ii) Identification of both potential and actual sources of Cryptosporidium
contamination and an assessment of the relative impact of these sources on the system's source
water quality.
              (iii) An analysis of the effectiveness and feasibility of control measures that could
reduce Cryptosporidium loading from sources of contamination to the system's source water.
              (iv) A statement of goals and specific actions the system will undertake to reduce
source water Cryptosporidium levels. The plan must explain how the actions are expected to
contribute to specific goals, identify watershed partners and their roles, identify resource
requirements and commitments, and include a schedule for plan implementation with deadlines
for completing specific actions identified in the plan.
         (3) Systems with existing watershed control programs ( i.e., programs in place on January
5, 2006) are eligible to seek this credit. Their watershed control plans must meet the criteria in
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and must specify ongoing and future actions that will reduce
source water Cryptosporidium levels.
         (4) If the State does not respond to a system regarding approval of a watershed control
plan submitted under this section and the system meets the other requirements of this section, the
watershed control program will be considered approved and 0.5 log Cryptosporidium treatment
credit will be awarded unless and until the State subsequently withdraws such approval.
         (5) Systems must complete the actions in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section
to maintain the 0.5-log credit.
              (i) Submit an annual watershed control program status report to the State. The annual
watershed control program status report must describe the system's implementation of the
approved plan and assess the adequacy of the plan to meet its goals. It must explain how the
system is addressing any shortcomings in plan implementation, including those previously
identified by the State or as the result of the watershed survey conducted under paragraph
(a)(5)(ii) of this section. It must also describe any significant changes that have occurred in the
watershed since the last watershed sanitary survey. If a system determines during implementation
that making a significant change to its approved watershed control program is necessary, the
system must notify the State prior to making any such changes. If any change is likely to reduce
the level of source water protection, the system must also list in its notification the actions the
system will take to mitigate this effect.
                                                                                                            321

and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in
this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

              (ii) Undergo a watershed sanitary survey every three years for community water
systems and every five years for noncommunity water systems and submit the survey report to
the State. The survey must be conducted according to State guidelines and by persons the State
approves.
                    (A) The watershed sanitary survey must meet the following criteria: encompass
the region identified in the State-approved watershed control plan as the area of influence; assess
the implementation of actions to reduce source water Cryptosporidium levels; and identify any
significant new sources of Cryptosporidium.
                    (B) If the State determines that significant changes may have occurred in the
watershed since the previous watershed sanitary survey, systems must undergo another watershed
sanitary survey by a date the State requires, which may be earlier than the regular date in
paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.
              (iii) The system must make the watershed control plan, annual status reports, and
watershed sanitary survey reports available to the public upon request. These documents must be
in a plain language style and include criteria by which to evaluate the success of the program in
achieving plan goals. The State may approve systems to withhold from the public portions of the
annual status report, watershed control plan, and watershed sanitary survey based on water supply
security considerations.
         (6) If the State determines that a system is not carrying out the approved watershed
control plan, the State may withdraw the watershed control program treatment credit.

    (b) Alternative source.
         (1) A system may conduct source water monitoring that reflects a different intake
location (either in the same source or for an alternate source) or a different procedure for the
timing or level of withdrawal from the source (alternative source monitoring). If the State
approves, a system may determine its bin classification under § 141.710 based on the alternative
source monitoring results.
         (2) If systems conduct alternative source monitoring under paragraph (b)(1) of this
section, systems must also monitor their current plant intake concurrently as described in §
141.701.
         (3) Alternative source monitoring under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must meet the
requirements for source monitoring to determine bin classification, as described in §§ 141.701
through 141.706. Systems must report the alternative source monitoring results to the State, along
with supporting information documenting the operating conditions under which the samples were
collected.
         (4) If a system determines its bin classification under § 141.710 using alternative source
monitoring results that reflect a different intake location or a different procedure for managing the
timing or level of withdrawal from the source, the system must relocate the intake or permanently
adopt the withdrawal procedure, as applicable, no later than the applicable treatment compliance
date in § 141.713.

§ 141.717. Pre-filtration treatment toolbox components.
    (a) Presedimentation. Systems receive 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit for a
presedimentation basin during any month the process meets the criteria in this paragraph.
         (1) The presedimentation basin must be in continuous operation and must treat the entire
plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source.
         (2) The system must continuously add a coagulant to the presedimentation basin.
                                                                                                            322

this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

          (3) The presedimentation basin must achieve the performance criteria in paragraph (3)(i)
or (ii) of this section.
               (i) Demonstrates at least 0.5-log mean reduction of influent turbidity. This reduction
must be determined using daily turbidity measurements in the presedimentation process influent
and effluent and must be calculated as follows: log10 (monthly mean of daily influent
turbidity)−log10 (monthly mean of daily effluent turbidity).
               (ii) Complies with State-approved performance criteria that demonstrate at least 0.5-
log mean removal of micron-sized particulate material through the presedimentation process.

    (b) Two-stage lime softening. Systems receive an additional 0.5-log Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for a two-stage lime softening plant if chemical addition and hardness
precipitation occur in two separate and sequential softening stages prior to filtration. Both
softening stages must treat the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source.

     (c) Bank filtration. Systems receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit for bank filtration that
serves as pretreatment to a filtration plant by meeting the criteria in this paragraph. Systems using
bank filtration when they begin source water monitoring under § 141.701(a) must collect samples
as described in § 141.703(d) and are not eligible for this credit.
          (1) Wells with a ground water flow path of at least 25 feet receive 0.5-log treatment
credit; wells with a ground water flow path of at least 50 feet receive 1.0-log treatment credit. The
ground water flow path must be determined as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
          (2) Only wells in granular aquifers are eligible for treatment credit. Granular aquifers are
those comprised of sand, clay, silt, rock fragments, pebbles or larger particles, and minor cement.
A system must characterize the aquifer at the well site to determine aquifer properties. Systems
must extract a core from the aquifer and demonstrate that in at least 90 percent of the core length,
grains less than 1.0 mm in diameter constitute at least 10 percent of the core material.
         (3) Only horizontal and vertical wells are eligible for treatment credit.
         (4) For vertical wells, the ground water flow path is the measured distance from the edge
of the surface water body under high flow conditions (determined by the 100 year floodplain
elevation boundary or by the floodway, as defined in Federal Emergency Management Agency
flood hazard maps) to the well screen. For horizontal wells, the ground water flow path is the
measured distance from the bed of the river under normal flow conditions to the closest
horizontal well lateral screen.
         (5) Systems must monitor each wellhead for turbidity at least once every four hours while
the bank filtration process is in operation. If monthly average turbidity levels, based on daily
maximum values in the well, exceed 1 NTU, the system must report this result to the State and
conduct an assessment within 30 days to determine the cause of the high turbidity levels in the
well. If the State determines that microbial removal has been compromised, the State may revoke
treatment credit until the system implements corrective actions approved by the State to
remediate the problem.
         (6) Springs and infiltration galleries are not eligible for treatment credit under this
section, but are eligible for credit under § 141.718(c).
         (7) Bank filtration demonstration of performance. The State may approve
Cryptosporidium treatment credit for bank filtration based on a demonstration of performance
study that meets the criteria in this paragraph. This treatment credit may be greater than 1.0-log
and may be awarded to bank filtration that does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1)-(5) of
this section.
                                                                                                            323

             (i) The study must follow a State-approved protocol and must involve the collection
of data on the removal of Cryptosporidium or a surrogate for Cryptosporidium and related
hydrogeologic and water quality parameters during the full range of operating conditions.
             (ii) The study must include sampling both from the production well(s) and from
monitoring wells that are screened and located along the shortest flow path between the surface
water source and the production well(s).

§ 141.718. Treatment performance toolbox components.
     (a) Combined filter performance. Systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct
filtration treatment receive an additional 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit during any
month the system meets the criteria in this paragraph. Combined filter effluent (CFE) turbidity
must be less than or equal to 0.15 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements. Turbidity must
be measured as described in § 141.74(a) and (c).

     (b) Individual filter performance. Systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct
filtration treatment receive 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit, which can be in addition to
the 0.5-log credit under paragraph (a) of this section, during any month the system meets the
criteria in this paragraph. Compliance with these criteria must be based on individual filter
turbidity monitoring as described in sections 64655 and 64661, as applicable.
          (1) The filtered water turbidity for each individual filter must be less than or equal to 0.15
NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements recorded each month.
          (2) No individual filter may have a measured turbidity greater than 0.3 NTU in two
consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart.
          (3) Any system that has received treatment credit for individual filter performance and
fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section during any month does not
receive a treatment technique violation under § 141.711(c) if the State determines the following:
              (i) The failure was due to unusual and short-term circumstances that could not
reasonably be prevented through optimizing treatment plant design, operation, and maintenance.
              (ii) The system has experienced no more than two such failures in any calendar year.

     (c) Demonstration of performance. The State may approve Cryptosporidium treatment credit
for drinking water treatment processes based on a demonstration of performance study that meets
the criteria in this paragraph. This treatment credit may be greater than or less than the prescribed
treatment credits in § 141.711 or §§ 141.717 through 141.720 and may be awarded to treatment
processes that do not meet the criteria for the prescribed credits.
         (1) Systems cannot receive the prescribed treatment credit for any toolbox box option in
§§ 141.717 through 141.720 if that toolbox option is included in a demonstration of performance
study for which treatment credit is awarded under this paragraph.
         (2) The demonstration of performance study must follow a State-approved protocol and
must demonstrate the level of Cryptosporidium reduction the treatment process will achieve
under the full range of expected operating conditions for the system.
         (3) Approval by the State must be in writing and may include monitoring and treatment
performance criteria that the system must demonstrate and report on an ongoing basis to remain
eligible for the treatment credit. The State may designate such criteria where necessary to verify
that the conditions under which the demonstration of performance credit was approved are
maintained during routine operation.

                                                                                                            324

§ 141.719. Additional filtration toolbox components.
     (a) Bag and cartridge filters. Systems receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit of up to 2.0-
log for individual bag or cartridge filters and up to 2.5-log for bag or cartridge filters operated in
series by meeting the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section. To be eligible for
this credit, systems must report the results of challenge testing that meets the requirements of
paragraphs (a)(2) through (9) of this section to the State. The filters must treat the entire plant
flow taken from a Title 22, Division 4, Chapter 17, California Code of Regulations source.
          (1) The Cryptosporidium treatment credit awarded to bag or cartridge filters must be
based on the removal efficiency demonstrated during challenge testing that is conducted
according to the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9) of this section. A factor of safety
equal to 1-log for individual bag or cartridge filters and 0.5-log for bag or cartridge filters in
series must be applied to challenge testing results to determine removal credit. Systems may use
results from challenge testing conducted prior to January 5, 2006 if the prior testing was
consistent with the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(2) through (9) of this section.
          (2) Challenge testing must be performed on full-scale bag or cartridge filters, and the
associated filter housing or pressure vessel, that are identical in material and construction to the
filters and housings the system will use for removal of Cryptosporidium. Bag or cartridge filters
must be challenge tested in the same configuration that the system will use, either as individual
filters or as a series configuration of filters.
          (3) Challenge testing must be conducted using Cryptosporidium or a surrogate that is
removed no more efficiently than Cryptosporidium. The microorganism or surrogate used during
challenge testing is referred to as the challenge particulate. The concentration of the challenge
particulate must be determined using a method capable of discreetly quantifying the specific
microorganism or surrogate used in the test; gross measurements such as turbidity may not be
used.
          (4) The maximum feed water concentration that can be used during a challenge test must
be based on the detection limit of the challenge particulate in the filtrate ( i.e. , filtrate detection
limit) and must be calculated using the following equation:

                  Maximum Feed Concentration = 1 × 10 4 × (Filtrate Detection Limit)

         (5) Challenge testing must be conducted at the maximum design flow rate for the filter as
specified by the manufacturer.
         (6) Each filter evaluated must be tested for a duration sufficient to reach 100 percent of
the terminal pressure drop, which establishes the maximum pressure drop under which the filter
may be used to comply with the requirements of this subpart.
         (7) Removal efficiency of a filter must be determined from the results of the challenge
test and expressed in terms of log removal values using the following equation:

                                         LRV = LOG10 (Cf )−LOG10 (Cp )
    Where:

    LRV = log removal value demonstrated during challenge testing; Cf = the feed concentration measured during the
    challenge test; and Cp = the filtrate concentration measured during the challenge test. In applying this equation,
    the same units must be used for the feed and filtrate concentrations. If the challenge particulate is not detected in
    the filtrate, then the term Cp must be set equal to the detection limit.



                                                                                                                            325

and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in
this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

         (8) Each filter tested must be challenged with the challenge particulate during three
periods over the filtration cycle: within two hours of start-up of a new filter; when the pressure
drop is between 45 and 55 percent of the terminal pressure drop; and at the end of the cycle after
the pressure drop has reached 100 percent of the terminal pressure drop. An LRV must be
calculated for each of these challenge periods for each filter tested. The LRV for the filter
(LRVfilter ) must be assigned the value of the minimum LRV observed during the three
challenge periods for that filter.
         (9) If fewer than 20 filters are tested, the overall removal efficiency for the filter product
line must be set equal to the lowest LRVfilter among the filters tested. If 20 or more filters are
tested, the overall removal efficiency for the filter product line must be set equal to the 10th
percentile of the set of LRVfilter values for the various filters tested. The percentile is defined by
(i/(n+1)) where i is the rank of n individual data points ordered lowest to highest. If necessary, the
10th percentile may be calculated using linear interpolation.
         (10) If a previously tested filter is modified in a manner that could change the removal
efficiency of the filter product line, challenge testing to demonstrate the removal efficiency of the
modified filter must be conducted and submitted to the State.

     (b) Membrane filtration.
          (1) Systems receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit for membrane filtration that meets
the criteria of this paragraph. Membrane cartridge filters that meet the definition of membrane
filtration in section 64651.54 are eligible for this credit. The level of treatment credit a system
receives is equal to the lower of the values determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this
section.
              (i) The removal efficiency demonstrated during challenge testing conducted under
the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (ii) The maximum removal efficiency that can be verified through direct integrity
testing used with the membrane filtration process under the conditions in paragraph (b)(3) of this
section.
          (2) Challenge testing. The membrane used by the system must undergo challenge testing
to evaluate removal efficiency, and the system must report the results of challenge testing to the
State. Challenge testing must be conducted according to the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)
through (vii) of this section. Systems may use data from challenge testing conducted prior to
January 5, 2006 if the prior testing was consistent with the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through
(vii) of this section.
              (i) Challenge testing must be conducted on either a full-scale membrane module,
identical in material and construction to the membrane modules used in the system's treatment
facility, or a smaller-scale membrane module, identical in material and similar in construction to
the full-scale module. A module is defined as the smallest component of a membrane unit in
which a specific membrane surface area is housed in a device with a filtrate outlet structure.
              (ii) Challenge testing must be conducted using Cryptosporidium oocysts or a
surrogate that is removed no more efficiently than Cryptosporidium oocysts. The organism or
surrogate used during challenge testing is referred to as the challenge particulate. The
concentration of the challenge particulate, in both the feed and filtrate water, must be determined
using a method capable of discretely quantifying the specific challenge particulate used in the
test; gross measurements such as turbidity may not be used.


                                                                                                            326

and cannot be relied upon by the regulated community as the State of California’s representation of the
law. The published codes are the only official representation of the law. Refer to the published codes—in
this case, 17 CCR and 22 CCR—whenever specific citations are required. Statutes related to the State
Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

             (iii) The maximum feed water concentration that can be used during a challenge test
is based on the detection limit of the challenge particulate in the filtrate and must be determined
according to the following equation:

                Maximum Feed Concentration = 3.16 × 106 × (Filtrate Detection Limit)

              (iv) Challenge testing must be conducted under representative hydraulic conditions at
the maximum design flux and maximum design process recovery specified by the manufacturer
for the membrane module. Flux is defined as the throughput of a pressure driven membrane
process expressed as flow per unit of membrane area. Recovery is defined as the volumetric
percent of feed water that is converted to filtrate over the course of an operating cycle
uninterrupted by events such as chemical cleaning or a solids removal process ( i.e. ,
backwashing).
              (v) Removal efficiency of a membrane module must be calculated from the challenge
test results and expressed as a log removal value according to the following equation:

                                         LRV = LOG10 (Cf ) − LOG10 (Cp )

    Where:

    LRV = log removal value demonstrated during the challenge test; Cf = the feed concentration measured during the
    challenge test; and Cp = the filtrate concentration measured during the challenge test. Equivalent units must be
    used for the feed and filtrate concentrations. If the challenge particulate is not detected in the filtrate, the term Cp
    is set equal to the detection limit for the purpose of calculating the LRV. An LRV must be calculated for each
    membrane module evaluated during the challenge test.

              (vi) The removal efficiency of a membrane filtration process demonstrated during
challenge testing must be expressed as a log removal value (LRVC-Test ). If fewer than 20
modules are tested, then LRVC-Test is equal to the lowest of the representative LRVs among the
modules tested. If 20 or more modules are tested, then LRVC-Test is equal to the 10th percentile
of the representative LRVs among the modules tested. The percentile is defined by (i/(n+1))
where i is the rank of n individual data points ordered lowest to highest. If necessary, the 10th
percentile may be calculated using linear interpolation.
              (vii) The challenge test must establish a quality control release value (QCRV) for a
non-destructive performance test that demonstrates the Cryptosporidium removal capability of the
membrane filtration module. This performance test must be applied to each production membrane
module used by the system that was not directly challenge tested in order to verify
Cryptosporidium removal capability. Production modules that do not meet the established QCRV
are not eligible for the treatment credit demonstrated during the challenge test.
              (viii) If a previously tested membrane is modified in a manner that could change the
removal efficiency of the membrane or the applicability of the non-destructive performance test
and associated QCRV, additional challenge testing to demonstrate the removal efficiency of, and
determine a new QCRV for, the modified membrane must be conducted and submitted to the
State.
         (3) Direct integrity testing. Systems must conduct direct integrity testing in a manner that
demonstrates a removal efficiency equal to or greater than the removal credit awarded to the
membrane filtration process and meets the requirements described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through
(vi) of this section. A direct integrity test is defined as a physical test applied to a membrane unit
                                                                                                                               327

in order to identify and isolate integrity breaches ( i.e. , one or more leaks that could result in
contamination of the filtrate).
              (i) The direct integrity test must be independently applied to each membrane unit in
service. A membrane unit is defined as a group of membrane modules that share common valving
that allows the unit to be isolated from the rest of the system for the purpose of integrity testing or
other maintenance.
              (ii) The direct integrity method must have a resolution of 3 micrometers or less,
where resolution is defined as the size of the smallest integrity breach that contributes to a
response from the direct integrity test.
              (iii) The direct integrity test must have a sensitivity sufficient to verify the log
treatment credit awarded to the membrane filtration process by the State, where sensitivity is
defined as the maximum log removal value that can be reliably verified by a direct integrity test.
Sensitivity must be determined using the approach in either paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this
section as applicable to the type of direct integrity test the system uses.
                    (A) For direct integrity tests that use an applied pressure or vacuum, the direct
integrity test sensitivity must be calculated according to the following equation:

                                      LRVDIT = LOG10 (Qp /(VCF × Qbreach ))

    Where:

    LRVDIT = the sensitivity of the direct integrity test; Qp = total design filtrate flow from the membrane unit;
    Qbreach = flow of water from an integrity breach associated with the smallest integrity test response that can be
    reliably measured, and VCF = volumetric concentration factor. The volumetric concentration factor is the ratio of
    the suspended solids concentration on the high pressure side of the membrane relative to that in the feed water.

                  (B) For direct integrity tests that use a particulate or molecular marker, the direct
integrity test sensitivity must be calculated according to the following equation:

                                        LRVDIT = LOG10 (Cf )−LOG10 (Cp )

    Where:

    LRVDIT = the sensitivity of the direct integrity test; Cf = the typical feed concentration of the marker used in the
    test; and Cp = the filtrate concentration of the marker from an integral membrane unit.

              (iv) Systems must establish a control limit within the sensitivity limits of the direct
integrity test that is indicative of an integral membrane unit capable of meeting the removal credit
awarded by the State.
              (v) If the result of a direct integrity test exceeds the control limit established under
paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the system must remove the membrane unit from service.
Systems must conduct a direct integrity test to verify any repairs, and may return the membrane
unit to service only if the direct integrity test is within the established control limit.
              (vi) Systems must conduct direct integrity testing on each membrane unit at a
frequency of not less than once each day that the membrane unit is in operation. The State may
approve less frequent testing, based on demonstrated process reliability, the use of multiple
barriers effective for Cryptosporidium , or reliable process safeguards.
         (4) Indirect integrity monitoring. Systems must conduct continuous indirect integrity
monitoring on each membrane unit according to the criteria in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (v) of
                                                                                                                           328

this section. Indirect integrity monitoring is defined as monitoring some aspect of filtrate water
quality that is indicative of the removal of particulate matter. A system that implements
continuous direct integrity testing of membrane units in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs
(b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section is not subject to the requirements for continuous indirect
integrity monitoring. Systems must submit a monthly report to the State summarizing all
continuous indirect integrity monitoring results triggering direct integrity testing and the
corrective action that was taken in each case.
              (i) Unless the State approves an alternative parameter, continuous indirect integrity
monitoring must include continuous filtrate turbidity monitoring.
              (ii) Continuous monitoring must be conducted at a frequency of no less than once
every 15 minutes.
              (iii) Continuous monitoring must be separately conducted on each membrane unit.
              (iv) If indirect integrity monitoring includes turbidity and if the filtrate turbidity
readings are above 0.15 NTU for a period greater than 15 minutes ( i.e. , two consecutive 15-
minute readings above 0.15 NTU), direct integrity testing must immediately be performed on the
associated membrane unit as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
              (v) If indirect integrity monitoring includes a State-approved alternative parameter
and if the alternative parameter exceeds a State-approved control limit for a period greater than
15 minutes, direct integrity testing must immediately be performed on the associated membrane
units as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.

     (c) Second stage filtration. Systems receive 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit for a
separate second stage of filtration that consists of sand, dual media, GAC, or other fine grain
media following granular media filtration if the State approves. To be eligible for this credit, the
first stage of filtration must be preceded by a coagulation step and both filtration stages must treat
the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source. A cap, such as GAC, on a
single stage of filtration is not eligible for this credit. The State must approve the treatment credit
based on an assessment of the design characteristics of the filtration process.

     (d) Slow sand filtration (as secondary filter). Systems are eligible to receive 2.5-log
Cryptosporidium treatment credit for a slow sand filtration process that follows a separate stage
of filtration if both filtration stages treat entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI
source and no disinfectant residual is present in the influent water to the slow sand filtration
process. The State must approve the treatment credit based on an assessment of the design
characteristics of the filtration process. This paragraph does not apply to treatment credit awarded
to slow sand filtration used as a primary filtration process.

§ 141.720. Inactivation toolbox components.
    (a) Calculation of CT values.
        (1) CT is the product of the disinfectant contact time (T, in minutes) and disinfectant
concentration (C, in milligrams per liter). Systems with treatment credit for chlorine dioxide or
ozone under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must calculate CT at least once each day, with
both C and T measured during peak hourly flow as specified in §§ 141.74(a) through (b).
        (2) Systems with several disinfection segments in sequence may calculate CT for each
segment, where a disinfection segment is defined as a treatment unit process with a measurable
disinfectant residual level and a liquid volume. Under this approach, systems must add the
Cryptosporidium CT values in each segment to determine the total CT for the treatment plant.
                                                                                                            329

dose required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section ( i.e. , validated operating conditions). These
operating conditions must include flow rate, UV intensity as measured by a UV sensor, and UV
lamp status.
             (i) When determining validated operating conditions, systems must account for the
following factors: UV absorbance of the water; lamp fouling and aging; measurement uncertainty
of on-line sensors; UV dose distributions arising from the velocity profiles through the reactor;
failure of UV lamps or other critical system components; and inlet and outlet piping or channel
configurations of the UV reactor.
             (ii) Validation testing must include the following: Full scale testing of a reactor that
conforms uniformly to the UV reactors used by the system and inactivation of a test
microorganism whose dose response characteristics have been quantified with a low pressure
mercury vapor lamp.                                                                                         331

Board’s drinking water-related activities are in the Health & Safety Code, the Water Code, and other
codes.

             (iii) The State may approve an alternative approach to validation testing.
         (3) Reactor monitoring.
             (i) Systems must monitor their UV reactors to determine if the reactors are operating
within validated conditions, as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This monitoring
must include UV intensity as measured by a UV sensor, flow rate, lamp status, and other
parameters the State designates based on UV reactor operation. Systems must verify the
calibration of UV sensors and must recalibrate sensors in accordance with a protocol the State
approves.
             (ii) To receive treatment credit for UV light, systems must treat at least 95 percent of
the water delivered to the public during each month by UV reactors operating within validated
conditions for the required UV dose, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
Systems must demonstrate compliance with this condition by the monitoring required under
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

§ 141.721. Reporting requirements.
    (a) Systems must report sampling schedules under § 141.702 and source water monitoring
results under § 141.706 unless they notify the State that they will not conduct source water
monitoring due to meeting the criteria of § 141.701(d).

    (b) Systems must report the use of uncovered finished water storage facilities to the State as
described in § 141.714.

    (c) Filtered systems must report their Cryptosporidium bin classification as described in §
141.710.

    (d) Unfiltered systems must report their mean source water Cryptosporidium level as
described in § 141.712.

    (e) Systems must report disinfection profiles and benchmarks to the State as described in §§
141.708 through 141.709 prior to making a significant change in disinfection practice.

    (f) Systems must report to the State in accordance with the following table for any microbial
toolbox options used to comply with treatment requirements under § 141.711 or § 141.712.
Alternatively, the State may approve a system to certify operation within required parameters for
treatment credit rather than reporting monthly operational data for toolbox options.
