PREFACE

Background
In the process of revision of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, the need for a
fundamental change in the guidelines for microbial safety has been identified. The former
Guidelines were focussed on end-product monitoring for E. coli. This system is reactive; the
warning signal is received at the time that the consumer’s health is already at risk. Outbreaks
of disease through drinking water that meets this Guideline have been reported. This also
indicates that meeting the Guideline is not always a safeguard against transmission of illness
through that same drinking water. Developments in microbial risk assessment and in a risk
management framework in the food industry have indicated that a preventive, risk based
approach can provide the necessary expansion of the current approach to protect the
consumer against health effects from drinking water.

In subsequent meetings in Medmenham (1994), Stockholm (1999), Berlin (2000) and
Adelaide (2001), the microbiology working group of the revision of the WHO guidelines has
been progressing towards the complementation of the current microbiological guidelines
with the requirement for a Water Safety Plan. Such a plan is a systematic inventory of the
hazards, an evaluation of the significance of these hazards and of the efficacy of control
measures taken. This changes the focus of attention to verification that the safeguards in the
water supply chain (catchment and source protection, treatment processes, distribution
system integrity) are in place and effective.

In this new approach to the new Guidelines, the need for background documents that
illustrate the approach and discuss the available scientific information was identified. This
document on Cryptosporidium is the first in a series of microbiological Environmental
Health Criteria (EHC) that will serve as background documents.

Cryptosporidium is selected as the target for this risk assessment. Its ubiquitous occurrence
in the environment, its persistence, and resistance to chemical disinfection has made this
protozoan parasite to one of the critical pathogens for the drinking water industry. Numerous
drinking water outbreaks have been reported since its first recognition as a waterborne agent
in 1984. Most of these were attributed to insufficiencies or failures in water treatment and
distribution, but more importantly many occurred in systems that were regarded as safe and
complied with the microbiological standards. As a consequence, research has focussed on




                                              v
this pathogen over the last decades and has provided a wealth of information, on sources,
occurrence and behaviour of Cryptosporidium in water, on removal and inactivation by
water treatment processes and on its pathogenicity. Risk assessment requires this type of
knowledge.

This document follows the basic steps of the microbial risk assessment framework: Hazard
Identification, Problem Definition, Exposure assessment, Effect assessment and risk
characterisation. The chapters follow the subsequent steps and show both the information
that is needed to complete the step and the information that is available about
Cryptosporidium. The document aims to illustrate what it means to implement the risk
assessment framework in the drinking water supply, both in terms of the information that is
required and in terms of the information that it provides to aid risk management. It discusses
the information on Cryptosporidium that is available to incorporate in this process and also
highlights the information that is still lacking


Target audience and purpose
The target audience of this document are persons responsible for:
• setting standards for drinking-water,
• evaluating adequacy of drinking-water quality or water treatment, and /or
• system design, implementation, and supervision in controlling infectious disease.

They can use this document as guidance for a quantitative assessment of the health risk of
Cryptosporidium through a drinking water supply. For systems that have no specific data on
Cryptosporidium, we have deduced default source water concentrations for different types
of source waters. Similarly, we have deduced default log-credits for surface water treatment
processes. We have included several worked-out case studies to illustrate the approach, the
information that is needed and the result it provides and how this can be used in risk
management. In these case studies, we have tried to show the spectrum from systems where
very little specific information about Cryptosporidium is available to systems that have site-
specific information about Cryptosporidium in their source water and removal by water
treatment. We feel that this illustrates the power and versatility of the new risk assessment
approach. The approach can be effectively applied in all cases, from a simple screening
study to sophisticated collection and statistical evaluation of comprehensive data-sets
covering all steps of the risk assessment.

Cryptosporidium as reference pathogen




1.1     FRAMEWORK FOR SAFE DRINKING-WATER

In the 3rd edition of the Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, the World Health
Organisation [WHO, 2004] has introduced the preventive management Framework for Safe
Drinking-water that comprise five key components (Figure 1):
• Health based targets based on critical evaluation of health concerns;
• System assessment to determine whether the water supply chain (from source through
    treatment to the point of consumption) as a whole can deliver water of a quality that
    meets the above targets;
• Operational monitoring of the control measures in the supply chain which are of
    particular importance in securing drinking-water safety;
• Management plans documenting the system assessment and monitoring; and describing
    actions to be taken in normal operation and incident conditions; including upgrade and
    improvement documentation and communication;
• A system of independent surveillance that verifies that the above are operating properly.
Components 2, 3 and 4 encompass the Water Safety Plan (WSP) that is a new component of
the Guidelines. For more information the reader is referred to the Guidelines.

1.2       SYSTEM ASSESSMENT
Assessment of the ability of the drinking-water system to meet the health-based targets is one
of the components of a Water Safety Plan (WSP, Figure 1). System assessment is equally
applicable to large utilities with piped distribution systems, and piped and non-piped
community supplies, including hand pumps, and individual domestic supplies. Assessment
can be of existing infrastructure or of plans for new or upgrading supplies. As drinking-water
quality varies throughout the system, the assessment should aim to determine whether the
final quality of water delivered to the consumer is able to routinely meet established health-
based targets. Understanding source quality and changes through the system requires expert
input. The assessment of systems should be reviewed periodically.

This background document aims to give guidance on a System assessment for
Cryptosporidium, one of the microbial hazards for drinking water safety. Cryptosporidium is
considered as reference pathogen for the enteric protozoan pathogens (see 1.3). In this
document, Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment is used as tool to quantify the risks
associated with Cryptosporidium in water supply. It describes the information that water
suppliers need to collect to be able to assess the safety of their water supply system from the
catchment to the consumer and how this information can be transformed into a quantitative
assessment of the safety for the drinking water consumer. By compiling the current state of




                                                     2
the scientific literature on Cryptosporidium, this document also serves to validate the System
Assessments made by water suppliers. Validation is an element of a System Assessment that
is undertaken to ensure that the information supporting the WSP is based on state-of-the art
scientific knowledge. This document provides guidance based on (and refers to) the
scientific literature on Cryptosporidium and QMRA. Water suppliers can refer to this
document as state-of-the-science and reference for the QMRA methodology for their System
Assessment.
When the QMRA shows that the system is theoretically capable of meeting the health-based
targets, the WSP is the management tool that will assist in meeting the targets at all times. If
the system is unlikely to be capable of meeting the health-based targets, a programme of
upgrading (which may include capital investment and/or training) should be initiated to
ensure that the supply will meet the targets in due course. In the interim period, every effort
should be made to supply water of the highest achievable quality. Where a significant risk to
public health exists additional measures may be appropriate.


1.3      REFERENCE PATHOGENS

In the WHO GDWQ the concept of reference pathogens is introduced: “It is neither possible
nor necessary to consider all pathogens in order to design and operate safe drinking-water
supplies. Waterborne pathogens vary in size, in their ability to survive in the environment,
through different water treatment processes and in the distribution system; they also vary in
their infectivity and in the severity of the diseases they cause. In identifying specific
pathogens that by their characteristics can represent a group of similar pathogens, it is
possible to limit the necessary information and considerations. Such pathogens can provide
a reference for developing design and implementation guidelines to meet water quality goals
for an entire group of pathogens. In order to protect public health such pathogens should be
those within the group that are most difficult to remove or control and that have the largest
associated health burden, both on a population and on individual basis. Ideally, there should
also be ample high quality data on each aspect of relevance to assessing and managing
risks.” This implies that, when a water supply system meets the water quality targets for the
reference pathogen, it also meets the water quality targets for the group of pathogens that it is
considered reference pathogen for.


1.4      WATERBORNE PROTOZOAN PATHOGENS
In the group of parasitic protozoa, several species may be transmitted to humans through the
drinking water route. These are: Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium (primarily C.
hominis and C. parvum cattle genotype), Giardia intestinalis, Toxoplasma gondii,
Balantidium coli, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Microsporidia, Isospora belli, Naegleria fowleri
and Acanthamoeba sp. For the selection of a reference pathogen for this group, waterborne
outbreaks are an important source of information. Outbreaks indicate which pathogens have




                                               3
been able to break through the multiple barriers and cause disease. Other criteria for the
selection are the prevalence and severity of the illness they cause, and the difficulty to
control them in water treatment. A practical criterion for the selection of the reference
pathogen is the availability of data on waterborne transmission and on the efficacy of control
measures. Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the waterborne protozoan parasites. This
table aims to give an indication, rather than a quantitative analysis of the different parasites.
For more information about the other parasites, the reader is referred to the review books on
waterborne disease from Hunter [1997] and Percival et al. [2004]. Most of the parasites in
table 1 are transmitted through the faecal-oral route, except for the free-living aquatic
amoeba Naegleria, Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia. Naegleria fowleri has occasionally
caused PAM in swimmers in recreational surface waters [Cerva & Novak, 1968; Duma et
al., 1971; Lares-Villa et al., 1993] or a warm spa [Cain et al., 1981]. In Western Australia,
cases have been associated to drinking water from overland mains that were heated by the
sun [Robinson et al., 1996]. Balamuthia mandrillaris may cause granulomatous amoebic
encephalitis (GAE) [Schuster et al., 2003] and the environment (soil) is suggested as the
source of infection. No water-related cases are reported.
Acanthamoeba may also cause GAE primarily or exclusively in immunodepressed patients
[Martinez & Visvesvara, 1997] and has occasionally caused keratitis in contact lens wearers
[Kilvington & White, 1994]. Risk factors are home made saline solution to rinse contact
lenses [Visvesvara, 1991] and the initial source of the amoeba was thought to be the drinking
water distribution network where these amoeba can live if there is sufficient biofilm on pipe-
walls.
From the faecal-orally transmitted parasites, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium
hominis and C. parvum, Giardia intestinalis and Toxoplasma gondii are the most commonly
associated with human illness, with prevalences of 2-50% [Hunter, 1997; Percival et al.,
2004]. Balantidium coli is also found regularly, esp. in (sub)tropical regions with pig-
farming (pigs are the principal animal reservoir), such as the Philippines (prevalence around
1%) [Barnish & Ashford, 1989]. Blastocystis hominis is frequently found in both
asymptomatic persons and persons with symptoms of an intestinal infection. The
epidemiology of this fecal-oral protozoan is not well understood, but no water-related cases
are reported.
Most data on Cyclospora cayetanensis come from Nepal, Peru, Haiti and Guatemala where
Cyclospora is endemic [Soave, 1996]. The prevalence is 2-6% in these countries. In
industrialised countries, the incidence is generally lower. Microsporidia and Isospora belli
are found occasionally, primarily or exclusively in immunocompromised (HIV) patients
[Cali, 1999; Garcia, 1999].
Waterborne transmission is most frequently reported for Cryptosporidium, Giardia and
Entamoeba [Kramer et al, 1996; Barwick et al., 2000 Hunter, 1997]. Compared to Giardia,
Entamoeba, Toxoplasma, Balantidium and Cyclospora, Cryptosporidium is the most
persistent in the environment, most resistant to chemical disinfection, and smallest in size, so
the most difficult to remove by filtration. The high profile this parasite has received in water
supply research means that many data are available about this transmission route.
Cryptosporidium is therefore the pathogen of choice as reference for protozoan parasites




                                               4
that use the faecal-oral route in piped water supplies, both community systems and small
(chlorinated) supplies. It is not considered a reference pathogen for:
• the free-living aquatic protozoa, because of their different ecology;
• non-piped, non-chlorinated supplies, because there are no control challenges that are
    specific for Cryptosporidium in these systems and other enteric pathogens are likely to
    have a higher health burden in these systems;
• all faecal-oral pathogens (esp. viruses, bacteria) that have been shown to cause disease
    outbreaks through drinking water. Given the differences in health burden, infectivity,
    nature, size, surface characteristics, resistance to disinfectants, sources, etc..,
    Cryptosporidium cannot be regarded as a reference for all these faecal-oral pathogens, so
    additional reference pathogens are needed to guide risk management to design safe water
    supply systems.

2.1      CRYPTOSPORIDIUM

2.1.1 Description

Cryptosporidium is a small protozoan parasite that infects the microvillous region of
epithelial cells in the digestive and respiratory tract of vertebrates. It is an obligate
intracellular parasite of man and other mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It requires its host
to multiply. Environmentally robust oocysts are shed by infected hosts into the environment.
These oocysts can survive the adverse conditions on the environment for months until
ingested by a new suitable host. In the new host, the life cycle starts again and multiplication
occurs, using resources of the host. The parasite has been first described in mice in 1907
[Tyzzer, 1907], but was not recognised as a causative agent for human illness until 1976
[Nime et al., 1976; Meisel et al., 1976]. It was first associated with disease in severely
immunocompromised individuals, esp. AIDS patients with low CD4-counts, but is now also
recognised as widespread, general pathogen of immunocompetent humans.




                                               6
2.1.2    Taxonomic position
Cryptosporidium is part of the Apicomplexa, Cryptosporidiidae and has been classified as
member of the group of eimeriid coccidia, a diverse group of parasitic protozoa. Recent
taxonomic studies place Cryptosporidium as a clade separate from the coccidia. A study on
the 18S rRNA gene indicated a closer relation to the gregarines [Carreno et al., 1999]. This
would also explain why Cryptosporidium has several features that separate it from the other
coccidia: infection of the host is confined to the apical region of the epithelial cells, the small
size of the oocysts, the formation of both thick- and thin-walled oocysts and the insensitivity
to anti-coccidial agents. Further understanding of the relation to the gregarines is very
important for understanding its ecology and waterborne transmission [Ryan & Xiao, 2003].
The gregarines are parasites to freshwater invertebrates and cross-reaction of
Cryptosporidium antibodies to gregarines can occur [Bull et al., 1998]. Even multiplication
of Cryptosporidium in freshwater hosts could occur and development of extracellular life-
cycle stages in water has been suggested [Boxell et al., 2004].

Until the mid-1990’s, several species of Cryptosporidium had been described. The species
description was based primarily on morphology and host specificity. C. parvum, C. muris, C.
felis and C. wrairi were identified as species that infect mammals, C. baileyi and C.
meleagridis infect birds, C. serpentis and C. saurophilum infect reptiles and C. nasorum
tropical fish. C. parvum was the primary species isolated from infected humans. C. parvum
was isolated from 152 species of mammals [Casemore et al, 1997; Fayer et al., 2000] and
cross-transmission studies indicated that C. parvum isolates can be transmitted from humans
to animals and between different animals. Human cases of cryptosporidiosis were associated
with animal contact to humans. This gave the impression that the host-range of C. parvum
was very broad, and hence many animals served as reservoir for Cryptosporidium that could
infect man.
Molecular taxonomy, based on several markers (such as the 18S rRNA gene, the
Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and TRAP-2 gene), have now shown
that the taxonomy is more complex. Morgan et al. [1999] have reviewed the taxonomic
information and have seen considerable genetic heterogeneity between isolates of
Cryptosporidium from different vertebrate species. They have proposed a revised taxonomy,
suggesting that host specific genotypes occur within the species of C. parvum: a human
genotype (H-type or type 1), a cattle genotype (C-type or type 2), a ferret genotype, a pig and
marsupial genotype, a dog genotype and two genotypes that were classified as distinct
species: C. wrairi and C. felis. The H-type was recently renamed as a new species C. hominis
[Morgan-Ryan et al., 2002], which appears to be specific to humans although there are
reports of C. hominis infection in gnotobiotic piglets [Widmer et al., 2000] and in the dugong
[Morgan et al., 2000]. The dog genotype was renamed C. canis [Fayer et al., 2001] and also
the pig genotype(s) is proposed as separate (pig-specific) species Cryptosporidium suis
[Ryan et al., 2003]. Other genotypes of Cryptosporidium have been identified in wildlife




                                                7
[Fayer et al., 2000], [Perz & LeBlanq, 2001; Morgan et al., 1998], but these have not been
found in humans [Xiao et al., 2004].

Currently, 13 of the parasite species are regarded as valid [Table 2, Ryan et al., 2003].
Several other Cryptosporidium genotypes have been described from mammals, birds and
reptiles which need further characterisation to determine the species status.

Infection in immunocompetent human hosts is predominantly caused by C. hominis and the
cattle genotype of C. parvum. [McLauchlin et al., 2000]. Other Cryptosporidium species
have been reported to infect humans, but less frequently (C. meleagridis, C. felis and C.
canis) or very occasionally (C. muris, C. andersoni and the pig genotype of
Cryptosporidium) [Pieniazak et al., 1999; Morgan et al., 1999b; 2000; Pedraza-Días et al.,
2000; Xiao et al 2001; Yagita et al., 2001; Gatei et al., 2002; Tangtip & Jongwutiwes, 2002;
Xiao, 2004].
Interestingly, studies from Australia and North America indicate that C. hominis is most
prevalent in humans [Morgan et al., 1998; Xiao et al., 2002; Ong et al., 2002], while studies
in Europe indicate that the cattle genotype of C. parvum is most prevalent in humans [
McLauchlin et al., 2000; Lowery et al., 2001; Fretz et al., 2001]. The reasons for this
discrepancy are not clear. A recent UK-survey of 5001 faecal specimens of confirmed human
Cryptosporidium infections in the UK, C. hominis was identified in 50% of the specimens,
C. parvum cattle genotype in 45%, 4% could not be identified and C. meleagridis was found
in 0.6%. C. felis and C. canis were found in 3 and 1 specimens respectively [Chalmers et al.,
2003].
The taxonomy of Cryptosporidium is still under development. Understanding the taxonomic
position and the differentiation of the species and subtypes is not only relevant to




                                                8
evolutionary biology, but also to understanding the sources and environmental transmission
of human cryptosporidiosis.

2.1.3    Life cycle
Infected hosts shed oocysts, the environmentally resistant transmission stage of the parasite,
with their faeces [Fayer & Ungar, 1986; Fayer et al., 1997]. These oocysts are immediately
infectious and may remain in the environment for very long periods without losing their
infectivity, due to a very robust oocyst wall that protects the four sporozoites against
physical and chemical damage. When the oocyst is ingested by a new host, the suture in the
oocyst wall opens (excystation), triggered by the body temperature and the interaction with
stomach acid and bile salts. Four motile sporozoites are released into the small intestine of
the host and they infect the epithelial cells of the small intestine, mainly in the jejunum and
ileum. The parasite infects the apex of the epithelial cells and resides beneath the cell
membrane of the epithelial cells but outside of the cytoplasm. The sporozoites transform into
several life stages in an asexual (merogony) and a sexual reproduction cycle (gametogony).
The oocysts are the result of the sexual reproduction cycle. Oocysts of C. hominis/C. parvum
are spherical with a diameter of 4-6 µm. Thick- and thin-walled oocysts are formed. The
thin-walled oocysts may excyst within the same host and start a new life cycle
(autoinfection). This may lead to a heavily infected epithelium of the small intestine,
resulting in malabsorptive or secretory diarrhoea. The thick-walled oocyst is excreted with
the faeces and is environmentally robust.


2.1.4    The disease
A description of the health effects in immunocompetent and immunocompromised
individuals is given in chapter 5.2.


2.1.5    Prevalence
In stool surveys of patients with gastro-enteritis, the reported prevalence of Cryptosporidium
is 1-4% in Europe and North America and 3-20% in Africa, Asia, Australia, South and
Central America [Current & Garcia, 1991]. Peaks in the prevalence in developed countries
are observed in the late summer [van Asperen et al., 1996] and in spring [Casemore, 1990].
In industrialised countries, the prevalence is high in children under 5 years of age and in
young adults. In developing countries, infection is common in infants less than 1 year, but is
rarely seen in adults.
Asymptomatic carriage, as determined by stool surveys, generally occurs at very low rates in
industrialised countries (<1%) [Current & Garcia, 1991], although in day care centres higher
rates have been reported [Lacroix et al., 1987; Crawford & Vermund, 1988; Garcia-
Rodriguez et al., 1989]. Routine bile endoscopy suggests a higher asymptomatic prevalence:




                                              9
13% of non-diarrhoeic patients were shown to carry Cryptosporidium oocysts [Roberts et al.,
1989]. High rates of asymptomatic carriage (10-30%) are common in non-industrialised
countries [Current & Garcia, 1991]. Seroprevalence rates are generally higher than faecal
carriage rates, from 25-35% in industrialised countries up to 68-88% in Russia [Egorov et
al., 2004] and 95% in South America [Casemore et al, 1997]. Seroprevalence rates increase
with increasing age [Zu et al., 1992; Kuhls et al., 1994; Egorov et al., 2004] and are
relatively high in dairy farmers [Lengerich et al., 1993] and day care centre attendants
[Kuhls et al., 1994]. Two city studies in the USA showed that people that consumed treated
surface water were more likely to show seroconversion during the study period than the
people that consumed well-protected groundwater [Frost et al., 2001; 2002; 2003]. During
the months of the study, a significant proportion of the population exhibited seroconversion
(also in the groundwater cities), indicating that Cryptosporidium infections may be relatively
common. Illness rates were not increased in the cities supplied with surface water, so,
although infections were more common, illness was not. The more intense serological
response in the residents of the surface water cities could indicate an increased level of
protection from illness. Human feeding trials also indicated a protective effect of a prior
infection to illness after low dose exposure, but not against high dose exposure [Chappell et
al., 2004]. Both in the USA and in Russia, consumption of drinking water from shallow
wells was correlated to a high seroprevalence [Frost et al., 2003; Egorov et al., 2004].


2.1.6    Routes of transmission
The majority of human infections are caused by C. hominis and the cattle genotype of C.
parvum. Other Cryptosporidium species that occasionally infect immunocompetent humans
are C. meleagridis, C. felis and C. canis. Species that have been reported only in
immonocompromised individuals are C. muris/andersoni (evidence on species not
conclusive) and a cervine and pig genotype [Xiao, 2004]. It is likely that other species or
genotypes will be found in (immunocompromised) humans in the future, but these will
probably account for only a (very) small fraction of human infections.

As C. hominis and the cattle genotype of C. parvum account for the vast majority of human
infections, the sources of these species are the predominant reservoirs of human
cryptosporidiosis. Humans are the only significant source of C. hominis and humans and
ruminants are the predominant sources of the cattle genotype of C. parvum [Xiao et al.,
2003]. The cattle genotype of C. parvum has been found in other mammals, but infected
humans, cattle and sheep shed oocysts in very high numbers, especially when infected in
infancy, which probably contribute most to the environmental contamination. Transmission
occurs through direct or indirect contact with faeces of these shedders. Outbreaks illustrate
the different routes: person-to person spread in institutions, animal contact during farm visits,
contact with recreational waters, swimming pool visits, municipal drinking water and food.




                                              10
Human-to-human
Person-to-person transmission is a common route, as illustrated by outbreaks in day-care
centres [Fayer & Ungar, 1986; Casemore, 1990; Cordell & Addiss, 1994] and the spread of
these outbreaks in the households of the attending children. Patient-to-patient or patient-to-
health care staff transmission may occur in hospitals [Casemore et al., 1994]. Also sexual
practices that imply oro-anal contact yield a high risk for exposure to Cryptosporidium.
Case control studies show that major risk factors are household contacts with people (esp.
children) with diarrhoea [Robertson et al., 2002; Hunter, 2003]. Another risk factor that is
generally found in these studies is foreign travel, esp. to countries with a higher prevalence
of cryptosporidiosis.

Animal-to-human
Zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium parvum is well documented. There are various
reports of outbreaks or cases of cryptosporidiosis in school children or students after
exposure to calves or lambs [Casemore, 1990; Casemore et al., 1997]. Occupational
exposure to infected animals (mainly calves) has also resulted in human infection [Current,
1994; Casemore et al., 1997]. The recent genotypic evidence suggests that only the cattle
genotype of C. parvum is capable of zoonotic transmission [Sulaiman et al., 1998], but this
genotype has been found in many host species (humans, cattle, pigs, sheep). The high
prevalence of the C. parvum in cattle and sheep and the high numbers of oocysts shed by
infected animals (esp. newborns) make cattle and sheep important sources of environmental
contamination with Cryptosporidium oocysts that are able to infect humans.
Indirect evidence indicates that contact with horses and contact with horse manure are risk
factors for cryptosporidiosis [Casemore, 1990]. However, only immonosuppressed horses
have been shown to carry the cattle genotype of C. parvum, while immunocompetent horses
carry a unique horse genotype.

Cryptosporidium meleagridis may infect humans and is found in turkeys worldwide
[McDougald, 1998]. Outbreaks of avian cryptosporidiosis have been reported in turkey
farms, and these may be the main source of environmental contamination with C.
meleagridis.

Also pet animals can be infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts, but these do not appear to be
an important source of human infection [Casemore et al., 1997; Glaser et al., 1998]. The
species found in cats (C. felis) and dogs (C. canis) are occasionally found in
immunocompromised humans [Pedraza-Dias et al., 2001]. Hence, cats and dogs should be
considered as a potential source of infection to humans if they are immunocompromised. The
prevalence of C. felis in cats is 2.4 – 8.2% and the prevalence of C. canis in dogs is 1.5 –
45% [Olson et al., 2004].

The role of wildlife as a source is less clear. Cryptosporidium sp. have been identified in
many species of wildlife, but genotyping studies generally identify the isolates from wildlife




                                             11
as unique genotypes [Olson et al., 2004]. This indicates that wildlife species are host to
specific Cryptosporidium species that are not found in other animals including humans. All
these animals shed oocysts into the environment, contributing to the total Cryptosporidium
load of drinking water sources. Conventional detection techniques do not discriminate well
between the different species and genotypes. Therefore, genotyping of environmental
isolates is important to determine the presence of genotypes that are pathogenic to humans,
especially in more pristine environments.
Waterfowl and insects have been suggested as vectors of C. parvum, where the animals pick
up oocysts from contact with human or cattle faeces and may deposit them again in water or
on food [Graczyk et al., 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000; Szostakowska et al., 2004]. The flies may
be important for food borne transmission. The significance of waterfowl in contamination of
watersheds with oocysts that may infect humans is unknown.

Water
Indirect person-to-person or zoonotic transmission may occur by contamination of water
used for recreation or drinking, swimming pools or food. Surface water becomes
contaminated through the discharge of untreated and treated sewage and run-off of manure.
The relative significance of these sources may differ between watersheds. Large rivers and
lakes often receive both agricultural run-off and treated and untreated domestic wastewater.
As a result, Cryptosporidium oocysts of various genotypes are ubiquitous in surface waters
throughout the world. Reported concentrations generally range from 0.01-100 per litre.
These concentration data are not corrected for the (low) recovery of the detection method, so
the actual concentrations may be more than tenfold higher. Higher concentrations are found
in urbanised or agricultural waters than in pristine waters [LeChevallier et al., 1991; Rose et
al., 1991]. 12% of groundwater supplies in the US were contaminated with Cryptosporidium
and/or Giardia [Hancock et al., 1997], mostly in infiltration galleries and horizontal wells
(impacted by surface water contamination).
Although water is probably not the most important route of transmission, many waterborne
outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been described, some of which are very large. The
largest outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis were attributed to contaminated drinking water, both
from surface water and groundwater sources [Craun, 1992; Mackenzie et al., 1994; Hunter,
1997; de Jong & Andersson, 1997; Glaberman et al., 2002; Guyonnet & Claudet, 2002].
Outbreaks have also been associated with exposure to recreational water and swimming
pools [Joce et al., 1991; Sorvillo et al., 2002; MacKenzie et al., 1995; van Asperen et al.,
1996; Anon, 1998; Kramer et al., 1998; Puech et al., 2001; Nichols et al., 2004]. In several
case control studies swimming in recreational water and/or a swimming pool was identified
as risk factor for cryptosporidiosis [Puech et al., 2001]. Drinking water from community
supplies was not identified as risk factor [Sorvillo et al., 1994; Khalakdina et al., 2003;
Robertson et al., 2004]. Sea water may contain Cryptosporidium [Johnson et al., 1995; Fayer
et al., 1998], but has not been implicated in outbreaks.
In several waterborne outbreaks the Cryptosporidium isolates have been genotyped and both
C. hominis and the cattle genotype of C. parvum have been implicated as causative agents. In




                                             12
most outbreaks, only one genotype was identified, but in some outbreaks both genotypes
have been found [Xiao et al., 2004; Mathieu et al., 2004].

Food
Outbreaks have occurred through consumption of contaminated food (raw milk and meat,
farm-made apple cider, fermented milk, salads, raw vegetables)[Casemore et al., 1997].
Food can be contaminated by infected food handlers [Quinn et al., 1998; Quiroz et al.,
2000], irrigation with contaminated water or manure. Cryptosporidium has been found in
shellfish, such as oysters [Fayer et al., 1998; 2003; Schets et al., 2002], and on raw
vegetables suggesting these could be routes of transmission as well. Interestingly, eating raw
vegetables was a protective factor against cryptosporidiosis in a case-control study in the UK
[Hunter, 2003]. This could be related to repeated exposure through this route and build-up of
protective immunity, but this is not proven.


2.2 CHARACTERISTICS RELATING TO WATERBORNE
TRANSMISSION
Several characteristics of Cryptosporidium facilitate waterborne transmission. These are
outlined below.


2.2.1    Extreme resistance to chemical disinfection
Disinfection with chlorine has always been an important barrier for waterborne pathogens.
The high resistance of Cryptosporidium oocysts against chlorine disinfection [Korich et al.,
1990; Smith et al., 1990; Ransome et al., 1993] renders this process ineffective for oocyst
inactivation in drinking water treatment. Chlorine dioxide is slightly more effective, but still
requires a high CT product (measure of disinfectant dose: (residual) concentration of
disinfectant C x contact time T) of 75 - 1000 mg.min l-1 for 99% inactivation of oocysts
[Korich et al., 1990; Chauret et al., 2001].
Ozone is the most potent chemical oocysticide: at 20°C, the CT for 99% inactivation of C.
parvum oocysts is 3.5 mg.min.l-1 [Finch et al., 1993]. The effectiveness of ozone reduces at
lower temperatures and the CT values required for inactivation of oocysts at low
temperatures are high. CT values are limited, however, since high CT’s can give rise to
formation of high concentrations of (geno)toxic by-products.
Exposure of Cryptosporidium oocysts to multiple disinfectants in succession has been shown
to be more effective than was to be expected from both disinfectants alone [Finch et al.,
1994; Liyanage et al., 1997] and synergism between disinfection and environmental stress
during sand filtration has also been observed [Parker et al., 1993]. The multiple stresses that
(oo)cysts encounter in the environment and during treatment might limit the infectivity of
(oo)cysts.




                                              13
Although older literature suggests that UV systems have a limited effect on Cryptosporidium
viability, more recent work shows that this was due to the use of in vitro viability assays that
over-estimate infectivity. Clancy et al. [1998], using animal infectivity, showed that
medium-pressure UV is very effective against Cryptosporidium; they obtained 99.98%
inactivation at UV-doses as low as 19 mJ/cm2. Many successive studies have shown that
oocysts are sensitive to low or medium pressure UV [Craik et al., 2001; Shin et al., 2001;
Morita et al., 2002; Clancy et al., 2002; Rochelle et al., 2004].

More detail on disinfection of Cryptosporidium is given in chapter 4.


2.2.2    Persistence in the environment
Oocysts can survive for months in surface water [Robertson et al., 1992; Chauret et al.,
1995; Medema et al., 1997]. Under natural conditions, the die-off rate of Cryptosporidium
oocysts in water is 0.005-0.037 10log-units per day. Oocysts also survive well in estuarine
waters (over 12 weeks at 20C and a salinity of 10), but less in seawater (4 weeks at salinity
of 30 ppm) [Fayer et al.,1998].
In the older studies, survival was monitored with in vitro assays such as excystation or dye
exclusion. The longevity of oocysts in fresh water has been confirmed in studies that use
enumeration by cell culture infectivity; King et al. [2005] showed inactivation rates of 0.095,
0.048, 0.011 and <0.01 10log/day of C. parvum oocysts in freshwater at 25, 20, 15 and 4°C
respectively.
Long survival (120 days) of oocysts in soil has also been reported [Kato et al., 2004].
Oocysts in soil do not survive well when artificially frozen/thawed in the soil [Kato et al.,
2002] or under field conditions in Norwegian soil [Robertson & Gjerde, 2004].



2.2.3    Small size
Compared to other protozoan parasites, the oocysts of Cryptosporidium are small (4-6 µm).
Due to their smaller size, the are less efficiently removed during soil passage, in bank
filtration and in rapid or slow sand filtration in drinking water treatment. However, compared
to bacteria (~1 µm) and esp. viruses (20-60 nm), oocysts of Cryptosporidium are large.

Although the state in which (oo)cysts occur in water (suspended or attached to particles) is
relevant for water treatment (sedimentation, filtration), and oocysts readily attach to particles
in sewage effluent [Medema et al., 1998], little information is available as yet on the
significance of these factors in the environmental ecology of (oo)cysts. Dai & Boll [2003]
reported no attachment of oocysts to loam or sand particles in batch experiments.




                                              14
2.2.4    High infectivity
The infectivity of oocysts is high. Extrapolation of the dose-response data [Chappell et al.,
1999, (extensively discussed in chapter 5)] indicates that ingestion of a single oocyst gives a
discrete probability of infection. The occurrence of waterborne outbreaks with high attack
rates substantiates this. The reviews of Cryptosporidium concentrations in drinking water
during outbreaks [Haas & Rose, 1995; Craun et al., 1998] suggests that consumers ingest
only one to a few oocysts per day. The infectivity of oocysts varies between isolates. A
comprehensive analysis of the dose-response data from volunteer studies with the different
isolates is given in chapter 5.
Other waterborne pathogens exhibit an even higher infectivity than Cryptosporidium; this
includes several viruses (rotavirus, enteroviruses, Norovirus (?)), Giardia and
Campylobacter [Teunis et al., 1996].


2.2.5    Human and livestock sources
As discussed in 2.1.5, the majority of human infections are caused by C. hominis and C.
parvum. C. hominis is transmitted between humans and C. parvum is transmitted between
humans and from other mammals (esp. ruminants) to humans. Cryptosporidium sp. has been
isolated from cattle worldwide, mostly from diarrheic newborn calves. The prevalence in
diarrheic calves is very high. A wide range of prevalences have been reported in calves (5-
100%) [Angus, 1990; Casemore et al., 1997; Olson et al., 2004], but this is probably due to
differences in detection methods applied and the age of the calves sampled. 90 -100% of
herds may be infected [Medema et al., 2001]. Clinical infection occurs primarily in the
newborn calves, which may shed more than 1010 oocysts/day. Prevalence is lower in adult
cattle.
Sheep are also hosts of C. parvum. Lambs of 1 – 2 weeks old are most commonly infected
and in some cases mortality can be high [Angus, 1990]. Reported prevalence in Spain was
highest during spring, where 40% of lambs (90% of farms) shed Cryptosporidium sp.,
compared to 8% in autumn (40% of farms) [Matos-Fernandez et al., 1994]. The same study
reported high prevalence (70%) in goats. Also for goats, prevalence is high in kids of 5-15
days [Angus, 1990]. Olson et al. [2004] reviewed published prevalence data for sheep: 10 –
78%; and goats: 28 – 100%.
Cryptosporidium infection has been described in horses, again mainly in very young animals
[Xiao & Herd, 1994a]. Prevalence rates were 17-31%, but these were probably the horse
genotype that is not found in humans.
The close contact with cattle and sheep make the risk of transmission high. The high density
of cattle and sheep in watersheds and the excretion of high numbers of oocysts make these
animals important sources of environmental contamination, which have been implicated in
several waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis.




                                             15
2.2.6    Oocyst shedding in high numbers
During acute infection, oocysts can be found in high numbers in the faeces of the host. This
is facilitated by auto-infection of the host (see 2.1.2). At the peak of the infection, infected
humans shed up to 105-7 per gram faeces [Chappell et al., 1999]. Rose et al. [1986] and
Madore et al. [1987] reported an average number of 5300 Cryptosporidium oocysts per litre
in untreated sewage water and a range of 850-14,000 oocysts per litre. However, only a small
number of samples were taken (n = 4). Rose et al. [1996] found 67% of the raw sewage
samples in St. Petersburg, Florida positive, with an average concentration of 1500 per litre
(maximum 12000 per litre); 42% of the effluent samples were positive with an average
concentration of 140 per litre (maximum 1100 per litre). The removal efficiency rate was
91% (1.0 log) for Cryptosporidium for the combined processes. In a wastewater treatment
plant in Israel, the number of Cryptosporidium oocysts varied from 300 to7700 per litre. The
purification efficiency of 93% resulted in 50 oocysts/l in the effluent [Nasser & Molgen,
1998]. In a Canadian study by Chauret et al. [1999] 54 effluent samples were taken at the
Ottawa-Carleton wastewater treatment. The numbers of Cryptosporidium were 50 per litre.
In the Netherlands, 2 wastewater treatment plants were investigated [Medema et al., 2001].
Geometric mean oocyst concentration in raw and sedimented sewerage (pre clarifier) were
540 and 4650 per litre and in effluent of these biological treatment systems were 17 and 250
per litre respectively.

Several studies show that infected cattle, especially newborn calves, sheds high numbers of
oocysts [Anderson & Bulgin, 1981; Current, 1987; Casemore et al., 1997]. In newborn
calves, excretion of oocysts usually occurs after 7 days and peaks around 14 days. At the
peak of the infection, 106-7 oocysts per gram faeces are excreted. Several authors have
studied the shedding patterns of calves quantitatively. Xiao & Herd [1994b] found oocyst
concentrations of 104-7/gram faeces in calves of 1-6 weeks. Medema et al. [2001] found
oocysts in 90% of the veal calf herds when manure of 1-6 week-old calves was sampled. The
average concentration of oocysts was 5.2 x 104 per gram (range 0 – 1.9 x 105 /gram). Both
the prevalence and the concentration of oocysts declined as the calves grew older,
respectively to 20% and 2.6 x 103/gram at calves of 26 weeks [Medema et al., 2001]. They
estimated the annual emission of oocysts by all veal calves in the Netherlands to be 1.2 x
1015 oocysts. Svoboda et al. [1997] found a median concentration of 3 x 106 oocysts/gram of
calve faeces (range 0 – 1.3x108/gram), resulting in a daily oocyst excretion of >1010. Adult
cattle showed much lower concentrations of oocysts (0.5 – 45/gram), resulting in a daily
excretion of 7 x 105 oocysts. Scott et al. [1994] found somewhat higher oocyst-
concentrations in adult cattle: 90/gram (range 25-18000/gram). There was no apparent
relation with calving. In contrast, Medema et al. [2001] did not find Cryptosporidium in
manure of adult dairy cattle. Fayer [2004] and Olson et al. [2004] showed that calves of 1 – 4
weeks predominantly shed C. parvum, while older calves were infected primarily by C.
andersoni. So, young animals are the principal source of zoonotic C. parvum. This is
important for management of animal farming in watersheds; ensuring that the newborns and

their manure are kept away from water sources may reduce the risk of waterborne
transmission considerably.
Slurry from calve housing contains oocysts; Medema et al. [2001] found an average
concentration of 7500 oocysts (range 6100-9800)/gram. Survival of oocysts in slurry was
less than 4 weeks at 20°C; higher survival rates were observed at 4°C [Svoboda et al., 1997].
Shedding of C. parvum by other farm animals (sheep, goat, horse) does occur, but is less
well studied. Symptomatic infection is also here more common in infant than in adult
animals.


2.2.7   No maturation required
Unlike other coccidian parasites, Cryptosporidium oocysts do not require a period of
maturation of the oocysts after shedding with faeces. They are immediately able to infect a
new host.

Problem formulation




3.1      IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS EVENTS
Like many of the waterborne pathogens Cryptosporidium is an intestinal pathogen and is
transmitted by the faecal-oral route. Many of the hazardous events that can be identified for
Cryptosporidium are identical to those for other enteric pathogens, such as Giardia, but also
enteric bacteria (i.e. Campylobacter) and viruses (i.e. Noroviruses or Hepatitis A or E
viruses), since all of these pathogens originate from faecal contamination. On the other hand,
Cryptosporidium has characteristics that may results in a relatively high risk of disease in the
case of a hazardous event results. These are particularly its extreme resistance to chemical
disinfection and long survival in the aquatic environment (see chapter 2).
To identify hazardous events, drinking water outbreaks are an important source of general
information on hazardous events leading to waterborne transmission of Cryptosporidium
(paragraph 3.2). Site-specific information on hazardous events can be obtained from a
sanitary survey and from historical monitoring data (paragraph 3.3).
Paragraph 3.4 describes how the information on hazardous events can be used in QMRA.




                                              18
3.2      LESSONS FROM DRINKING WATERBORNE OUTBREAKS
Many waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been reported in industrialised
countries [MacKenzie et al., 1994; Hunter, 1997; 2004; Bouchier, 1998; Craun et al., 1998].
The first reported human outbreak of cryptosporidiosis due to contaminated water supplies
occurred in Texas in 1984 in conjunction with a Norwalk virus outbreak [D’Antonio et al.,
1985]. The water source was an artesian well and was suspected of being contaminated with
sewage. Disinfection by chlorination was the only treatment and although adequate to
control coliform bacteria, it was apparently insufficient in controlling Norwalk virus and
Cryptosporidium. A second outbreak in Carrollton, Georgia (USA) occurred in January
1987, where over 13,000 people were affected [Hayes et al., 1989]. The Carrollton drinking
water supply underwent conventional treatment, including coagulation, sedimentation, rapid
sand filtration, and disinfection. Subsequent investigations revealed no violations for
coliform or turbidity levels. At the same time, an outbreak in the UK was reported that was
caused by contamination of the distribution network through contamination of a break-
pressure tank, which was enhanced during rainfall [Smith et al., 1989]. Again, the water
complied with the coliform standard. These first waterborne outbreaks instructed scientists
that:
      - Cryptosporidium could be transmitted by municipal drinking water systems and
          cause large outbreaks;
      - Systems with chlorination only without filtration were especially vulnerable;
      - Outbreaks could occur through drinking water that met the coliform and turbidity
          standards.
In 1991 an outbreak occurred in the Swindon/Oxfordshire area of the UK through
conventionally treated (coagulation/filtration and disinfection) drinking water [Richardson et
al., 1991]. In this case, recirculation of filter backwash water caused an increased challenge
of the treatment systems with Cryptosporidium oocysts that broke through the filters. In
April 1993, the largest North American outbreak of cryptosporidiosis was described as
apparently affecting some 403,000 people in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and as being caused by
cattle faeces in surface water passing through the conventional treatment plant just after a
coagulant change-over [MacKenzie et al., 1994]. Since that time both the true size and
sources of the outbreak have been questioned, with molecular epidemiological evidence
pointing to a human rather than a cattle source [Sulaiman et al., 1998] and the true size of the
outbreak possibly being exaggerated by orders of magnitude through over-reporting bias
[Hunter and Syed, 2001]. These and many other outbreaks informed scientists that
conventional treatment systems also can be vulnerable to outbreaks when the coagulation
and filtrations systems are not carefully operated and maintained.
In 1998 Sydney experienced a succession of Cryptosporidium contamination events. A
combination of early detection in samples by the monitoring laboratory, subsequent boil
water alerts issued to consumers, and the possibility that oocysts in the supply system were
not viable or counts overestimated may have been the reason that no cases of
cryptosporidiosis were traced to drinking water during these three events [McClellan, 1998;




                                              19
Allen et al. 2000; Clancy, 2000, 2001; Hawkins et al. 2000; 2001]. The incidents did result
in a large body of research into the origin of the contamination events. This has lead to the
understanding of the transport of Cryptosporidium in reservoirs following rainfall events. In
this case, the heavy rainfall after a period of draught caused relatively cold floodwater to
enter and fill the reservoir (Lake Burrangorang). The thermal stratification of the water in the
reservoir caused the colder floodwater to flow along the lake bottom and reached the dam
with the off take within days in stead of months. This flow caused an internal wave in the
reservoir that hit the off take on several subsequent days, leading to relatively high
Cryptosporidium counts in the water that entered treatment [Hawkins et al., 2000; Cox et al.,
2004].
In the summer of 2002, increased counts of Cryptosporidium in treated water (found in the
statutory monitoring) led to a boil water alert for Glasgow and Edinburgh. Also here, no
increase in the number of gastro-enteritis cases was observed [Healthstream, 27 sep. 2002].

Waterborne outbreaks have indicated the water supply systems that are at risk of
Cryptosporidium. Since chlorination or chloramination is not effective, unfiltered supplies
are at risk and catchment protection is important in management of this risk. Conventional
supplies are at risk if water treatment is compromised, especially incombination with a peak
contamination event in source water. In addition, several outbreaks through (karst)
groundwater supplies indicate that groundwater can be a source of cryptosporidiosis, despite
being usually regarded as surface water pathogen. Several outbreaks are associated with
ground water under the direct influence of surface water [Willcocks et al., 1998; Bouchier,
1998; Bergmire-Sweat et al., 1999]. Bank filtration systems are part of these groundwaters.
The outbreaks show that even deep boreholes can be affected by surface water ingress
through fissures in the soil. At the Brushy Creek outbreak, the distance between well system
and creek was over 400m [Bergmire-Sweat et al., 1999]. Other means of groundwater
contamination that have been associated with outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis is livestock
manure (cattle, sheep) near well-heads but also other contamination sources from above (or
in) ground (sewers, manure, manure deposits, sludge deposits etc.) Cryptosporidium
contamination may arise. In general, soils with fractures or fissures are vulnerable (rock,
chalk), but also freatic aquifers in more fine-structured soils (sand, gravel) are at risk. Heavy
rainfall events are risk events, since they promote rapid transport of contaminations through
the soil.

Several authors have reviewed the causes of outbreaks through drinking water [Smith &
Rose, 1990; 1998; Badenoch, 1990; 1995; Hunter, 1997; Craun et al., 1998; Bouchier, 1998;
Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004] and have made recommendations for optimising water treatment
practice (see Box 1 & 2). In a significant number of these outbreaks, the drinking water that
was implicated as the cause of the outbreak complied with the WHO-guidelines for
Escherichia coli levels and turbidity [Craun et al., 1998]. In most outbreaks, deviations from
normal raw water quality or treatment operation could be identified. However, in a drinking
waterborne outbreak in Las Vegas, no abnormalities in operation or water quality (raw or
treated) were detected [Goldstein et al., 1996].




                                              20
  Box 1.
  Badenoch [1995] recommendations for water treatment practices:

  To minimise the risk of cryptosporidial oocysts passing into public water supplies, water companies should pay
  partiular attention to the following:
        i.          the operation of rapid filters should avoid sudden surges of flow which may dislodge retained
                    deposits;
        ii.         rapid filters should not be restarted after shutdown without backwashing;
        iii.        after cleaning, slow sand filters should not be brought back into use without an adequate
                    “ripening period”;
        iv.         by-passing of part of the water treatment process should be avoided.



The information on the events/errors that led to these outbreaks can be used for the
identification of hazards. A common thread of many of the reported outbreaks and
contamination events is that the disinfection and filtration systems were thought to have been
inadequate to prevent contamination, at least in their operational state at the time of
contamination. It should be kept in mind however, that the information that is disseminated
from outbreak studies can be biased. The question about who is responsible (and may
encounter legal actions) for the outbreak has become more and more significant, and this
may influence the information that is released.
Drinking-waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been caused by contamination of
the source water due to heavy rainfall or melting snow [Richardson et al., 1991; MacKenzie
et al., 1994; Curriero et al., 2001] or to sewage contamination of wells [d’Antonio et al.,
1985; Kramer et al., 1996], inadequate treatment practices [Richardson et al., 1991; Craun et
al., 1998] or treatment deficiencies [Badenoch, 1990; Leland et al., 1993; Craun et al., 1998]
or combinations of these factors [MacKenzie et al., 1994]. Also, leakage or cross-
connections in the distribution system have caused outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis [Craun,
1992; de Jong & Andersson, 1997; Craun et al., 1998; Endo pers. comm.].




                                                       21
  Box 2.
  Selected Bouchier [1998] recommendations for water treatment.

  Water utilities should investigate immediately when oocyst are detected in raw water to establish if any
  circumstance exists to allow Cryptosporidium to enter water supplies. Investigations should include review of
  recent treatment plant operational data.

  Water utilities should systematically asess and rank the potential risk of groundwater contamination by
  Cryptosporidium by application of a tripartite approach which assesses source, catchment and hydrogeological
  factors. Continued use should be made of existing national groundwater vulnerability maps and zoning schemes
  to assess risk of contamination wih Cryptosporidium.

  The group recommends that water utilities carry out an assessment of risk from Cryptosporidium from each
  source and put in place a procedure for updating the review of risk assessment. Water treatment requirements and
  monitoring systems should be reviewed against the level of risk.

  Water treatment works should be designed to handle the typical peak turbidity and colour loadings in source
  water.

  Water treatment works should be operated at all times in a manner that minimises turbidity in final water;
  attention should be given to other parameters which reflect performance of chemical coagulation, that is
  coagulant metal concentration and colour

  Coagulation/flocculation processes should be checked regularly to meet changing conditions of source water
  quality and other environmental factors.

  Filters should be operated and maintained under optimum conditions with attention to the quality and depth of
  media abd to the operation of backwashing/airscouring systems.

  For all sites at which Cryptosporidium might be a high risk, as determined by the risk assessment, monitoring
  should include continuous turbidity measurement on the outlet of each filter and on the final water using
  instuments capabl of detecting changes of less than 0.1 NTU.


During several of these outbreaks, oocysts were detected in the drinking water over a wide
range of concentrations [Haas & Rose, 1995]. Haas & Rose proposed an action level of 10-
30 oocysts in 100 l drinking water as a level above which outbreaks could occur. Craun et al.
[1998] reviewed oocyst data from 12 outbreaks and found no association between observed
oocyst concentration in drinking water and risk of illness. Examination of drinking water
during outbreaks is usually too late to determine the concentrations that triggered the
outbreak. This means that the water quality data are usually inadequate to determine if there
is an association with illness. Gale et al. [2002] add the variability in oocyst concentration in
drinking water as another factor that complicates establishing this association. To obtain
‘historical’ data on the occurrence of oocysts in drinking water, researchers have attempted
to detect oocysts in ice [MacKenzie et al., 1994], in in-line filters [van Asperen et al., 1996]
and in sediments of water storage tanks [Pozio et al., 1997]. The detected concentrations are
probably an underestimation of the concentrations that led to the outbreak, although Haas et
al.,[1999] showed for the Milwaukee outbreak that, with some assumptions, the measured
concentration in drinking water was close to the predicted concentration on the basis of the
attack rate, water consumption and dose-response relation. However, Hunter & Syed [2001]




                                                        22
argued that the size of the Milwaukee outbreak was actually much smaller, due to the use of
an incorrect (low) background incidence. This would mean that the correlation between
outbreak data and risk assessment data need to be revisited.

Low oocyst concentrations in drinking water have also been found in situations where no
evidence for the occurrence an outbreak was present [LeChevallier et al., 1991; Karanis &
Seitz, 1996; Rose et al., 1997; McClellan, 1998; Hunter, 2004]. Studies that have attempted
to correlate the prevalence of parasites in drinking water to the prevalence of disease in the
community receiving this water do not show a clear relation. This relation may be obscured
by host immunity that could be triggered (and maintained) by low level exposure through
drinking water and environmental sources. Most current detection methods do not allow the
determination of infectivity of oocysts in water, which makes it difficult to determine the
significance of low oocyst levels in drinking water. Given this uncertainty, detection of
oocysts in treated water should always lead to the use of additional tests to confirm the
presence of (potentially viable) C. hominis or C. parvum oocysts (molecular methods, using
the 18S-rDNA gene and/or COWP-gene as targets [Xiao et al., 2000; Amar et al., 2004;
Heijnen et al., 2005]. Smith [2003] developed a method to genotype Cryptosporidium
oocysts that were isolated from the slides used to detect Cryptosporidium with the
conventional IFA method. If genotyping indicates the presence of C. hominis or C. parvum
oocysts in relatively high numbers, this should lead to an epidemiological study to determine
if significant waterborne transmission occurs and careful examination for the source(s) of the
contamination and the installation of control measures (improved source protection and/or
water treatment). Only when oocysts found in treated water are genotyped to determine
whether they could potentially infect humans can the (in)significance of low numbers of
oocysts in treated water be assessed. The molecular methods are sensitive enough for
genotyping isolates from water, but unfortunately the current methods to determine whether
oocysts are indeed infectious (mouse assay, cell culture) are not sensitive enough.The
required sensitivity for the cell culture methods to work adequately for water quality
monitoring is around 1 infective oocyst per litre.




3.3      SITE-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF HAZARDOUS EVENTS.


3.3.1    Sanitary survey
A means to collect site-specific information on hazardous events is a sanitary survey. This is
part of the Water Safety Plans’ system assessment. It is the basis for effective strategies for
prevention and control of hazards. Assessment of hazardous events includes understanding
the characteristics of the drinking-water system, what hazards may arise and from which




                                             23
sources, how these hazards create risks, and the efficacy of processes and practices that
affect drinking-water quality. The complete system from catchment to tap should be
described and analysed for events/conditions that could lead to contamination of the water
supply. For a more detailed description of a sanitary survey, the reader is referred to the
WHO background document on Water Safety Plans [Davison et al., 2005]. Table 3 lists
specific hazardous events that have led to Cryptosporidium outbreaks, as a basis for
prioritising the hazardous events by risk of Cryptosporidium transmission. For
microbiological catchment surveys of surface and groundwater supplies, the reader can find
specific guidance in Medema et al. [2004].

3.3.2                         Historical data
Historical data from monitoring of the source water, treatment processes, treated water and
distributed water are also a potential source for site-specific identification of hazardous
events. Data on the flow and turbidity of river water at the abstraction site can inform the
water supplier of the frequency and magnitude of peak contamination events (esp. if the
physicochemical data are supplemented with data on faecal indicator bacteria). An example
can be found in the turbidity data of the off take of the water in Lake Burrangorang during
the Sydney events in 1998 [Cox et al., 2004]. An assessment of multiyear historical data on
faecal indicators can identify the occurrence and magnitude of peak events (Figure 2) and
help water suppliers to focus pathogen monitoring to these peak events.

Similarly, historical data on the performance of treatment processes, such as the data from
turbidity monitoring or particle counting or the data on disinfectant dosing and residual, UV
sensors etc., provide valuable information about the nominal performance and the occurrence
of incidents of poor treatment performance (Figure 3).

increase in effluent turbidity and the occurrence of turbidity spikes.

Also incident reports and operational logs can be used to determine the type of failures in
treatment and their magnitude, frequency and duration, which is valuable for risk assessment
[Westrell et al., 2003].
The data from the monitoring programmes of the water in distribution networks (esp. E. coli
and if available, enterococci) provide information about the occurrence of events of faecal
contamination of water in distribution networks [Westrell et al., 2003; Lieverloo et al.,
2006]. Also incident logs of larger contamination events provide information about
hazardous events that have lead to contamination of the specific site.
Obviously, the physicochemical data and data on indicator organisms can only serve as
indication of optimal or sub-optimal system performance. Whether these moments of
suboptimal performance can lead to contamination of drinking water with pathogens and to
what extend is less clear and usually assumptions are needed to deduce this information from
the data.

In the UK, historical data on Cryptosporidium monitoring of treated water are available, as a
result of the Cryptosporidium regulations that require daily monitoring of Cryptosporidium
in at-risk water supplies [Lloyd & Drury, 2002]. Such data are of course particularly relevant
for the identification of events in catchment, source or treatment that give rise to relatively
high Cryptosporidium counts in finished water. Such an evaluation is currently being
conducted with the regulatory data in the UK.




                                                               26
3.4      USE OF HAZARDOUS EVENTS IN QMRA
In the site specific assessment of hazardous events, hazards and hazardous situations are
identified and prioritised using the sanitary survey, historical data on indicators or process
parameters, or operational logs, or expert knowledge. These hazardous situations are
significant information for risk assessment as they may comprise most of the health risk.
Bartram et al. [2001] already identified that QMRA should not only be directed at the
nominal performance of treatment systems, but also at the moments of poor source water
quality and treatment performance.
After the individual hazardous events are catalogued, the events can be clustered into a risk
scenario (i.e. heavy rainfall in the catchment leads to run-off of manure and sewer overflows
resulting in high concentrations of Cryptosporidium in the source water). Simultaneously,
the high turbidity of the source water renders disinfection less effective and may overload
coagulation/filtration leading to breakthrough of the treatment. If the most relevant
hazardous event can already be identified with the available knowledge, it may be effective
to go back to the problem formulation and focus the risk assessment to this hazardous event.

Exposure assessment



This chapter describes how information can be obtained to determine the probability of
exposure of humans to infective Cryptosporidium oocysts through drinking water. The
exposure is determined by two factors:
• the concentration of viable and infective Cryptosporidium oocysts in drinking water at
    the point of consumption, which is usually very low;
• and the consumption of drinking water without further treatment (i.e. boiling) by the
    population.
In formula:

         Pe = C dw × V                                                                       (1)

Where:
Pe     = probability of exposure
Cdw    = concentration in drinking water
V      = volume of cold tap water consumed

Exposure can be defined as a single dose of one or more Cryptosporidium oocysts that a
consumer ingests at a certain point in time, or the total amount of oocysts that constitute a set
of exposures, i.e. over a day or a year. ?) As exposure to oocysts in drinking water is not




                                              28
evenly distributed in time, it is important to assess not only the average exposure but also its
distribution.
The next paragraphs describe how data and information can be collected to determine the
concentration of Cryptosporidium in drinking water and the available information about
consumption of cold tap water.
Two ways to assess the concentration of Cryptosporidium in drinking water are described.
The first one is direct: monitoring of drinking water for the presence of Cryptosporidium.

                                                     Concentration in        Consumption of
                                                      drinking water          cold tap water

The second one is indirect: monitoring of source water for the presence of Cryptosporidium
and assessment of the efficacy of the water treatment processes in removing
Cryptosporidium oocysts. Combining source water concentration and treatment efficacy
yields an estimate of the concentration of Cryptosporidium in drinking water.


  Concentration in            Treatment            Concentration in         Consumption of
   source water                efficacy             drinking water           cold tap water


In current practice, both systems provide an estimate of the Cryptosporidium concentration
in drinking water as it leaves the treatment works. Although post-treatment contamination is
a significant source of waterborne outbreaks, the assessment of the contribution of this route
is less well developed. A method is described to use the data on faecal indicator bacteria (E.
coli) that are collected in distributed water.
But first, the methods for detecting Cryptosporidium in water are briefly described, as this
knowledge is required to understand this discussion.


4.1 METHODS FOR DETECTION OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN
WATER
For a comprehensive overview of the detection methodologies, the reader is referred to the
WHO Microbiology Review Document on protozoan parasites [Medema et al, 2001b] and
the proceedings of the conference: Cryptosporidium: the analytical challenge [Smith &
Thompson, 2001]. Here, the characteristics of the methods that are relevant for QMRA are
briefly discussed.
The methods required for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water are different and
more complex than the methods traditionally used in the water industry for the detection of
bacteria. The overall procedure consists of several sequential stages, namely: sample
collection and concentration, separation of (oo)cysts from contaminating debris and




                                              29
detection/enumeration of (oo)cysts. Both large (100 – 1000 litres) and small (1-10 litres)
volume sampling methods have been developed. Several different methods are used for
sample concentration, filtration on flat membrane or cartridge filters, compressed foam
filters, cross flow filtration, centrifugation and flocculation. After concentration, the oocysts
have to be extracted and purified from the concentrate. This was originally done with density
centrifugation, but is now commonly done with immunomagnetic separation. Some labs use
flow cytometry with cell sorting (FACS) for purification. After the oocysts are purified, they
are stained with fluorescent antibodies and detected under the epifluorescence microscope.
The immunofluorescence assay is commonly used in environmental monitoring. This assay
can be aided by FACS or laser scanning technology. Oocysts are identified by their
fluorescence and morphology. Identification is facilitated by the use of the
diaminophenylindole (DAPI) stain that stains the nucleus of the sporozoites. Characteristic
morphology is verified by examining the oocysts under Differential Interference Contrast.
A recent development in detection methodology is harmonisation of the protocols used for
environmental monitoring [EPA 1623 [1999], UKSCA [1999], Stanfield et al., 2000, ISO
[2004]]. Filtration is the most common method for the concentration, although different
filter-types are used, and immunomagnetic separation is now the most commonly used
technology for the separation of oocysts from sample debris.
The current methodology has several drawbacks that limit the applicability or interpretation
of the results of Cryptosporidium monitoring, both in general and more specifically for the
use of the data in QMRA. These drawbacks are outlined below.


4.1.1 Recovery efficiency

An important drawback of the current concentration methods is that many factors in the
water matrix (suspended solids, algae) and also age/history of the (oo)cysts, can have
significant effect on the recovery efficiency. Oocysts are lost in the subsequent concentration
and purification steps, they are not eluted from the filter material or are not captured by the
IMS. Suspended solids and divalent cations influence the binding of the IMS-antibodies to
the oocysts and also ageing and oxidative treatment may strip the epitopes for antibody
attachment from the oocyst wall [Vesey et al., 1993; Smith, 1996]. The actual concentration
of oocysts in a water sample is thus (much) higher than the measured concentration. To
estimate the actual concentration of oocysts, the oocyst counts need to be corrected for the
recovery efficiency. This is complicated by the fact that the recovery efficiency can vary
between samples.
The recovery efficiency can be measured by adding a known number of oocysts to the
sample and process and analyse the sample. Seeding should be done in the water before the
first concentration step, to approach the recovery efficiency of “natural” oocysts in the water
sample.
Care should be given to the preparation of the oocyst suspension used for seeding, as
purification procedures may alter the surface characteristics of oocysts [Reduker et al., 1985;




                                              30
Brush et al., 1998] that may affect the outcome of the recovery experiments. Also the age of
the oocysts is a factor that may affect the recovery efficiency.
Ideally, the recovery efficiency is determined for every sample. Since this is laborious and
expensive, recovery efficiency data are usually collected from a subset of samples. Warnecke
et al. [2003] describe the use of pre-stained oocysts that can be discriminated from natural
oocysts for seeding of every sample.
Teunis et al. [1997] regarded the recovery efficiency as a stochastic process; each oocyst has
a certain Binomial probability of being recovered and this probability is not constant but
follows a Beta-distribution. This allowed them to fit a Beta-Binomial distribution through
recovery data to describe the variation in the recovery efficiency.


4.1.2 Viability/infectivity

Another drawback of the immunofluorescence detection assay is that is does not allow
differentiation of viable from dead oocysts. DIC microscopy can be used to determine if the
internal morphology is compromised as an indication of non-viability. DAPI
(diaminophenylindole)-staining is used as support-stain that allows the assessment of the
presence of sporozoites in the oocyst, again as mark of viability. Vital staining (PI [Campbell
et al., 1992] or Syto59 [Belosevic & Finch, 1997]) can be used in combination with the IFA
test and gives an indication of cell membrane integrity. These dye exclusion assays provide
some information about viability, but should be used with caution as they can (largely)
overestimate viability of oocysts that have been exposed to stressors such as exposure to UV
light [Clancy et al., 1998].
Another assay to assess the viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts is cell culture.
Cryptosporidium oocysts are able to infect cell-lines of human epithelial cells [Upton et al.,
1994]. The infection process and asexual reproduction of Cryptosporidium occur. Several
cell lines are used; the lines from human enterocytes (HCT8) [Slifko et al., 1997; 1999] and
colon cells (CaCo2) [Rochelle et al., 1997] and others. Immunofluorescence (foci method)
or PCR are used to detect the presence of Cryptosporidium in the cell-culture.
Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum differ in their ability to grow on different cell lines
[Morgan-Ryan et al., 2002]. Cell culture - PCR is currently used by one research group for
the detection and quantification of oocysts in source water and drinking water [LeChevallier
et al., 2003], but is not used by others because the assay is considered too insensitive [Schets
et al., 2005].
If data on the proportion of non-viable oocysts are available from internal morphology or dye
exclusion there are two ways to incorporate this information in the QMRA. The first is to use
only the observed concentration of potentially viable Cryptosporidium oocysts in each
sample, hence to discard oocysts that were counted as dead by these assays. The second is to
combine the information from the (non)viability assays of the individual samples to
determine the probability distribution of viability of oocysts in the water body that is assayed
[Teunis et al., 1997]. If count data are available from the cell-culture assay these can be used
in QMRA directly [LeChevallier, 2004].




                                              31
4.1.3    Specificity

The specificity of the immunofluorescence assay is based on the specificity of the
monoclonal antibody-antigen reaction. Although this is highly specific, non-specific binding
is observed in natural samples. Many of the particulates that react with the monoclonal
antibody can be discriminated from oocysts by a trained observer, but occasionally particles
(algae) occur in the sample that are very difficult to discriminate from oocysts [Rodgers et
al., 1995]. This may lead to false-positive results. In the Sydney events, this lack of
specificity led to debate between researchers that argued that many of the observed oocyst-
like particles could be algae versus others that considered them Cryptosporidium oocysts
[Clancy, 2000; 2001].
The immunofluorescence method is also not specific to Cryptosporidium species and
genotypes that are infectious to humans, also species that are infectious to animals are
detected. Molecular techniques (PCR, genotyping) are rapidly evolving and some
laboratories are now using these methods for environmental monitoring [LeChevallier et al.,
2003; Xiao et al., 2001; 2004; Jiang et al., 2005; Heijnen et al., 2005]. The high specificity
of genotyping methods is essential to understand the environmental transmission of
Cryptosporidium [Latham et al., 2003]. In the case of waterborne outbreaks, genotyping of
the outbreak strain and strains found in the environment may elucidate the route of
transmission and confirm or contradict the role of drinking water as route. Environmental
samples are more likely to contain a cocktail of Cryptosporidium spp. than samples isolated
from humans or animals. Genotyping can discriminate between the different
Cryptosporidium species in environmental samples [Xiao et al., 2001] and also identify that
multiple genotypes are involved in a waterborne outbreak [Xiao et al., 2004]. Care is needed
when applying PCR-RFLP analysis of one or several gene-loci, as comparison to
microsatellite genotyping of stool samples showed that RFLP underestimates mixed
infections [Chalmers et al., 2005]. Genotyping methods can also be targeted to the question.
In an outbreak investigation the question is whether the environmental isolates are identical
to the outbreak strain and very specific methods such as microsatellite testing are applicable
[Smith et al., 2003]. In a QMRA the main question is how many oocysts of human
pathogenic species are present, so typing to the subspecies level is not necessary but specific
PCR(-RFLP) methods for C. hominis, C. parvum genotype 2 and C. meleagridis and maybe
the Cryptosporidium species that are incidentally found in human cases.
PCR is not a quantitative assay. It can be made (semi) quantitative by assaying serial
dilutions or by employing real-time PCR, where the formation of PCR-product in the
reaction is monitored on-line and the onset of detection of PCR-product is related to the
initial concentration of target DNA. A positive control is needed to test for inhibition of the
PCR. The PCR gives information about presence of Cryptosporidium DNA in the sample. In
combination with the concentration and IMS purification it can be argued that it is likely that
this was no free DNA from the water sample but originating from the oocysts that were
concentrated from the water sample. The PCR does not give information about viability or




                                             32
infectivity of the oocysts. The PCR can be preceded by an assay that indicates viability
(excystation [Filkorn et al., 1994; Wagner-Wiening & Kimmig, 1995] or cell-culture
[LeChevallier et al., 2003], but these methods are either not specific for infective oocysts
[Neumann et al., 2000] or too insensitive [Schets et al., 2005] for environmental samples.


4.2       MONITORING OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN (UN)TREATED
          DRINKING WATER
Monitoring Cryptosporidium in untreated drinking water is the most direct way of assessing
the concentration of Cryptosporidium in (finished) drinking water. Several studies have
examined the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in treated drinking water (Table 4). Of
the samples analysed (5 – 142), 3.0 – 40% of the samples contained oocysts in
concentrations of 0.001 – 1.5 per litre. In the study of LeChevallier et al., 1991, oocysts were
found in 26.8% of 82 samples. All samples were taken from drinking water that was treated
by filtration and the treatment systems had no recent history of sub-optimal operation. The
highest concentrations were found in the study of Hsu et al. [1999] in Taiwan, China. The
highest oocyst concentrations were found in systems using poor source water quality with
high oocyst counts.

In the UK, direct monitoring of drinking water is embedded in the drinking water regulation.
Water supply systems that are at risk from Cryptosporidium are obliged to sample their
treated water continuously. Samples of approx. 1000 litres water, taken over a period of at
least 23 hours, are to be taken daily. The regulation requires water utilities to demonstrate
that the drinking water is treated so as to ensure that the average concentration of
Cryptosporidium is less than 1 oocyst per 10 litres of treated water. Although not put in place
to assess exposure of consumers to Cryptosporidium, but rather as a treatment standard, the
data that are collected under this regulation are applicable for risk assessment. In the UK
regulatory monitoring of 2000 – June 2004, a total of 201136 finished water samples were
analysed! In 195183 samples (84% of the water supply systems) no oocysts were detected. In
5953 samples, oocysts were detected in low concentrations (Table 4), with a maximum of
0.49 oocysts per litre. Since 2000, the percentage of positive samples declined from 8 to 1 %,
partly due to improvements of treatment, and abandonment of risky supplies.

In unfiltered systems (with chlorination only and no UV), the Cryptosporidium concentration
in drinking water can be estimated by monitoring source water. An example of such an
approach is given by Haas & Eisenberg [2001], who used data from Cryptosporidium
monitoring in the watersheds of New York City water supply. New York does not filter but
treats the water from their pristine reservoirs with chlorination only. They had oocyst data
from two watersheds. For each watershed, 292 data points were available, with many (85%)
non-detects. The overall mean concentration in the two watersheds (with non-detects as zero)
was 0.26 and 0.31 oocysts per 100 l.


LeChevallier [2004] studied the occurrence of Cryptosporidium in filtered drinking water
with the cell-culture-PCR assay. In 1690 samples of 100 litres of treated water, 24 showed
the presence of one or more infectious oocysts (1.4%). 153 samples were tested with the
conventional method (EPA 1623) and 1 (0.7%) showed the presence of Cryptosporidium. He
found no relation between detection of Cryptosporidium in treated water with the turbidity of
the source water, type of clarification, plant capacity, backwash of filters and level of
automation. Fewer positive samples were found in plants that used mixed filter media
compared to sand or granular activated carbon alone. Small systems (serving <25000 people)
were more often positive than large systems (31 vs. 20%) and small suburban systems were




                                                34
more often positive than small urban systems (44 vs. 26%). Also plants of more than 75
years old were more often positive than younger plants (32 vs. 23%).

There are several major drawbacks associated with direct monitoring. The actual
concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in drinking water is in most cases very low. In the
absence of information on viability, infectivity and genotypes it is difficult to interpret
monitoring data in terms of health risk. A very extensive monitoring programme is required
to establish accurate information about the concentration. Spatial and temporal variation of
microbial concentrations after treatment have been reported [Gale et al., 2002; Hijnen et al.,
2004]. The likely result of an extensive monitoring programme with the current methodology
will be a large number of non-detects and a low number of positive samples containing one
or few oocysts. This is confirmed by most of the systems in the UK and also in the source
water monitoring of New York City [Haas & Eisenberg, 2001] and Melbourne [Stevens,
pers. comm.]. Although statistical distributions can be used to describe this type of data-set
[Teunis & Havelaar., 1999; Evers & Groennou, 1998; Haas & Eisenberg, 2001], the level of
uncertainty is high. As the cost of the methodology is high, large surveys are particularly
expensive.
The methodological shortcomings, and especially the lack of specificity of the IFA-method
for infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts, have led many researchers away from monitoring of
finished water to focus on source water [Allen, 2000].


4.3     CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN SOURCE WATER AND REMOVAL
        BY TREATMENT
In the indirect approach, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in drinking water is
calculated from their occurrence in source water and the removal efficacy of the treatment
process. Source water monitoring for Cryptosporidium is applied in several countries,
although usually in research rather than in routine monitoring.


4.3.1    Cryptosporidium in source water

Estimation based on watershed use
If no data are available on the presence of Cryptosporidium in a watershed, the average
concentration of oocysts can be estimated very roughly from information on the level of
faecal pollution of the watershed. This can be assessed by a sanitary survey [see Bartram &
Howard, 2001] and available data on faecal indicator bacteria (E. coli, enterococci). Many
studies have indicated that Cryptosporidium concentrations may peak during storm events or
snowmelt, and that peak concentrations in source waters may be 10 – 100-fold higher than
the concentration in non-event situations [Stewart et al., 1997]. The potential occurrence of
peak events should be taken into account in the sanitary survey and the estimation of the




                                             35
Cryptosporidium levels on the basis of watershed use. In the classification below the average
oocyst concentration is given. The maximum concentration in each of the classes will be 10-
100-fold higher.

Very pristine
The watershed lies in an area without human settlements and activities like agriculture.
Wildlife may be present but not in high densities. E. coli concentrations are typically below
1/100 ml. In such a watershed, Cryptosporidium oocysts may sporadically be present.
Average concentration of oocysts can be estimated at 0.001 oocysts per litre.

Pristine
The watershed lies in an area with little and dispersed human settlement and small-scale
agricultural activities. No direct input of human or livestock wastes is present. Wildlife is
present. E. coli concentrations lie in the range of 1-10/100ml. Cryptosporidium is
infrequently present. The average Cryptosporidium concentration can be estimated at 0.01
oocysts per litre.

Moderately polluted
The watershed lies in an area with villages and extensive agricultural activities (animal-based
or foodcrops using manure or waste water sludge for fertilisation) are undertaken. Faecal
wastes are collected and treated before discharged into the watershed. The intake of water for
production of drinking water is not under the direct influence of wastewater discharges. The
average E. coli count is 10-100/100ml Cryptosporidium is occasionally present. The average
Cryptosporidium concentration can be estimated at 0.1 oocysts per litre.

Polluted
Small cities, villages and agricultural (animal- based or foodcrops using manure for
fertilisation, feedlots) areas are present in the watershed. Wastewater is collected and treated
before discharge in the watershed. Sewer overflows and agricultural run-off enter the
watershed, but the water intake is not directly under the influence of these discharges. E. coli
counts are typically around 100/100ml. Cryptosporidium is generally present. The average
Cryptosporidium concentration can be estimated at 1 oocyst per litre.

Heavily polluted
Many and large urbanised areas and intensive agriculture (feedlots, large manure-storage
facilities, intensive fertilisation with manure) are present in the watershed. Wastewater is
generally collected and treated before discharge into the watershed. Average E. coli counts
lies around 1000/100 ml. Cryptosporidium is generally present, in an estimated concentration
of 10 oocysts per litre




                                              36
Grossly polluted
Large urbanised areas and intensive agriculture are present in the watershed. Wastewater is
generally not treated and/or manure is discharged into the watershed. The water intake may
be under the direct influence of wastewater or manure discharges. The E. coli counts are
usually above 1000/100 ml. Cryptosporidium is very generally present in average
concentrations of 100 oocysts/litre and higher.

Cryptosporidium monitoring
Cryptosporidium has been found in very many surface waters worldwide. Many authors have
reported the results of source water monitoring for Cryptosporidium oocysts [Madore et al.,
1987; Ongerth & Stibbs, 1987; Rose 1988; Stetzenbach et al., 1988; Badenoch, 1990, 1995;
Rose et al., 1991; LeChevallier et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1991; Hansen & Ongerth, 1991;
Roach et al., 1993; Karanis et al., 1996; Wallis et al., 1996; Ong et al., 1996; Medema, 1999;
Dolesj et al., 2000; Hsu et al., 2001; Robertson & Gjerde, 2001; Medema et al., 2001, 2003;
Hashimoto et al., 2002; Kistemann et al., 2002; Tsushima et al., 2003; Hormann et al., 2004;
Bastos et al., 2004]. Although the interpretation of the results is hampered by the
shortcomings of the detection and enumeration methods that have been used, these studies
highlight several characteristics of the occurrence of Cryptosporidium in source waters. The
most important of these is the variability of the oocyst concentrations. Cryptosporidium is
found to be present in the majority of surface waters, but depending on the level of faecal
pollution only few or almost all samples are found positive. The contamination level is
related to the presence of the sources of faecal contamination, especially human sewage and
run-off from agricultural land with cattle or sheep manure, in the watershed.
The concentration of oocysts at a surface water site varies considerably too. An overview of
surface water surveys in the US showed that Cryptosporidium was found in 9.1 – 100% of
the surface water samples in geometric mean concentrations of 0.003 – 1920 oocysts per litre
[Rose et al., 1997]. Figure 4 shows the geometric mean and maximum concentration found
in surface water from 38 studies in 16 countries, with a total number of 9354 samples. The
mean percentage of positive samples found in these studies was 47% (5-95%: 5-100%). Most
of the studies focused on source water for drinking water production; some included
recreational water. Most of the studies reported oocyst concentrations without correction for
the recovery efficiency of the detection method, some did correct the concentration. In the
pristine sites, the geometric mean concentration was between 0.001 and 0.01 per litre, while
maximum concentrations may rise to around 1 per litre. In heavily contaminated sites the
geometric mean concentration is around 10-100 per litre, with maxima between 100 – 1000
per litre.

Figure 4. Cryptosporidium in surface water. Compilation of data from 9354 surface water
samples from 16 countries (mostly developed countries). Surface waters ranged from pristine
reservoirs in protected catchments to heavily contaminated rivers. Many studies reported
geometric means, many reported arithmetic means and one study reported the median. The
reported measures of general tendency are plotted in this figure.


In the US many data are available through the Cryptosporidium monitoring programs that
were conducted under the Information Collection Rule (ICR) and ICR Supplementary
Survey (ICRSS) [EPA, 2003]. Under the ICR, monthly data were collected over a period of
18 months at 338 filtered and 12 unfiltered water treatment plants, a total of approx. 6300
samples. Only 7% of these samples was found positive for Cryptosporidium, much lower
than the avergae of the studies presented in figure 4. For filtered supplies the (arithmetic)
mean concentration was 0.068 oocysts (all) per litre (90th percentile was 0.194 / l). The
mean concentration of oocysts showing specific internal structures was only 16% of the total
oocyst concentration. For unfiltered supplies, the mean concentration was 0.002 per litre
(90th percentile 0.005 / l). In the ICRSS, 80 selected supplies (77 randomly selected filtered
supplies and 3 selected unfiltered supplies), 24 samples were taken biweekly over a one year
period (number of samples approx. 1900). In this survey 14% of the samples were positive,
possibly due to the improved detection method (for the ICR this was EPA1622/1623, with a
recovery efficiency of 43%, compared to 12% for the ICR-method). The mean concentration




                                             38
was 0.06 oocysts per litere (90th percentile 0.1/l). Here, the mean conentration of oocysts
with internal structures was 30% of the mean concentration of all oocysts. EPA has
performed statistical data analysis on these data-sets [EPA, 2003].




Figure 5. The increase of Cryptosporidium and Giardia concentration in a tributary to a
drinking water reservoir following heavy rainfall (from Kistemann et al., 2002 (AEM)).

Despite the overall relation with the level of faecal contamination, the correlation between
Cryptosporidium concentration and the concentration of faecal indicator bacteria is usually
low [Atherholt et al., 1998, Rose et al., 1997, Medema, 1999]. Only spores of Clostridium
perfringens are reported to correlate with Cryptosporidium concentrations in several studies
[Atherholt et al., 1998; Medema, 1999; Medema et al., 2001].
Events such as rainstorms and snowmelt lead to run-off from agricultural lands and overflow
of sewage systems. This gives rise to a sudden, sharp increase in the pollution of surface
water with human and animal excreta. Several authors have shown that during these events
the concentration of Cryptosporidium can be 10 – 100-fold higher than during non-event
situations [Atherholt et al., 1998; Ferguson et al., 1996; Kistemann et al., 2002 (see Figure
5)]. Peak precipitation or snowmelt events may not only lead to increased run-off but also in
rapid travel of oocysts from source to drinking water off take or groundwater wells [Cox et
al., 2004; Medema & Stuyfzand, 2003]
The occurrence of short peak contamination events makes infrequent grab sampling less
suitable for assessment of the concentration of Cryptosporidium. The likelihood that these
peaks are missed is high, while these peaks represent periods of high risk. Atherholt et al.
[1998] showed that the maximum concentrations found by monthly sampling was 7-fold
lower than in a scheme were daily samples were taken for three weeks in each season.




                                              39
As peak concentrations of Cryptosporidium are related to events such as heavy rainfall,
several authors have used event sampling [Stewart et al., 1997; Roser et al., 2003]. So, rather
than monitoring with a regular sampling program, (part of) the monitoring resources were
dedicated to event sampling. This required knowledge of the catchment to identify sources of
contamination and conditions that could lead to a peak event. Historical data on rainfall,
snowmelt and river flow and turbidity may help to identify the conditions that lead to peak
events and the “shape” of these events. As years differ, it is important to collect multiyear
catchment data. The data can be used to tailor a monitoring program so peak events are
included, but also to determine the frequency and magnitude of peak events.


4.3.2 Assessment of treatment efficacy

General
A comprehensive overview of the efficacy of treatment processes to remove/inactivate
Cryptosporidium and other microbes can be found in the WHO review document on
treatment efficiency by LeChevallier & Au [2004]. Also Smith & Grimason [2003] have
reviewed the literature on water treatment processes against Cryptosporidium (and Giardia)
and Hijnen et al. [2004] did the same for protozoa, viruses and bacteria, with a special
emphasis on translation to full scale drinking water treatment.
In this document, only a brief description of the removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts by
water treatment processes is given and generic removal efficiencies are derived from the
published literature. For a more detailed description of the effect of treatment processes on
Cryptosporidium, the reader is referred to the review documents mentioned above.

Chemical disinfection
Cryptosporidium is very resistant to chemical disinfection. The conventional disinfectants
chlorine and chloramine have very little to no effect on the infectivity of Cryptosporidium
[Korich et al., 1990; Finch et al., 1994; Chauret et al., 1998]. Chlorine dioxide treatment
may result in inactivation, but the required product of concentration and contact time (CT;
disinfectant dose) is still high, especially at low temperatures [Finch et al., 1997]. Ozone is
the most potent oxidant, but the level of inactivation that can be achieved in drinking water
practice is still very little at low temperatures [Peeters et al., 1989; Korich et al., 1990; Finch
et al., 1993; Gyurek et al., 1999; Oppenheimer et al., 2000]. Chemical disinfectants cannot
be dosed to high concentrations because toxic by-products are formed by the reaction with
compounds in the water, such as trihalomethanes by chlorine, nitrite (and NDMA?) by
monochloramine, chlorite by chlorine dioxide and bromate by ozone.

UV
Although the older literature, employing in vitro viability assays, suggests that
Cryptosporidium is very resistant to UV [Ransome et al., 1993], Clancy et al., 1998 showed
that Cryptosporidium oocysts were highly susceptible to UV when assayed with mouse




                                               40
infectivity tests. Several subsequent studies with mouse infectivity or cell culture assays have
confirmed the high sensitivity of oocysts to UV, both from low and medium pressure lamps
[Clancy et al., 1998; 2000; 2003; Craik et al., 2001; Shin et al., 2001]. Identification of
possible DNA repair genes in C. parvum showed that the oocysts contain all of the major
genetic components of the nucleotide excision repair complex [Rochelle et al., 2004].
Nevertheless, inactivation displayed by oocysts immediately after UV exposure or displayed
by oocysts after UV exposure followed by various repair conditions were generally in the
same order of magnitude, suggesting that oocysts will not regain infectivity after UV
exposure.
These findings have resulted in an increased interest in UV treatment of the water industry
and many surface water systems in the developed world are now evaluating the installation
of UV for Cryptosporidium control.

Filtration
Filtration processes are important barriers for Cryptosporidium in water treatment. Before
the discovery of the sensitivity of oocysts to UV, the attention of the water industry was
focussed on oocyst removal by filtration processes and especially upgrading filter design and
operations to optimise oocyst removal. Full scale conventional treatment with coagulation,
floc removal and rapid granular filtration removes >2.3 logs [LeChevallier & Norton, 1992].
Other filtration processes, such as slow sand filtration and diatomaceous earth filtration give
similar removal efficiencies for oocysts [LeChevallier & Au, 2004]. Membrane filtration can
provide even higher removals of more than 4 logs, provided the integrity of the complete
membrane system is well-maintained [Jacangelo et al., 1995; Owen et al., 1999].

Bank filtration
Bank filtration can be a significant barrier for Cryptosporidium [Medema et al., 2000;
Berger, 2002; Schijven et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002; Gollnitz et al., 2003; Plutzer et al.,
2007], but this strongly depends on the type of soil. Karstic soils have large fissures and
cracks that allow rapid transport of oocysts without significant removal or inactivation. More
fine grained soils (loam, loamy sand, gravel/sand) is effective in oocyst removal. A
vulnerable situation for all bank filtration systems is a sharp rise in the river level (due to
snowmelt or heavy rainfall). This may lead to peak events in source water in combination
with rapid transport of water and oocysts in the soil [Medema & Stuyfzand, 2003; Dechesne
& Soyeux, 2007].

Generic log-credits
Data on removal or inactivation of Cryptosporidium by full-scale water treatment processes
are limited. Most of the data on treatment efficacy are collected in pilot systems or in
laboratory experiments (jar-tests for coagulation, batch-tests for chemical disinfection and
UV). Generally, challenge tests in the laboratory or in pilot plants tend to give more removal
or inactivation than is seen in drinking water practice. This is due to differences in scale and
hence the occurrence of short-circuits in full scale treatment processes [Smeets et al., 2006],




                                              41
to differences in the state of the micro-organisms in drinking water practice as compared to
lab or pilot tests (attached to particles, more resistant state of micro-organisms in the
environment). Full scale drinking water treatment is prone to variation [Medema, 1999;
Hijnen et al., 2000; 2004; Gale, Pitchers & Gray, 2002], due to variation in influent water
quality, temperature, operations etc.. Data on the efficacy of treatment processes determined
in lab and pilot tests should therefore be translated to full scale drinking water treatment with
care.
In the US, the available literature is translated into “log-credits” for well-designed and
operated treatment processes [EPA 1999, 2004; 2006]. In this approach, data from different
studies are combined using mathematical [Clark et al., 2003] or statistical [Qian et al., 2004]
approaches. The combination yields a single “log-credit” for the physical processes or a
single dose-inactivation relationship for the disinfection processes. In the Netherlands,
Hijnen et al., [2004] reviewed the available literature on the removal of micro-organisms by
UV, coagulation and slow sand filtration and translated this to log-credits for full scale water
treatment processes.
These generic log-credits are helpful in a system assessment to determine the potential
removal of Cryptosporidium by treatment processes. It must be borne in mind that generic
log-credits are an approximation for removal by well-designed, maintained and operated
treatment processes. Practical experience shows that poor design, maintenance and operation
may greatly reduce the efficacy of water treatment. Generic log-credits are listed in Table 5
& Table 6 and can be regarded as ‘default’ values for well-designed, maintained and
operated treatment processes. The generic log-credits can be higher in treatment systems that
have installed special measures, such as intensive monitoring of turbidity or particle counts
of individual filters as basis for the control of filter operation, intensive monitoring of the
integrity of membrane filtration modules with regard to treatment monitoring, or detailed
monitoring of the disinfectant dose over the contact chambers. The log-credits can also be
lower when design is poor or the treatment processes are not well maintained and controlled
(i.e. during peak events).

Site-specific assessment of removal of oocysts by water treatment
The “log-credit approach” assigns a default-value for a treatment process, such as ozonation
or slow sand filtration, while in practice such treatment processes differ in design, operation,
feed water quality etc. Hence, there can be considerable differences from one water supply
system to the other. McTigue et al. [1998], for example, reported an on-site survey in 100
conventional water treatment plants across the United States and demonstrated that the
removal efficiency of particles greater than 2 µm ranged from 0.04 to 5.5 logs (median 2.8
logs). They also found a significant variation in the removal efficiencies of Cryptosporidium.
Also within a site, pathogen removal may vary considerably, due to variations in feed water
composition, temperature, operations, filter backwashing etc. [UKWIR, 1995; Gray et al.,
1999; Medema, 1999; Hijnen et al., 2000]. Cryptosporidium removal may be significantly
reduced during periods of suboptimal coagulation, at the end of a filter-run of just after
backwashing if no filter-to-waste is applied [Huck et al., 2001; Emelko et al., 2003].
Variation is common to all water treatment systems and usually operations are dedicated to
reduce the impact of variation in conditions on final water quality. For example, disinfection
doses that are applied are higher when water temperatures are lower, coagulant aid is added
when temperatures decrease, more coagulant is added when the turbidity of the feed water
increases etc. So variation is normal and treatment processes and their operation are directed
towards minimising the effect. On the other hand however, treatment operations may
introduce variation. Turbidity or particle monitoring of treated water may show the filter
backwash cycles reflected in turbidity/particle peaks in treated water (see Figure 3). In some
cases the sources that lead to variation can even lead to treatment failure and the
breakthrough of pathogens to treated water. For microbial water quality, even short-term
variations and failures are critical, as short-term exposure to contaminated drinking water
can give rise to microbial disease. Treatment failures have been associated with several
outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis (Swindon, Milwaukee). In a theoretical exercise, Gale [2002]
has shown that the impact of frequency of poor treatment performance (“bad days”) is the
main determinant of the health risk. In the same exercise he showed that if one filter in an




                                                       44
array of parallel filters in a treatment system operates poorly, this will greatly reduce the net
removal of the whole system.

For site specific risk assessment and to incorporate the variability of the treatment processes,
data on the removal of micro-organisms should be collected on-site, with sufficient
frequency and duration to capture short- and long- (seasonal) variations.

Use of Cryptosporidium monitoring
An option to determine site-specific removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts is monitoring for
Cryptosporidium before and after the treatment process. LeChevallier et al. [1991] collected
data on the Cryptosporidium concentration before and after (coagulation)/filtration from 66
surface water treatment plants that used conventional treatment. The average reduction in
Cryptosporidium counts was 2.38 10logs. Data from individual systems were too limited to
assign local log-credits. In the UK, a substantial number of site-specific data are available on
concentration of Cryptosporidium before and after treatment, but the treatment efficacy from
these data has not been published.
Van Breemen [1998] and Medema [1999] published data on the concentration of
Cryptosporidium in a river and after 3 subsequent pre-treatment storage reservoirs with an
average residence time of 5 months. Teunis et al [1997; 1999] used these data to calculate an
average removal efficacy of 1.94 logs.

Use of microbial surrogates
Cryptosporidium monitoring is expensive and suffers from the methodological shortcomings.
Data are usually scarce. Several indigenous micro-organisms, that are ubiquitous in surface
water and easy to analyse, have been used as surrogates for the removal of Cryptosporidium
oocysts by conventional treatment. Of these, aerobic spores [Nieminski, 1997; Hall et al.,
2000; Facile et al., 2000] and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia/Clostridium perfringens
[Payment & Franco, 1993, Deny et al., 1992; Hijnen et al., 1997; 2000; Medema, 1999;
Montiel, 2002; Chung et al., 2004] have been used most extensively. The average removal of
Bacillus spores by filtration in 22 full scale systems corresponded with the removal of
Cryptosporidium oocysts (both 1.6 – 1.8 log) [Nieminski, 1997]. Facile et al. [2000]
determined the inactivation of lab-cultured Bacillus subtilis and environmental aerobic
spores by ozone and compared these to published inactivation kinetics of Cryptosporidium.
At 20-22°C, the CT required for 2 log inactivation of environmental aerobic spores was 1.72
mg.min-1.l-1 at pH 6.3, and 3.58 mg.min-1.l-1 at pH 8.2. This is comparable to the CT of 3.5
mg.min-1.l-1 that Finch et al. [1994] reported for Cryptosporidium parvum at 22°C, pH 6.9.
Other surrogates that have been used are algae [Akiba et al., 2002], diatoms [Nobel et al.,
2002] and biological particles [Microscopic Particulate Analysis; Hancock et al., 1996].
In pilot plant studies, Emelko & Huck [2004] showed that removal of seeded fluorescent
polystyrene microspheres (4.6 µm, density 1.045 g/ml) correlated well with removal of
seeded (inactivated) C. parvum oocysts by conventional and in-line filtration during a range
of (suboptimal) treatment conditions. No full scale seeding trials have been reported.




                                              45
Brown & Cornwell [2007] reviewed the data on aerobic spore removal and showed that they
are a conservative surrogate for conventional physical removal processes, such as
coagulation, clarification, filtration and bank filtration. Using the naturally occuring spores in
source water of full-scale systems in the US, they were able to demonstrate up to 4 or 5 logs
removal. The great value of such indicators is that they are much easier and cheaper to
analyse, which allows water utilities to obtain solid data-sets on microbial removal of the
full-scale system under the varying conditions of drinking water practice.

Data on the concentration of SSRC before and after treatment processes of surface water
companies in the Netherlands were analysed to determine their elimination capacity [Hijnen
et al., 2000]. This survey has yielded a description of the removal of SSRC by
coagulation/floc removal processes all under operational conditions (Figure 6).
The removal efficiency primarily depended on the type of floc removal process. Upward
filtration is relatively effective process for primary floc removal, but in all the other systems,
filtration is used as a secondary floc removal, rendering these systems overall more effective
in floc removal. Within these process-types, the removal of spores by open sedimentation is
relatively low, while flotation effectively removed spores.

As SSRC concentrations after the final treatment steps were low, the method was scaled up
to be able to analyse 100-500 litres of water [Hijnen et al., 2000]. This increased sensitivity
has allowed the assessment the efficiency of full scale treatment systems under operational
conditions (Figure 7). With the conventional method, >2.2 logs removal could be
demonstrated, while the high sensitivity method allowed the demonstration of 3.5-4.2 logs
removal.

A: conventional methods; the efficiency of the latter treatment processes cannot be
demonstrated. B: high sensitivity method; the efficiency of all treatment processes and the
overall treatment can be demonstrated.

None of the surrogates is perfect and the validity of the use of surrogates to get a quantitative
estimate of the removal of Cryptosporidium by water treatment processes should be
demonstrated in comparative studies. Nonetheless, the relative ease of data collection of full
scale systems is of great value to determine treatment performance, especially to determine
the removal under suboptimal process conditions.




                                                                            47
In the case of microbial count data, data analysis can be done according to the method
described by Teunis et al. [1999b.]. They have described how data before and after a
treatment process can be combined. In drinking water practice, samples before and after
treatment are usually collected on the same day and these samples could be regarded as
paired samples from which the removal efficacy of each day could be calculated. It should be
borne in mind that this approach may be valid for treatment processes where the in- and
outlet sample reflect the same body of water with suspended micro-organisms, such as in
disinfection processes. In several treatment processes, samples taken on the same day are not
samples of the same water body before and after treatment and cannot be regarded as paired
samples. An illustration is the dataset on Cryptosporidium before and after reservoir storage
with an average residence time of 5 months [Medema, 1999]. Even if sampling does analyse
the same water body before and after treatment, by taking the average water residence or
contact time in the treatment into account, micro-organisms may not be transported through
the treatment in the same manner as water is transported. An example is slow sand filtration
where Cryptosporidium oocysts can be retained on the filter and may be dislodged over time
or during increased flows. For such processes, the log-credits should be derived from the
combined inlet and combined outlet samples (average concentration in/average concentration
out). The variation in the concentration of micro-organisms can give an indication of the
variability of the removal.

Use of turbidity and particle counts
Pathogen measurements are not very suitable to collect data on the variability of treatment
efficacy in full scale systems, because they are too laborious and have too much inherent
variability. Also, many pathogens may not be detectable in source water when there is no
constant fecal source. This is especially true for waters in natural areas or waters affected by
smaller sewage systems or few individual treatment systems, (e.g., septic tanks.) To a lesser
extend, this is also true for all current microbial parameters as the sampling frequency is still
low (usually once a week, sometimes once a day) and covers only a small proportion of the
time treatment processes are in operation. Non-microbial surrogates that can be monitored
on-line are used for process control. Water suppliers usually have multi-year data of process
or water quality parameters such as turbidity, disinfectant residuals, coagulant dose etc.

Several process parameters can be used to assess the efficacy (and its variation) of full scale
filtration systems in (near) real time. Examples are counting of small-size particles and
turbidity. Nieminski & Ongerth [1995] evaluated the removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts
(and Giardia cysts) at pilot and full-scale conventional (and direct) filtration plants. Dual-
media filters with anthracite and sand were used. Cryptosporidium oocysts were effectively
removed when the plants produced filtered water of low turbidity (0.1 - 0.2 NTU). Under
optimal coagulation conditions, the average removal of Cryptosporidium was 2.3 logs. A
correlation was found between removal of Cryptosporidium and particle (4–7 µm) removal
(R2 =0.79) and removal of turbidity (R2=0.64).




                                              48
Gale & Stanfield [2000] have used the data on particle removal from 67 different
conventional treatment plants to determine the variability of Cryptosporidium removal. This
is not the same as the variation of one conventional treatment plant over time, but can serve
as a first estimate of the variance in treatment performance.
LeChevallier & Au [2004] discuss an important limitation of turbidity and particle counts.
They refer to McTigue et al. (1998), who used pilot filtration plant experiments and the level
of Cryptosporidium in feed water was varied from 26 to 4610 oocysts/l. Monitoring of the
plant effluent showed a consistent removal of approximately 4 logs. Turbidity and particle
count data, which were limited because of relatively low levels in source water, showed an
apparent removal of 1.0–1.6 logs (Table 7). Hence, removal of oocysts is considerably better
than indicated by the surrogates. The value of particle or turbidity removal by filtration

McTigue et al. [1998]).

to describe the log-removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts by conventional filtration processes
is therefore limited.
Turbidity and particle counts have more value in assessing on-line monitoring process
performance and can indicate changes in the removal of particles (and hence micro-
organisms) due to changes in feed water or operations. In the UKWIR study [200?] and in
Edwards [2000] several examples of the value of particles are given: to identify poor
performance of individual filters or the slow decrease of the performance of a filter over
time, to monitor the performance increase during filter-to-waste or slow-start of filters after
backwashing, to determine the performance decrease towards the end of the filter-run and to
identify the effect of flow surges. Employing particle counts to monitor the removal of
pathogens by ultrafiltration in drinking water practice at Heemskerk, the Netherlands
[Willemsen-Zwaagstra et al., 1997], particle removal with newly installed membranes
indicated 5log removal. After months of operation, the particle counts after the UF gradually
increased, which was attributed to loss of integrity of individual membrane filter units. After
replacement of these units, the particle removal was 5 logs again [Kruithof et al., 2001].
Hence, turbidity and particle counts are very useful in monitoring filtration systems on-line
to detect breakthrough of particles through filtration as early as possible. They are therefore a
valuable tool for the treatment operator to optimise and maintain filtration performance, and
to indicate when corrective actions are required because filtration performance is
compromised.




                                              49
Use of treatment models
Several treatment models have been used; Haas et al. [2000] produced a model for removal
of Cryptosporidium by coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation, using coagulant
concentration, polymer concentration and process pH to describe the factors which log
removal of oocysts was dependent upon. The model had an excellent fit to the data (R2 of
0.94), although incorporation of more data-sets reduced the fit. Disinfection efficacy has
been modelled by several models, all using disinfectant concentration and contact time to
describe inactivation efficacy. The disinfection models are simple first-order kinetics
(N/N0=e-kCt)1 Chick’s model) or have more parameters to improve the fit on disinfection data
[Chick-Watson: N/N0=e-kCnt). For ozone disinfection of Cryptosporidium, Finch et al. [1993]
used the Hom model (N/N0=e-kCntm).
Teunis et al., [1999] and Havelaar et al., [2000] have used the Hom model from Finch et al.
in combination with an ozone demand and decay model and a contact time distribution
model (inverse Gaussian) to calculate the inactivation of Cryptosporidium oocysts, assuming
a constant ozone dose.
In the monograph on micro-organism removal by water treatment, LeChevallier & Au
[2004] describe the use a model for removal of particles by filtration to describe
Cryptosporidium removal. The model uses a combination of transport of particles from the
suspension to the filter grains and the attachment of particles to the filter grains. The
probability that a particle touches a filter grain is governed by intervention, sedimentation
and diffusion and the probability that this particle attaches to the grain is governed by
physicochemical (electrostatic) processes. The model appeared to predict removal
efficiencies of Cryptosporidium oocysts by gravity filters in the same order of magnitude as
experimental data [LeChevallier & Au, 2004].

Use of failure reports
Water suppliers may also have failure/incident reports that can be used to determine
frequency, magnitude and impact of treatment failures. These data and reports can be used to
determine the removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts, both the average removal and the
variation over time. Westrell et al. [2003] describe the use of failure reports in treatment (and
distribution, see 4.3.1) to estimate the health risk for the consumers. The type of treatment
failure and its duration were documented in the failure reports. For the water supply of the
city of Gothenburg, they identified an annual failure frequency in filter operation of 15 times
with an average duration of 5 hours, chlorination failure frequency was once every two years
for 0.4 hours and coagulation failure frequency of 1.5 times per year for 0.6 hours. They
estimated the impact of these failures on the concentration of pathogens in treated water and
the resulting exposure of the consumers (Figure 8). In this system, they estimated that the

empirical constants, C= dissinfectant concentration; t = contact time




                                              50
nominal operation of the treatment resulted in a higher annual probability of infection than
the infrequent and relatively short failures.




Figure 8. Median (with 95% error bars) annual infections per 250,000 inhabitants resulting
from normal operation, failures in treatment and in distribution in the water supply system of
Gothenburg (from Westrell et al., 2003).


Synergism between processes
Synergism (two processes produce more than the sum of the single processes) between
processes has been described for disinfection processes [Oppenheimer et al., 2000; Driedger
et al., 2000; Biswas et al, 2003]. However, Cryptosporidium is extremely resistant to
chlorine and chloramines and even in combination the inactivation of Cryptosporidium under
drinking water treatment conditions is limited. The combination of ozone and chlorine
dioxide and ozone and chlorine have also been shown to be synergistic, the latter only at low
pH (around 6.0).
An important observation from the data on removal of Clostridium spores by a chain of
treatment processes is that the level of variation in the efficiency of the overall treatment is
not as large as would be expected from the adding the removal data from the individual
processes (Table 8). This indicates that the variation in one treatment step counteracts the
variation from the previous treatment step.

steps. Note that the variation (coefficient) of overall treatment is smaller than the variation
of the individual treatment steps

This means that multiple barriers in treatment not only increase the overall removal capacity,
but also reduce the variation in the overall treatment efficiency and thus the risk of
breakthrough of pathogens to drinking water. This interaction should be incorporated in the
description of treatment efficiency, using statistical methods. There is a specific WHO
document in preparation that describes the effect of treatment fluctuation and the interaction
between different treatment processes on microbial removal.


4.3.3    Post-treatment contamination
Post-treatment contamination is a significant hazard. When the water in the distribution
system or in storage containers is contaminated, no barriers are in place to prevent ingestion
of infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts. Post-treatment contamination may occur through
infiltration of contaminants in the distribution system through leaks (during surges), in open
distribution reservoirs or other open connections and during construction and repair. Cross-
connections and back-siphonage may draw water from toilets or sewers into the network.
Storage tanks used in houses (i.e. in standpipe systems) may also become contaminated.
Several outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been caused by post-treatment contamination
[Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004].
Once introduced into the distribution network, Cryptosporidium may settle in the sediment
or biofilm in the network. Settled oocyst may survive for prolonged periods in the sediment
or biofilm, although no information is available about the residual infectivity of oocysts in
biofilms. Settled oocysts may be resuspended in the water phase during high water flow.
After the initial findings of Cryptosporidium-like particles in the distribution network of
Sydney, the network was flushed to remove the contamination, but the number of oocysts
found in samples after flushing was higher than before flushing. It was suggested that this
was due to oocysts that were present in the sediment [McClellan, 1998]. Information about
the presence and infectivity of Cryptosporidium oocysts in distribution system sediments is
lacking.

Except for the reported outbreaks, no data are available about the presence of
Cryptosporidium in distributed water. An indirect assessment of the frequency and
magnitude of faecal contamination of distributed water can be done with the data from the
monitoring programs for E. coli. Water suppliers have many years of data on E. coli samples
from the distribution network available from statutory monitoring programs. In addition,
water suppliers have incident reports, describing the occurrence of contamination incidents
and the response to these incidents. Both types of information are generally the only site-
specific information available and can be used to estimate the frequency of faecal




                                             52
contamination and give an idea of the magnitude of these contaminations. In studies in the
UK and the Netherlands, overall 0 – 0.2% of the samples in the distribution network were
positive for E. coli, although some individual distribution networks could have higher
percentages of samples in which thermotolerant coliforms were detected [van der Kooij et
al., 2003; Lieverloo et al., 2006]. Westrell et al. [2003] collected distribution incident reports
from the water supply of Gothenburg over a 20 year period and used either the flow ratio of
sewage vs. drinking water during cross connections with pressurised sewerage systems or the
coliform data during contamination incidents of unknown origin in reservoirs or the
periphery of the network. The coliform data in water were compared to those in sewage to
calculate the degree of contamination and translated these to Cryptosporidium
concentrations. The calculated risk of infection was < 10-5 per person per year (pppy), and
was considerably lower than the 10-3 pppy that they calculated from normal treated water
(figure 4.5). Lieverloo et al. [2006] also investigated incident reports of water companies.
Eight water suppliers in the Netherlands reported 9 faecal incidents (repeated detection of E.
coli in distributed water) over a period of 5 years, although this was considered to be a lower
estimate as not all incidents were documented. Data on the duration and magnitude of these
incidents were collected. Under the (worst case) assumption that the incidents were due to
contamination with fresh sewage, they used the concentration of thermotolerant coliforms
during the incidents and the average concentration in sewage to calculate the contamination
level. Using concentration data of Cryptosporidium in sewage, they estimated the
concentration of Cryptosporidium in tap water during these incidents. They calculated a risk
of infection due to Cryptosporidium of up to 10-5 pppy during incidents.
These assessments should be regarded as a rough approximation. Monitoring is infrequent
and the probability that contamination events are missed is high. Water transport patterns in
larger distribution systems are complex and variable, so it is not easy to deduce a
contamination level from infrequent grab samples.
A faecal contamination event that has led to the presence of E. coli in distributed water may
have come from various sources, where Cryptosporidium may have or may not have been
present. If the assumption is made that the origin of the faecal contamination is the ingress of
fresh domestic wastewater, the available literature data on Cryptosporidium concentrations
in sewerage can be used to make a rough worst case estimate of the concentration of
Cryptosporidium in the contaminated drinking water.
In a theoretical exercise, Pouillot et al., [2004] calculated the probability of infection from
different concentrations of Cryptosporidium in a distribution reservoir. The concentration of
Cryptosporidium in reservoir water was considered to be Poisson distributed (random) and
combined the concentration data with the data from a French water consumption survey
[Beaudeau et al., 2003] to calculate the probability of infection. The relation they found
between Cryptosporidium concentration and probability of infection (with confidence range)
is plotted in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Probability of infection associated with Cryptosporidium concentrations in tap
water (adapted from Pouillot et al., 2004).

Obvious source of uncertainty is the assumption that the source of contamination is domestic
wastewater and the presence and concentration of Cryptosporidium in domestic wastewater,
which would depend on the size of the population served by the collection system. Other
sources may have been responsible for the contamination. Wildlife sources will yield a lower
probability of contamination with Cryptosporidium, given the low prevalence that is reported
in wildlife and the absence of genotypes that can cause illness in humans (see Chapter 2). If
the source is fresh calf manure, the probability of Cryptosporidium presence and the
expected concentration of oocysts in the contaminated water are higher than with domestic
wastewater (see Chapter 2).
If the distributed water is chlorinated, E. coli could be less suitable for translation to
Cryptosporidium occurrence, because E.coli is much more sensitive to chlorine than
Cryptosporidium.

Overall, the information to incorporate contamination of water in the distribution in QMRA
is limited. The approach used by Westrell et al. [2003] and van Lieverloo et al. [2006] can be
used as a first assessment, but the main uncertainty is the concentration of pathogens in
distributed water during incidents.

A recent case control study on sporadic cryptosporidiosis in the UK reported an association
between gastro-intestinal illness and the loss of water pressure in the distribution network
[Hunter et al., 2005]. Twenty eight of 423 controls reported diarrhoea in the two weeks
before the questionnaire. Analysis of the risk factors showed a strong association with the
loss of water pressure at the household tap. Most of these pressure-losses were associated
with reported events in the distribution network, such as a burst of water mains. They




                                                                               54
suggest that failures in the distribution network could have a significant contribution (around
15%) to the overall rate of gastro-enteritis in the population.


4.4      CONSUMPTION OF DRINKING WATER
The other component of exposure assessment is the volume of water consumed by the
population. Not only the average volume of water consumed is important, also the person-to-
person variation in consumption behaviour and especially consumption behaviour of risk
groups (in terms of sensitivity to infection or high level of consumption) is relevant.
When assessing the consumption of drinking water, only tap water that receives no
additional (heat) treatment that will inactivate or remove Cryptosporidium should be
considered. Heat treatment (i.e. for coffee, tea or cooking) at temperatures of 60°C and
higher rapidly inactivates oocysts [Harp et al., 1996]. After 15s at 72°C, no infectivity could
be observed in 177 doses of 105 oocysts in neonatal mice, which (given the ID50 of oocysts in
neonatal mice) may be considered equivalent to > 5 log reduction. Also other means of
point-of-use treatment eliminate oocysts. Membrane (micro- or ultra-) filtration units can be
absolute barriers against oocysts [Jacangelo et al., 1995]. Exposure of tap water to UV or
sunlight inactivates oocysts. A significant inactivation occurs at low UV-doses (>3 logs at 19
mJ/cm2; Bukhari et al., 1999].
In addition to drinking, tap water (or in containers in the case of non-piped supplies) is used
for other purposes (ice, beverage and food preparation, personal hygiene, laundry etc.) that
result in ingestion of drinking water.

Data on the volume of tap water consumed are available for several high-income countries.
In previous risk-assessment studies consumption data from several studies were used. In the
first risk assessments, an average consumption of 2 litres/day was used [Regli et al., 1991].
Roseberry & Burmaster (1992] performed a survey of drinking water consumption in the
USA. This is, however, the consumption of both untreated and boiled or heated drinking
water. The survey did provide data on the variation of tap water consumption within a US
population. These data were used in several risk assessment studies [Medema et al., 1995;
Haas et al., 1999; Haas & Eisenberg, 2001; Westrell et al., 2003]. In Canada, similar tap
water consumption is reported [Haas et al., 1999].
Teunis et al., [1997, 1999] used consumption data from a food intake population survey in
the Netherlands, the median intake of unboiled tap water was 0.152 litres per day, much
lower than the intake data of total tap water intake from North America.

The survey of Roseberry and Burmaster also provided age-specific distributions of tap water
consumption, with a tendency towards increased consumption with age; the elderly tend to
consume more tap water. A survey by Ershow et al. [1991] indicated that in the proportion of
persons consuming > 2 litres of tap water was relatively high in pregnant women (15%). The
elderly and pregnant women are sensitive groups with an increased risk of severity of gastro-
intestinal illness and mortality due to several waterborne pathogens [Haas et al., 1999].




                                             55
There are however no specific data that suggest that these groups are also at risk of more
severe cryptosporidiosis.

Studies from other areas are available but have not been used in risk assessment studies. The
information on consumption of tap water is collected in different types of studies, such as in
epidemiological studies of waterborne outbreaks; in general food intake surveys and in
specific tap water intake studies. Different study designs are used. The impact of study
design on the outcome is currently reviewed [Mons et al. 2007]. They re-analysed the data
from several consumption studies and recommended the use of country-specific data where
available. If no country-specific data are available, they suggested to use the relatively
conservative (high consumption) dataset that was collected by Robertson et al. [2000] in
Australia (Error! Reference source not found.), in risk assessment studies.

Effect assessment: dose-response
relation



5.1      HOST CHARACTERIZATION

The probability that exposure to micro-organisms will result in infection or illness depends
on both properties of the host and of the pathogens. Different strains of the organisms may
differ in their ability to infect or cause illness, by their genetic make-up, but there may also
be effects of the environment (time since they were excreted from the previous host,
susceptibility to adverse stimuli, see chapter 4 on pathogen characterization). Different
human hosts may also differ in their susceptibility to the pathogens, because they are
(genetically) predisposed, or because of previous experience (acquired resistance), or
dependent on the specific circumstances of exposure, for instance the vehicle (water or some
buffered suspension) or behaviour (recreational exposure, associated with
immunosuppressive UV levels). Ultimately, health effects result from the interaction
between pathogen and host, and it is the combination of pathogen and host factors that
determines the actual risk.
Age is usually considered an important factor in the susceptibility to pathogenic micro-
organisms. In humans, cryptosporidiosis is prevalent among small children [Wiedermann et




                                              57
al. 1985]. While there may also be an association with unhygienic behaviour (causing
increased exposure), the immature status of the intestinal tract, as well as mucosal immunity,
may be mainly responsible for this increased susceptibility.
Human feeding studies have shown that adults are susceptible as well [DuPont et al. 1995,
Okhuysen et al. 1998, 1999, Chappell et al. 1996, 1999]. While there is as yet no information
on potential heterogeneity in innate susceptibility among humans, a protective effect
associated with an immune response has been demonstrated [Chappell et al. 1999]. Other
evidence for such an association comes from cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised
subjects, where illness is much more persistent and severe than in normal immunocompetent
subjects. This is especially the case in HIV patients or patients receiving cancer
chemotherapy who have low CD4 T-cell concentrations. In these patients, chronic
cryptosporidiosis is reversed when CD4 counts can be elevated.


5.2      HEALTH EFFECTS
Most reports on cryptosporidiosis are based on outbreaks, travellers’ diarrhoea, and
Cryptosporidium-infected HIV-patients. The incubation period for illness symptoms is
approximately 7 days (range 1-14 days) and illness is usually self-limiting, with a mean
duration of 6-9 days [Dupont et al., 1995; Palmer & Biffin, 1990], although longer times
(mean duration 19-22 days, maximum up to 100-120 days) were reported in a recent survey
in Australia [Robertson et al., 2002]. Relapses are common; reports indicate 1-5 additional
episodes in 40-70 percent of patients [Hunter et al., 2004]. Predominant symptom is
diarrhoea, watery, sometimes mucous but rarely bloody, sometimes profuse (1-2 l/day in a
small minority of cases, usually very young or old). Pathogenesis is associated with
tissue/cell damage of the intestinal epithelium. The infection of Cryptosporidium into
enterocytes may lead to an increase of membrane permeability, changes in the ion flux and
apoptosis. These effects are associated with the secretory diaarhoea. The precise pathogenic
mechanisms are not well understood [Chappell et al., 2003; Percival et al., 2004]. Other
symptoms include nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, fever.
Shedding of oocysts may continue after the cessation of the disease symptoms.
Immunocompetent individuals clear the infection and Cryptosporidium-associated mortality
is rare among the immunocompetent population. Outbreak data indicate a mortality rate
lower than 1:100,000 [Hoxie et al. 1997]. In immunocompromised patients with severely
depressed immune responses, especially AIDS patients with CD4 counts below 50
cells/mm3, infection results in illness in almost every case, and diarrhoea usually is chronic
and may be fulminant, leading to rapid death. Clifford et al [1990] found that
cryptosporidiosis affected 10-15% of the AIDS patients, causing death in 50% of the cases.
The introduction of antiretroviral therapy has largely reduced the impact of cryptosporidiosis
on HIV-infected individuals.
In normal otherwise healthy subjects, infection is thought to be limited to the ileum. In
severely immunocompromised patients, infection may spread throughout the intestinal tract,




                                             58
to the colon as well as the proximal parts of the gut (the gastric mucosa, and oesophagus).
Respiratory infection and even sinusitis have been reported in such patients as well.
Even though the infection appears to be restricted to the ileum in immunocompetent persons,
the occurrence of non-intestinal sequelae (joint and eye pain, recurrent headache, dizzy spells
and fatigue has been reported for infection with C. hominis, but not for infection with C.
parvum [Hunter et al., 2004].
The human feeding studies with Cryptosporidium showed a clear distinction between
infection and illness. Infection and colonization of the pathogens within the intestinal tract,
can occur without any symptoms of gastro-enteritis. This is consistent with the view of
infection as a necessary, but not sufficient cause for illness. The occurrence of infection
among exposed subjects could be controlled by factors different from those influencing the
occurrence of illness among infected subjects. Available data indicate that in
immunocompromised patients the probability of illness among those infected with
Cryptosporidium may be near 1, whereas in immunocompetent subjects this probability may
be much lower (around 0.4 in feeding studies, for instance). This does not mean that
susceptibility to infection is also much higher in immunocompromised subjects.
The seroprevalence of antibodies to Cryptosporidium is high, from 25-35% in developed
countries to 60% in regions with poor hygiene. This does not necessarily imply that infection
rates for Cryptosporidium must be high. If the decay rate of antibody levels is slow, any
seropositive subject may have encountered their infection a long time earlier in life.


5.3      DOSE RESPONSE ANALYSIS

5.3.1    Human feeding studies
A series of human feeding studies was done at the University of Texas [Chappel et al.,
2003]. Before enrolment, volunteers were screened for the presence of antibodies to
Cryptosporidium. Each volunteer then underwent a complete physical examination to find
any illnesses or immunodeficiencies. Subjects who were in contact with subpopulations at
risk (very young, very old, immunodeficient) were excluded. After eight hours of fasting,
each volunteer received a single dose of oocysts in a gelatine capsule. Subjects were
monitored intensively for 14 days after challenge (daily physical examinations, collection of
all stools) and less intensively for the following 4 weeks (three visits a week).
Inocula were prepared from three different sources, all propagated in neonatal calves
(meaning that they were genotype 2 or C. parvum oocysts). The Iowa and UCP isolates were
obtained from naturally infected calves; the source of the TAMU isolate was an infected foal
[details in Okhuysen et al. 1999]. The Moredun isolate was from cervine origin [Okhuysen et
al. 2002]. After amplification in calves, fecal preparations were purified and stored in
potassium dichromate buffer on ice. Before challenge, the preparations were safety tested for
the presence of any other pathogens and resuspended in PBS. The oocyst concentration in
this suspension was carefully adjusted, and checked by direct counting (haemocytometer, at
least 6 replicate counts). Viability of oocysts in the inocula was ascertained by excystation




                                             59
(80% or higher) and infectivity in neonatal mice. Oocysts were used within 6 weeks of their
production in the calfs.
Infection has been defined as either detection of oocysts in the faeces 36 hours or later after
challenge, or the presence of clinical cryptosporidiosis. Detection of faecal antigen (DFA) is
not sensitive, and there may be false negative results. Subjects who did not excrete oocysts in
detectable amounts but clearly displayed symptoms characteristic for cryptosporidiosis were
therefore scored as infected. This has been called the clinical definition of infection.
The Iowa, UCP, TAMU, and Moredun isolates were tested in human volunteers who did not
have pre-existing anti-Cryptosporidium IgG antibodies. Widely different ID50s (estimated
dose to infect 50% of the exposed population) were found, indicating considerable
differences in infectivity among these isolates. Pathogenicities (attack rates of acute gastro-
enteritis) also appeared to vary among isolates. All four isolates were capable of causing
illness in healthy, immunocompetent human subjects. Incubation periods and durations of
illness periods were similar for these isolates.
Nineteen of the 29 volunteers who had been challenged with the Iowa isolate were available
to undergo rechallenge, with a single dose of 500 oocysts. Of these 19, infection was
observed in 15 in the first challenge and no infection was observed in 4. The rechallenge did
result in the same probability of occurrence of diarrhoea symptoms as the first challenge,
indicating limited protective immunity against infection and illness. The number of oocysts
shed by infected volunteers was lower than in the first challenge, resulting in alower risk of
secondary transmission. However, when the same Iowa isolate was tested in a different
group of volunteers with or without a pre-existing serum IgG to C. parvum, the ID50 was 14-
20 fold higher in the volunteers with pre-existing IgG and illness was significantly associated
with the highest doses.
To obtain a dose-response relation, the obtained data on infection were analyzed as a binary
(yes/no) response with the single hit model for microbial infection [Teunis & Havelaar,
2000].

5.3.2    Hit theory for infection
The conceptual basis for the infection model is the observation that exposure and infection
are conditional events. At physiologically meaningful concentrations, exposure to pathogenic
micro-organisms usually implies that only a small, discrete number of particles is present, as
opposed to toxic substances. A lethal dose of botulinum toxin A, one of the strongest toxins
known to man still contains several hundreds of millions of molecules of the toxin. In
contrast the ID50 of many infectious pathogens is a few hundred particles, and sometimes
much lower. Therefore exposure to a low dose may be associated with a considerable
probability that not a single organism has been ingested, in which case infection is not
possible. For infection to occur, one or more oocysts must have been ingested, one or more
of these ingested pathogens must have survived to reach a site suitable for growth, and,
having reached this site, the sporozoites must still have been in a condition to infect host
cells and complete the life cycle. When the ingested dose consists of only few pathogens,
and/or the probability that they survive their journey through the digestive tract is low, the




                                             60
success of infection may depend on a small number of organisms. The particulate nature of
the inoculum is a property that is unique to microbial pathogens, and has a profound
influence on the dose response relation, especially at low doses.
As most detection assays in microbiology are destructive, numbers of micro-organisms in a
sample can usually only be estimated as an expected number. The dose, the ingested number
of organisms, is treated as a Poisson sample with the estimated (or target) dose as parameter.
Different doses are obtained by dilution, thereby adjusting the dose estimate by the applied
dilution factor. Given a certain expected dose D the probability of exposure, i.e. the
probability of ingesting 1 or more organisms is
                                      Prexp (D) = 1− e -D
Any ingested organism encounters many different barriers to infection: host defences,
several in each compartment of the human intestinal tract, some part of the intestinal immune
system, others mechanical (peristalsis, diarrhoea) or chemical (low pH, bile, pancreatic
juices,…) in nature. Only organisms that succeed in passing all the barriers without damage
can attach to a suitable site on the intestinal epithelium and initiate infection. Noting that
(usually) a single surviving pathogen can grow and start a colonizing population leads to the
single hit model: survival of 1 or more organisms after passing all host barriers is a necessary
and sufficient condition for infection. For Cryptosporidium oocysts the gut is a big place, and
we may assume that survival is an independent process: survival of one oocyst does not
depend on the numbers present (i.e. the dose). If we call pm the probability of survival for
any individual ingested oocyst then the probability of infection is
                                 Prinf ( D | p m ) = 1 − e - pm D
the dose response parameter pm acts as a scale factor for the dose. This is the well known
exponential dose response relation, the basic equation of all hit theory models. Unfortunately
this model is too simple. In particular, the assumption that the host-pathogen interaction can
be characterized by a single fixed factor pm is unrealistic: both pathogen and host properties
are variable. The infectivity of the individual oocysts in an inoculum is not constant, due to
slight differences in conditions prior to ingestion, genetic variation, ageing. Nor is the
susceptibility to infection the same in any host, even from a seemingly homogeneous
population like that used in clinical studies. Therefore, most commonly the parameter pm is
given a Beta distribution, to represent heterogeneity in the host-pathogen interaction. The
resulting dose response relation
                                                                               −α
                                                                      D
                Prinf ( D | α , β ) = 1−1 F1 (α , α + β ,− D) ≈ 1 − 1 + 
                                                                      β
is known as the Beta-Poisson model for microbial infection. The latter, simplified form is
most frequently used, it should be noted that this equation is only correct for certain
parameter values ( α << β , β >> 1 ). In many practical cases this approximate relation may
be used, however it should be noted that while the best fitting curve may comply with these
parameter constraints, use of the approximate relation still produces incorrect uncertainty
estimates leading to gross overestimation of the extrapolated risk at low doses [Teunis &




                                               61
Havelaar, 2000]. In some cases both α and β appear to be very small: that is a special case,
where the Beta distribution, describing heterogeneity in host-pathogen interaction, is
bimodal, with part of the cases having a very high risk of infection, and others a very low
risk. In other words: part of the host-pathogen encounters is associated with a very high risk,
and the remainder has a very low risk, virtually zero. This is an interesting phenomenon,
which we may interpret as partial immunity: a fraction of the population appears protected
against infection (and unprotected subjects may be at high risk). The corresponding dose
response relation looks different: a steep rise at low doses, and saturation at an infection
probability below 1. Interestingly, this is observed in the dose response relations of some
isolates (Figure 11).

                   Box: Heterogeneity in microbial dose response models
  In the absence of any heterogeneity the shape of the dose response relation depends
  only on exposure (the ‘Poisson’ part). For a Poisson inoculum this produces an
  exponential dose response relation. Any heterogeneity added, for instance by assuming
  variation in infectivity parameter pm or overdispersed inoculum (e.g. aggregation)
  produces a less steep dose response relation. The exponential relation is the steepest
  model in the hit theory family of functions. For example, if we take notice of the fact
  that any oocyst of Cryptosporidium contains 4 sporozoites, and these do not necessarily
  all have identical infectivities, this merely adds heterogeneity to the infectivity of a
  single particle (the oocyst): 1 oocyst might contain 0,1,2,3, or 4 viable sporozoites. Such
  heterogeneity is adequately modelled by using the Beta-Poisson relation.

  One comment needs to be made: if action of the infectious particles is not independent
  (as assumed in the single hit model), for instance if there is cooperation (a dose twice as
  high leads to a more than twofold increase in infectivity) the dose response relation is
  steeper. In the absence of heterogeneity an elegant demonstration of cooperative effects
  (like quorum sensing) might be found in testing whether the observed dose response
  relation is steeper than the exponential model. Unfortunately, in the real world
  heterogeneity is always present and we cannot discriminate cooperative interaction from
  heterogeneity: one tends to make the relation steeper, the other less steep. Any effect of
  cooperation might be countered by a certain amount of heterogeneity producing a
  relation with arbitrary slope. In statistics this is called ‘unidentifiability’.



5.3.3    Pathogen factors: variation in infectivity among isolates
Data from each of the four isolates (Iowa, TAMU, UCP and Moredun) can be used for fitting
dose response models. This produces four relations, with considerable differences in shape
and location, see Figure 11, which begs the question how to use this information to make
predictions of the infection risk for an unknown environmental isolate, as required in
microbial risk assessment. Any of the individual dose response relations provides




                                              62
information about the variation in infectivity of that particular isolate, but we would like to
characterize the variation among these isolates in such a way that we can extrapolate to any
type 2 oocyst sample.




The proper approach here is to analyze these different dose response data with a two-level
model, the lower hierarchical level representing variation in single isolates, and the upper
level representing variation among isolates. The Beta-Poisson dose response model is used,
as in the simple one-level case, but now the parameters (α , β ) are assumed to be taken from
(joint) distributions, describing the ‘between isolates’ variation. This allows us to generalize
the heterogeneous infectivity to the ‘group’ level for isolates of type 2, treating the four data
sets as an n=4 sample from the presumed population of environmental type 2 oocysts.
Instead of a single parameter set we now have to deal with a distribution, which may be
interpreted as the frequency distribution for dose response relations from type 2 oocysts.
Sampling from this type 2 ‘group’ distribution produces a predictive dose response relation
(Figure 11B), which is suitable for use in quantitative risk assessment.

The graph in Figure 11B suggests that the predicted distribution of dose response relations
appears to cover a wide range of infectivities. This may be put into perspective by looking at

the range of predicted infectivities extrapolated to the low doses that may often be prevalent
in drinking water sources. The graph in Figure 12A emphasizes once again that at low doses
the exposure part of dose response relations becomes dominant: overall uncertainty in the
predicted infectivity may be about 10-fold, not higher. We can also interpret the dose
response parameters as describing the distribution of pm, the infectivity of a single particle
(oocyst). Figure 12B shows a graph of the predicted distribution of the expected value of pm,
or the mean of its (Beta) distribution.

5.3.4     Host factors: immunity and susceptibility to infection
The high seroprevalence of anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies indicates that exposure to
Cryptosporidium oocysts happens to most people at least once. In the challenge studies not
all exposed subjects became infected or ill which raises the question whether there could
exist some protective response resulting from infection (or illness). Interestingly, a
rechallenge study with the Iowa isolate seems to indicate that if there is such a protective
response, its duration is shorter than 12 months. On the other hand, when the same isolate
was given to a study population of human subjects selected for high anti-Cryptosporidium
IgG levels, with the same Iowa isolate, there was clear evidence of decreased infectivity
compared to the prior study using seronegative volunteers [Chappell et al. 1999]. High IgG




                                                            64
levels could indicate a recent episode of cryptosporidiosis (or infection by Cryptosporidium),
and may thus be associated with a protective response.

If we could describe the relation between IgG levels and susceptibility to infection in a
quantitative relation this could be useful for quantitative risk assessment. Serum IgG
concentrations can be measured in the general population, and if we could use individual IgG
levels as a proxy for susceptibility we may at least partly control host variation in the general
population.

In hit theory model for microbial infection the interaction between host and pathogen is
contained in the parameter pm. If we want to incorporate a covariable like IgG level into the
model, this parameter can be made dependent on that covariable. Since pm is a probability a
logistic model lies at hand, so that ultimately we have a logistic relation nested into the
exponential dose response model [Teunis et al. 2000].

When data from the two studies with the Iowa isolate are combined we have a data on
infection in subjects with a wide range of (baseline) IgG levels, as shown in Figure 13A.
Fitting the IgG-dependent dose response model results in a function for the infectivity
parameter pm which shows clearly that there is a protective effect associated with high levels
of baseline (pre-challenge) IgG. When such a model is applied to the data obtained in
subjects with high pre-existing IgG levels, there is a clear indication of decreasing infectivity
with increasing IgG levels (Figure 13B). Figure 13C shows the dose response relation, which
is now a function of two variables, dose and baseline IgG level.

a function of dose. B. Conditional probability of illness at a dose of 103 oocysts as a function

Just like infection is conditional on exposure, illness is conditional on infection: when there
is not a colonizing, metabolizing population of pathogens a host cannot become ill. During
infection, parts of the intestinal tract contain many living pathogens. By considering the
duration of infection as reflecting the balance between the colonization potential of the
pathogens and the potential of the host for clearing the infection, a dose response model for
illness in an infected host can be formulated [Teunis et al. 1999].

Since we have data on illness as a function of both dose and baseline IgG (again for the Iowa
isolate), this model can also be made dependent on baseline IgG levels, like the infection
model. Figure 14 shows some results, note that both dose and IgG-dependence are rather
weak [Teunis et al. 1999]. Therefore alternatively, any infected subject may be assumed to
have a fixed probability of becoming ill. This probability appears to be high, at least in these
clinical studies, with healthy immunocompetent volunteers. For the Iowa isolate, the average
probability of illness given infection was 0.65 (13/20) in low IgG subjects and 0.83 (10/12)
in high IgG subjects. With the two other isolates, TAMU and UCP, no asymptomatic
infections could be detected, so the probability of illness given infection is 1.0 for these
isolates.

Risk characterisation




6.1      GENERAL APPROACH
Risk characterisation is the combination of the information about the probability of exposure
to Cryptosporidium and the health effect of this exposure. Several authors have described the
approach to this combination of exposure assessment and effect assessment in water supply
[Regli et al., 1991; Medema et al., 1995; Haas et al., 1996; Gale, 1996; Teunis et al., 1997;
Teunis & Havelaar, 1999; Haas et al., 1999; Gale & Stanfield, 2000; Gale, 2002]. The
information that is collected on the concentration of Cryptosporidium in drinking water,
either by the direct method (Par. 4.2) or the indirect method (Par. 4.3), is combined with the
consumption data to determine the probability that a consumer ingests one or more
Cryptosporidium oocysts in a certain period. To determine the health risk associated to this
exposure level, the exposure data are combined with the dose-response data (Chapter 5).
This yields a probability of infection. This can be translated into a risk of illness and even
risk of death if morbidity and mortality data are available (Figure 15). The probability of
illness, the probability of death and the severity of the illness can be combined into “burden
of disease”-measure, such as the Disability Adjusted Life-Years [Havelaar & Melse, 2003],
so the health risk of Cryptosporidium through drinking water can be compared to other
transmission routes, other pathogens or even other types of health risk in the society.

6.2 RISK ASSESSMENT OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN DRINKING
WATER

The first quantitative microbial risk assessment studies on drinking water were conducted on
viruses and Giardia [Regli et al., 1991]. When the dose-response data from the first human
volunteer study on Cryptosporidium [DuPont et al., 1995] became available, several authors
have performed QMRA for Cryptosporidium in water supply (Table 9).

The overview of QMRA-studies for Cryptosporidium in water supply illustrates several
issues:
1. QMRA studies were conducted to:
 • balance the health risk of Cryptosporidium in ozonated drinking water to the health risk
    of bromate formation by ozone [Havelaar et al., 2000]. For the assessment of exposure to
    Cryptosporidium, they used raw water monitoring data on Cryptosporidium, data on the
    removal of anaerobic spores by conventional treatment and an ozone disinfection model
    (the Hom model published by Finch et al., 1993) and a bromate formation model. The
    ingested dose of oocysts and bromate ions was translated to DALY’s to allow
    comparison of the microbiological and chemical health risk. In their scenario, the health
    benefits of micro-organism inactivation by ozonation outweighed the health losses by
    bromate formation.
 • demonstrate the need for additional treatment with UV [Aboytes et al., 2004]. They used
    monitoring data of Cryptosporidium in treated water, using a cell-culture-PCR technique
    to determine the concentration of infectious oocysts in treated water.

    et al., 2003]. Failure reports were collected from operational logs/interviews. These
    failures were translated into an estimate of Cryptosporidium (and other pathogen)
    occurrence (which was the most uncertain step in this QMRA). They indicated that in this
    system, the health risk associated with normal operation was higher than from the very
    infrequent and short lasting reported incidents.
•   to prioritise research needs [Gale, 2002], who illustrates how QMRA can be used to
    determine the relative significance of major, well-controlled and minor, less well-
    controlled routes of exposure and the impact of moments of reduced treatment
    performance.
•   To perform a cost-benefit analysis of Cryptosporidium regulation that requires additional
    drinking water treatment for systems with relatively high levels of Cryptosporidium in
    source water [EPA, 2005].

2. Exposure assessment is in many studies hampered by incomplete “site-specific” data. The
gaps in the site-specific data are filled by using data from the scientific literature. This is
particularly true for the studies in the 1990’s. As the use of QMRA progressed, more authors
have collected site-specific information about most if not all steps in the exposure
assessment.

3. Most studies used the dose-response data of the Iowa strain of C. parvum as published by
DuPont et al. [1995]. Over the years, the dose-response relationships of more C. parvum
strains have been published. One recent study on the risk of Cryptosporidium to fire fighters
using recycled water used the dose-response data of the TAMU strain of C. parvum as this
was the most infective strain [Deere & Davison, 2004]. In the current review, we present an
approach for the use of a C. parvum dose-response relation, which is a combination of the
dose-response data that are published for four different isolates of C. parvum (Iowa, TAMU,
UCP and Moredun; see chapter 5).

4. The most frequently used health outcome is the probability of infection; a few studies also
determined the probability of illness of the general population and the immunodeficient
population [Perz et al., 1997; Pouillot et al., 2002]. Two studies calculated the DALY
resulting from the waterborne transmission of Cryptosporidium [Teunis & Havelaar, 1997;
Havelaar et al., 2000].

5. Using the data of the Milwaukee outbreak, the calculated probability of infection/illness
with QMRA was compared to the observed probability of illness in the outbreak as observed
in the epidemiological investigations [Haas et al., 1999; Haas, 2000]. The authors conclude




                                               73
that the results of QMRA and epidemiological investigation are consistent. The analysis of
the exposure of the Milwaukee residents to Cryptosporidium via tap water was hampered by
the lack of timely measurements of Cryptosporidium in the contaminated water.
Unfortunately, this is the rule rather than the exception in waterborne outbreaks. The
concentration had to be inferred from oocyst concentrations found in samples of ice that was
prepared at the time of the water supply contamination and was corrected for the expected
loss of detectable oocysts after freezing/thawing. The exposure assessment was therefore not
very certain. In addition, the reported magnitude of the Milwaukee outbreak [MacKenzie et
al., 1994] has been criticised by Hunter & Syed [2001]. They claim that the background
prevalence of gastro-intestinal illness in the US is much higher (1.2 – 1.4 episodes per person
per year, or 0.10 – 0.12 per person per month) than the prevalence used by MacKenzie et al.
[2004] (0.005 per person per month). If the higher background prevalence were used, this
would drastically reduce the estimated size of the Milwaukee outbreak.

6. The set-up of the QMRA’s sometimes used point estimates, but more generally a
probabilistic approach is used to be able to estimate the level of uncertainty of the calculated
probability of infection or illness.

7. Between the different studies, the calculated probability of infection can differ
considerably (see table 10). Within studies, the uncertainty of the risk estimate towards the
higher health risk (illustrated by as the difference between the average or median risk and the
95% confidence limit) is limited to around a factor of 10.



6.3      TIERED APPROACH
Risk assessment is well-suited for a tiered approach and this is also commonly used in risk
assessment practice, both in human health risk assessment and in ecological risk assessment.
The tiered approach allows an effective interaction between risk assessment and risk
management, starting with a crude risk assessment, usually based on limited information to
determine the urgency of the perceived problem, to prioritise the risk of different water
supply sites or scenarios and to determine the need of a more detailed study for a particular
situation. This allows the effective allocation of resources to the sites or situations that give
rise to the highest risk. There is no strict definition of the tiers, only that the initial QMRA is
usually generic and simple and the specificity and complexity increase in subsequent tiers.
Examples of QMRA studies with different levels of specificity and complexity are given in
three cases studies.

The most basic (but also most important) QMRA is a screening level study. Starting with
whatever information is available, a crude first evaluation is made. Usually, the available
information is not specific to the system that is studied, but has to be extrapolated from the
available scientific literature. For a surface water treatment system, the information on
Cryptosporidium levels in source water can be derived from watershed use (see par. 4.3) and




                                               74
for the water treatment processes default log-credits for the removal or inactivation of
Cryptosporidium are also given in par. 4.3. So in its simplest form, a QMRA can be
performed with only a generic description of the water supply system. For instance, a water
supply system with a watershed that can be characterised as moderately polluted (according
to the criteria in par. 4.3) and with off stream storage reservoirs and a conventional
(coagulation/filtration/chlorination) water treatment system, has an expected concentration of
Cryptosporidium of 0.1 per litre in source water and 0.5 + 2.5 = 3.0 logs removal (see Table
5 and Table 6). Hence, the estimated concentration of Cryptosporidium in drinking water is
1.0 x 10-4 per litre. With a consumption of cold tap water of 0.78 litre per day (3.49 glasses
of 0.25 litre, par. 4.4) the average probability of exposure to Cryptosporidium is 8.7 x 10-5
per person per day. With the combined dose-response relation of the four C. parvum strains
the probability of infection is estimated at 3.8 x 10-5 per person per day, which amounts to
1.4 x10-2 (=1.4%) per person per year. An example of a practical application of such a
screening-level risk assessment is given in case study 1, where a large water supply company
uses the screening-level QMRA to prioritise risk management of their water supply systems.

The screening level assessment may show that the risks are negligible, without much
scientific doubt. In that case, the screening-level risk assessment can be used to demonstrate
the safety of the system. Setting up an more detailed study is not warranted. Or the
screening-level risk assessment may highlight that the risk is unacceptably high, again
without much scientific doubt. In Case Study 1, the screening-level risk assessment is used to
justify the installation of additional control measures. Such a screening-level risk assessment
is also very useful in comparing different scenarios for risk management, e.g. different water
treatment options.

If the outcome of the screening-level risk assessment is that there may be a health risk that is
not negligible, there is an incentive for a next iteration of the risk assessment, collecting site-
specific data, for instance on the presence of Cryptosporidium in the source water or
catchment. The QMRA is repeated with the new, site-specific information. The options for
the outcome of this second-level QMRA are the same as for the first iteration. In general, a
result of any risk assessment is the identification of which information is missing and the
prioritisation of research needs [Gale, 2002].

The screening-level risk assessments usually work with point estimates of risk. The tendency
is to use conservative or worst-case estimates, to “be on the safe side”. But worst-case
estimates, by nature, may overestimate the risk and it is not clear to the risk manager what
the uncertainty of the calculated risk is, only that the uncertainty will be towards the lower
risk values (the nature of a worst case assumption). More helpful for the risk manager is to
provide a range of risks (interval estimate) that denote the variability and uncertainty in the
risk estimate. In the case of the screening-level risk assessment this can be achieved by using
an average, worst and best case, to illustrate the range of the risk that can be deduced from
the available information and the level of certainty that is embedded in the QMRA. An
example of such a QMRA is given in Case Study 2.




                                               75
Interval estimates require information about the variability and uncertainty. Variability is the
result of intrinsic heterogeneity in the input of the risk assessment, such as the variation in
Cryptosporidium concentration in source water over time, or the variation in the removal of
particles by a filtration process over time. Variability can be characterised if sufficient data
points are collected. Uncertainty is the result of unknown errors in inputs of the risk
assessment, such as errors in the measurement of Cryptosporidium or the assumption that
certain indicator organisms can be used to describe the removal of Cryptosporidium by
filtration. Uncertainty can be characterised by specific research activities, e.g. to determine
the recovery efficiency of the Cryptosporidium enumeration method or to compare the
removal of Cryptosporidium to indicator organisms by filtration.
When sufficient data are available, a probabilistic risk assessment can be performed, where
the input is described by statistical distribution functions to describe the confidence interval
of the input itself and of the calculated risk. An example is given in Case Study 3.

and UK, Suez wanted to develop an approach to evaluate the risk of Cryptosporidium for
each water system. Such an approach would allow Suez to:
 • demonstrate compliance with the EU drinking water directive (which states that drinking
    water must be free of …parasites…, which in numbers…may constitute a potential
    danger to human health.);
 • know if any of these systems was at risk to Cryptosporidium;
 • prioritise investments (if needed).

Specific risk assessment goal
What is the risk of Cryptosporidium in the (>1700) water systems?

6.4.2    Hazard identification
The risk assessment was focussed on Cryptosporidium, because of the absence of specific
therapy against this microorganism, making it hazardous for immunocompromised
consumers, and because of its resistance to chemical disinfection. A questionnaire was sent
to the operators of each system, inquiring about the volume of water produced, the type of
source water used, including information on the type of environment (urban, rural, presence
of cattle etc.) and data on general water quality parameters (coliforms, turbidity, ammonium




                                              76
and nitrate), and about the type of treatment processes. The returned information covered
treatment facilities that supply 9 million people with drinking water.

6.4.3   Exposure assessment
Several source water systems discriminated on the basis of the data on source waters, source
water environment and water quality: groundwater systems, groundwater systems under the
influence of surface water, surface water systems and systems with drinking water that was a
blend of the former systems. Information was obtained from a previous study aiming at
measuring the occurrence of Cryptosporidium in surface water and in groundwater (Figure
16). These literature data were used to estimate the concentration of Cryptosporidium in each
of the source water types identified, using a conservative estimation (Figure 17).

The removal or inactivation of Cryptosporidium by the treatment processes was also
obtained from CIRSEE – Suez Environnement studies and collected from the scientific
literature. Generic Log-credits were assigned to each of the treatment processes (Figure 18).

The information about each treatment works was entered into a database with the facility to
analyse the data.

6.4.4   Risk characterisation
For each system, a treatment performance target was defined according to the estimated
concentration of Cryptosporidium in source water, in order to achieve one of these three
levels of risk:




                                             78
•  A low level of risk was related to a Cryptosporidium concentration of 0.003 per 100
   litres. This concentration was derived from the 10-4 probability of infection pppy, the
   suggested target for safe drinking water [Haas et al., 1996] and using the exponential
   dose-response function of the Iowa strain.
• A medium level of risk was related to the analytical detection limit of Cryptosporidium,
   which was determined to be 0.3 oocyst per 100 litres. The associated probability of
   infection was 10-2 pppy.
• A high level of risk was arbitrarily set at 30 oocysts per 100 litre. The associated
   probability of infection was 0.6 pppy.
The treatment capacity of each treatment facility was compared to these treatment
performance targets, and a level of risk was assigned to each facility accordingly (Figure 19).

6.4.5    Risk management
The risk assessment highlighted that the sites at higher risk were primarily small systems
(serving <5000 people) and groundwater systems that were under the influence of surface
water.
To validate the outcome of the risk assessment, a Cryptosporidium monitoring program was
conducted at selected sites from each of the risk categories. In this monitoring program,
treated water samples were collected every two weeks for a period of at least 6 months and
analysed for Cryptosporidium (and Giardia) and other water quality parameters: turbidity,
coliforms, aerobic spores, temperature, pH, conductivity, UV transmission and ammonium.
Additional samples were taken during turbidity peaks.
The results of the Cryptosporidium monitoring were consistent with the risk assessment;
high risk sites showed the highest frequency of samples positive for Cryptosporidium and the
highest concentrations were observed at these sites. No Cryptosporidium was found at any of
the low risk sites and the medium risk sites gave intermediate results. There was also a good
correlation between the presence of Cryptosporidium and high turbidity. The verification of
the QMRA with the monitoring data was very valuable to convince the risk managers and
owners of the water supplies that the QMRA results are a valid and good basis for setting
risk management priorities.
The main risk factors for Cryptosporidium that were found were the presence of cattle in the
catchment area, less than 99% compliance with the coliform standard and turbidity of >0.2
NTU in distributed water. The company has audited the high risk sites and, where necessary,
has upgraded the treatment facilities in accordance with the local health authority.
Furthermore, Suez has since then used the same risk assessment approach for the water
works they operate in other countries.


6.5      CASE STUDY 2: EVALUATING A RISK SCENARIO
In this case study, no site specific information is available on Cryptosporidium, but data are
inferred from literature.

6.5.1    Problem formulation
A proposal for a 33-lot unsewered, residential subdivision was lodged with a Shire Council
in south-eastern Australia. The proposed subdivision was located on marginal grazing land in
the catchment of a water supply reservoir. The reservoir supplied a population in nearby
towns and surrounding areas of approximately 42,000. Under State planning laws, the local
water utility was listed as a referral authority and needed to provide an approval for the
development to proceed. When the utility refused permission for the development on the
grounds that, being unsewered, it posed a threat to water quality in the reservoir; the property
developer took the utility to court. The developer argued that best practice wastewater
management and on-site treatment systems would ensure the protection of water supplies.




                                              80
The utility countered this argument with a preliminary quantitative risk assessment and
evidence that on-site treatment systems rarely met design performance standards due to poor
maintenance. Under realistic operating conditions, the risk assessment showed that the
threats to public health from Cryptosporidium exceeded the US EPA’s Surface Water
Treatment Rule (SWTR) baseline tolerable risk for domestic water supply of 10-4 cases of
gastrointestinal illness per annum.

Specific risk assessment goal
Does the proposed development pose an intolerable risk to water supplies?


6.5.2    Hazard identification
In order to assess the additional public health risk posed by the proposed subdivision a
spreadsheet model was developed based on Cryptosporidium oocysts (Table 10).
Cryptosporidium was considered to be the pathogen most likely to pose a threat due to the
resistance of oocysts to conventional water treatment. Oocysts resist disinfection in drinking
water treatment plants and can survive for 3 months or more in freshwaters (Fayer et al.
1998). Consequently any additional sources of Cryptosporidium in water supply catchments
are highly undesirable.


6.5.3    Exposure assessment
The key parameters in the model were the analytical laboratory recovery rate (i.e. the
detection efficiency), the concentration of Cryptosporidium in the sewage treatment plant
effluent, the percentage of effluent reaching the stream feeding the water supply reservoir,
the average stream flow, the oocyst removal rate of the drinking water treatment plant, and
the average volume of water consumed per person per day.
Each parameter is subject to some degree of uncertainty, however realistic values were
chosen for the average case scenario. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted using best
and worst case scenarios to give an indication of the upper and lower limits that could be
expected. For reasons of simplicity, extreme values for some of the parameters in the
sensitivity analysis were not chosen. The rationale for each of these decisions is discussed
below.

Source water quality
Each of the properties on the subdivision were to rely on septic tanks or small aerated
wastewater treatment plants (AWTS) for the disposal of household wastes, with either
transpiration or evaporation as the means of final effluent disposal.
Average values for the removal of oocysts by conventional wastewater treatment plants can
be estimated from the literature. For the purposes of this risk assessment it was assumed that
the average treatment efficiency of the sewerage treatment systems for the proposed




                                             81
subdivided plots was 2 log10 (i.e. 99%). Crockett and Haas (1997) present figures for the
concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in raw sewage with the highest value from a
limited survey showing a concentration of 290 oocysts per litre. Using this concentration
and assuming a 2 log10 removal gives a value of 2.9 oocysts per litre. The effluent disposal
systems recommended for the development were either conventional adsorption of the
primary septic tank effluent in absorption trenches or trickling irrigation of secondary
effluent, which has undergone treatment in an aerated wastewater treatment system (AWTS).
Both of these systems could easily have a removal rate lower than the assumed value. State
Wastewater Reuse Class A guideline level for parasites (i.e. the category which includes
Cryptosporidium) is < 1 parasite per 50 L. While this is a desirable target on public health
grounds, in practice it is very difficult to meet. Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and other
means of treatment are expected to have significantly lower treatment efficiencies due to the
poorer quality of the raw effluent they receive. With relatively fixed removal efficiencies,
the concentration of oocysts in the effluent is likely to depend heavily on the load going to
the STP. Consequently a concentration of 0.5 oocysts per litre for the best case scenario and
3 oocysts for the worst case were chosen.

The water usage for each lot was proposed to be 1200L/day. This value was chosen for the
average case scenario. The percentage of effluent reaching the small creek that drained the
proposed development was modelled at 10% for the average case. This was based on the
fact that oocysts can survive in the damp conditions on irrigated pasture and could be washed
by subsequent rainfall down the slopes of the site into the creeks. Soil analysis, rainfall
levels and anecdotal evidence also indicated that there may be periods over winter were the
soil becomes water logged. Automated irrigation control (e.g. rain sensors stopping
irrigation when rain is detected) would help in reducing the risk of oocyst transport to the
creek; however, there is little doubt that at certain times of year a significant quantity of
oocysts would enter the creek.

Stream flow was modelled as the average flow in the creek (estimated from relevant Gauging
Station Data), which was around 4 ML per day. A more sophisticated model (beyond the
scope of this preliminary study) could include variation in stream flow, although it was not
expected that this would alter the predicted magnitude of the probability of infection. Since
the model was aimed at assessing the increased health risks due to the proposed
development, the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the creeks upstream of the
development was assumed to be zero2. Consequently, the estimated concentration of oocysts
in the stream downstream is given by the total oocyst load divided by the total discharge
(stream flow plus effluent).



2
 Another approach could have been to compare current land-use with proposed use,
however, due to the marginal nature of the farmland, the continuity of current land-use was
highly unlikely.




                                             82
It is important to note that the turbidity of sample waters can greatly decrease WTP pathogen
removal efficiency. Consequently highly turbid storm flows which may mobilise
Cryptosporidium oocysts off wastewater irrigated pasture, stream beds, or water storage
sediment surface and which increase turbidity, pose greater pathogen control problems.

Once the oocysts enter the stream they travel approximately 5 km before discharging into the
reservoir. In the reservoir the storage time is likely to be in the order of some months,
however, it is not known what proportion of oocysts that may enter the reservoir may die off
and or settle out before being drawn off for treatment and drinking water supply. In shallow
reservoirs even light winds can keep small particles in suspension and it is unlikely that there
would be significant settlement of such small particles (4.2 to 5.4 µm for Cryptosporidium
parvum, Arrowood 1997). Some particle flocculation may occur which may increase
sedimentation rates, reducing the number of oocysts in the water column but the extent of
this is unknown. In the absence of detailed information, a conservative approach was taken
in assuming no die-off or settlement of oocysts entering the reservoir and that the
concentration of oocysts reaching the WTP is the same as in the creek.

Recovery efficiency
The laboratory recovery rate for Cryptosporidium was set at 33%. This is based on the
analytical laboratory’s performance data and is an average value for recovery based on the
particular analytical methodology that may be used and the quality of the water tested. Many
factors, in particular high water turbidities can interfere with the analytical extraction
processes, thus the recovery rate is somewhat variable.

Treatment efficacy
Small water treatment plants generally have a treatment process that includes coagulation,
sedimentation and filtration and this is generally expected to remove up to 99% of oocysts
(i.e. a 2 log10 removal rate) (Rose et al., 1997). It is possible that the WTP could exhibit
infrequent suboptimal performance (e.g. during storms, when oocyst numbers may be at their
highest) so the WTP removal rate for oocysts has been modelled at 95% for the average case
scenario.

6.5.4    Risk characterisation
The above calculations give the estimated concentration of oocysts in domestic drinking
water. The probability of infection, Pi, per day is given by the equation:

                                 Pi = 1 – exp(-rN)

where r is the fraction of Cryptosporidium oocysts that are ingested which survive to initiate
an infection and N is the daily exposure (i.e. actual number of oocysts ingested). For
Cryptosporidium, r = 0.00467 and N = the number of oocysts in 1.948 L, the assumed daily
ingestion rate (Rose et al. 1997). For the average case scenario Pi = 4.48 x10-6. Multiplying
this figure by the number of days in a year gives an annual risk of infection of 1.63 x 10-3.
This is the additional risk posed to consumers within the subdivision. It exceeds by a factor
of 16 times the US EPA’s Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) baseline tolerable risk for
domestic water supply and is clearly intolerable.

As stated, the models were based on the conservative assumption of no die-off of oocysts
before reaching the WTP. If a die-off factor of 90% is incorporated into the calculations, the
average and worst case scenarios for annual risk of infection would be 10% of the values
shown in Table 10, however these would still exceed the SWTR tolerable risk criterion.


6.5.5    Risk management
On-site treatment system reliability
In addition to the above risks, there were a number of additional operational risks that have
not been modelled or considered. These include the probability of spill incidents,
breakdowns in irrigation systems, failure of secondary treatment if this option was chosen,
increased water usage and subsequent flooding of the system, poor maintenance on septic
tanks including structural break downs and leakage from the system, the effect of fire
damage on plant performance and operation of irrigation system after vegetation loss
following fire, and a range of other difficult to control events.




                                             84
There is mounting evidence that maintenance of on-site treatment systems is frequently poor.
In support of its case the water utility conducted monitoring of streams near existing
unsewered towns in its area of jurisdiction. The results of these studies provided compelling
evidence that on-site systems are commonly poorly maintained. Measurements made of a
number of water quality parameters including nutrients, biological oxygen demand (BOD)
and E. coli, showed that drainage from residential subdivisions, many of the size of the
proposed development frequently recorded high levels of E. coli, BOD and nutrients. In
some cases these levels were of such magnitude that they constituted a public health threat
from direct contact.

On the basis of the arguments put forward by the water utility, the court - in this case an
administrative tribunal chaired by two commissioners - found in favour of the utility and the
development did not proceed. The value of the risk assessment study was to quantify the
likely risk to water supplies. Despite the uncertainty surrounding appropriate values of many
of the model parameters, simple worst case and best case scenarios were able to indicate the
bounds on the uncertainty. More sophisticated risk modelling and uncertainty analysis
would have narrowed the degree of uncertainty. However, the risks of the proposed
development were of such magnitude that further risk modelling was unnecessary.


6.6      CASE STUDY 3: MEETING THE HEALTH-BASED TARGET

The use of point estimates for each component of the risk assessment has the advantage of
simplicity and communication of the information to risk managers. However, the
disadvantage of point estimates is that the information about variation and uncertainty is not
taken into account, and point estimates give a false sense of certainty. The information about
variation and uncertainty is important when risk management actions are decided upon, as
they guide risk management to the most important areas of control and uncertainty.
The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method can be used to combine different probability
distributions. Hence, the variability and uncertainty can be included in the risk assessment
and the outcome is a probability distribution of the risk estimate which gives the confidence
interval of the risk estimate. Using sensitivity analysis, it is possible to identify which
information source contributes most to the overall uncertainty of the risk estimation.

The information on Cryptosporidium oocyst concentrations, recovery efficiency of the
detection method, efficacy of treatment processes, distribution integrity, and the
consumption of cold tap water may now be used to calculate daily doses for
Cryptosporidium. To this end, samples are drawn from the fitted probability distributions for
these factors using the Monte Carlo method. Resampling can provide information about
multiple exposures [Teunis et al., 1997]. Using the distribution of the daily dose and the
dose-response the risk of infection and illness can be estimated. The outcome is a probability
distribution of the probability of infection or illness per day that can be transformed to the
annual risk.




                                             85
6.6.1    Problem formulation
A Water Company in the Netherlands is the owner and operator of a plant for drinking water
production from surface water. Given the occurrence of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis
through drinking water in neighbouring countries the water company and the drinking water
inspectorate want to know if the population served by the treatment plant is adequately
protected against cryptosporidiosis.
The new Dutch Drinking Water Act states that for pathogenic micro-organisms, a health risk
should not exceed 1 infection per 10.000 consumers per year (VROM, 2001). There are
precedents in the drinking water industry in the Netherlands where this risk level has been
used to evaluate the safety of drinking water.

Specific risk assessment goal
Does this treatment plant produce drinking water that meets the 10-4 infection risk-level?

6.6.2    Hazard identification
The risk assessment is limited to Cryptosporidium. As the treatment contains chlorination it
is argued that Cryptosporidium is likely to be the most significant health hazard. The
outcome of the risk assessment is the risk of infection, since this is the health outcome that is
incorporated in the regulation.

The water company uses water from a large, international river as source water. The river is
contaminated by discharges of mainly treated domestic waste waters. During rainfall events,
additional contamination is likely to come from run-off from agricultural lands and
overflows of combined sewers. Treated sewage is not discharged in the vicinity of the
abstraction site.
The river water is pre-treated by conventional treatment (coagulation, sedimentation and
rapid sand filtration). The pre-treated river water is then transported to the coastal sand dune
area and infiltrated in the sandy soil (by surface infiltration). The water is abstracted from the
soil again by pumping wells at a distance of the infiltration ponds. The travel time of the
water through the sandy aquifer is 60-100 days. After abstraction, the water is recollected in
an open canal system and reservoir. This open system lies in a natural area, but becomes
recontaminated by waterfowl, wildlife and grazing cattle. Measurements have shown faecal
contamination to be present in the recollected water, esp. in winters when the bird load is
high. Cryptosporidium has been detected in the recollected water and genotyping has
indicated that at least part of the oocysts in this water is C. parvum. The recollected water is
treated by rapid sand filtration, ozonation, softening, GAC filtration and slow sand filtration.
The production of the plant is 180,000 m3/d.

Rapid sand filtration




                                               86
The water is collected from the open reservoir and aerated by cascades. This aerated water is
filtered over 56 separate filter units (total area of 2368 m2). With a filtration rate of 3.3-4.9
m/h the water is filtered over a bed with river sand (0.7-1.4 mm) of 1.3 m height (HRT = 16-
24 min). The filters are back washed on based either on head loss or time of operation (96 h
on an average).


Main disinfection
The water (8000-11,300 m3/h) is disinfected with ozone. In winter and summer with a dose
of 0.9 and 0.75 mg/l (counter current) resulting in CT-values of 3-4 and 1-2 (mg/l)*min,
respectively. The CT is limited to control the formation of bromate. The water is treated in 5
separate units 778 m3 each and the HRT is 15-24 min. Residual ozone concentration is <0.01
mg/l. The T10/Thydraulic of the system is 60%. CT is regulated weekly by measurement of the
ozone profile of the installation (5 sampling points), the UV-extinction and temperature.

Softening
After ozonation the water is treated with caustic soda (pH= 8.7-9.2) and sand grains in
fluidized bed reactors (12; HRT= 1-2 min) to reduce hardness. After this process pH is set at
a saturation index of -0.2 with hydrochloric acid.

GAC filtration
Softening is followed by granular activated carbon (Norit ROW 0.8) filtration in 20 separate
filter units of two successive filter beds with a total HRT of 40 minutes (two times 20 min.).
The surface area is 58 m2 per unit of two filters, the bed height is 5 m (x2.5), the filtration
rate 7-10 m/h and the HRT range 30-43 min. (8000-11,300 m3/h). These filters are back
washed once or twice per month with air (60 m/h) in summer and with water all seasons (20-
40 m/h).

Slow sand filtration
Last stage of the post-treatment is slow sand filtration (25 filters). With a rate of 0.25 m/h
(maximum of 0.5) the water is filtered through a filter bed (0.8-1.2 m; HRT = 190-290 min.)
with mol and silver sand (0.15-0.6 mm). The filter bed is scraped with a frequency of once
every two years, depending on the head loss, to maintain production capacity.

Post-disinfection
This plant does not use post-chlorination (drinking water is distributed without residual
disinfectant).

Sludge treatment and back wash water reuse
The back wash water of the rapid sand filters and the GAC filters (3,800 m3/d) is treated by
in-line coagulation (1.4 g/ FeCl3) and Dynasand filtration. There is of filter-to-waste period
after back washing.

Operation diary for disturbances
There is a registration of disturbances, maintenance and incidents.

The treated water is stored in a 13,400 m3 reservoir and distributed in a network. The yearly
production is 65,000,000 m3 per year for 600,000 clients.


6.6.3    Exposure assessment
Source water quality
The Water Company has conducted a monitoring programme of its source water over the
period of several years. The source water was sampled each month for the presence of
Cryptosporidium. 48 Samples of 100 – 200 litres were taken and concentrated and purified
according to the EPA 1623 method. Fifteen of the 48 samples contained Cryptosporidium
oocysts. The average concentration in the positive samples was 4.8 per 100 litres and the
maximum was 19.3 per 100 litres. The concentrations in the winter season were highest.
The oocyst counts can be fitted with statistical distributions. The distribution is commonly
skewed: a few samples contain a relatively high oocyst count while most samples contain no
or very low oocyst numbers. Several authors have described fitting of statistical distributions
to such Cryptosporidium concentration data-sets. Teunis et al., [1997] compared the Poisson
distribution, the Poisson distribution with added zero’s and the Negative Binomial
distribution to Cryptosporidium concentration data from an off-stream storage reservoir and
concluded that use of the Negative Binomial distribution provided the best fit. The latter has
been shown to give the best description of these river water data. Havelaar et al. [2000] used
the Log-Normal distribution on these same data. Also Gale & Stanfield [2000] used the Log-
Normal distribution to fit Cryptosporidium concentration data in raw water. The advantage
of the Log-Normal distribution is that when the distribution of oocysts in source water is
combined with the other elements of exposure assessment (treatment efficacy), the overall
variance can easily be determined by simple summation of the variance of the individual
elements. Teunis et al. [1999] used the Negative Binomial distribution to describe
Cryptosporidium concentration data from LeChevallier et al. [1998], assuming that the
individual Cryptosporidium count data were Poisson distributed, with the concentration
varying between samples, following a Gamma distribution. The combination of these
assumptions means that Cryptosporidium counts follow a Negative Binomial distribution.
Medema et al., [2003] and Pouillot et al. [2004] also used the Negative Binomial distribution
to fit their Cryptosporidium concentration data.
A Gamma distribution was fitted to the Cryptosporidium counts in source water. Figure 20
shows a histogram of the data; the probability of no or low oocyst counts is high, and the
probability of high oocyst concentrations is low. The figure also shows the probability
density function (PDF) and the cumulative density function (CDF) of the fitted Gamma
distribution, testing also for a Gamma distribution with a large α and small β and the reverse.
The “average” Gamma distribution with the α of 1.18 and β of 20.94 was selected for
inclusion in the QMRA.

source water, and the fitted Gamma distribution (X-axis shows Cryptosporidium
concentration in oocysts per 1000 litres).
As stated before, the detection methods for Cryptosporidium in water have a low and
variable recovery efficiency and the observed concentrations should be corrected for this
recovery efficiency. Ideally, recovery data are available for every individual sample. If that is
the case, the individual Cryptosporidium counts can be corrected for the recovery efficiency
and the statistical distribution can be fitted to the corrected concentrations [Medema et al.,
2003]. If the recovery efficiency is not available on all individual samples, data on the
recovery efficiency from a subset of samples can be used. If these are also not available,
recovery data from quality assurance testing should at least be available, otherwise the
laboratory has no way to demonstrate the efficacy of their detection method. The simplest
approach is to correct all the concentration data with the average recovery efficiency [Gale &
Stanfield, 2000, using data of Hutton et al., 1995]; Havelaar et al. 2000]. Teunis et al. [1997]
described a statistical method to describe the recovery efficiency. Assuming each oocyst in
the water sample has a probability p of being recovered and this probability is not fixed but
varies following a Beta distribution, the recovery data should be fitted to a Beta-Binomial
distribution. The recovery efficiency and Cryptosporidium concentration data are combined
with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Using this approach, the variation in the recovery
efficiency is taken into account and the uncertainty that is introduced by the variable
recovery efficiency can be quantified [Pouillot et al., 2004]. This is of importance when the
outcome of the overall risk assessment is to be interpreted in terms of the risk management




                                                   89
actions that are required. Uncertainty introduced by the detection method requires another
approach than variation introduced by fluctuations in treatment efficacy.
The recovery of the method that was used to enumerate the Cryptosporidium oocysts in
source water was evaluated for 30 surface water samples at different sites (including this
site) over the same years as the monitoring at this site. The average recovery efficiency was
22.0% (95% CL: 2.3 – 71%). Figure 21 shows a histogram of the data (expressed as fraction
recovered) and the PDF and CDF of the fitted Beta and Exponential distribution. The
Exponential distribution fitted best to the data and was selected for the QMRA.

Treatment efficiency
To get a first idea of the level of protection of the drinking water, an approximate assessment
of the treatment efficiency was conducted, using the default treatment efficiency as given in
par. 4.3. The rapid sand filtration and GAC filtration would both remove 0.5 log, the slow
sand filtration 2 log and the ozonation 0.25 log in winter to 1 log in summer. This would
result in an estimated concentration of oocysts in drinking water (corrected for the recovery)
of 0.7-3.9 x 10-4 per litre. With an average daily consumption of cold tap water of 0.78 litre
per person the average probability of exposure would be 0.6-3.3 x 10-4 per person per day.
This would result in a probability of infection of 0.26-1.4 x 10-4 per person per day (using the
combined dose-response relation of the 4 C. parvum isolates (chapter 5), which corresponds
to an annual risk of infection of 0.9-5 x 10-2 per person, above the maximum acceptable risk
of infection that is present in the Dutch regulation.
This called for a more comprehensive and site specific assessment of the treatment
efficiency. The water utility had data available on the presence of spores of sulphite-reducing
clostridia at different stages of the treatment train. The removal of these spores was used as a
model for the removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts by the treatment processes. For the slow
sand filtration, specific data on Cryptosporidium removal were collected at a pilot slow sand
filter in a long-term challenge study.

Rapid sand filtration
380 data-pairs were available with the concentration of clostridia spores before and after
filtration. These data-pairs were used to calculate the removal efficiency for each sampling
day. The average removal efficiency was 1.35 log. The removal data (expressed as fraction
passing filtration) are plotted in the histogram in Figure 23, together with the fitted Gamma-,
Beta- and Beta-Binomial distribution.

Ozonation
For the ozonation, 355 data pairs on spores were available. 34.9% of the days that the spores
were measured, no spores were detected at the outlet of the ozone reactor. For these days, no
accurate removal efficiency could be calculated. However, ignoring these data would mean
that the data that show a high removal efficiency would be disregarded. To be able to include
these data, the zeros in the outlet were replaced by a 0.005 per litre. Two distributions were
made; one of the 65.1% of the data with spores present both in the inlet and outlet and one of
the 34.9% of the data with spores in the inlet and no spores in the outlet (now 0.005 per
litre). Figure 24 shows the histogram of the data with spores present for in- and outlet
samples with the fitted Beta and Exponential distribution and Figure 25 shows the data with
spores in the inlet and no spores in the outlet with the fitted Beta distribution. The two Beta
distributions (from Figure 24 and Figure 25) were selected for the QMRA, with a spore in
the inlet of the ozonation having a 65.1% chance of “entering” the first Beta distribution and
a 34.9% of entering the second.

Softening
The softening did not show significant removal of spores and the removal of oocysts by this
process was considered 0.

GAC filtration + slow sand filtration
Data on spores were available from the inlet of the GAC filters and of the final water, after
slow sand filtration, but not from the outlet of the GAC filters (=inlet slow sand filters).
Hence, the data combined the removal by the two filtration processes. One hundred sixty two
data points were available before GAC filtration and 2069 data points were available after
slow sand filtration. However, 36% of the samples before the GAC filters contained no
spores and 95% of the (1 litre) samples after slow sand filters contained no spores, so the
data did not allow an accurate description of the removal by slow sand filtration. Since the
slow sand filtration was considered the most important barrier against Cryptosporidium, it
was decided to conduct a study to collect specific data on Cryptosporidium removal in a pilot
sand filter that operated under the same conditions as the full scale filters. Cryptosporidium
oocysts were added to the feed water over a period of three months and the oocyst
concentration for in- and outlet samples were analysed. The results show a very efficient
removal of oocysts equal to or more than 4.0 log [Hijnen et al., in prep.].

Concentration in drinking water
Now information of the Cryptosporidium concentration in source water, the recovery
efficiency, the removal of spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia by rapid sand filtration,
ozonation and the pilot study on slow sand filtration was available and statistical
distributions were fitted to each of these data-sets. The concentration of Cryptosporidium in
drinking water was computed by taking 1,000,000 random samples from each of the
statistical distributions (Monte Carlo analysis). For slow sand filtration, the removal was
fixed at the average removal. Figure 26 shows the Cryptosporidium concentration (corrected
for recovery) in source water, after rapid sand filters, after ozone, and after GAC-
filtration+slow sand filtration, which is the final water that was distributed (without
disinfectant residual) to the consumers. The computed median concentration of
Cryptosporidium in drinking water was 0 per litre (95% CL: 1.8 x 10-6 per litre).

Water consumption
Following the recommendations of Mons et al. [2007], the conservative data on consumption
of cold tap water from the Melbourne diary study of Robertson et al. [2000] were used. The
Poisson distribution provided the best fit to these data and is relatively simple (Figure 10,
Chapter 4). The Poisson distribution with a mean of 3.49 glasses (0.25 l) per day was used to
assess the exposure to Cryptosporidium through tap water consumption.

6.6.4    Risk characterization
To characterize the risk of infection, the data on the concentration of Cryptosporidium in
drinking water were combined with the consumption data to calculate the daily dose. These
were entered in the (Iowa) dose-response relation to determine the daily risk of infection
(Pinf,daily). The annual risk of infection (Pinf, annual) was computed by: Pinf, annual= 1-(1-Pinf,
      365
daily) . Figure 27 shows the annual probability of exposure and the annual risk of infection.
The median risk of infection is 0, with and with an upper 95%CL of 2.8 x 10-5 per person.

day and the annual probability of infection per person.


6.6.5    Risk management
The first stage of the risk assessment, the slow sand filtration could not be adequately
described (see 6.6.3). The first action was therefore to conduct the pilot plant research to
collect data on Cryptosporidium removal by the slow sand filters.
After these data were collected the second stage of the risk assessment was conducted, which
is the stage that is reported here. With the outcome of this risk assessment the water utility
has demonstrated to the Drinking Water Inspectorate and to the public that their drinking
water meets the Dutch guideline of 10-4 risk of infection with a very high certainty.



6.7 FROM HEALTH-BASED TARGETS TO TREATMENT TARGETS
In the new WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, an example is given on how
QMRA can be used to transform health-based targets into treatment performance targets3.
The health-based target for drinking water-related illness that is set in the Guidelines is a
DALY disease burden of 10-6 per person per year [WHO, 2004]. For Cryptosporidium, the
DALY per case is 1.5 x 10-3 [Havelaar & Melse, 2003]. This means that, in a population of

3
 The data in this paragraph are extracted from Table 7.3 of the WHO Guidelines for
Drinking Water Quality [WHO, 2004].




                                                                    96
one million people, a maximum of 666 persons may contract cryptosporidiosis via drinking
water annually. If the probability of an infected person to develop clinical cryptosporidiosis
is 0.7, the maximum probability of infection is 9.2 x 10-4 per person per year, or 2.5 x 10-6
per day. Using the (Iowa) dose-response relation, the maximum probability of exposure to
keep below this tolerable infection risk is 6.3 x 10-4 per person per day. Assuming a
consumption of 1.0 litre of cold tap water per person per day, the maximum concentration of
Cryptosporidium in tap water is 6.3 x 10-4 per litre. The required treatment performance can
now be determined from the difference in the concentration in source water and the
maximum concentration in tap water (Figure 28, adapted from WHO, 2004). The infectivity
of the other C. parvum isolates is higher than the Iowa isolate (see chapter 5). Also the
probability of contracting the illness once infected is higher for the other isolates. Hence,
when the combined dose-response relation of the four isolates is used and the probability of
illness when infected is assumed to be 1.0, the maximum exposure to achieve 10-6 DALYs
per person per year is significantly lower and the required treatment performance is 2.2 logs
higher (Figure 28).
The health-based targets that are set may differ from country to country. The approach
presented here to infer treatment performance targets from a health-based target can be used
for any health outcome (probability of infection, probability of illness, DALYs etc.) that is
used to set health-based targets. An advantage of this approach is that it allows a clear
communication between water supplies (treatment performance) and health
authorities/regulators (health target).

Risk management



7.1      THE VALUE OF QMRA
Water suppliers and drinking water policy makers that have to make risk management
decisions are faced with information that is complex and uncertain. But risk management
decisions have to and are being made anyway. Questions like: “When can I regard a water
supply system as safe (enough)?”, “How much effort should be put in the protection of
drinking water compared to other routes of transmission?”, “How should I weigh increased
ozonation to inactivate Cryptosporidium to the health risk of increased bromate formation?”
and many others are dealt with by risk managers throughout the world. Quantitative
microbial risk assessment can help risk management in two main ways:
• QMRA provides a systematic approach basis where the best available scientific
    information can be combined into an assessment of the level of safety of water supply
    systems. A state-of-the-art QMRA of a water supply has to rely partly on assumptions.
    Given the current level of uncertainty in quantitative risk assessments of drinking water
    supply, the outcome should be regarded as an indication of the level of safety, rather than
    an absolute assessment of health risk. Nonetheless, the outcome can be used to guide the




                                             98
    risk management to the most effective ways of pathogen control and to select the most
    appropriate control measures, using the best available scientific basis and systematic risk
    assessment approach. Examples can be found in the literature (see Table 9) and are given
    in the case studies in Chapter 6.
•   QMRA models provide a systematic combination of all relevant information and improve
    the understanding of the pathways and barriers involved in transmission of pathogens
    such as Cryptosporidium through drinking water. The risk assessment process also
    identifies important gaps or weaknesses in the available information. Gale [2002]
    described QMRA as a chain of mathematical calculations, in which the weakest link is
    often the component which is supported by poor or inadequate data with a high level of
    uncertainty. QMRA focuses research on the areas where improved information improves
    the basis for risk management most effectively.


7.2      RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS
Risk management requires a systems approach. The Water Safety Plan provides such an
approach [Deere et al., 2001; WHO, 2004; Davison et al., 2005]. Risk assessment provides
the risk manager with an objective indication of the need and extend of risk management
measures, the Water Safety Plan is a tool to determine where and how these risk
management measures will be taken and to document the safety of the drinking water
system. Naturally, Drinking Water Safety Plans and the risk management actions are specific
for the water supply under investigation. The above references provide a comprehensive
description of the Water Safety Plan approach and examples of their implementation in water
supply and the reader is referred to these for further reading.

Cryptosporidium is a pathogen that is transmitted through the faecal-oral route, like many
other enteric pathogens. Many of the actions to manage the risk of Cryptosporidium in water
supply are similar to the actions needed to control of other faecal pathogens and include
protection of the catchment against contamination with faecal wastes from man and
livestock, adequate water treatment processes and protection of treated water during
transport and distribution to the consumers home (the multiple barrier principle). For
guidance on general risk management of transmission of enteric pathogens through water
supply and the multiple barrier principle, the reader is referred to the recent books of
Fewtrell & Bartram [2001], Percival et al. [2004]; OECD/WHO [2003], Mara & Horan
[2003] and Rhodes-Trussel [2005]. In this document the issues that are specific to managing
the risk of Cryptosporidium in water supply are discussed.

Risk management actions that are most frequently employed for controlling the
Cryptosporidium risk to water supply are:
• Cryptosporidium monitoring;
• enhanced catchment protection;
• optimisation of filtration in water treatment and/or




                                              99
•  the installation of additional water treatment processes, esp. UV and membrane filtration.
The following paragraphs give guidance on each of these actions.

7.2.1    Cryptosporidium monitoring

Include peak events
Monitoring for Cryptosporidium is, despite the drawbacks of the detection methods as
discussed in Chapter 4, needed to understand the occurrence of Cryptosporidium in the
catchment and in source waters. Most regulatory monitoring programs [ICR] and water
supply monitoring programs are using sampling schemes with regular (for example monthly)
intervals. Such sampling schemes may miss important peak events [Atherholt et al., 1998]
and it is better to guide monitoring with information about hazardous events that may occur
in the catchment and lead to peak contaminations of source waters. Several authors have
found a relationship between heavy rainfall and high concentrations of Cryptosporidium
[Poulton et al., 1991; Hansen & Ongerth, 1991; Stewart et al., 1997; Atherholt et al., 1998;
Cox et al., 2004]. Also sewer overflows [Gibson et al., 1998] and snowmelt may lead to
peaks of Cryptosporidium concentrations in source water. Extreme weather conditions may
be a driver for peak events, both in surface and groundwater. Other causes for peak events
also occur, most of them man-made, such as farming practices, accidental spills and water
quantity management practices. Peak events are catchment specific; a catchment survey can
identify the specific events that could lead to peaks in a specific source water. Information
about the occurrence and impact of hazardous events on source water quality may be
deduced from relatively simple indicators, such as rainfall, water flow, turbidity and faecal
indicator bacteria [Medema et al., 2001; Roser et al., 2003]. Intensive monitoring for these
simple and cheap indicators is helpful in guiding more complex and expensive
Cryptosporidium monitoring programs.

Quality assurance
The shortcomings of the current detection methods for Cryptosporidium detection and
enumeration require extensive quality assurance of the analysing laboratories. Although the
methods and laboratories have improved over the years, the quality of the analysis is still
very dependent on the competence of the lab personnel and quality of equipment [Schaefer,
2001]. Several countries [US, UK, Australia and others] have introduced an accreditation
system for Cryptosporidium laboratories and proficiency testing schemes such as PHLS,
LEAP, CRYPTS]. These schemes are also accessible for laboratories from other countries
and it is strongly recommended that they join such schemes. Most frequent errors are the
presence of false positive and false negative samples and low (or very high) recovery
efficiencies.
The occurrence of false-positive samples is attributed to the presence of structures that
resemble oocysts in the microscopical preparations of samples. The introduction of
purification methods such as IMS and flow cytometry have reduced this background, but not
completely. It is therefore important to have the ability to confirm that oocyst-like particles
have the morphological features of oocysts, by using Nomarski Differential Interference




                                             100
Contrast (DIC) Microscopy and/or the fluorogenic dye DAPI (4’6 diamidino-phenyl-indole)
which highlights the sporozoite nuclei.
Low recoveries are the main problem of Cryptosporidium enumeration in water samples. It is
therefore essential for analysing laboratories to include control samples to determine the
recovery efficiency. In such samples, a known number of oocysts is added to a representative
water sample. This seeded sample is processed as a normal sample and the number of
oocysts recovered is counted. Because many studies have shown the recovery to be variable,
both within and between laboratories, recovery samples should be taken by each laboratory
at regular intervals. The ideal situation is to determine the recovery efficiency for each
individual sample. Commercial preparations of pre-stained oocysts that can be distinguished
from the “wild” oocysts in the sample are available for this purpose [Warnecke et al., 2003].
Other QA samples should include method blanks and reagent (monoclonal antibodies, IMS
beads) tests

Molecular typing
In recent years, there have been significant advances in the genotyping of Cryptosporidium,
both in the available methods and the understanding of the taxonomy of the genus (see
Chapter 4). Genotyping methods have been shown valuable in investigating the source of
outbreaks and to verify (or falsify) the waterborne nature of outbreaks [Ong & Isaac-Renton.,
2003; Smith, et al., 2003]. The general conclusion of a workshop on the application of
molecular methods for Cryptosporidium monitoring [Latham et al., 2003] was that use of
genotyping methods will improve the risk management of cryptosporidiosis and that these
methods should be employed in environmental investigations, not only retrospectively in
outbreak situations but generally so that more informed handling of the results environmental
surveillance is achievable. The value of molecular typing to better understand the sources of
Cryptosporidium in the catchment and their health significance is becoming more widely
recognised. Several recent studies have shown that genotyping of environmental isolates
results in a better understanding of the sources of pollution of Cryptosporidium in source
waters and their potential to cause infections in humans [Xiao, 2003, 2005; Neumann et al.,
2004].

7.2.2   Catchment protection
The principle aim of catchment protection is to prevent microbial contamination travel from
the contamination source to the source water used for the production of drinking water as
much as possible. This is an important element of the multiple barrier approach for surface
water supplies, that has been employed since the Greek and Roman times [Medema et al
2001]. It is even more important for groundwater supplies, that usually rely an little
treatment (see par. 7.2.3). Intake points from surface water supplies should be kept well
away from contamination sources, such as sewer overflows, discharges of untreated and
treated sewage, slaughterhouse effluents, agricultural waste disposal, sites of intensive
animal farming etc. Similarly, groundwater wells should be kept well away from sewers,
septic tanks, manure or sewage sludge landfills, intensive livestock farms or other storage




                                            101
facilities of human or animal faeces. Even today, a simple survey of contamination sources
in the vicinity of the water source may reveal the presence of sources that may threaten the
water supply. An example is the Clitheroe outbreak of cryptosporidiosis [Howe et al., 2002],
were site inspection showed that the concrete cover of the reservoir that collected spring
water as well as a wellhead cover were damaged and cattle manure was present on and
around these covers. Heavy rainfall just prior to the outbreak may have facilitated transport
of Cryptosporidium from the manure into the drinking water system. Risk management
included restoring the integrity of the water abstraction systems.
Sometimes, the travel from contamination source to water intake is not directly obvious, but
can still lead to outbreaks or contamination events. One example is the Milwaukee outbreak
of cryptosporidiosis [MacKenzie et al., 1994]; the intake of the Howard Avenue drinking
water treatment plant was located in Lake Michigan, not far from the mouth of the
Milwaukee River. The city’s sewage treatment plant discharged in the river close to the river
mouth. As the river water entered the lake, it was not mixed but created a plume of river
water in the lake. The intake of the treatment plant was situated inside this plume. Initially,
Spring rains and snowmelt was thought to have transported high levels of Cryptosporidium
from the cattle farms and slaughterhouses into the harbour at the river mouth and travel to
the intake. Retrospective genotyping of the outbreak isolates revealed that the outbreak was
caused by C. hominis, the human genotype and hence originated from the human sewage
rather than cattle. Chistensen et al. [1997] studied water quality data and mixing behaviour
and found a high correlation in the turbidity of the sewage treatment effluent and the water at
the intake of the drinking water treatment plant, indicating the sewage outfall was the more
likely source of the outbreak. The risk management actions that were taken in the catchment
were to recommend relocation of the intake farther out into the lake. Interestingly, in January
1994, a few months before the outbreak, a tunnel system was created for storage of sewerage
during storm events, to prevent sewer overflows. These overflows may have contributed to
previous contamination events of the Howard Avenue plant intake. The description here
focuses on the catchment side of this outbreak. The outbreak was not only due to a peak
contamination in the source water, but also by events in the treatment system. For an
overview of the information about this outbreak (and may others), the reader is referred to
the review of Hrudy & Hrudey, 2004.
Another example is given by the Cryptosporidium incidents in Sydney in 1998. Sydney used
surface water from a semi-protected catchment with a series of dams. The final reservoir
(Lake Burragorang) has a length of 55 km and a residence time of approx. 6 months. In the
period of 1993-1998, the Sydney area experienced below average rainfall, and the reservoir
level was low. In August 1998, heavy rain fell in the catchment. The runoff entering the lake
was colder than the water in the lake. The thermal stratification in the lake caused the flood
water to travel to the lake floor and towards the dam. This, together with the strong wind
caused and internal wave around the thermocline. When the offtake of the water treatment
plant was above the thermocline, clean long-residence time water was abstracted, but when
the wave crests hit the dam wall, contaminated, short-residence time floodwater was
abstracted. Detection of oocysts in the raw water coincided with these floodwater incursions
[Cox, et al., 2003]. The post-incident(s) risk management action were the installation of a




                                             102
separate body that was responsible for the catchment management, research into contaminant
sources, identifying hotspots and research into pathogen transport in the catchment.
Understanding the regional processes that govern Cryptosporidium ingress into the surface
water and the fate and transport [Davies et al., 2004] helps to define the most effective risk
mitigation measures.

Domestic wastewater and agricultural run-off are the main sources of Cryptosporidium in
water. Sewer overflows and discharges are hotspots for contamination of water with
Cryptosporidium species that are pathogenic to humans [Jiang et al., 2005]. Agricultural
run-off, especially from young calves and lambs is a serious risk factor for contamination of
watersheds with Cryptosporidium that is pathogenic to humans. Since, calves and lambs of
1-4 weeks old are of highest risk of being infected with C. parvum [Olson et al., 2004] and
can shed very high numbers of oocysts, calving and lambing should be set in places where
the possibility of contamination of surface or groundwater is minimised. Similarly, these
young animals should be kept away from the watershed and their manure should preferably
be separated and composted at high temperatures to inactivate the oocysts. If manure is
applied to lands, these should be level soils and the manure should be incorporated into the
soil. Open area grazing can be done with older animals, but fencing should keep them away
from the direct vicinity of the watershed to prevent direct input of manure in the watershed.


7.2.3    Groundwater protection
Following an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in North London (UK) that was traced to a
groundwater supply that was vulnerable to infiltration of surface water containing
Cryptosporidium sp. [DWI, 1998], the UK Group of Experts recommended that groundwater
systems should be evaluated for potential contamination risk [Bouchier, 1998]. The current
groundwater protection practice is based (as in many countries) on land surface zoning
according to travel times of the water from the land surface to the groundwater sources and
the restriction of contaminating activities in the most vulnerable zones. In Germany and The
Netherlands, no contamination sources may be present in the zone of 60 days groundwater
travel time around the abstraction. Bouchier [1998] evaluated these practices for their
protective value against microbial pollution, especially with Cryptosporidium sp. It was
concluded that this approach formed a sound basis for assessing vulnerable groundwater
supplies, but that an important limitation was that by-pass features, which allow rapid
transport of water with contaminants to groundwater, are not incorporated in the
vulnerability assessment. By-pass flow may occur in many of the British carbonate aquifers
and in other karstic aquifers. Similarly, surface water-aquifer interactions that may occur in
valley-bottoms (surface water recharge) and upper catchments are not incorporated in the
vulnerability assessment. Bouchier [1998] recommended the inclusion of an additional
vulnerability class in the zoning scheme. This extreme vulnerability class would apply to
areas with the combination of contaminated surface water and rapid access points (solution
features, sinkholes, karst or pseudo karst features, mines and aggregate extraction sites).




                                            103
    The need for the inclusion of rapid access of surface water to groundwater as an important
    factor in vulnerability assessment was illustrated by the fact that eight of the nine suspected
    cases of groundwater contamination with Cryptosporidium sp. in the UK were associated
    with adited wells, collectors, spring galleries and former mines with adits [Morris and Foster,
    2000]. Groundwater supplies in rural settings were more commonly affected than sites in
    urban settings. Fissure flow, dual porosity flow and intergranular flow were all represented
    in these cases. Intergranular flow appeared only to be important in settings where the
    residence time in the aquifer was very short, such as in river gravels close to a surface water
    course.

    The Expert Group listed the factors of a groundwater system that need to be considered for
    assessing the risk of contamination with Cryptosporidium sp. (Table 12) and gave guidance
    on techniques to determine/verify the significance of these factors. Simple qualitative
    ranking may help to prioritise the different hazards, however, Morris and Foster [2000] stress
    the need to focus on the individual water supply when applying ranking, appreciating the
    unique hydro-geological, operational and contamination sources setting of each supply
    system. Special attention should be given to the risk of contamination during rain events.
    Heavy rains may facilitate rapid transport of oocysts from the sources through the
    groundwater or through cracks in the abstraction system (see description of the Clithero
    outbreak in par. 7.2.2). Many contamination incidents and outbreaks are associated with
    heavy rainfall [Curriero et al., 2001].

    7.2.4      Optimised particle removal by water treatment
    Many of the waterborne outbreaks have been associated with treatment inadequacies
    [Bouchier, 1998; Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004]. Several outbreaks might have been prevented if
    the treatment systems were operated in accordance with good practice. This means that
    maintaining good practice, monitoring the performance of treatment systems and taking
    corrective measures when monitoring indicates treatment is compromised (see Water Safety
    Plan) is essential.

    Many important recommendations for risk management of Cryptosporidium in water
    treatment are already given by the Group of Experts in the UK [Bouchier, 1998]. These are
    directed primarily at conventional water treatment, which is coagulation/floc
    removal/filtration. The recommendations of the Group of Experts are given in

    Box 1 (slightly adapted). The highlights are presented in Figure 29. During a filter-run, the
    first time (hour) after backwashing represents a major risk of oocyst breakthrough. Risk
    management actions may be filter-to-waste or slow start of filters after backwashing.
    Towards the end of the filter-run, particle removal is reduced and filters need to be
    backwashed. Particle counting of the effluent of individual filter is a too to detect increased
    particle breakthrough as early as possible [Edwards, 2000; Mazounie et al., 2000] and helps
    to optimise filter performance.

Box 1. Recommendations for optimised conventional water treatment (adapted from
Bouchier, 1998).

Water treatment works should be designed to handle the typical peak turbidity in the source water.

Water treatment works should be operated at all times in a manner that minimises turbidity in the
final water; attention should also be given to other parameters which reflect the performance of
chemical coagulation, that is, coagulant, metal concentration, and colour.

Water treatment works should normally be operated within the design capacity and without by-
passing of the solids-liquid separation processes which are responsible for removal of turbidity and
coagulant solids; coagulation itself should never be by-passed or compromised.

In the event of an emergency, if it is necessary to overload or by-pass solid-liquid separation
processes, a stringent monitoring regimen should be initiated to ensure that turbidity targets of 0.1
NTU are not exceeded. If there is an indication that these targets will not be achieved, an immediate
advice to boil notice should be issued.

For high risk sites, if minimisation of the effects of filter start-up on final water quality cannot be
achieved through more easily implemented changes (for example improved backwash or delayed
start after backwash), modifications to the works should be made to allow the first flush to be run to
waste or recycled to the works inlet.

Coagulation/flocculation processes should be checked regularly to meet changing conditions of
source water quality and other environmental factors

Only dedicated washwater mains should be used to carry the returned washwater flow.

Filters should be operated and maintained under optimum conditions with attention to the quality
and depth of media and to the operation of the backwashing/air scouring system.

Treatment works staff should be trained to be aware of the potential effect on the final water quality
of even very small changes in the catchment or the treatment stream.

Water utilities should check that process monitoring systems are appropriate to the risk at each
source. For high risk sites, monitoring should include continuous turbidity measurement at the
outlet of each filter and on the final water using instruments capable of detecting changes of less
than 0.1 NTU.

Appropirate action procedures to react immediately to turbidity alarms should be in place; actions
might include immediate isolation of the filter, or, if suggested by history, the issue of advice to
boil.

7.2.5    Additional treatment
Membrane filtration
Additional treatment processes for Cryptosporidium control are primarily membrane
filtration and UV disinfection. Before 1998, the focus was on membrane filtration as initial
studies on UV inactivation of Cryptosporidium, using in vitro viability assays, had indicated
that UV is not effective against Cryptosporidium [Lorenzo-Lorenzo et al., 1993;
Ransome, Whitmore & Carrington, 1993; Campbell et al. 1995] (see Chapter 4). Different
types of membrane systems LeChevallier & Au [2004] give an overview of the efficacy of
microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO)
against Cryptosporidium and other pathogens and indicator organisms. In general, membrane
filtration can remove Cryptosporidium very effectively; reported log-removals are typically
in the order of 5 – 7 logs, with higher removals also reported. If membranes are installed
primarily for Cryptosporidium control, microfiltration is usually the system of choice, due to
the relatively low costs and ease of operation. MF does not remove viruses, so if a broader
barrier against pathogens is necessary, the finer pore size of UF is required. RO and NF are
usually not selected primarily as pathogen barrier but for desalination, softening and/or
micropollutant control.
In some cases, significantly lower removals are seen in pilot or full scale studies. These low
removals are attributed to the composition and integrity of the membranes. Integrity of the
membrane systems (membrane material, seals, spacers, membrane housing etc.) is crucial if
these high log removals need to be maintained. Several integrity tests have been developed
that can be used when the system is off-line, such as the pressure-hold test and bubble point
test. Monitoring system integrity on-line is even more important. At the UF/RO water
treatment plant of Heemskerk (The Netherlands) counting of (0.05 µm and larger) particles
is used to monitor the UF system and sulphate monitoring is used to monitor the integrity of
the RO system on-line [Kruithof et al., 2001].

UV
After 1998, when Cryptosporidium parvum was found to be very sensitive to UV [Clancy et
al., 1998], UV became a widely studied additional treatment system for Cryptosporidium
control. Several water utilities in the world are installing or have already installed UV for the
control of pathogens such as Cryptosporidium (Seattle; Rotterdam; New York); several of
these on the basis of QMRA [van der Veer, 2002; LeChevallier, 2004]. UV is effective
against most enteric pathogens [Hijnen et al., 2005]. Low and medium pressure lamps appear
to be equally effective against Cryptosporidium. Recently, Johnson et al. [2005]
demonstrated that C. hominis is as sensitive to UV as C. parvum. Compared to other enteric
pathogens, Cryptosporidium is more sensitive to UV than viruses, but less sensitive




                                              107
compared to most bacteria. Rapid inactivation of oocysts is readily observed at low UV
doses (3 logs at 5 – 10 mJ/cm2 [Hijnen et al., 2005]. At higher UV doses, Craik et al. [2001]
observed considerable tailing in the inactivation data. The cause for this tailing is still under
debate. If it is a biological phenomenon, this would limit the efficacy of UV to 3 log
inactivation of Cryptosporidium. Repair of UV damage, as reported for bacteria, is present in
oocysts; Morita et al. [2002] demonstrated photo-reactivation and dark-repair of DNA in
Cryptosporidium parvum with the endonuclease-sensitivity site assay. The animal
infectivity, however, was not restored. Similar observations were reported by Shin et al.
(2001) and Zimmer et al. (2003).
Qian et al. [2004] combined the available data on UV inactivation of Cryptosporidium with a
statistical method (Bayesian meta-analysis) which resulted in the relation between UV dose
and Cryptosporidium inactivation presented in Figure 30 [USEPA, 2003]. Due to the
uncertainty over the inactivation at higher doses, this relation was calculated for an
inactivation up to 3 log. The relation is described by the following formula:
                                                                 C          

Figure 30 Relation between Cryptosporidium inactivation and UV dose [after USEPA, 2003]
An important issue in the application of UV in water treatment is the assessment of the net
UV dose in UV reactors in treatment practice. The UV intensity is usually monitored with
one or more UV sensors in the reactor (preferably at the reactor wall), but the UV dose
depends on the distribution of the UV intensity and the water flow in the UV reactor
chamber. Reactor design and hydraulics are very important as even a small fraction of short-




                                                                                          108
circuiting seriously limits the disinfection efficacy. Standards and guidelines have been
developed to determine the effective (or Reduction Equivalent) dose of UV systems
[DVGW, 1997; ONORM, 1999; USEPA, 2003]. In these guidelines, the reduction equivalent
UV dose is determined by challenging the UV system with a micro-organism with well-
characterised UV inactivation kinetics (such as MS2 phages or Bacillus subtilis spores). The
inactivation of the challenge organism that is observed when operating the UV system under
a range of test conditions (water flow, lamp power, UV transmission of feed water) is used to
calculate the reduction equivalent UV dose at each setting. When a calibrated sensor is used,
the sensor reading can be employed during operation of the UV system in practice to monitor
the performance of the UV system over time.
Other factors that are important for the operation of UV systems are the ageing of lamps,
fouling of lamp sleeves and sensors, and the presence of particles in the feed water, since
they may shield pathogens from UV.
More background on the assessment of the net UV dose and the factors that influence the
efficacy of UV systems can be found in the EPA Guidelines [USEPA, 2003] and in Sommer
et al., 1997; 1998; 2000.



7.2.6    Distribution

Although not typically an area where specific Cryptosporidium control measures are used,
the protection of the integrity of the distribution network is especially important against
Cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium is very resistant to chlorine, so the residual chlorine
levels that are used to protect the distribution network against the consequences of ingress of
contaminants do not work against Cryptosporidium. The same applies to groundwater
systems that do not use filtration or UV.
The barriers in the distribution network are the integrity of the system, the water pressure and
backflow prevention in the connections of the network to the domestic plumbing
installations. Any breach in these barriers may result in a contamination. Hence, low pressure
events, leakage, cross-connections and mains breaks are indicators of the presence of a
health risk, even in the presence of a disinfectant residual. Strict hygiene during construction,
maintenance and repair of distribution networks and groundwater abstraction systems are
equally important control measures to prevent Cryptosporidium (and other pathogens) to
enter drinking water.
Comprehensive guidance on proper operation, maintenance and risk management of the
distribution network can be found in a recent WHO review document by Ainsworth et al.
[2004].

7.3      RESEARCH PRIORITIES


7.3.1    Exposure assessment
Detection methodology
The detection and enumeration methods for Cryptosporidium in environmental samples still
need considerable improvement. The main areas are increased and consistent recovery
efficiency, confirmation of presumptive oocysts and the ability to determine the viability and
infectivity. Genotyping methods are evolving rapidly and should be implemented in
environmental surveys to increase our understanding of the environmental transmission of
human cyptosporidiosis.

Catchment and source water protection

Treatment
A large amount of data have been collected on the removal of Cryptosporidium during
filtration or the inactivation upon exposure to disinfectants. Most of these studies are done in
laboratory experiments or pilot scale treatment systems. This information can be and is used
in QMRA-studies in the form of generic log-credits (see Case study 1 and 2). This is very
useful in screening-level QMRAs to set risk management priorities. As the screening-level
QMRA has indicated that a water supply system may be at risk, a more site-specific QMRA
is needed. In the vast majority of water supplies, no site-specific data on the removal of
Cryptosporidium are present. To extrapolate the body of available scientific knowledge and
water treatment experience to a treatment process at a specific site, performance models for
the removal of Cryptosporidium by the treatment process are very useful. This is already
used in ozone disinfection for instance, using the disinfectant concentration, contact time,
reactor hydraulics and temperature as model parameters [ESWTR, Smeets et al., 2006].
The performance of a treatment process is not constant. As a result of variation in feed water
quality, temperature, water flow and process control, the removal of pathogens varies over
time [Gale et al., 2002; Hijnen et al., 2000; 2004; LeChevallier & Au, 2004]. Of particular
importance for QMRA are the moments of poor performance [Gale, 2002]. In a well-
operated treatment process, these moments are scarce, but when they occur, they result in a
relatively high health risk. Many of the outbreaks are related to treatment deficiencies. Data
on the occurrence of such events are scarcely available in the scientific literature, but are
present in the logs of water utilities [Westrell et al., 2003] and may be deduced from
treatment performance monitoring data (i.e. turbidity, particle counts, disinfectant residual)
or the microbiological monitoring programs (E. coli and other microbial indicators) of water
utilities.
When microbial indicators (spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia, aerobic spores) are used to
establish the removal of Cryptosporidium by a specific full-scale system on-site, it is
important to know if and how the removal of the indicator correlates with the removal of
Cryptosporidium. This can be established in studies where the removal of Cryptosporidium




                                             110
is compared to the removal of the indicators under identical conditions [Emelko et al., 2003;
Chung et al, 2004].

UV is increasingly used for Cryptosporidium control in water treatment. Several issues
around UV inactivation of Cryptosporidium warrant further investigation. The ‘tailing’ of the
inactivation kinetics at higher UV doses potentially limits the efficacy of UV, while the high
sensitivity of oocysts observed at low doses suggests that high log-inactivations are
achievable. Suggested cause of this phenomenon is a resistant subpopulation of oocysts, but
also experimental artefacts may result in these observations. Understanding of the cause of
this apparently reduced sensitivity is important to determine the scope of UV as barrier
against Cryptosporidium in water treatment. The occurrence of at least part of the cellular
mechanism to repair the damage of UV to the oocysts DNA appears to be inconsistent with
the observation of several authors that no restoration of infectivity occurs after exposure to
low doses of UV. A better understanding of the UV repair capacity of oocysts is needed.
A practical problem of the current EPA guidelines for the testing of UV reactors specifically
with the objective to assign log-credits for Cryptosporidium is that the biodosimeters that are
currently used are much more resistant to UV. The pattern of inactivation over the reactor is
therefore different for Cryptosporidium and the biodosimeters. A bias-factor is introduced in
the EPA-guidance manual, but an alternative biodosimeter with a UV sensitivity similar to
that of oocysts would be more reliable.

Distribution
To be able to assess the risk of the ingress of material in the distribution network during low
or no pressure events, leaks in the network, e.g. in reservoir covers or during maintenance
and repair, data are needed on:
- the occurrence (frequency, magnitude) of contamination events;
- the presence of Cryptosporidium in the material that may enter the network during these
    events.
A QMRA that attempted to calculate the risk of contamination events in the distribution
network have used the water utilities logs to collect data on the frequency of such events and
has used assumptions on the type (sewerage) and amount of material that entered the
distributed water [Westrell et al., 2003] during these events. The use of the microbiological
monitoring programmes of distributed water may provide information about the frequency
and also the magnitude of contamination events. This is now under investigation.


7.3.2    Effect assessment
Cryptosporidium parvum is, at the moment, the only pathogenic micro-organism for which
there is information on the natural variation in infectivity and pathogenicity in human hosts.
Four different isolates have been studied and appeared to have different dose response
properties (Chapter 5). Two different groups of human subjects have been studied in their
responses to the same type of oocysts and here too, there appeared to be substantial variation




                                             111
in dose response relations. Still, there remains much to be investigated. All oocyst types
studied so far belonged to C. parvum, infectious to humans and to other mammals. A feeding
study with C. hominis, which exclusively infects humans, has just been reported [Chappell et
al., 2006]. The ID50 was 10-83 oocysts, in the low range of the C. parvum strains.
Interestingly, there appears to be a better dose-illness and dose-IgG respons relation for C.
hominis. Subtyping of the C. parvum isolates found in human infections is indicating that
some subtypes are more frequently, maybe even exclusively, found in humans [Smith, pers.
comm.]. Employing genotyping methods will increase our understanding of the taxonomy
and of the transmission pathways of Cryptosporidium.

The older QMRA literature uses the dose-response of the Iowa isolate. The exponential dose-
response relation that was inferred from the human volunteer data predicts a probability of
infection at a dose of a single oocyst of 0.42%. The data on the TAMU isolate yield a
probability of infection by ingestion of a single oocyst of 5.9% [Deere & Davison, 2004].
For the UCP and Moredun isolate this is around 40%. The combination of the dose-response
function of the four isolates as presented in Chapter 5 gives a probability of infection of 20%
for ingestion of a single oocyst. This means that the QMRA in the older literature may have
underestimated the risk. If more isolates were tested in human volunteer studies, this
percentage is likely to change further and complying with an acceptable risk level may prove
a moving target. However, a simple approximation could be to assume that the infectivity is
100%. This would mean that the probability of infection equals the probability of exposure.
This will overestimate the risk by a factor of 2.5 for the UCP and Moredun isolate and 5 for
the combined isolates, which is relatively small compared to other factors (see Chapter 6).

A somewhat more technical problem is related to the detection of oocysts excreted by
infected subjects. Faecal detection is problematic and the immunofluorescence method is
known to be too insensitive to detect low numbers of excreted oocysts. The performance or
recovery of the detection method is accessible to independent measurement. Given a certain
recovery, the statistical analysis of dose response data could be corrected for false negatives.

Hazard identification does not stop with the estimation of individual risks of infection or
acute illness. Translation to the population level is not completely trivial, and involves new
problems: sampling effects in small (sub-)populations, temporal variation, nonlinear relation
between involved numbers and costs, and the impact of secondary infection. A pathogen like
Cryptosporidium that is transmitted through the faecal—oral pathway cannot be assumed to
spread homogenously in a host population. The potential for secondary spreading by direct
contact is probably high in certain environments (within households, day-care centres,
schools, …) and low everywhere else. Therefore, a transmission model must account for
different compartments, with high transmission in small subpopulations. For these small
compartments, stochastic effects (due to small numbers of subjects) cannot be neglected.

Dose response assessment is a problem area because required information is hard to find and
studies specifically targeted at obtaining such information (human feeding studies) are




                                             112
usually very expensive. Therefore, the information on dose response relations of microbial
pathogens in humans will always be limited. Even for Cryptosporidium, where an impressive
data base has been built in the last decennium, there are many essential aspects of hazard
characterization that remain unclear. Therefore, a common approach for assessing the risk of
a pathogen when such dose response data are missing, is the use of a surrogate.
Several problems are associated with such a choice: the surrogate organism has some
properties in common with the true pathogen, but similarities are based on observable
biological characteristics, and not on similar infectivity or pathogenicity. Recent
developments in molecular typing methods have greatly increased the amount of detail with
which a micro-organism can be characterized. However, the properties of interest here
concern the interaction between pathogen and host, for which the coincidence of certain
specific factors in both host and pathogen is necessary, often accompanied by certain
environmental conditions. Therefore, even when virulence factors in a pathogenic micro—
organism can be identified, their presence in a different microorganism under different
conditions need not tell us very much about infectivity/pathogenicity of this latter organism.
On the other hand information from various sources – the presence of certain genetic
markers in pathogen and/or host, outbreak investigations where pathogen type and amount
ingested have been recorded, vaccine studies— adds to the knowledge of the dose response
relation in some way or another. Modern statistical techniques are being developed to deal
with such information from various sources and of varying quality.



7.3.3    QMRA versus epidemiology
Whenever a risk model has been set up in enough detail to have some uncertainty estimates,
it would be highly interesting to try and confront the estimated risks with epidemiological
data. Although this involves many additional uncertainties that cannot always be easily
quantified, it is the closest we can get to a validation with ‘real world’ data. By choosing a
scenario and calculating incidences (or prevalences, in a transmission model) by means of
Monte Carlo procedures, the agreement between the risk model and observed outbreak data
could be quantified. A waterborne outbreak with well-characterised health and water quality
data would be the best scenario for such a comparison. Haas et al. compared the
epidemiological investigations of the Milwaukee outbreak with a QMRA on the
Cryptosporidium concentrations that were found in samples of ice that was prepared from
mains water at the time of the contamination and concluded that the results of the QMRA are
consistent with the epidemiological investigations (see par. 6.2). Confirmation of this
relation by comparing QMRA and epidemiology at other outbreaks (preferably good water
quality data) would strengthen the use of QMRA as a health risk assessment tool.
