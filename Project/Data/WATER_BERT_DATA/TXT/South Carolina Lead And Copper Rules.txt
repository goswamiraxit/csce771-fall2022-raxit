                       STATE PRIMARY DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS

A. General.

   Regulations 61-58 through 61-58.17 are promulgated pursuant to S.C. Code Sections 44-55-10 et seq.
and are collectively known as the State Primary Drinking Water Regulations. The Department finds the
standards and procedures prescribed are necessary to maintain reasonable standards of purity of the drinking
water of the State consistent with the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.

B. Definitions.

  (1) "Act" means the State Safe Drinking Water Act of 1976, and amendments.

  (2) "Action level" is the concentration of lead or copper in water specified in R.61-58.11.B(1), Lead
and Copper Action Levels, which determines, in some cases, the treatment requirements contained in R.61-
58.11, Control of Lead and Copper that a water system is required to complete.

  (3) "Administrator" means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

  (4) "Annular space" means the space between the well casing and the formation or the space between
the inner casing and outer casing where two casings are used.

  (5) "Aquifer" means a geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that contains
sufficient saturated permeable material to yield significant quantities of groundwater to wells and springs.

   (6) "Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) Well" means a water well which allows potable water to be
injected into a subsurface aquifer to be recovered by pumping at a later date.

  (7) "Artificial filter" means filter material which is placed in the annular space to increase the effective
diameter of the well, and to prevent fine-grained sediments from entering the well.

  (8) "Backflow prevention device" means any device approved by the Department for use in preventing
backflow under prescribed limited conditions of use.

  (9) “Bag filters” are pressure-driven separation devices that remove particulate matter larger than 1
micrometer using an engineered porous filtration media. They are typically constructed of a non-rigid,
fabric filtration media housed in a pressure vessel in which the direction of flow is from the inside of the
bag to outside.

  (10) “Bank filtration” is a water treatment process that uses a well to recover surface water that has
naturally infiltrated into ground water through a river bed or bank(s). Infiltration is typically enhanced by
the hydraulic gradient imposed by a nearby pumping water supply or other well(s).

  (11) “Bedrock” means the parent solid rock formation underlying weathered rock and soil.

  (12) "Best available technology" or "BAT" means the best technology, treatment techniques, or other
means which either the Department or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds, after examination
for efficacy under field conditions and not solely under laboratory conditions, are available (taking cost into
consideration).



1 | Regulation 61-58
   (13) "Board" means the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control charged with
responsibility for implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.

   (14) "Boil Water Notice/Advisory" means a notice, whether written or verbal, issued by the Department,
or the owner or operator of a public water system, notifying the users of the water system that the water
is/may be contaminated and to boil the water (vigorous rolling boil for at least one minute) prior to using it
for drinking or cooking. The notice shall give the reason for its issuance and corrective actions being taken.

  (15) "Booster Pump" means any pump installed within a water distribution system for the purpose of
increasing the water pressure in the water distribution system, including distribution storage facilities
downstream from the pump. The term booster pump does not apply to the so called low service and high
service pumps at water treatment plants.

  (16) "Business Plan" for the purpose of these regulations means a document consisting of three sub-
plans, a "Facilities Plan", a "Management Plan", and a "Financing Plan" which is intended to show how a
water system will be self-sustaining and have the commitment and the financial, managerial and technical
capability to consistently comply with the State Safe Drinking Water Act and these Regulations.

   (17) “Cartridge filters” are pressure-driven separation devices that remove particulate matter larger than
1 micrometer using an engineered porous filtration media. They are typically constructed as rigid or semi-
rigid, self-supporting filter elements housed in pressure vessels in which flow is from the outside of the
cartridge to the inside.

  (18) "Centralizer" means device to keep the casing and screen aligned in the center of the borehole to
ensure proper emplacement of grout around the casing and artificial filter around the screens.

  (19) "Certified Laboratory" means a laboratory approved by the Department under Regulation 61- 81.

  (20) "Certified Tester" means any person holding an up-to-date backflow prevention assembly tester
certification card issued by the Department. Certified testers fall into one of the following classifications:

     (a) General Tester -any person who has successfully completed an approved backflow prevention
training and certification course which is sponsored by or approved by the Department, and who has
personal possession of or whose employer owns a backflow prevention assembly test kit. This person
provides the service of testing backflow prevention assemblies to the general public.

     (b) Inspector Tester -any person with the same qualifications as the General Tester, except the
Inspector Tester must be employed by a municipality, water district, subdivision, or other public water
system. The Inspector Tester is normally involved in the management of a backflow prevention program,
and does not sell his services to the general public.

     (c) Limited Tester -any person with the same qualifications as the General Tester except the

17 | Regulation 61-58
                           CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION PERMITS

A. Applicability.

  This Regulation establishes procedures for obtaining construction and operational permits from the
Department.

B. Requirements for Construction Permits.

  (1) Before the construction, expansion or modification of any public water system, application for a
permit to construct shall be made to, and a permit to construct obtained from, the Department.

  (2) The application for a permit to construct shall include the following documentation:

    (a) a completed application form for a permit to construct submitted in triplicate (one original and
two copies);

     (b) four (4) sets of detailed plans (including location map);

     (c) three (3) sets of material and construction specifications, except when Department-approved
standard specifications are to be used for the construction project;

     (d) design data and calculations;

    (e) if the owner of the project is different from the utility supplying the water, a letter from the utility
supplying the water stating their willingness and ability to serve the project;

    (f) if the owner of the project is different from the person that will be responsible for operating and
maintaining the project, a letter from that person acknowledging such responsibility; and,

      (g) if the owner of the project is different from the entity which has legal authority to serve or grant
franchises for the area in which the project is located, the application shall include a letter from that legal
entity stating that the proposed project is consistent with the water supply service plan for the area. This
letter is not required if the project will not supply water to any person within the service or franchise area,
other than to the legal authority.

  (3) The application procedure outlined in R.61-58.1(B)(2) is based on a design-bid-build concept for
the construction of a project. The Department may consider on a case by case basis alternate design and
construction concepts and issue construction permits accordingly.

   (4) Before a permit to construct can be issued for a new public water system, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that the new system will be a "viable water system" as
defined in R.61-58(B). In addition to the documentation required in R.61-58.1(B)(2), the application for a
permit to construct a new public water system shall include a management plan and a multi-year financial
plan. These plans will not be required for those new systems whose only source of water is from an existing
viable water system and the new system does not provide additional treatment to the water or sell the water.
If the application proposes that the new system has its own source of water (i.e., its own well(s) or surface
water treatment plant), the applicant shall evaluate the feasibility of connecting to an existing viable public
water system as part of the demonstration of viability. This evaluation shall include, but not be limited to,
a determination of the willingness and ability of an existing system to serve the project, water quality,
capital cost of constructing the line extension versus constructing a new source and the operation and

18 | Regulation 61-58.1
maintenance costs of both alternatives. Any cost comparisons between creating a new water system with
its own source of water and connecting to an existing viable water system shall not be based on any
subsidized monitoring. Also any financing of the new system shall not utilize a loan amortization schedule
which exceeds the useful life of the facility or its components. This demonstration of viability may be
presented to the Department in the form of a Preliminary Engineering Report or as an engineering report
submitted when applying for a permit to construct.

  (5) For projects in the eight coastal counties, no permit may be issued until the project is found by the
Department to be consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Program.

  (6) Projects involving construction in state navigable waters will be evaluated by the Department for
compliance with the Department's regulations concerning such construction before a permit may be issued.

   (7) For projects involving a surface water discharge of water treatment residuals or wastewater, a
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit must be obtained from the Department.
For projects involving land application of water treatment residuals or wastewater, a No Discharge (ND)
permit must be obtained from the Department. No construction permit can be issued for such projects until
a valid NPDES or ND permit is obtained.

   (8) For projects involving a new groundwater source(s), the permitting will be a two step process. In
the first step the owner must submit an application for a permit to construct the source. This construction
will involve the drilling of the well, the development of the well, conducting a pumping test in accordance
with R.61-58.2(B)(12) and testing the water quality in accordance with R.61-58.2(B)(14). The second step
will involve the permitting of the pumping equipment, concrete pad, well head piping, and any treatment,
storage and/or distribution facilities associated with the source. The owner must make a second application
for a permit to construct these facilities. This second application must include the well record form, the
necessary plans and specifications and calculations for these facilities along with the results of the pumping
test and water quality analyses. The Department may waive this two-step permitting process and issue a
single construction permit for the entire project if the quality and quantity of water from the proposed well
can be reasonably predicted through information available from existing wells in the immediate area or a
test well. In the event the quantity and/or quality of water from the well is different than anticipated in the
original design, revised plans and specifications must be submitted to the Department for approval prior to
proceeding with the construction of the project.

  (9) Construction permits are valid for three (3) years, from the date of issue, at which time the project
must be completed or an extension must be applied for in writing. The extension request must be made by
the professional engineer of record for the project and, if applicable, shall include current flow test data.
Projects for which the permit to construct has been expired for more than one (1) year are considered new
projects and must include a new application as required in paragraph 2 of this section.

  (10) A permit to construct may be denied when:

    (a) the project does not comply with the design requirements specified in R.61-58.2, R.61-58.3, and
R.61-58.4;

     (b) the water quality fails to comply with the drinking water standards specified in R.61- 58.5;

     (c) the owner of a proposed new system fails to prove to the Department’s satisfaction that the
system will be a “viable water system” as defined in R.61-58(B); or,



19 | Regulation 61-58.1
    (d) the project does not comply with the Department's regulations for permits for construction in
navigable waters.

   (e) the project does not comply with the Interbasin Transfer Act and R.121-12.1 et seq., Code of
Laws of South Carolina, 1976, as amended.

  (11) Piping associated with a service connection will not require a construction permit if the following
conditions are met:

     (a) all piping associated with the connection is dedicated strictly for use by a single customer being
served water;

     (b) the customer consists of only a single house, single mobile home, single building or multiple-
building complex under single ownership with no rental units (e.g., schools or industry);

    (c) the customer is not a shopping mall, multiple-building complex where there will be several
owners or renters (e.g., apartment complex, condominium complex, mobile home park, campground,
industrial park, or business park) or marina; and,

     (d) the line serving the customer does not pass a lot or potential customer between the connection
and the customer to be served (this includes the piping downstream or the service meter as well as piping
upstream of the service meter).

   (12) Failure to obtain a permit to construct is a violation of the Act (Code Section 44-55-40) and is subject
to an enforcement action by the Department. Where a person has failed to obtain a permit to construct, an
application for permit must be submitted and must include record drawings carrying the seal and signature
of a professional engineer.

  (13) A 15-day local government notification period shall lapse prior to the issuance of any construction
permit. This notification period shall be waived for any projects permitted under the provisions of a general
construction permit and delegated review program. This notification period may be waived by the cognizant
local government or by the Department if the construction is necessary in order to maintain a safe and
adequate supply of water during an emergency. A letter from the local government having potable water
planning authority for the area approving the project constitutes a waiver by the cognizant local
government.

  (14) A dedicated fire line protected by an approved backflow prevention device located at the point of
connection to the public water system’s distribution line will not require a permit to construct.

C. Engineer's Report.

   A preliminary engineering report shall be prepared in triplicate for each new surface water intake, surface
water treatment plant, expansion or modification to an existing surface water intake or surface water
treatment plant, or other projects deemed necessary by the Department. This report shall carry the seal and

issued to the new owner of the system in accordance with R.61-58.1.O(3).

  (8) If an existing water system is out of compliance with any of the requirements of the Act or these
Regulations, the Department may include in the operating permit a schedule for achieving compliance with
such requirements.

  (9) The operating permit for an existing system shall specify the “overall rating” of the last sanitary
survey conducted by the Department. If the overall rating of the last sanitary survey was “unsatisfactory”,
the operating permit shall require the submission of a business plan which will demonstrate how the system
will be managed in the future to ensure its long term viability. The business plan must be submitted to the
Department for approval within six months of the effective date of the operating permit. The Department
may on a case by case basis require that the business plan include a schedule for achieving compliance with
the Act and these Regulations. Once the compliance schedule is approved by the Department, it becomes a
part of the operating permit.

33 | Regulation 61-58.1
  (10) Once the permittee has satisfactorily complied with the requirements of R.61-58.1.O(9) and
necessary corrections have been made to the water system, the permittee may request that the Department
revise the sanitary survey rating on the operating permit.

Department within six months following the issuance of an “unsatisfactory” rating on any future sanitary
survey.

   (12) The Department may issue general operating permits for groups of systems with similar operating
requirements. The Department may deny coverage under the general operating permit to any system which
is not in compliance with the requirements of the Act or these Regulations. The Department may also deny
coverage under the general operating permit where specific requirements are necessary to obtain and/or
maintain compliance with the Act or these Regulations.

   (13) If an existing public water system is divided into two or more smaller water systems, each of the
smaller water systems shall comply with the water quality monitoring requirements of the water system
prior to it being divided.




34 | Regulation 61-58.1
                          GROUNDWATER SOURCES AND TREATMENT

A. Applicability.

   This regulation applies to all new construction and all expansions or modifications of existing public
water systems. If the Department can reasonably demonstrate that safe delivery of potable water to the
public is jeopardized, a system may have to upgrade its existing facilities in order for an expansion or
modification to meet the requirements of this regulation. This regulation prescribes minimum design
standards for the construction of groundwater sources and treatment facilities.

B. Groundwater Development.

  All wells must be constructed by a certified well driller.

  (1) Quantity -

     (a) A minimum of two (2) independent sources of groundwater shall be provided for all community
water systems serving fifty (50) or more taps or one hundred fifty (150) or more people. Systems with an
additional source (Surface Water Plant or Master Meter) will not be required to have two groundwater
sources.

     (b) The total developed groundwater source capacity shall equal or exceed the design maximum day
demand without pumping more than sixteen (16) hours a day. With the largest producing well out of service,
the capacity of the remaining well(s) pumping twenty- four (24) hours a day shall equal or exceed the design
maximum daily demand, except those systems requiring only one well. The capacity from an additional
source (Surface Water Plant or Master Meter) will be included in the quantity analysis. However,
emergency and stand-by wells will not be included in the quantity analysis.

  (2) Quality - Where the water quality does not meet the drinking water standards established in R.61-
58.5, appropriate treatment designed in accordance with R.61-58.2 shall be provided.

  (3) Site Considerations -

     (a) Location -

        (i) The location of the public well shall be at least one hundred (100) feet from all potential pollution
sources except where the professional engineer or professional geologist can justify a lesser distance based
in part on hydrogeological conditions or special well construction techniques or where the pollution source
is designed in such a manner as to prevent the release of contaminants to the environment. A greater
pollution free radius shall be required where water from water table aquifers will be used. A Wellhead
Protection Area Inventory must be performed based on the location and expected yield of the proposed
well.

        (ii) The well location shall be at least fifty (50) feet from all surface water bodies including drainage
ditches. The site must be such that the wellhead can be protected above the one hundred (100) year flood
plain. Special construction techniques may be required by the Department in any area which is generally
subject to flooding and the professional engineer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department
that the site selected is the best available. No well(s) shall be constructed in such proximity to existing wells
as to cause unwarranted well interference.



35 | Regulation 61-58.2
      (b) Easement - Once the pollution free radius is established according to R.61- 58.2(B)(3)(a), an
appropriate easement, ownership or deed restriction to ensure the required pollution-free radius shall be
filed at the county courthouse. A copy of the deed must be submitted to the Department prior to placing the
well into operation. If a right-of- way easement is needed to maintain access to the well, such an easement
shall be filed at the county courthouse and a copy submitted to the Department prior to placing the well into
operation.

      (c) Special Considerations - Wells located within two hundred (200) feet of a body of water, or
constructed such that water is being drawn from less than fifty (50) feet in depth, or constructed such that
the filter material extends to less than fifty (50) feet below grade, must conduct special monitoring required
in R.61-58.2(B)(14)(c). This monitoring must be conducted within one year of receiving the permit to
operate. If the well is found to be under the direct influence of surface water, treatment must be added and
monitoring conducted in accordance with the requirements of R.61-58.10, Filtration and Disinfection.

      (4) All materials and products installed in a public water system after December 31, 1995, which
comes into direct contact with drinking water during the treatment, storage, transmission or distribution of
the water, shall be certified as meeting the specifications of the American National Standard
Institute/National Sanitation Foundation Standard 61, Drinking Water System Components - Health
Effects. The certifying party shall be accredited by the American National Standards Institute.

     (5) Drilling and Sampling -

        (a) Driller's log - A driller's log shall be completed for each well and shall include a depth reference
point, the depth of each formation change, a description of each forma- tion including color, mineralogy,
rock type, grain size, and any other observations which may have a bearing on the final construction of the
well. Special attention is required in the case of Type I wells in that the log shall denote the depth, thickness,
and approximate flow of each fracture or fracture zone as measured by discharge during air circulation
hammer/rotary drilling. The Department must be provided two (2) copies of the driller's log prior to the
construction of the pumping, treatment or distribution facilities associated with the well or with the
engineer's certification letter if the project is permitted in one step.

       (b) Geophysical/Mechanical logs - Where required by the Department, two (2) copies shall be
provided to the Department prior to the construction of the pumping, treatment or distribution facilities
associated with the well or with the engineer's certification letter if the project is permitted in one step.

       (c) Penetration rate log - Where required by the Department, two (2) copies shall be provided to
the Department prior to the construction of the pumping, treatment or distribution facilities associated with

and be analyzed for total coliform bacteria. The results of both samples must show the absence of total
coliform bacteria using membrane filter methodology. The measured chlorine residual and non-coliform
growth must also be reported. If the non-coliform growth is greater than eighty (80) colonies per one
hundred (100) milliliters, the sample result will be deemed invalid and must be repeated. All samples must
be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Department. The Department may request that heterotrophic
plate count analyses be conducted on a case- by-case basis where construction, development, or disinfection
problems are suspected.

      (b) Chemical and radiological analysis - Representative clear samples shall be properly collected and
preserved and shall be analyzed by a certified laboratory. The sample shall be analyzed for all contaminants
listed in R.61-58.5 and all other parameters needed to determine the aggressiveness of the water to include,

rainfall events (at least 2 inch over a 24 hour period); and,

       (iii) where the above analysis indicates a possible problem, microscopic particulate analysis must
be conducted.

  If these analyses indicate that the well is under direct surface water influence, treatment must be added
and monitoring conducted in accordance with R.61-58.10 or the well must be abandoned in accordance
with R.61-58.2(B)(15).

  (15) Permanent Well and Test Hole Abandonment - All wells and test holes that are not completed as a
production, monitoring or observation well shall be properly abandoned. Abandonment of these wells shall
be performed by a certified well driller.

surface.

        (iv) Bridging for deep wells - Very deep wells that do not require complete filling for sanitary
protection may be backfilled with clean sand or gravel to the depth appropriate for the bottom of the plug
of sealing materials. Where open casing (types II or III wells) or open borehole (types I or IV wells) is to
remain below the sealed depth, a temporary bridge or plug made of inorganic materials (e.g., metal, cement)
or manufactured devices specifically designed for this purpose in well construction and made of plastic or
other elastic materials (e.g., neoprene, rubber) may be used to support the column of sealing materials until
they cure and bond to the casing or borehole. The column of sealing materials is installed above the
temporary bridge.

  In Type I or IV wells, the column of permanent sealing materials may be set with the bottom at least ten
(10) feet below the top of firm bedrock or limestone and extending up to within five (5) feet of the ground
surface. The casing may be removed if desired and the borehole abandoned by grouting instead. The upper

etc.) the casing must be properly installed with the appropriate grouted material or else removed and the
borehole abandoned by grouting.

     (vi) Contaminated wells - wells tapping multiple aquifers of different hydrostatic heads or wells
tapping multiple zones of significantly different water quality must be abandoned in a manner such that
contaminated or lower quality water does not migrate through the abandoned well or borehole and such that
ongoing large vertical transfers of water between aquifers, of any quality, do not occur. The methods
proposed for sealing such wells shall be reviewed and will require prior written approval by the Department,
completely filling an uncased borehole with sealing materials shall be acceptable without prior approval.

     (vii) In sealing a double wall or multiple cased well, the certified well driller shall submit a drawing
with a description of the proposed procedure.

        (c) Well abandonment records - Before the equipment is removed from the site, the exact location
of the abandoned well or hole shall be accurately surveyed and a record made to the location with respect
to several fixed reference points. All information relative to the abandonment procedures, the location,

sample result is invalid and must be repeated. All samples must be analyzed by a certified laboratory. The
Department may request that heterotrophic plate count analyses be conducted on a case-by-case basis where
disinfection problems are suspected.

102 | Regulation 61-58.4
   (3) Washwater Tanks - Washwater tanks shall be designed in accordance with R.61- 58.4(C)(1) and
shall be sized, in conjunction with available pump units and finished water storage, to provide the backwash
water required by R.61-58.3(D)(5)(a)(xi). Consideration must be given to the backwashing of several filters
in rapid succession.

  (4) Clearwell -

      (a) Clearwell storage shall be sized, in conjunction with distribution system storage, to relieve the
filters from having to follow fluctuations in water use.

shall be given to size and baffling.

     (c) An overflow shall be provided.

     (d) Finished water must not be stored or conveyed in a compartment adjacent to unsafe water when
the two compartments are separated by a single wall.

   (5) Hydropneumatic (Pressure) tanks - Hydropneumatic (pressure) tanks, when provided as the only
storage facility, are acceptable only in small water systems. For systems serving more than three hundred
(300) taps or more than one thousand (1000) people, elevated storage shall be provided. Pressure tank
storage shall not be considered for fire protection purposes, unless standby power is provided and the
pumping capacity from wells or ground storage exceeds the fire flow demand with the largest well or pump
out of service. Pressure tanks five hundred (500) gallons and larger shall meet the requirements of the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers for the construction and installation of unfired pressure vessels
and shall carry its approval stamp.

    (a) The tank shall be located above normal ground surface and shall be fenced to protect it from
vandalism.

     (b) Sizing - For surface and ground water systems where the pump yield equals or exceeds the
instantaneous demand, the tank shall be sized so the pump cycles a maximum of six (6) times per hour.
Where the pump yield is less than the instantaneous demand the tank shall be sized to provide the difference
for a minimum twenty (20) minute demand period based on the actual usable volume of the tank.

     (c) Bypass Piping - A flow through arrangement is required for all hydropneumatic storage tanks.
However, the tank shall also be equipped with bypass piping to permit the tank to be removed from service

applied wax, cold applied wax, grease, and coal tar coatings are not acceptable.

     (g) Disinfection - Hydropneumatic storage tanks shall be disinfected in accordance with current
American Waterworks Association (AWWA) Standard for the disinfection of water storage facilities. Prior
to sampling, the chlorine residual must be reduced to normal system residual levels or be non-detectable in
those systems not chlorinating. A minimum of two (2) samples must be collected and analyzed for total
coliform bacteria. These samples must be collected at least twenty-four (24) hours apart and results must
show the absence of total coliform bacteria. The chlorine residual must also be measured and reported. If
the membrane filter method of analysis is used for the coliform analysis, non-coliform growth must also be
reported. If the non-coliform growth is greater than eighty (80) colonies per one hundred (100) ml, the
sample result is invalid and must be repeated. All samples must be analyzed by a certified laboratory. The
Department may request that heterotrophic plate count analyses be conducted on a case-by-case basis where
disinfection problems are suspected.

     (h) The pressure range of hydropneumatic tanks shall not exceed twenty (20) pounds per square inch.

excess of maximum peak hourly flow.

     (b) Diameter - The minimum size of water mains for providing fire protection and serving fire
hydrants shall be six (6) inches in diameter. Larger size mains will be required if necessary to allow the
withdrawal of the required fire flow while maintaining the minimum residual pressure specified in R.61-
58.4(D)(4)(a).

  (5) No line extension shall be made of an existing line when the existing line does not meet the minimum
pressure and flow requirements of this regulation.

  (6) Dead ends -

     (a) Dead ends shall be minimized by looping of all mains whenever practical.

     (b) The lengths of small dead end lines shall not exceed the following:

       (i) One (1) inch diameter --- 150 ft.

whichever is greater.

105 | Regulation 61-58.4
     (e) Lines ten (10) inches and larger require flows in excess of five hundred (500) gallons per minute
to achieve a two and a half (2.5) feet per second scouring velocity. This would require a standard fire
hydrant or other approved blow-off, for flushing which must be designed to provide at least five hundred
(500) gallons per minute in excess of peak hourly flow and a minimum residual pressure of twenty (20)
pounds per square inch.

     (f) No flushing device shall be directly connected to any sewer.

R.61-58.4.D(7). Post hydrants shall not be used on lines smaller than three (3) inches. Design calculations
must be submitted when utilizing post hydrants on three (3) inch lines. These calculations must show one
hundred (100) gallons per minute in excess of peak hourly flow can be maintained, and provide a residual
pressure greater than or equal to twenty (20) pounds per square inch.

  (10) Air Relief Valves, Valve, Meter and Blow-Off Chambers

     (a) Air relief valves - Air relief valves shall be provided in accordance with sound engineering
practice at high points in water mains as required. Automatic air relief valves shall not be used in situations
where flooding of the manhole or chamber may occur.

     (b) Air relief valve piping - The open end of an air relief pipe from automatic valves or from a
manually operated valve shall be extended to the top of the pit and provided with a screened downward

adequately support and protect the pipe. Stones, other than crushed bedding, shall not come in contact with
the pipe and shall not be within six (6) inches of the pipe.

     (c) Cover - All water mains shall be provided with a minimum thirty (30) inches of cover. Where
this is not possible, pipe shall be steel, concrete, ductile iron, or other approved material and method
approved by the Department, and, when necessary, insulated to prevent freezing.

     (d) Blocking - All tees, bends, plugs and hydrants on lines two and one half inches in diameter and
larger shall be provided with reaction blocking, tie rods or other approved restraining methods to prevent
movement.

     (e) Pressure and leakage testing - All newly installed pipe shall be pressure tested and leakage tested
in accordance with American Water Works Association (AWWA) Standard C600.

     (f) Disinfection - Disinfection of all new water mains shall be in accordance with current American
Water Works Association (AWWA) Standard C651 for the disinfection of water mains. In general one
approved method referred to as "continuous feed method" is as follows: Before being placed in service,
all new mains shall be thoroughly flushed then chlorinated with not less than twenty-five (25) milligrams
per liter of available chlorine. Water from the existing distribution system or other source of supply shall
be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid pipeline during the application of chlorine. The
solution shall be retained in the pipeline for not less than twenty-four (24) hours and then flushed thoroughly
with a potable water of satisfactory bacteriological quality before starting the sampling program.

   The contractor or owner shall collect a minimum of two (2) samples from each sampling site for total
coliform analysis. The number of sites depends on the amount of new construction but must include all
dead-end lines and be representative of the water in the newly constructed mains. Prior to sampling, the
chlorine residual must be reduced to normal system residual levels or be non-detectable in those systems
not chlorinating. These samples must be collected at least twenty-four (24) hours apart and must show the
water line to be absent of total coliform bacteria. The chlorine residual must also be measured and reported.
If the membrane filter method of analysis is used for the coliform analysis, non-coliform growth must also
be reported. If the non-coliform growth is greater than eighty (80) colonies per one hundred (100) milliliters,
the sample result is invalid and must be repeated. All samples must be analyzed by a certified laboratory.
The Department may request that heterotrophic plate count analyses be conducted on a case-by-case basis
where disinfection problems are suspected.

    (g) Detection of mains - All mains shall be detectable within three (3) feet with electronic locating
equipment. Non-metallic pipes shall be installed with copper wire or other means of detection.

     (h) Contaminated Areas - All water mains shall be located out of all contaminated areas. If the main
must run through a contaminated site, the main material must protect the water system from being
contaminated (e.g. Ductile Iron Pipe with chemical resistant gaskets).

or proposed sewer. The distance shall be measured edge to edge. In cases where it is not practical to
maintain a ten foot separation, the Department may allow deviation on a case-by-case basis, if supported
by data from the design engineer. Such deviation may allow installation of the water main closer to a sewer,
provided that the water main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located on one side
of the sewer at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least eighteen (18) inches above
the top of the sewer.

      (b) Crossings - Water mains crossing sewers shall be laid to provide a minimum vertical separation
of eighteen (18) inches between the outside of the water main and the outside of the sewer. This shall be
the case whether the water main is either above or below the sewer line. Whenever possible, the water main
shall be located above the sewer line. Where a new water main crosses a new sewer line, a full length of
pipe shall be used for both the water main and sewer line and the crossing shall be arranged so that the
joints of each line will be as far as possible from the point of crossing and each other. Where a new water
main crosses an existing sewer line, one full length of water pipe shall be located so both joints will be as
far from the sewer line as possible. Where a water main crosses under a sewer, adequate structural support
shall be provided for the sewer line to prevent damage to the water main.

     (c) Special Conditions - When it is impossible to obtain the distances specified in R.61-
58.4(D)(12)(a) and (b) the Department may allow an alternative design. Any alternative design shall:

and sanitary sewer force mains. There shall be an eighteen (18) inch vertical separation at crossing as
required in R.61-58.4(D)(12)(a) and (b).

     (e) Sewer manholes - No water pipe shall pass through or come in contact with any part of a sewer
manhole. Water lines may come in contact with storm sewers or catch basins if there is no other practical
alternative, provided that ductile iron is used, no joints of the water line are within the storm sewer or catch
basin and the joints are located as far as possible from the storm sewer or catch basin.

     (f) Drain-fields and Spray-fields - Potable water lines shall not be laid less than twenty-five (25) feet
horizontally from any portion of a waste-water tile-field or spray- field, or shall be otherwise protected by
an acceptable method approved by the Department.

** The MCL for arsenic is 0.05 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for all public water systems until January 23,
2006.

112 | Regulation 61-58.5
   (3) At the discretion of the Department, nitrate levels not to exceed twenty milligrams per liter may be
allowed in a non-community water system if the supplier of water demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Department that:

     (a) Such water will not be available to children under six months of age; and,

     (b) The non-community water system is meeting the public notification requirements under R.61-
58.6(E)(9), including continuous posting of the fact that nitrate levels exceed ten (10) milligrams per liter
and the potential health effects of exposure; and,

     (c) No adverse health effects shall result from the consumption of this water.

C. Primary Inorganic Chemical Sampling and Analytical Requirements.

   (1) The monitoring requirements for inorganic contaminants specified in Section B (2)(b), (c), (d), (e),
(g), (k), (l), (m), (n), and (o) above apply to community water systems and non-transient non- community
water systems. The monitoring requirements for inorganic contaminants specified in Section B (2)(a) and
(f) above only apply to community water systems. Beginning January 22, 2004, the monitoring
requirements for the inorganic contaminant specified in Section B (2)(a) above will apply to community
water systems and non-transient, non-community water systems. The monitoring required for inorganic
contaminants specified in Section B (2)(h), (i) and (j) above apply to community, non-transient non-
community and transient non-community water systems.

  (2) Analytical methods used to comply with Section B above, shall be made using EPA- approved
methods listed in 40 CFR 141. Analyses for the purpose of determining compliance with Section B above
are required as follows:

     (a) Analyses for all community water systems utilizing surface water sources, in whole or in part,
shall be completed within one year following the effective date of this regulation. These analyses shall be
repeated at yearly intervals.

     (b) Analyses for all community water systems utilizing only groundwater sources shall be completed
within two years following the effective date of this regulation. These analyses shall be repeated at three-
year intervals.

     (c) For non-community water systems, whether supplied by surface or groundwater sources, analyses
for nitrate shall be completed within two years following the effective date of this regulation. These analyses
shall be repeated at intervals determined by the Department.

    (d) The Department shall have the authority to determine compliance or to initiate enforcement action
based upon analytical results and other information compiled by the Department.

  (3) If the result of an analysis made pursuant to subsection (2) above indicates that the level of any
contaminant listed in Section B above exceeds the maximum contaminant level, the supplier of water shall
report to the Department within seven days.



113 | Regulation 61-58.5
   (4) When the maximum contaminant level for any contaminant listed in Section B above is exceeded
as determined in accordance with subsection (15) below, the supplier of water shall notify the Department
and give notice to the public pursuant to R. 61-58.6, Reports, Record Retention, and Public Notification,
Sections B and E. Monitoring after public notification shall be at a frequency designated by the Department
and shall continue until the maximum contaminant level has not been exceeded in two successive samples
or until a monitoring schedule as a condition to a variance, exemption, or enforcement action shall become
effective.

  (5) The provisions of subsections (3) and (4) above notwithstanding, compliance with the maximum
contaminant level for nitrate and nitrite shall be determined in accordance with subsection (12)(b) below.

   (6) For the initial analyses required by items (2)(a), (b), or (c) above, data for surface waters acquired
within one year prior to the effective date and data for groundwater acquired within three years prior to the
effective date of this regulation may be substituted at the discretion of the Department. Analyses conducted
to determine compliance with Section B above shall be made in accordance with the analytical methods
adopted by the Department.

  (7) Monitoring for the purpose of determining compliance with the maximum contaminant levels
specified in Section B (2) above, shall be conducted as follows:

     (a) Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution
system which is representative of each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point) beginning in
the initial compliance period. The system shall take each sample at the same sampling point unless
conditions make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant.

     (b) Surface water systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution
system after any application of treatment or in the distribution system at a point which is representative of
each source after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point) beginning in the initial compliance period.
The system shall take each sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling
point more representative of each source or treatment plant. [Note: For purposes of this paragraph, surface
water systems include systems with a combination of surface and ground sources.]

      (c) If a system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before
distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal
operating conditions (i.e., when water is representative of all sources being used).

     (d) The Department may reduce the total number of samples which must be analyzed by allowing the
use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five samples are allowed, provided that the
detection limit of the method used for analysis is less than one-fifth of the MCL. Compositing of samples
must be done in the laboratory.

        (i) If the concentration in the composite sample is greater than or equal to one-fifth of the MCL
of any inorganic chemical, then a follow-up sample must be taken within 14 days at each sampling point
included in the composite. These samples must be analyzed for the contaminants which exceeded one-fifth
of the MCL in the composite sample. Detection limits for each analytical method and inorganic contaminant
shall be in accordance with those listed in 40 CFR 141


114 | Regulation 61-58.5
         (ii) If the population served by the system is greater than 3,300 persons, then compositing may
only be permitted by the Department at sampling points within a single system. In systems serving 3,300
persons or less, the Department may permit compositing among different systems provided the 5-sample
limit is maintained.

     (e) The frequency of monitoring for asbestos shall be in accordance with paragraph (8) of this section;
the frequency of monitoring for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cyanide,
fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium and thallium shall be in accordance with paragraph (9) of this section;
the frequency of monitoring for nitrate shall be in accordance with paragraph (10) of this section; and the
frequency of monitoring for nitrite shall be in accordance with paragraph (11) of this section.

   (8) The frequency of monitoring conducted to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant
level for asbestos specified in Section B(2) above shall be conducted as follows:

    (a) Each community and non-transient, non-community water system is required to monitor for
asbestos during the first three-year compliance period of each nine-year compliance cycle beginning in the
compliance period starting January 1, 1993.

     (b) If the system believes it is not vulnerable to either asbestos contamination in its source water or
due to corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe, or both, it may apply to the Department for a waiver of the
monitoring requirement in paragraph (8)(a) of this section. If the Department grants the waiver, the system
is not required to monitor.

    (c) The Department may grant a waiver based on a consideration of the following factors:

         (i)   Potential asbestos contamination of the water source; and,

         (ii) The use of asbestos-cement pipe for finished water distribution and the corrosive nature of the
water.

     (d) A waiver remains in effect until the completion of the three-year compliance period. Systems not
receiving a waiver must monitor in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (8)(a) of this section.

     (e) A system vulnerable to asbestos contamination due solely to corrosion of asbestos-cement pipe
shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions where asbestos
contamination is most likely to occur.

    (f) A system vulnerable to asbestos contamination due solely to source water shall monitor in
accordance with the provision of paragraph (7) of this section.

     (g) A system vulnerable to asbestos contamination due both to its source water supply and corrosion
of asbestos-cement pipe shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos-cement pipe and under conditions
where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur.

     (h) A system which exceeds the maximum contaminant levels as determined in paragraph (15) of this
section shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the violation occurred.


115 | Regulation 61-58.5
     (i) The Department may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement to the frequency specified in
paragraph (8)(a) of this section provided the Department has determined that the system is reliably and
consistently below the maximum contaminant level. In no case can the Department make this determination
unless a groundwater system takes a minimum of two quarterly samples and a surface (or combined
surface/ground) water system takes a minimum of four quarterly samples.

     (j) If monitoring data collected after January 1, 1990 are generally consistent with the requirements
of paragraph (8) of this section, then the Department may allow systems to use that data to satisfy the
monitoring requirement for the initial compliance period beginning January 1, 1993.

   (9) The frequency of monitoring conducted to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant
levels in Section B(2) above for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cyanide,
fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium, and thallium shall be as follows:

     (a) Groundwater systems shall take one sample at each sampling point during each compliance
period. Surface water systems (or combined surface/ground) shall take one sample annually at each
sampling point.

     (b) The system may apply to the Department for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified
in paragraph (9)(a) of this section. The Department may grant a public water system a waiver for monitoring
of cyanide, provided that the Department determines that the system is not vulnerable due to lack of any
industrial source of cyanide.

       (c) A condition of the waiver shall require that a system shall take a minimum of one sample while
the waiver is effective. The term during which the waiver is effective shall not exceed one compliance cycle
(i.e., nine years).

      (d) The Department may grant a waiver provided surface water systems have monitored annually for
at least three years and groundwater systems have conducted a minimum of three rounds of monitoring. (At
least one sample shall have been taken since January 1, 1990.) Both surface and groundwater systems shall
demonstrate that all previous analytical results were less than the maximum contaminant level. Systems
that use a new water source are not eligible for a waiver until three rounds of monitoring from the new
source have been completed.

    (e) In determining the appropriate reduced monitoring frequency, the Department shall consider:

       (i)   Reported concentrations from all previous monitoring;

       (ii) The degree of variation in reported concentrations; and

      (iii) Other factors which may affect contaminant concentrations such as changes in groundwater
pumping rates, changes in the system's configuration, changes in the system's operating procedures, or
changes in stream flows or characteristics.

     (f) A decision by the Department to grant a waiver shall be made in writing and shall set forth the
basis for the determination. The determination may be initiated by the Department or upon an application
by the public water system. The public water system shall specify the basis for its request. The Department

116 | Regulation 61-58.5
shall review and, where appropriate, revise its determination of the appropriate monitoring frequency when
the system submits new monitoring data or when other data relevant to the system's appropriate monitoring
frequency become available.

     (g) Systems which exceed the maximum contaminant levels as calculated in paragraph (15) of this
section shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the violation occurred.

     (h) The Department may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement to the frequencies specified
in paragraphs (9)(a) and (9)(c) of this section provided it has determined that the system is reliably and
consistently below the maximum contaminant level. In no case can the Department make this determination
unless a groundwater system takes a minimum of two quarterly samples and a surface water system takes
a minimum of four quarterly samples.

     (i) All new systems or systems that use a new source of water that begin operation after January 22,
2004 must demonstrate compliance with the MCL within a period of time specified by the Department. The
system must also comply with the initial sampling frequencies specified by the Department to ensure a
system can demonstrate compliance with the MCL. Routine and increased monitoring frequencies shall be
conducted in accordance with the requirements in this section.

  (10) All public water systems (community; non-transient, non-community; and transient, non-
community) shall monitor to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant level for nitrate in
Section B above.

     (a) Community and non-transient, non-community water systems served by groundwater systems
shall monitor annually beginning January 1, 1993; systems served by surface water shall monitor quarterly
beginning January 1, 1993.

     (b) For community and non-transient, non-community water systems, the repeat monitoring
frequency for ground water systems shall be quarterly for at least one year following any one sample in
which the concentration is 50 percent or more of the MCL. The Department may allow a groundwater
system to reduce the sampling frequency to annually after four consecutive quarterly samples are reliably
and consistently less than the MCL.

     (c) For community and non-transient, non-community water systems, the Department may allow a
surface water system to reduce the sampling frequency to annually if all analytical results from four
consecutive quarters are less than 50 percent of the MCL. A surface water system shall return to quarterly
monitoring if any one sample is 50 percent or more of the MCL.

    (d) Each transient non-community water system shall monitor annually beginning January 1, 1993.

    (e) After the initial round of quarterly sampling is completed, each community and non-transient
non-community system which is monitoring annually shall take subsequent samples during the quarter(s)
which previously resulted in the highest analytical result.

   (11) All public water systems (community; non-transient, non-community; and transient, non-
community systems) shall monitor to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant level for nitrite
in Section B above.

117 | Regulation 61-58.5
    (a) All public water systems shall take one sample at each sampling point in the compliance period
beginning January 1, 1993 and ending December 31, 1995

   (b) After the initial sample, systems where an analytical result for nitrite is less than 50 percent of the
MCL shall monitor at the frequency specified by the Department.

     (c) For community, non-transient, non-community, and transient non-community water systems, the
repeat monitoring frequency for any water system shall be quarterly for at least one year following any one
sample in which the concentration is 50 percent or more of the MCL. The Department may allow a system
to reduce the sampling frequency to annually after determining the system is reliably and consistently less
than the MCL.

    (d) Systems which are monitoring annually shall take each subsequent sample during the quarter(s)
which previously resulted in the highest analytical result

  (12) Confirmation samples:

      (a) Where the results of sampling for asbestos, antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium,
chromium, cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium or thallium indicate an exceedance of the maximum
contaminant level, the Department may require that one additional sample be collected as soon as possible
after the initial sample was taken (but not to exceed two weeks) at the same sampling point.

      (b) Where nitrate or nitrite sampling results indicate an exceedance of the maximum contaminant
level, the system shall take a confirmation sample within twenty-four (24) hours of the system's receipt of
notification of the analytical results of the first sample. Systems unable to comply with the twenty (24) hour
sampling requirement must immediately notify the consumers served by the area served by the public water
system in accordance with R.61-58.6.B and E and meet other Tier 1 public notification requirements under
this regulation. Systems exercising this option must take and analyze a confirmation sample within two
weeks of notification of the analytical results of the first sample.

     (c) If a Department-required confirmation sample is taken for any contaminant, then the results of
the initial and confirmation sample shall be averaged. The resulting average shall be used to determine the
system's compliance in accordance with paragraph (15) of this section. The Department has the discretion
to delete results of obvious sampling errors.

   (13) The Department may require more frequent monitoring than specified in paragraphs (8), (9), (10)
and (11) of this section or may require confirmation samples for positive and negative results at its
discretion.

 (14) Systems may apply to the Department to conduct more frequent monitoring than the minimum
monitoring frequencies specified in this section.

   (15) Compliance with Section B(2) above (as appropriate) shall be determined based on the analytical
result(s) obtained at each sampling point.



118 | Regulation 61-58.5
     (a) For systems which are conducting monitoring at a frequency greater than annual, compliance with
the maximum contaminant levels for antimony, arsenic, asbestos, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium,
cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, selenium, or thallium is determined by a running annual average at any
sampling point. If the average at any sampling point is greater than the MCL, then the system is out of
compliance. If any one sample would cause the annual average to be exceeded, then the system is out of
compliance immediately. Any sample below the method detection limit shall be calculated at zero for the
purpose of determining the annual average. If a system fails to collect the required number of samples,
compliance (average concentration) will be based on the total number of samples collected.

     (b) For systems which are monitoring annually, or less frequently, the system is out of compliance
with the maximum contaminant levels for arsenic, asbestos, antimony, barium, beryllium, cadmium,
chromium, cyanide, fluoride, mercury nickel, selenium or thallium if the level of a contaminant at any
sampling point is greater than the MCL. If a confirmation sample is required by the Department, the
determination of compliance will be based on the average of the two samples. If a system fails to collect
the required number of samples, compliance (average concentration) will be based on the total number of
samples collected.

     (c) Compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for nitrate and nitrite is determined based on
one sample if the levels of these contaminants is below the MCLs. If the levels of nitrate and/or nitrite
exceed the MCLs in the initial sample, a confirmation sample is required in accordance with paragraph
(12)(b) of this section, and compliance shall be determined based on the average of the initial and
confirmation samples

    (d) Arsenic sampling results will be reported to the nearest 0.001 mg/L.

  (16) Each public water system shall monitor at the time designated by the Department during each
compliance period

  (17) Inorganic Analysis

      (a) Analysis for antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cyanide, fluoride,
mercury, nickel, nitrate, nitrite, selenium, and thallium shall be conducted using EPA-approved methods
listed in 40 CFR 141.

    (b) Sample collection for antimony, arsenic, asbestos, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium,
cyanide, fluoride, mercury, nickel, nitrate, nitrite, selenium, and thallium under this section shall be
conducted using EPA-approved methods listed in 40 CFR 141.

    (c) Analysis under this section shall only be conducted by laboratories that have been certified by the
Department.

D. Maximum Contaminant Levels for Organic Chemicals.

   (1) The following are the maximum contaminant levels for organic chemicals. The MCLs specified in
R.61-58.5(D)(2) below, apply to all public water systems. The maximum contaminant level for total
trihalomethanes is pursuant to Section P below.

  (6) Reserved.

  (7) Analytical methods used to comply with Section D(2)(b) above, shall be made using EPA-approved
methods listed in 40 CFR 141. Analysis of the contaminants listed in Section D(2)(b) above, for the
purposes of determining compliance with the maximum contaminant level shall be conducted as follows:

     (a) Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution
system which is representative of each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). Each sample
must be taken at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more
representative of each source or treatment plant.

      (b) Surface water systems shall take a minimum of one sample at points in the distribution system
that are representative of each source or at each entry point to the distribution system after treatment
(hereafter called a sampling point). Each sample must be taken at the same sampling point unless conditions
make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant. [Note: For purposes of
this paragraph, surface water systems include systems with a combination of surface and ground sources.]

      (c) If the system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before
distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal
operating conditions (i.e., when water representative of all sources is being used).

    (d) Monitoring frequency:

       (i) Each community and non-transient non-community water system shall take four consecutive
quarterly samples for each contaminant listed in Section D(2)(b) above, during each compliance period
beginning with the initial compliance period.

       (ii) Systems serving more than 3,300 persons which do not detect a contaminant in the initial
compliance period, may reduce the sampling frequency to a minimum of two quarterly samples in one year
during each repeat compliance period.

      (iii) Systems serving 3,300 persons or less which do not detect a contaminant in the initial
compliance period may reduce the sampling frequency to a minimum of one sample during each repeat
compliance period.

     (e) Each community and non-transient water system may apply to the Department for a waiver from
the requirement of paragraph (7)(d) of this section. A system must reapply for a waiver for each compliance
period.

     (f) The Department may grant a waiver after evaluating the following factor(s): Knowledge of
previous use (including transport, storage, or disposal) of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of
influence of the system. If a determination by the Department reveals no previous use of the contaminant
within the watershed or zone of influence, a waiver may be granted. If previous use of the contaminant is
unknown or it has been used previously, then the following factors shall be used to determine whether a
waiver is granted.

        (ii) The proximity of the system to a potential point or non-point source of contamination. Point
sources include spills and leaks of chemicals at or near a water treatment facility or at manufacturing,
distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal waste landfills and other waste handling
or treatment facilities. Non-point sources include the use of pesticides to control insect and weed pests on
agricultural areas, forest lands, home and gardens, and other land application uses.

       (iii) The environmental persistence and transport of the pesticide or PCBs.

       (iv) How well the water source is protected against contamination due to such factors as depth of
the well and the type of soil and the integrity of the well casing.

       (v) Elevated nitrate levels at the water supply source.

       (vi) Use of PCBs in equipment used in the production, storage, or distribution of water (i.e., PCBs
used in pumps, transformers, etc.).

     (g) If an organic contaminant listed in Section D(2)(b) above, is detected (as defined by paragraph
(7)(r) of this section) in any sample, then:

       (i)   Each system must monitor quarterly at each sampling point which resulted in a detection.

        (ii) The Department may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement specified in paragraph
(7)(g)(i) of this section provided it has determined that the system is reliably and consistently below the
maximum contaminant level. In no case shall the Department make this determination unless a groundwater
system takes a minimum of two quarterly samples and a surface water system takes a minimum of four
quarterly samples.

       (iii) After the Department determines the system is reliably and consistently below the maximum
contaminant level the Department may allow the system to monitor annually. Systems which monitor
annually must monitor during the quarter that previously yielded the highest analytical result.

       (iv) Systems which have 3 consecutive annual samples with no detection of a contaminant may
apply to the Department for a waiver as specified in paragraph (7)(f) of this section.

        (v) Groundwater systems which have detected one or more of the following two-carbon organic
compounds: trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2,- dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, cis-1,2-
dichloroethylene, trans-1,2- dichloroethylene, or 1,1-dichloroethylene shall monitor quarterly for vinyl
chloride. A vinyl chloride sample shall be taken at each sampling point at which one or more of the two-
carbon organic compounds was detected. If the results of the first analysis do not detect vinyl chloride, the
Department may reduce the quarterly monitoring frequency of vinyl chloride monitoring to one sample
during each compliance period. Surface water systems are required to monitor for vinyl chloride as
specified by the Department.



122 | Regulation 61-58.5
      (h) Systems which violate the requirements of Section D(2)(b) above, as determined by paragraph
(7)(k) of this section must monitor quarterly. After a minimum of four quarterly samples show the system
is in compliance and the Department determines the system is reliably and consistently below the MCL, as
specified in paragraph (7)(k) of this section, the system shall monitor at the frequency specified in paragraph
(7)(g)(iii) of this section.

     (i) The Department may require a confirmation sample for positive or negative results. If a
confirmation sample is required by the Department, the result must be averaged with the first sampling
result and the average used for the compliance determination as specified by paragraph (7)(k) of this section.
The Department has the discretion to delete results of obvious sampling errors from this calculation.

      (j) The Department may reduce the total number of samples a system must analyze by allowing the
use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five sampling points are allowed, provided
that the detection limit of the method used for analysis is less than one-fifth of the MCL. Compositing of
samples must be done in the laboratory and analyzed within 14 days of sample collection.

       (i) If the concentration in the composite sample detects one or more contaminants listed in Section
D(2)(b) above, then a follow-up sample must be taken 14 days at each sampling point included in the
composite, and be analyzed for that contaminant.

        (ii) If duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling point used in the composite are
available, the system may use these duplicates instead of resampling. The duplicate must be analyzed and
the results reported to the Department within 14 days of collection.

        (iii) If the population served by the system is more than 3,300 persons, then compositing may only
be permitted by the Department at sampling points within a single system. In systems serving 3,300 persons
or less, the Department may permit compositing among different systems provided the 5-sample limit is
maintained.

     (k) Compliance with Section D(2)(b) above, shall be determined based on the analytical results
obtained at each sampling point. If one sampling point is in violation of an MCL, the system is in violation
of the MCL.

       (i) For systems monitoring more than once per year, compliance with the MCL is determined by
a running annual average at each sampling point.

        (ii) Systems monitoring annually or less frequently whose sample result exceeds the regulatory
detection level as defined by paragraph (7)(r) of this section must begin quarterly sampling. The system
will not be considered in violation of the MCL until it has completed one year of quarterly sampling.

        (iii) If any sample result will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL at any sampling
point, the system is out of compliance with the MCL immediately.

        (iv) If a system fails to collect the required number of samples, compliance will be based on the
total number of samples collected.



123 | Regulation 61-58.5
       (v) If a sample result is less than the detection limit, zero will be used to calculate the annual
average.

     (l)         [Reserved]

     (m) Analysis for PCBs shall be conducted using EPA-approved methods listed in 40 CFR 141.

           (i)     [Reserved]

           (ii) [Reserved]

       (iii) Compliance with the PCB MCL shall be determined based upon the quantitative results of
analyses using EPA-approved methods listed in 40 CFR 141.

      (n) If monitoring data collected after January 1, 1990, are generally consistent with the requirements
of this section, then the Department may allow systems to use that data to satisfy the monitoring requirement
for the initial compliance period beginning January 1, 1993.

     (o) The Department may increase the required monitoring frequency, where necessary, to detect
variations within the system (e.g., fluctuations in concentration due to seasonal use, changes in water
source).

    (p) The Department has the authority to determine compliance or initiate enforcement action based
upon analytical results and other information compiled by the Department.

   (q) Each public water system shall monitor at the time designated by the Department within each
compliance period.

    (r) Detection as used in this paragraph shall be defined as greater than or equal to the following
concentrations for each contaminant.

     (s) All new systems or systems that used a new source of water that begin operation after January
22, 2004 must demonstrate compliance with the MCL within a period of time specified by the Department.
The system must also comply with the initial sampling frequencies specified by the Department to ensure
a system can demonstrate compliance with the MCL. Routine and increased monitoring frequencies shall
be conducted in accordance with the requirements in this section.

F. Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for Microbiological Contaminants.

  These maximum contaminant levels shall apply to all public water systems.

   (1) Until March 31, 2016, the total coliform MCL is based on the presence or absence of total coliforms
in a sample, rather than coliform density.

     (a) For a system which collects at least forty (40) samples per month, if no more than five (5.0)
percent of the samples collected during a month are total coliform-positive, the system is in compliance
with the MCL for total coliforms.

      (b) For a system which collects fewer than forty (40) samples per month, if no more than one (1)
sample collected during a month is total coliform -positive, the system is in compliance with the MCL for
total coliforms.

   (2) Until March 31, 2016, any fecal coliform-positive repeat sample or E. coli-positive repeat sample,
or any total coliform-positive repeat sample following a fecal coliform-positive or E. coli-positive routine
sample constitutes a violation of the MCL for total coliforms. For purposes of the public notification
requirements in R.61 58.6.E, this is a violation that may pose an acute risk to health.

  (3) Beginning April 1, 2016, a system is in compliance with the MCL for E. coli for samples taken
under provisions of R.61-58.17 unless any of the conditions identified in R.61-58.5.F(3)(a) through (d)
occur. For purposes of the public notification requirements in R.61-58.6.E, violation of the MCL may pose
an acute risk to health.

125 | Regulation 61-58.5
    (a) The system has an E. coli-positive repeat sample following a total coliform- positive routine
sample.

    (b) The system has a total coliform-positive repeat sample following an E. coli- positive routine
sample.

     (c) The system fails to take all required repeat samples following an E. coli-positive routine sample.

     (d) The system fails to test for E. coli when any repeat sample tests positive for total coliform.

  (4) Until March 31, 2016, a public water system must determine compliance with the MCL for total
coliforms in R.61-58.5.F(1) and (2) for each month in which it is required to monitor for total coliforms.
Beginning April 1, 2016, a public water system must determine compliance with the MCL for E. coli in
R.61-58.5.F(3) for each month in which it is required to monitor for total coliforms.

   (5) The United States Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, pursuant to section 1412 of the
federal Safe Drinking Water Act, has identified the following as the best technology, treatment techniques,
or other means available for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant level for total coliforms
in R.61-58.5.F (1)and (2) and for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant level for E. coli in
R.61-58.5.F(3):

     (a) Protection of wells from fecal contamination by appropriate placement and construction;

     (b) Maintenance of a disinfection residual throughout the distribution system;

     (c) Proper maintenance of the distribution system including appropriate pipe placement and repair
procedures, main flushing programs, proper operation and maintenance of storage tanks and reservoirs,
cross connection control, and continual maintenance of positive water pressure in all parts of the distribution
system;

    (d) Filtration and/or disinfection of surface water, as described in R.61-58.10, or disinfection of
ground water, as described in R.61-58.16, using strong oxidants such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or
ozone; and

     (e) For systems using ground water, compliance with the requirements of an EPA- approved
Department Wellhead Protection Program developed and implemented under section 1428 of the federal
Safe Drinking Water Act.

   (6) The United States Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, pursuant to section 1412 of the
federal Safe Drinking Water Act, identifies the technology, treatment techniques, or other means available
identified in R.61-58.5.F(5) as affordable technology, treatment techniques, or other means available to
systems serving 10,000 or fewer people for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant level for
total coliforms in R.61-58.5.F(1) and (2) and for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant
level for E. coli in R.61-58.5.F(3).

G. Microbiological Contaminant Sampling and Analytical Requirements.

126 | Regulation 61-58.5
  These sampling and analytical requirements shall apply to community and non-community water
systems. Analytical methods used to comply with Section F above, shall be made using EPA-approved
methods listed in 40 CFR 141.

  (1) Routine Monitoring.

     (a) Community and non-community water systems shall collect total coliform samples at sites which
are representative of water throughout the distribution system according to a written sample siting plan.
These plans are subject to Department review and revision.

    (b) The monitoring frequency for total coliforms for community water systems is based on the
population served by the system, as follows:

         Population Served                        Minimum # of Samples Per Month
          25               to      1,0001                 1

    Includes public water systems which have at least fifteen (15) service connections, but serve fewer than twenty-five (25) persons.


   If a community water system serving twenty-five (25) to one-thousand (1,000) persons has no history of
total coliform contamination in its current configuration and a sanitary survey conducted in the past five
years shows that the system is supplied solely by a protected groundwater source and is free of sanitary
defects, the Department may reduce the monitoring frequency specified above, except that in no case may
the Department reduce the monitoring frequency to less than one sample per quarter. The Department must
approve the reduced monitoring frequency in writing.

             (i)    [Reserved]

      (ii) Community water systems shall make at a minimum one fecal or total coliform density
measurement each day from the raw water source, and one coliform density or presence/absence
measurement from the finished water, if treating surface water. This requirement may be waived by the
Department on a case-by-case basis if a public water supply can demonstrate that such monitoring is
unnecessary.

         (c) The monitoring frequency for total coliforms for non-community water systems is as follows:

       (i) A non-community water system using only ground water (except ground water under the direct
influence of surface water) and serving one-thousand (1,000) persons or fewer shall monitor each calendar
quarter that the system provides water to the public, except that the Department may reduce this monitoring
frequency, in writing, if a sanitary survey shows that the system is free of sanitary defects. Beginning June
29, 1994, the Department cannot reduce the monitoring frequency for a non-community water system using
only ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water) and serving one-
thousand (1,000) persons or fewer to less than once per year.

        (ii) A non-community water system using only ground water (except ground water under the direct
influence of surface water) and serving more than one- thousand (1,000) persons during any month shall
monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, as specified in paragraph (1)(b) of
this section, except that the Department may reduce this monitoring frequency, in writing, for any month
the system serves one-thousand (1,000) persons or fewer. The Department cannot reduce the monitoring
frequency to less than once per year. For systems using ground water under the direct influence of surface
water, paragraph (1)(c)(iv) of this section applies.

       (iii) A non-community water system using surface water, in total or in part, shall monitor at the
same frequency as a like-sized community water system, as specified in paragraph (1)(b) of this section,
regardless of the number of persons it serves.

        (iv) A non-community water system using ground water under the direct influence of surface water
shall monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, as specified in paragraph
(1)(b) of this section. The system shall begin monitoring at this frequency beginning six (6) months after
the Department determines that the ground water is under the direct influence of surface water.

     (d) The community or non-community water system shall collect samples at regular time intervals
throughout the month, except that a system which uses ground water (except ground water under the direct

influence of surface water), and serves 4,900 persons or fewer, may collect all required samples on a single
day if they are taken from different sites.

      (e) A community or non-community water systems that uses surface water or ground water under the
direct influence of surface water and does not practice filtration in compliance with R.61-58.10 shall collect
at least one sample near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the source water,
measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(2)(b), exceeds 1 NTU. This sample shall be analyzed for the
presence of total coliforms. When one or more turbidity measurements in any day exceed 1 NTU, the system
shall collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first exceedance, unless the Department determines
that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within
thirty (30) hours of collection. Sample results from this coliform monitoring shall be included in
determining compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Section F above.

     (f) Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfection practices are
sufficient following pipe placement, replacement, or repair, shall not be used to determine compliance with
the MCL for total coliforms in Section F above. Repeat samples taken pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
section are not considered special purpose samples, and shall be used to determine compliance with the
MCL for total coliforms in Section F above.

  (2) Repeat Monitoring.

     (a) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, the community or non-community water system
shall collect a set of repeat samples within twenty-four (24) hours of being notified of the positive result. A
system which collects more than one routine sample per month shall collect no fewer than three repeat
samples for each total coliform-positive sample found. A system which collects one routine sample per
month or fewer shall collect no fewer than four repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample
found. The Department may extend the twenty-four (24) hour limit on a case-by-case basis if the system
has a logistical problem in collecting the repeat samples within twenty-four (24) hours that is beyond its
control. In the case of an extension, the Department shall specify how much time the system has to collect
the repeat samples.

     (b) The system shall collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total
coliform-positive sample was taken, and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections
upstream and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five (5) service connections downstream of the
original sampling site. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one
away from the end of the distribution system, the Department may waive the requirement to collect at least
one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site.

     (c) The system shall collect all repeat samples on the same day, except that the Department may
allow a system with a single service connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a four-
day period or to collect a larger volume repeat sample(s) in one or more sample containers of any size, as
long as the total volume collected is at least 400 ml (300 ml for systems which collect more than one routine
sample per month).

     (d) If one or more repeat samples in the set is total coliform-positive, the water system shall collect
an additional set of repeat samples in the manner specified in paragraphs (2)(a) through (c) of this section.
The additional samples shall be collected within twenty-four (24) hours of being notified of the positive

129 | Regulation 61-58.5
result, unless the Department extends the limit as provided in paragraph (2)(a) of this section. The system
shall repeat this process until either total coliforms are not detected in one complete set of repeat samples
or the system determines that the MCL for total coliforms in Section F above, has been exceeded and
notifies the Department.

      (e) If a system collecting fewer than five routine samples per month has one or more total coliform-
positive samples and the Department does not invalidate the sample(s) under paragraph (3) of this section,
it shall collect at least five routine samples during the next month the system provides water to the public,
except that the Department may waive this requirement if the conditions of paragraph (2)(e)(i) or (ii) of this
section are met. The Department cannot waive the requirement for a system to collect repeat samples in
paragraphs (2)(a) through (d) of this section.

        (i) The Department may waive the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the
system provides water to the public if the Department, or an agent approved by the Department, performs
a site visit before the end of the next month the system provides water to the public. Although a sanitary
survey need not be performed, the site visit shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the Department to
determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The Department cannot
approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an agent approved by
the Department to perform sanitary surveys.

        (ii) The Department may waive the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the
system provides water to the public if the Department has determined why the sample was total coliform-
positive and establishes that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the
end of the next month the system serves water to the public. In this case, the Department shall document
this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved
and signed by the supervisor of the Department official who recommends such a decision, and make this
document available to the EPA and public. The written documentation shall describe the specific cause of
the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take to correct this
problem. The Department cannot waive the requirement to collect five routine samples the next month the
system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative.
Under this paragraph, a system shall still take at least one routine sample before the end of the next month
it serves water to the public and use it to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in R.61-
58.5.F, unless the Department has determined that the system has corrected the contamination problem
before the system took the set of repeat samples required in paragraphs (2)(a) through (d) of this section,
and all repeat samples were total coliform-negative.

     (f) After a system collects a routine sample and before it learns the results of the analysis of that
sample, if it collects another routine sample(s) from within five adjacent service connections of the initial
sample, and the initial sample, after analysis, is found to contain total coliforms, then the system may count
the subsequent sample(s) as a repeat sample instead of as a routine sample.

     (g) Results of all routine and repeat samples not invalidated by the Department shall be included in
determining compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Section F above.

  (3) Invalidation of total coliform samples.



130 | Regulation 61-58.5
  A total coliform-positive sample invalidated under this paragraph does not count towards meeting the
minimum monitoring requirements of this section.

    (a) The Department may invalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if the conditions of
paragraph (3)(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section are met.

          (i)   The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused the total coliform-positive
result.

       (ii) The Department, on the basis of the results of repeat samples collected as required by
paragraphs (2)(a) through (d) of this section, determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted
from a domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem. The Department cannot invalidate a
sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat sample(s) collected at the same tap as the
original total coliform- positive sample are also total coliform-positive, and all repeat samples collected
within five service connections of the original tap are total coliform-negative (e.g., the Department cannot
invalidate a total coliform- positive sample on the basis of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total
coliform- negative, or if the public water system has only one service connection).

        (iii) The Department has substantial grounds to believe that a total coliform- positive result is due
to a circumstance or condition which does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case,
the system shall still collect all repeat samples required under paragraphs (2)(a) through (d) of this section,
and use them to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in Section F above. To invalidate
a total coliform-positive sample under this paragraph, the decision with the rationale for the decision shall
be documented in writing, and approved and signed by the supervisor of the Department official who
recommended the decision. The Department shall make this document available to the EPA and the public.
The written documentation shall state the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample, and what
action the system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem. The Department may not invalidate a total
coliform-positive sample solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative.

     (b) A laboratory shall invalidate a total coliform sample (unless total coliforms are detected) if the
sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas
formation is examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique), produces a turbid culture in the
absence of an acid reaction in the Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent growth or
produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter (e.g.,
Membrane Filter Technique). If a laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the
Department shall be notified, and the system shall collect another sample from the same location as the
original sample within twenty-four (24) hours of being notified of the interference problem, and shall have
it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system shall continue to re-sample within twenty-four
(24) hours and have the samples analyzed until it obtains a valid result. The Department may waive the
twenty-four (24) hour time limit on a case-by-case basis.

  (4) Sanitary Surveys.

     (a) (i)Public water systems which do not collect five (5) or more routine samples per month shall
undergo an initial sanitary survey by June 29, 1994, for community water systems and June 29, 1999, for
non-community water systems. hereafter, systems shall undergo another sanitary survey every five (5)
years, except that non-community water systems using only protected and disinfected ground water, as

131 | Regulation 61-58.5
defined by the Department, shall undergo subsequent sanitary surveys at least every ten (10) years after the
initial sanitary survey. The Department shall review the results of each sanitary survey to determine whether
the existing monitoring frequency is adequate and what additional measures, if any, the system needs to
undertake to improve drinking water quality.

          (ii) In conducting a sanitary survey of a system using ground water in a State having an EPA-
approved wellhead protection program under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, information on sources
of contamination within the delineated wellhead protection area that was collected in the course of
developing and implementing the program should be considered instead of collecting new information, if
the information was collected since the last time the system was subject to a sanitary survey.

    (b) Sanitary surveys shall be performed by the Department or an agent approved by the Department.
The system is responsible for ensuring the survey takes place.

     (c) Sanitary surveys conducted by the Department under the provisions of 40 CFR 142.16(o)(2) may
be used to meet the sanitary survey requirements of R.61-58.5.G(4).

  (5) Fecal coliforms/Escherichia coli (E. coli) testing.

      (a) If any routine or repeat sample is total coliform positive, the system shall analyze that total
coliform-positive culture medium to determine if fecal coliforms are present, except that the system may
test for E. coli in lieu of fecal coliforms. If fecal coliforms or
E. coli are present, the system shall notify the Department by the end of the day when the system is notified
of the test result, unless the system is notified of the result after the Department is closed, in which case the
system shall notify the Department before the end of the next business day.

      (b) The Department has the discretion to allow a public water system, on a case-by- case basis, to
forego fecal coliform or E. coli testing on a total coliform-positive sample if that system assumes that the
total coliform-positive sample is fecal coliform-positive or
E. coli-positive. Accordingly, the system shall notify the Department as specified in paragraph (5)(a) of this
section and the provisions of Section F(2) above, apply.

  (6) Analytical methodology.

    (a) The standard sample volume required for total coliform analysis, regardless of analytical method
used, is 100 ml.

     (b) Water systems need only determine the presence or absence of total coliforms; a determination
of total coliform density is not required.

    (c) Analytical methods used to comply with R.61-58.5.G shall be in accordance with EPA-approved
methods listed in 40 CFR 141 (11-8-06 edition).

    (d) Water systems must conduct fecal coliform analysis in accordance with the procedure outlined in
40 CFR 141.21(f)(5) (11-8-06 edition).



132 | Regulation 61-58.5
     (e) Water systems must conduct Escherichia coli analysis in accordance with the analytical methods
outlined in 40 CFR 141.21(f)(6) (11-8-06 edition).

  (7) Response to violation.

     (a) A water system which has exceeded the MCL for total coliforms in Section F above, shall report
the violation to the Department no later than the end of the next business day after it learns of the violation,
and shall notify the public in accordance with R.61-58.6.E.

      (b) A water system which has failed to comply with a coliform monitoring requirement, including
the sanitary survey requirement, shall report the monitoring violation to the Department within ten days
after the system discovers the violation, and shall notify the public in accordance with R.61-58.6.E.

  (8) The provisions of R.61-58.5.G(1) and (4) are applicable until March 31, 2016. The provisions of
R.61-58.5.G(2), (3), (5), (6), and (7) are applicable until all required repeat monitoring under R.61-
58.5.G(2) and fecal coliform or E. coli testing under R.61-58.5.G(5) that was initiated by a total coliform-
positive sample taken before April 1, 2016 is completed, as well as analytical method, reporting,
recordkeeping, public notification, and consumer confidence report requirements associated with that
monitoring and testing. Beginning April 1, 2016, the provisions of R.61-58.17 are applicable, with systems
required to begin regular monitoring at the same frequency as the system-specific frequency required on
March 31, 2016.

H. Maximum Contaminant Levels for Radionuclides.

  (1) The maximum contaminant level for radionuclides are applicable to all public water systems.
Compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for radionuclides is calculated pursuant to Section I
below.

  (2) MCL for combined radium-226 and -228. The maximum contaminant level for combined radium-
226 and radium-228 is 5 pCi/L. The combined radium-226 and radium-228 value is determined by the
addition of the results of the analysis for radium-226 and the analysis for radium-228.

   (3) MCL for gross alpha particle activity (excluding radon and uranium). The maximum contaminant
level for gross alpha particle activity (including radium-226 but excluding radon and uranium) is 15 pCi/L.

  (4) MCL for beta particle and photon radioactivity.

     (a) The average annual concentration of beta particle and photon radioactivity from man-made
radionuclides in drinking water must not produce an annual dose equivalent to the total body or any internal
organ greater than 4 millirem/year (mrem/year).

     (b) Except for the radionuclides listed in Table A, the concentration of man-made radionuclides
causing 4 mrem total body or organ dose equivalents must be calculated on the basis of two (2) liters per
day drinking water intake using the 168 hour data list in "Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and
Maximum Permissible Concentrations of Radionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure,"

  A POU, or "point-of-use" technology is a treatment device installed at a single tap used for the purpose of
reducing contaminants in drinking water at that one tap. POU devices are typically installed at the kitchen
tap. See the April 21, 2000 NODA for more details.

Limitations Footnotes: Technologies for Radionuclides:


135 | Regulation 61-58.5
a
  The regeneration solution contains high concentrations of the contaminant ions. Disposal options should
be carefully considered before choosing this technology.
b
  When POU devices are used for compliance, programs for long-term operation, maintenance, and
monitoring must be provided by water utility to ensure proper performance.
c
  Reject water disposal options should be carefully considered before choosing this technology. See other
RO limitations described in the SWTR Compliance Technologies Table.
d
  The combination of variable source water quality and the complexity of the water chemistry involved may
make this technology too complex for small surface water systems.
e
  Removal efficiencies can vary depending on water quality.
f
  This technology may be very limited in application to small systems. Since the process requires static
mixing, detention basins, and filtration, it is most applicable to systems with sufficiently high sulfate levels
that already have a suitable filtration treatment train in place.
g
  This technology is most applicable to small systems that already have filtration in place.
h
  Handling of chemicals required during regeneration and pH adjustment may be too difficult for small
systems without an adequately trained operator.
i
  Assumes modification to a coagulation/filtration process already in place.

I. Monitoring Frequency and Compliance Requirements for Radionuclides in Community Water Systems.

   (1) This section shall apply only to community water systems which serve at least fifteen (15) service
connections used by year-round residents or systems which regularly serve at least twenty- five (25) year -
round residents. Suppliers of water for applicable community water systems shall analyze for radionuclides
to determine compliance with Section H above.

  (2) The monitoring and compliance requirements for gross alpha particle activity, radium- 226, radium-
228, and uranium.

136 | Regulation 61-58.5
     (a) Community water systems (CWSs) must conduct initial monitoring to determine compliance with
Section H(2), (3) and (5) above by December 31, 2007. For the purposes of monitoring for gross alpha
particle activity, radium-226, radium-228, uranium, and beta particle and photon radioactivity in drinking
water, "detection limit" is defined as in Section K(3) below.

        (i) Applicability and sampling location for existing community water systems or sources. All
existing CWSs using ground water, surface water or systems using both ground and surface water (for the
purpose of this section hereafter referred to as systems) must sample at every entry point to the distribution
system that is representative of all sources being used (hereafter called a sampling point) under normal
operating conditions. The system must take each sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make
another sampling point more representative of each source or the Department has designated a distribution
system location, in accordance with paragraph (2)(b)(ii)(C) of this section.

       (ii) Applicability and sampling location for new community water systems or sources. All new
CWSs or CWSs that use a new source of water must begin to conduct initial monitoring for the new source
within the first quarter after initiating use of the source. CWSs must conduct more frequent monitoring
when ordered by the Department in the event of possible contamination or when changes in the distribution
system or treatment processes occur which may increase the concentration of radioactivity in finished water.

     (b) Initial monitoring: Systems must conduct initial monitoring for gross alpha particle activity,
radium-226, radium-228, and uranium as follows:

       (i) Systems without acceptable historical data, as defined below, must collect four consecutive
quarterly samples at all sampling points before December 31, 2007.

        (ii) Grandfathering of data: The Department may allow historical monitoring data collected at a
sampling point to satisfy the initial monitoring requirements for that sampling point, for the following
situations:

          (A) To satisfy initial monitoring requirements, a community water system having only one entry
point to the distribution system may use the monitoring data from the last compliance monitoring period
that began between June 2000 and December 8, 2003.

          (B) To satisfy initial monitoring requirements, a community water system with multiple entry
points and having appropriate historical monitoring data for each entry point to the distribution system may
use the monitoring data from the last compliance monitoring period that began between June 2000 and
December 8, 2003.

           (C) To satisfy initial monitoring requirements, a community water system with appropriate
historical data for a representative point in the distribution system may use the monitoring data from the
last compliance monitoring period that began between June 2000 and December 8, 2003, provided that the
Department finds that the historical data satisfactorily demonstrate that each entry point to the distribution
system is expected to be in compliance based upon the historical data and reasonable assumptions about
the variability of contaminant levels between entry points. The Department must make a written finding
indicating how the data conforms to these requirements.


137 | Regulation 61-58.5
      (iii) For gross alpha particle activity, uranium, radium-226, and radium-228 monitoring, the
Department may waive the final two quarters of initial monitoring for a sampling point if the results of the
samples from the previous two (2) quarters are below the detection limit.

        (iv) If the average of the initial monitoring results for a sampling point is above the MCL, the
system must collect and analyze quarterly samples at that sampling point until the system has results from
four (4) consecutive quarters that are at or below the MCL, unless the system enters into another schedule
as part of a formal compliance agreement with the Department.

     (c) Reduced monitoring: The Department may allow community water systems to reduce the future
frequency of monitoring from once every three (3) years to once every six (6) or nine (9) years at each
sampling point, based on the following criteria.

        (i) If the average of the initial monitoring results for each contaminant (i.e., gross alpha particle
activity, uranium, radium-226, or radium-228) is below the detection limit specified in Table B, in Section
K(3)(a) below, the system must collect and analyze for that contaminant using at least one (1) sample at
that sampling point every nine (9)years.

        (ii) For gross alpha particle activity and uranium, if the average of the initial monitoring results for
each contaminant is at or above the detection limit but at or below one-half (1/2) the MCL, the system must
collect and analyze for that contaminant using at least one (1) sample at that sampling point every six (6)
years. For combined radium-226 and radium-228, the analytical results must be combined. If the average
of the combined initial monitoring results for radium- 226 and radium-228 is at or above the detection limit
but at or below one-half (1/2) the MCL, the system must collect and analyze for that contaminant using at
least one (1) sample at that sampling point every six (6) years.

        (iii) For gross alpha particle activity and uranium, if the average of the initial monitoring results for
each contaminant is above one-half (1/2) the MCL but at or below the MCL, the system must collect and
analyze at least one (1) sample at that sampling point every three (3) years. For combined radium-226 and
radium- 228, the analytical results must be combined. If the average of the combined initial monitoring
results for radium-226 and radium-228 is above one-half (1/2) the MCL but at or below the MCL, the
system must collect and analyze at least one (1) sample at that sampling point every three (3) years.

        (iv) Systems must use the samples collected during the reduced monitoring period to determine the
monitoring frequency for subsequent monitoring periods (e.g., if a system's sampling point is on a nine (9)
year monitoring period, and the sample result is above one-half (1/2) MCL, then the next monitoring period
for that sampling point is three (3) years).

        (v) If a system has a monitoring result that exceeds the MCL while on reduced monitoring, the
system must collect and analyze quarterly samples at that sampling point until the system has results from
four (4) consecutive quarters that are below the MCL, unless the system enters into another schedule as part
of a formal compliance agreement with the Department.

     (d) Compositing: To fulfill quarterly monitoring requirements for gross alpha particle activity,
radium-226, radium-228, or uranium, a system may composite up to four
(4) consecutive quarterly samples from a single entry point if analysis is done within a year of the first
sample. The Department will treat analytical results from the composited as the average analytical result to

138 | Regulation 61-58.5
determine compliance with the MCLs and the future monitoring frequency. If the analytical result from the
composited sample is greater than one-half (1/2) MCL, the Department may direct the system to take
additional quarterly samples before allowing the system to sample under a reduced monitoring schedule.

     (e) A gross alpha particle activity measurement may be substituted for the required radium-226
measurement provided that the measured gross alpha particle activity does not exceed 5 pCi/l. A gross alpha
particle activity measurement may be substituted for the required uranium measurement provided that the
measured gross alpha particle activity does not exceed 15 pCi/l.

  The gross alpha measurement shall have a confidence interval of 95 percent (1.65 sigma, where sigma is
the standard deviation of the net counting rate of the sample) for radium-226 and uranium. When a system
uses a gross alpha particle activity measurement in lieu of a radium-226 and/or uranium measurement, the
gross alpha particle activity analytical result will be used to determine the future monitoring frequency for
radium-226 and/or uranium. If the gross alpha particle activity result is less than detection, one-half (1/2)
the detection limit will be used to determine compliance and the future monitoring frequency.

  (3) Monitoring and compliance requirements for beta particle and photon radioactivity.

  To determine compliance with the maximum contaminant levels in paragraph (4) of this section for beta
particle and photon radioactivity, a system must monitor at a frequency as follows:

     (a) Community water systems (both surface and ground water) designated by the Department as
vulnerable must sample for beta particle and photon radioactivity. Systems must collect quarterly samples
for beta emitters and annual samples for tritium and strontium-90 at each entry point to the distribution
system (hereafter called a sampling point), beginning within one quarter after being notified by the
Department. Systems already designated by the Department must continue to sample until the Department
reviews and either reaffirms or removes the designation.

        (i) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally occurring potassium-40 beta particle
activity at a sampling point has a running annual
average (computed quarterly) less than or equal to 50 pCi/L (screening level), the Department may reduce
the frequency of monitoring at that sampling point to once every three (3) years. Systems must collect all
samples required in paragraph (2)(a) of this section during the reduced monitoring period.

       (ii) For systems in the vicinity of a nuclear facility, the Department may allow the CWS to utilize
environmental surveillance data collected by the nuclear facility in lieu of monitoring at the system's entry
point(s), where the Department determines if such data is applicable to a particular water system. In the
event that there is a release from a nuclear facility, systems which are using surveillance data must begin
monitoring at the community water system's entry point(s) in accordance with paragraph (2)(a) of this
section.

      (b) Community water systems (both surface and ground water) designated by the Department as
utilizing waters contaminated by effluents from nuclear facilities must sample for beta particle and photon
radioactivity. Systems must collect quarterly samples for beta emitters and iodine-131 and annual samples
for tritium and strontium-90 at each entry point to the distribution system (hereafter called a sampling
point), beginning within one quarter after being notified by the Department. Systems already designated by


139 | Regulation 61-58.5
the Department as systems using waters contaminated by effluents from nuclear facilities must continue to
sample until the Department reviews and either reaffirms or removes the designation.

      (i) Quarterly monitoring for gross beta particle activity shall be based on the analysis of monthly
samples or the analysis of a composite of three monthly samples. The former is recommended.

        (ii) For iodine-131, a composite of five consecutive daily samples shall be analyzed once each
quarter. As ordered by the Department, more frequent monitoring shall be conducted when iodine-131 is
identified in the finished water.

      (iii) Annual monitoring for strontium-90 and tritium shall be conducted by means of the analysis of
a composite of four consecutive quarterly samples or analysis of four quarterly samples. The latter
procedure is recommended.

        (iv) If the gross beta particle activity beta minus the naturally occurring potassium-40 beta particle
activity at a sampling point has a running annual average (computed quarterly) less than or equal to 15
pCi/L (screening level), the Department may reduce the frequency of monitoring at that sampling point to
every three (3) years. Systems must collect all samples required in paragraph (2)(a) of this section during
the reduced monitoring period.

       (v) For systems in the vicinity of a nuclear facility, the Department may allow the CWS to utilize
environmental surveillance data collected by the nuclear facility in lieu of monitoring at the system's entry
point(s), where the Department determines if such data is applicable to a particular water system. In the
event that there is a release from a nuclear facility, systems which are using surveillance data must begin
monitoring at the community water system's entry point(s) in accordance with paragraph (2)(a) of this
section.

     (c) Community water systems designated by the Department to monitor for beta particle and photon
radioactivity can not apply to the Department for a waiver from the monitoring frequencies specified in
paragraph (2)(a) or (2)(b) of this section.

     (d) Community water systems may analyze for naturally occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity
from the same or equivalent sample used for the gross beta particle activity analysis. Systems are allowed
to subtract the potassium-40 beta particle activity value from the total gross beta particle activity value to
determine if the screening level is exceeded. The potassium-40 beta particle activity must be calculated by
multiplying elemental potassium concentrations (in mg/L) by a factor of 0.82.

     (e) If the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally occurring potassium-40 beta particle activity
exceeds the appropriate screening level, an analysis of the sample must be performed to identify the major
radioactive constituents present in the sample and the appropriate doses must be calculated and summed to
determine compliance with Section H(4)(a) above , using the formula in Section H(4)(b) above. Doses must
also be calculated and combined for measured levels of tritium and strontium to determine compliance.

     (f) Systems must monitor monthly at the sampling point(s) which exceed the maximum contaminant
level in R.61-58.5.H(4)(a), beginning the month after the exceedance occurs. Systems must continue
monthly monitoring until the system has established, by a rolling average of three (3) monthly samples,


140 | Regulation 61-58.5
that the MCL is being met. Systems who establish that the MCL is being met must return to quarterly
monitoring until they meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (3)(a)(i) or (3)(b)(iv) of this section.

  (4) General monitoring and compliance requirements for radionuclides.

     (a) The Department may require more frequent monitoring than specified R.61- 58.5.I(1) or (2), or
may require confirmation samples at its discretion. The results of the initial and confirmation samples will
be averaged for use in compliance determinations.

    (b) Each public water systems shall monitor at the time designated by the Department during each
compliance period.

     (c) Compliance: Compliance with Section H(2) through (5) above, will be determined based on the
analytical result(s) obtained at each sampling point. If one (1) sampling point is in violation of an MCL, the
system is in violation of the MCL.

       (i) For systems monitoring more than once per year, compliance with the MCL is determined by
a running annual average at each sampling point. If the average of any sampling point is greater than the
MCL, then the system is out of compliance with the MCL.

       (ii) For systems monitoring more than once per year, if any sample result will cause the running
average to exceed the MCL at any sample point, the system is out of compliance with the MCL immediately.

       (iii) Systems must include all samples taken and analyzed under the provisions of this section in
determining compliance, even if that number is greater than the minimum required.

       (iv) If a system does not collect all required samples when compliance is based on a running annual
average of quarterly samples, compliance will be based on the running average of the samples collected.

       (v) If a sample result is less than the detection limit, zero will be used to calculate the annual
average, unless a gross alpha particle activity is being used in lieu of radium-226 and/or uranium. If the
gross alpha particle activity result is less than detection, one-half (1/2) the detection limit will be used to
calculate the annual average.

     (d) The Department has the discretion to delete results of obvious sampling or analytic errors.

     (e) If the MCL for radioactivity set forth in Section H(2) through (5) above, is exceeded, the operator
of a community water system must give notice to the Department pursuant to R.61-58.6.

J. Maximum Contaminant Level Goals for Radionuclides.

MCLGs for radionuclides are as indicated in the following table:

K. Analytical Methods for Radionuclides.

  (1) Analysis for the following contaminants shall be conducted to determine compliance with Section
H above, (radioactivity) in accordance with the methods adopted by the Department.

  (2) For the purpose of monitoring radioactivity concentrations in drinking water, the required sensitivity
of the radio-analysis is defined in terms of detection limit. The detection limit shall be that concentration
which can be counted with a precision of plus or minus one hundred percent at the ninety- five percent
confidence level (1.96 sigma where sigma is the standard deviation of the net counting rate of the sample).
To determine compliance with Sections H and J above, the detection limits shall not exceed those set form
by the Administrator.

  (3) To judge compliance with the maximum contaminant levels listed in Sections H and J above,
averages of data shall be used and shall be round to the same number of significant figures as the maximum
contaminant level for the substance in question.

    (a) To determine compliance with Section H(2), (3), and (5), above the detection limit shall not
exceed the concentrations in Table B to this paragraph.

O. VOC Monitoring, Sampling and Analytical Requirements.

  (1) This section shall apply to community and non-transient non-community water systems.

   (2) Beginning with the initial compliance period analysis of the contaminants listed in Section N(2)
above, for the purpose of determining compliance with the maximum contaminant level shall be conducted
as follows:

      (a) Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one (1) sample at every entry point to the
distribution system which is representative of each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point).
Each sample must be taken at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more
representative of each source or treatment plant.

      (b) Surface water systems (or combined surface/ground) shall take a minimum of one (1) sample at
points in the distribution system that are representative of each source or at each entry point to the
distribution system after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). Each sample must be taken at the
same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each source,
treatment plant, or within the distribution system.

      (c) If the system draws water from more than one (1) source and the sources are combined before
distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal
operating conditions (i.e., when water representative of all sources is being used).

     (d) Each community and non-transient non-community water system shall take four consecutive
quarterly samples for each contaminant listed in Section N(2)(b) through (u) above, during each compliance
period beginning in the initial compliance period.

      (e) If the initial monitoring for contaminants listed in Section N(2)(a) through (h) and the monitoring
for the contaminants listed in Section N(2)(i) through (u) as allowed in paragraph (2)(r) of this section, has
been completed by December 31, 1992, and the system did not detect any contaminant listed in Section
N(2) above, then each ground and surface water system shall take one (1) sample annually beginning with
the initial compliance period.

     (f) After a minimum of three (3) years of annual sampling, the Department may allow groundwater
systems with no previous detection of any contaminant listed in Section N(2) above, to take one (1) sample
during each compliance period.

      (g) Each community and non-transient non-community ground water system which does not detect
a contaminant listed in Section N(2) above, may apply to the Department for a waiver from the requirement
of paragraphs (4)(e) and (4)(f) of this section after completing the initial monitoring. (For the purposes of
this section, detection is defined as 0.0005 mg/L.) A waiver shall be effective for no more than six (6) years

144 | Regulation 61-58.5
(two compliance periods). The Department may also issue waivers to small systems for the initial round
of monitoring for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.

     (h) The Department may grant a waiver after evaluating the following factor(s):

        (i) Knowledge of previous use (including transport, storage, or disposal) of the contaminant within
the watershed or zone of influence of the system. If a determination by the Department reveals no previous
use of the contaminant within the watershed or zone of influence, a waiver may be granted.

        (ii) If previous use of the contaminant is unknown or it has been used previously, then the following
factors shall be used to determine whether a waiver is granted.

          (A) Previous analytical results.

           (B) The proximity of the system to a potential point or non-point source of contamination. Point
sources include spills and leaks of chemicals at or near a water treatment facility or at manufacturing,
distribution, or storage facilities, or from hazardous and municipal waste landfills and other waste handling
or treatment facilities.

          (C) The environmental persistence and transport of the contaminants.

         (D) The number of persons served by the public water system and the proximity of a smaller
system to a larger system.

          (E) How well the water source is protected against contamination such as whether it is a surface
or groundwater system. Groundwater systems must consider factors such as depth of the well, the type of
soil, and wellhead protection. Surface water systems must consider watershed protection.

      (i) As a condition of the waiver a groundwater system must take one (1) sample at each sampling
point during the time the waiver is effective (i.e., one sample during two compliance periods or six years)
and update its vulnerability assessment considering the factors listed in paragraph (2)(h) of this section.
Based on this vulnerability assessment the Department must reconfirm that the system is non-vulnerable.
If the Department does not make this reconfirmation within three (3) years of the initial determination, then
the waiver is invalidated and the system is required to sample annually as specified in paragraph (e) of this
section.

     (j) Each community and non-transient non-community surface water system which does not detect
a contaminant listed in Section N(2) above may apply to the Department for a waiver from the requirements
of paragraph (4)(e) of this section after completing the initial monitoring. Composite samples from a
maximum of five sampling points are allowed, provided that the detection limit of the method used for
analysis is less than one- fifth of the MCL. Systems meeting this criteria must be determined by the
Department to be non-vulnerable based upon a vulnerability assessment during each compliance period.
Each system receiving a waiver shall sample at the frequency specified by the Department (if any).

    (k) If a contaminant listed in Section N (2)(b) through (u) above, is detected at a level exceeding
0.0005 mg/L in any sample, then:


145 | Regulation 61-58.5
     (l) Systems which violate the requirements of Section N(2) above, as determined by paragraph (2)(o)
of this section must monitor quarterly. After a minimum of four (4) consecutive quarterly samples which
shows the system is in compliance as specified in paragraph (2)(o) of this section, the system and the
Department determines that the system is reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level,
the system may monitor at the frequency and time specified in paragraph (4)(k)(iii) of this section.

     (m) The Department may require a confirmation sample for positive or negative results. If a
confirmation sample is required by the Department, the result must be averaged with the first sampling
result and the average is used for the compliance determination as specified by paragraph (2)(o) of this
section. The Department has the discretion to delete results of obvious sampling errors from this calculation.

      (n) The Department may reduce the total number of samples a system must analyze by allowing the
use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five sampling points are allowed, provided
that the detection limit of the method used for analysis is less than one-fifth of the MCL. Compositing of
samples must be done in the laboratory and analyzed within fourteen (14) days of sample collection.

        (i) If the concentration in the composite sample is 0.0005 mg/L for any contaminant listed in
Section N(2) above, then a follow-up sample must be taken within fourteen (14) days at each sampling
point included in the composite, and be analyzed for that contaminant.

       (ii) If duplicates of the original sample taken from each sampling point used in the composite are
available, the system may use these instead of resampling. The duplicate must be analyzed and the results
reported to the Department within fourteen (14) days of collection.

       (iii) If the population served by the system is greater than 3,300 persons, then compositing may
only be permitted by the State at sampling points within a single system. In systems serving 3,300 persons,
the Department may permit compositing among different systems provided the 5-sample limit is
maintained.

        (iv) Compositing samples prior to GC analysis.

          (A) Add 5 ml or equal larger amounts of each sample (up to 5 samples are allowed) to a 25 ml
glass syringe. Special precautions must be made to maintain zero headspace in the syringe.

          (B) The samples must be cooled at 4oC during this step to minimize volatilization losses.

          (C) Mix well and draw out a 5-ml aliquot for analysis.

          (D) Follow sample introduction, purging, and desorption steps described in the method.

          (E) If less than five samples are used for compositing, a proportionately small syringe may be
used.

        (v) Compositing samples prior to GC/MS analysis.

          (A) Inject 5-ml or equal larger amounts of each aqueous sample (up to 5 samples are allowed)
into a 25-ml purging device using the sample introduction technique described in the method.

146 | Regulation 61-58.5
          (B) The total volume of the sample in the purging device must be 25 ml.

          (C) Purge and desorb as described in the method.

     (o) Compliance with Section N(2) above, shall be determined based on the analytical results obtained
at each sampling point. If one sampling point is in violation of an MCL, the system is in violation of the
MCL.

       (i) For systems monitoring more than once per year, compliance with the MCL is determined by
a running annual average at each sampling point.

       (ii) Systems monitoring annually or less frequently whose sample result exceeds the MCL must
begin quarterly sampling. The system will not be considered in violation of the MCL until it has completed
one year of quarterly sampling.

        (iii) If any sample result will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL at any sampling
point, the system is out of compliance with the MCL immediately.

        (iv) If a system fails to collect the required number of samples, compliance will be based on the
total number of samples collected.

       (v) If a sample result is less than the detection limit, zero will be used to calculate the annual
average.

    (p) Analysis for the contaminants listed in Section N(2) above, shall be conducted using EPA-
approved methods listed in 40 CFR 141.

    (q) Analysis under this section shall only be conducted by laboratories that are certified by the
Department.

      (r) The Department may allow the use of monitoring data collected after January 1, 1988, for
purposes of initial monitoring compliance. If the data are generally consistent with the other requirements
in this section, the Department may use those data (i.e., a single sample rather than four quarterly samples)
to satisfy the initial monitoring requirement of paragraph (2)(d) of this section. Systems which use
grandfathered samples and did not detect any contaminant listed in Section N(2)(b) through (u) above shall
begin monitoring annually in accordance with paragraph (2)(e) of this section beginning with the initial
compliance period.

     (s) The Department may increase required monitoring where necessary to detect variations within
the system.

   (t) Each public water system shall monitor at the time designated by the Department within each
compliance period.

    (u) All new systems or systems that use a new source of water that begin operation after January 22,
2004 must demonstrate compliance with the MCL within a period of time specified by the Department. The

147 | Regulation 61-58.5
system must also comply with the initial sampling frequencies specified by the Department to ensure a
system can demonstrate compliance with the MCL. Routine and increased monitoring frequencies shall be
conducted in accordance with the requirements in this section.

  (3) If a community or a non-transient non-community water system fails to comply with an applicable
VOC MCL, that system shall give notice to the customers served by the system in accordance with the
requirements of R.61-58.6.E.

  (11) All community and non-transient non-community water systems shall repeat the monitoring
required by this Section no less frequently than every five (5) years from the dates specified in paragraph
(2) of this section.

  (12) The Department or public water systems may composite up to five samples when monitoring for
the organic contaminants in paragraphs (1) and (10) of this section.

  (13) Monitoring of the contaminants listed in paragraphs (13)(k) and (l) of this section, shall be
conducted as follows:

     (a) Each community and non-transient, non-community water system shall take four consecutive
quarterly samples at each sampling point for each contaminant listed in paragraph (13)(k) of this section
and report the results to the Department. Monitoring must be completed by December 31, 1995.

    (b) Each community and non-transient non-community water system shall take one sample at each
sampling point for each contaminant listed in paragraph (13)(l) of this section and report the results to the
Department. Monitoring must be completed by December 31, 1995.

     (c) Each community and non-transient non-community water system may apply to the Department
for a waiver from the requirements of paragraph (13)(a) and (b) of this section.



152 | Regulation 61-58.5
     (d) The Department may grant a waiver for the requirement of paragraph (13)(a) of this section based
on the criteria specified in Section E(7)(f) above. The Department may grant a waiver from the requirement
of paragraph (13)(b) of this section if previous analytical results indicate contamination would not occur,
provided this data was collected after January 1, 1990.

      (e) Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one (1) sample at every entry point to the
distribution system which is representative of each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point).
Each sample must be taken at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more
representative of each source or treatment plant.

      (f) Surface water systems shall take a minimum of one (1) sample at points in the distribution system
that are representative of each source or at each entry point to the distribution system after treatment
(hereafter called a sampling point). Each sample must be taken at the same sampling point unless conditions
make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant. [Note: For purposes of
this paragraph, surface water systems include systems with a combination of surface and ground sources.]

      (g) If the system draws water from more than one (1) source and the sources are combined before
distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal
operating conditions (i.e., when water representative of all sources is being used).

     (h) The Department may require a confirmation sample for positive or negative results.

     (i) The Department may reduce the total number of samples a system must analyze by allowing the
use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five (5) sampling points are allowed.
Compositing of samples must be done in the laboratory and the composite sample must be analyzed within
fourteen (14) days of collection. If the population served by the system is greater than3,300 persons, then
compositing may only be permitted by the Department at sampling points within a single system. In systems
serving 3,300 persons or less, the Department may permit compositing among different systems provided
the 5-sample limit is maintained.

     (j) Instead of performing the monitoring required by this section, a community water system or non-
transient non-community water system serving fewer than 150 service connections may send a letter to the
Department stating that the system is available for sampling. This letter must be sent to the Department by
January 1, 1994. The system shall not send such samples to the Department, unless requested to do so by
the Department.

  (14) The owner or operator of a community or non-transient non-community water system that is
required to monitor in accordance with this section shall send a copy of the results of such monitoring
within thirty (30) days of receipt, and a copy of any public notice under paragraph (15) of this section, to
the Department.

   (15) The owner or operator shall notify the persons served by the system of the availability of the results
of sampling conducted in accordance with this section by including a notice in the first set of water bills
issued by the system after the receipt of the results or written notice within three (3) months. The notice
shall identify a person and supply the telephone number to contact for information on the monitoring results.
For surface water systems, public notification is required only after the first quarter's monitoring and must
include a statement that additional monitoring will be conducted for three (3) more quarters with the results
available upon request.

U. Special Monitoring for Sodium.

  (1) Suppliers of water for community public water systems shall collect and analyze one (1) sample per
plant at the entry point of the distribution system for the determination of sodium concentration levels;
samples must be collected and analyzed annually for systems utilizing surface water sources in whole or in
part, and at least every three (3) years for systems utilizing solely ground water sources. The minimum
number of samples required to be taken by the system shall be based on the number of treatment plants
used by the system, except that multiple wells drawing raw water from a single aquifer may, with the
Department's approval, be considered one (1) treatment plant for determining the minimum number of
samples. The supplier of water may be required by the Department to collect and analyze water samples
for sodium more frequently in locations where the sodium content is variable.

   (2) The supplier of water shall report to the Department the results of the analyses for sodium within
the first ten (10) days of the month following the month in which the sample results were received or within
the first ten (10) days following the end of the required monitoring period as stipulated by the Department,
whichever of these is first. If more than annual sampling is required the supplier shall report the average
sodium concentration within ten (10) days of the month following the month in which the analytical results
of the last sample used for the annual average was received.

   (3) The supplier of water shall notify the appropriate local public health officials of the sodium levels
in the water by written notice by direct mail within three (3) months after receiving the results of analyses.
Within ten (10) days after notifying the local public health officials, the supplier of water shall forward a

154 | Regulation 61-58.5
copy of such written notice to the Department. The supplier of water is not required to notify local public
health officials where the Department provides such notices.

  (4) Analysis for sodium shall be conducted using EPA-approved methods listed in 40 CFR 141.

V. Special Monitoring for Corrosivity Characteristics.

  (1)-(3)[Reserved]

  (4) The supplier of water for applicable community water systems shall identify and report to the
Department whether the following construction materials are present in their distribution system:

    (a) Lead from piping, solder, caulking, interior lining of distribution mains, alloys and home
plumbing.

     (b) Copper from piping and alloys, service lines and home plumbing.

     (c) Galvanized piping, service lines and home plumbing.

     (d) Ferrous piping materials such as cast iron and steel.

     (e) Vinyl lined asbestos cement pipe.

     (f) Coal tar lined pipes and tanks.

     (g) Asbestos cement pipe.

W. Special Monitoring and Notification Requirements.

   The Department shall perform such monitoring as is necessary to insure the quality and integrity of results
of tests, measurements, or analyses reported by the supplier of water. Should such monitoring by the
Department indicate a violation of the maximum contaminant levels, or the presence of any contaminant at
levels considered to be a real or potential threat to the public's health, the Department at its discretion may
notify the public or require the supplier of water to notify the public pursuant to R.61- 58.6.E, or other
method deemed appropriate by the Department and initiate the necessary action to eliminate the violation
or contaminant.

X. Monitoring of Consecutive Public Water Systems.

   When a public water system supplies water to one or more other public water systems, the Department
may modify the monitoring requirements imposed by this regulation to the extent that the interconnection
of the systems justifies treating them as a single system for monitoring purposes. Any modified monitoring
shall be conducted pursuant to a schedule specified by the Department and concurred in by the
Administrator.




155 | Regulation 61-58.5
Y. Criteria and Procedures for Public Water Systems using Point-of-Entry Devices.

  (1) Public water systems may use point-of-entry devices to comply with maximum contaminant levels
only if they meet the requirements of this section.

   (2) It is the responsibility of the public water system to operate and maintain the point-of- entry
treatment system.

   (3) The public water system must develop and obtain Department approval for a monitoring plan before
point-of-entry devices are installed for compliance. Under the plan approved by the Department, point-of-
entry devices must provide health protection equivalent to central water treatment. "Equivalent" means that
the water would meet all State primary drinking water regulations and would be of acceptable quality
similar to water distributed by a well-operated central treatment plant. In addition to the VOCs, monitoring
must include physical measurements and observations such as total flow treated and mechanical condition
of the treatment equipment.

  (4) The public water system must properly apply effective technology under a plan approved by the
Department and must maintain the microbiological safety of the water.

     (a) The public water system must provide adequate certification of performance, field testing, and, if
not included in the certification process, a rigorous engineering design review of the point-of-entry devices.

     (b) The design and application of the point-of-entry devices must consider the tendency for an
increase in heterotrophic bacteria concentrations in water treated with activated carbon. It may be necessary
to use frequent backwashing, post-contactor disinfection, and Heterotrophic Plate Count monitoring to
ensure that the microbiological safety of the water is not compromised.

  (5) The public water system must protect all consumers. Every building connected to the system must
have a point-of-entry device installed, maintained, and adequately monitored. The public water system must
assure that every building is subject to treatment and monitoring, and that the rights and responsibilities of
the public water system customer convey with title upon sale of property.

Z. Use of Other Non-Centralized Treatment Devices.

   Public water systems shall not use bottled water or point-of-use devices to achieve compliance with an
established maximum contaminant level. Bottled water or point-of-use devices may be used on a temporary
basis to avoid an unreasonable risk to health.

AA. Treatment Techniques.

  (1) This section establishes criteria and requirements for treatment techniques in lieu of maximum
contaminant levels for specified contaminants. This section applies to all public water systems.

  (2) Treatment techniques for acrylamide and epichlorohydrin. Each public water system must certify
annually in writing to the Department (using third party or manufacturer's certification) that when
acrylamide and epichlorohydrin are used in drinking water systems, the combination (or product) of dose
and monomer level does not exceed the levels specified as follows:

156 | Regulation 61-58.5
                  Acrylamide               =        0.05% dosed at 1 ppm (or equivalent)
                  Epichlorohydrin          =        0.01% dosed at 20 ppm (or equivalent)

Certifications can rely on manufacturers or third parties, as approved by the Department.

BB. Approved Laboratories.

   For the purpose of determining compliance with R.61-58.5.B through R.61-58.5.V, R.61- 58.5.CC, R.61-
58.10.F, R.61-58.11.D, and R.61-58.16.E, samples may be considered only if they have been analyzed by
a laboratory approved by the Department, except that measurements for turbidity may be performed by a
properly certified water treatment plant operator.

CC. Alternative Analytical Techniques.

  With express written permission of the Department, concurred in by the Administrator, an alternative
analytical technique may be employed. An alternative technique shall be acceptable only if it is substantially
equivalent to the prescribed test in both precision and accuracy as it relates to the determination of
compliance with any maximum contaminant level. The use of the alternative analytical technique shall not
decrease the frequency of monitoring required by this regulation.

161 | Regulation 61-58.7
E. Public Notification of Drinking Water Violations.

  (1) General public notification requirements:

     (a) Who must give public notice? Each owner or operator of a public water system (community water
systems, non-transient non-community water systems, and transient non community water systems) must
give notice for all violations of State Primary Drinking Water Regulations (SPDWR) and for other
situations, as listed in Table 1. The term "SPDWR violations'' is used in this regulation to include violations
of the maximum contaminant level (MCL), maximum residual disinfection level (MRDL), treatment
technique (TT), monitoring requirements, and testing procedures in this regulation. Appendix A to this
regulation identifies the tier assignment for each specific violation or situation requiring a public notice.

TABLE 1: VIOLATION CATEGORIES AND OTHER SITUATIONS REQUIRING A PUBLIC
NOTICE



 (1)       SPDWR violations:
    (i)    Failure to comply with an applicable maximum contaminant level(MCL) or maximum
           residual disinfectant level (MRDL).
    (ii) Failure to comply with a prescribed treatment technique (TT).
    (iii) Failure to perform water quality monitoring, as required by the drinking water regulations.
    (iv) Failure to comply with testing procedures as prescribed by a drinking water regulation.

 (2)      Variance and exemptions under R.61-58.9:
    (i) Operation under a variance or an exemption.
    (ii) Failure to comply with the requirements of any schedule that has been set under a variance
         or exemption.

 (3)      Special public notices:
    (i)   Occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak or other waterborne emergency.
    (ii)  Exceedance of the nitrate MCL by non-community water systems (NCWS), where granted
          permission by the Department under R.61- 58.5.B(3).
    (iii) Exceedance of the secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for fluoride.
    (iv) Availability of unregulated contaminant monitoring data.
    (v) Other violations and situations determined by the Department to require a public notice
          under this regulation, not already listed in Appendix A to this regulation.




     (b) What type of public notice is required for each violation or situation? Public notice requirements
are divided into three (3) tiers, to take into account the seriousness of the violation or situation and of any
potential adverse health effects that may be involved. The public notice requirements for each violation or
situation listed in Table 1 of this section are determined by the tier to which it is assigned. Table 2 of this
section provides the definition of each tier. Appendix A to this regulation identifies the tier assignment for
each specific violation or situation.
162 | Regulation 61-58.7
TABLE 2: DEFINITION OF PUBLIC NOTICE TIERS



 (1) Tier 1 public notice -- required for SPDWR violations and situations with significant potential
     to have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure.

 (2) Tier 2 public notice -- required for all other SPDWR violations and situations with potential
     to have serious adverse effects on human health.


 (3) Tier 3 public notice -- required for all other SPDWR violations and situations not included in
     Tier 1 and Tier 2.

     (c) Who must be notified?

        (i) Each public water system must provide public notice to persons served by the water system, in
accordance with this regulation. Public water systems that sell or otherwise provide drinking water to other
public water systems (i.e., to consecutive systems) are required to give public notice to the owner or operator
of the consecutive system; the consecutive system is responsible for providing public notice to the persons
it serves.

        (ii) If a public water system has a violation in a portion of the distribution system that is physically
or hydraulically isolated from other parts of the distribution system, the Department may allow the system
to limit distribution of the public notice to only persons served by that portion of the system which is out
of compliance. Permission by the Department for limiting distribution of the notice must be granted in
writing.

       (iii) A copy of the notice must also be sent to the Department, in accordance with the requirements
of R.61-58.6.B(5).

  (2) Tier 1 Public Notice: Form, Manner, and Frequency of Notice

     (a) Which violations or situations require a Tier 1 public notice? Table 1 of this section lists the

(30) days after the system learns of the violation. If the public notice is posted, the notice must remain in
place for as long as the violation or situation persists, but in no case for less than seven (7) days, even if the
violation or situation is resolved. The Department may, in appropriate circumstances, allow additional time
for the initial notice of up to three (3) months from the date the system learns of the violation. It is not
appropriate for the Department to grant an extension to the thirty (30) day deadline for any unresolved
violation or to allow across-the-board extensions by rule or policy for other violations or situations requiring
a Tier 2 public notice. Extensions granted by the Department must be in writing.

        (ii) The public water system must repeat the notice every three (3) months as long as the violation
or situation persists, unless the Department determines that appropriate circumstances warrant a different
repeat notice frequency. In no circumstance may the repeat notice be given less frequently than once per
year. It is not appropriate for the Department to allow less frequent repeat notice for an MCL or treatment
technique violation under the Total Coliform Rule or the Revised Total Coliform Rule (R.61-58.17) or a
treatment technique violation under the Surface Water Treatment Rule or Interim Enhanced Surface Water
Treatment Rule. It is also not appropriate for the Department to allow through its rules or policies across
the board reductions in the repeat notice frequency for other ongoing violations requiring a Tier 2 repeat
notice. Department determinations allowing repeat notices to be given less frequently than once every three
(3) months must be in writing.

        (iii) For the turbidity violations specified in this paragraph, public water systems must consult with
the Department as soon as practical but no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the public water system
learns of the violation, to determine whether a Tier 1 public notice under paragraph (2)(a) of this section is
required to protect public health. When consultation does not take place within the twenty-four (24) hour
period, the water system must distribute a Tier 1 notice of the violation within the next twenty-four (24)


166 | Regulation 61-58.7
hours (i.e., no later than forty- eight (48) hours after the system learns of the violation), following the
requirements under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Consultation with the Department is required for:

         (A) Violation of the turbidity MCL under R.61-58.10(C), (E), (H), or (I ); or

          (B) Violation of the SWTR, IESWTR or LT1ESWTR treatment technique requirement resulting
from a single exceedance of the maximum allowable turbidity limit.

      (c) What is the form and manner of the Tier 2 public notice? Public water systems must provide the
initial public notice and any repeat notices in a form and manner that is reasonably calculated to reach
persons served in the required time period. The form and manner of the public notice may vary based on
the specific situation and type of water system, but it must at a minimum meet the following requirements:

       (i) Unless directed otherwise by the Department in writing, community water systems must
provide notice by:

         (A) Mail or other direct delivery to each customer receiving a bill and to other service
connections to which water is delivered by the public water system; and

          (B) Any other method reasonably calculated to reach other persons regularly served by the
system, if they would not normally be reached by the notice required in R.61-58.6.E(3)(c)(i)(A). Such
persons may include those who do not pay water bills or do not have service connection addresses (e.g.,
house renters, apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients, prison inmates, etc.). Other
methods may include: Publication in a local newspaper; delivery of multiple copies for distribution by
customers that provide their drinking water to others (e.g., apartment building owners or large private
employers); posting in public places served by the system or on the Internet; or delivery to community
organizations.

       (ii) Unless directed otherwise by the Department in writing, non-community water systems must
provide notice by:

          (A) Posting the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the distribution system frequented by
persons served by the system, or by mail or direct delivery to each customer and service connection (where
known); and

          (B) Any other method reasonably calculated to reach other persons served by the system if they
would not normally be reached by the notice required in R.61-58.6.E(3)(c)(ii)(A). Such persons may
include those served who may not see a posted notice because the posted notice is not in a location they
routinely pass by. Other methods may include: Publication in a local newspaper or newsletter distributed
to customers; use of E-mail to notify employees or students; or, delivery of multiple copies in central
locations (e.g., community centers).

   "This is an alert about your drinking water and a cosmetic dental problem that might affect children under
nine years of age. At low levels, fluoride can help prevent cavities, but children drinking water containing
more than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of fluoride may develop cosmetic discoloration of their permanent
teeth (dental fluorosis). The drinking water provided by your community water system [name] has a fluoride
concentration of [insert value] mg/L.

  Dental fluorosis, in its moderate or severe forms, may result in a brown staining and/or pitting of the
permanent teeth. This problem occurs only in developing teeth, before they erupt from the gums. Children

172 | Regulation 61-58.7
under nine should be provided with alternative sources of drinking water or water that has been treated to
remove the fluoride to avoid the possibility of staining and pitting of their permanent teeth. You may also
want to contact your dentist about proper use by young children of fluoride-containing products. Older
children and adults may safely drink the water.

   Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
drinking water standard) can increase your risk of developing bone disease. Your drinking water does not
contain more than 4 mg/L of fluoride, but we're required to notify you when we discover that the fluoride
levels in your drinking water exceed 2 mg/L because of this cosmetic dental problem.

   For more information, please call [name of water system contact] of [name of community water system]
at [phone number]. Some home water treatment units are also available to remove fluoride from drinking
water. To learn more about available home water treatment units, you may call NSF International at 1-877-
8-NSF-HELP."

the monitoring are to be used to determine whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is
sufficient to adequately remove Cryptosporidium from your drinking water. We are required to complete
this monitoring and make this determination by (required bin determination date). We (did not monitor or
test) or (did not complete all monitoring or testing) on schedule and, therefore, we may not be able to
determine by the required date what treatment modifications, if any, must be made to ensure adequate
Cryptosporidium removal. Missing this deadline may, in turn, jeopardize our ability to have the required
treatment modifications, if any, completed by the deadline required, (date). For more information, please
call (name of water system contact) of (name of water system) at (phone number)”.

        (ii) The special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean Cryptosporidium level
must contain the following language: “We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for
Cryptosporidium in order to determine by (date) whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is
sufficient to adequately remove Cryptosporidium from your drinking water. We have not made this
determination by the required date. Our failure to do this may jeopardize our ability to have the required
treatment modifications, if any, completed by the required deadline of (date). For more information, please

A. Applicability.

   The Department may issue variances and exemptions from the requirements of these primary drinking
water regulations under conditions and in a manner which are not less stringent than the conditions under
which, and the manner in which, variances and exemptions may be granted under the Federal Safe Drinking
Water Act. This regulation shall apply to each public water system, unless the public water system meets
all of the following conditions:

  (1) Consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and does not have any collection and treatment
facilities);

  (2) Obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a public water system to which such
regulations apply;

  (3) Does not sell water to any person; and

  (4) Is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate commerce.

B. Variances.

  (1) Requirements for a variance.

    (a) The Department may grant one or more variances to any public water system within the State
from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level of an applicable State primary drinking
water regulation upon a finding that:

       (i) Because of characteristics of the raw water sources which are reasonably available to the
system, the system cannot meet the requirements respecting the maximum contaminant levels of such
drinking water regulations despite application of the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means,
which the Department finds are generally available (taking costs into consideration); and,

        (ii) The granting of a variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to the health of persons served
by the system.

     (b) The Department may grant one or more variances to any public water system within the State
from any requirement of a specific treatment technique or an applicable State primary drinking water
regulation upon a finding that the public water system applying for the variance has demonstrated that such
treatment technique is not necessary to protect the health of persons because of the nature of the raw water
source of such system.

  (2) Requests for a variance.

  A supplier of water may request the granting of a variance by submitting a request for a variance in
writing to the Department. Suppliers of water may submit a joint request for variances when they seek

water source will be completed.

          (B) Date of initiation of the connection of the alternative raw water source or improvement of
existing raw water source.

             (C) Date by which final compliance is to be achieved.

      (v) A plan for the provision of safe drinking water in the case of an excessive rise in the
contaminant level for which the variance is requested.

       (vi) A plan for additional interim control measures during the effective period of variance.

    (d) For any request made under paragraph (1)(b) above, a statement that the system will perform
monitoring and other reasonable requirements prescribed by the Department as a condition to the variance.

    (e) Other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the applicant.

    (f) Such other information as the Department may require.

  (3) Consideration of a variance request.

    (a) The Department will act on any variance request submitted pursuant to paragraph (2) above within
90 days of receipt of the request.

     (b) In its consideration of whether the public water system is unable to comply with a contaminant
level required by these regulations because of the nature of the raw water source, the Department will
consider such factors as the following:

193 | Regulation 61-58.9
       (i) The availability and effectiveness of treatment methods for the contaminant for which the
variance is requested.

        (ii) Cost and other economic considerations such as implementing treatment, improving the quality
of the source water or using an alternate source.

     (c) A variance may be issued to a system only after the system's application of the best technology,
treatment techniques, or other means, which the Department finds are available (taking costs into
consideration).

     (d) In its consideration of whether a public water system should be granted a variance to a required
treatment technique because such treatment is unnecessary to protect the public health, the Department will
consider such factors as the following:

       (i)   Quality of the water source including water quality data and pertinent sources of pollution.

       (ii) Source protection measures employed by the public water system.

  (4) Disposition of a variance request.

requirements of a final schedule issued pursuant to paragraph (5) below.

       (ii) For the type of variance specified in paragraph (1)(b) above, such notice will provide that the
variance may be terminated at any time upon a finding that the nature of the raw water source is such that
the specified treatment technique for which the variance was granted is necessary to protect the health of
persons, or upon a finding that the public water system has failed to comply with monitoring and other
requirements prescribed by the Department as a condition to the granting of the variance.

     (c) For a variance specified in paragraph (1)(a)(i) above, the Department will propose a schedule for:

      (i) Compliance (including increments of progress) by the public water system with each
contaminant level requirement covered by the variance; and,

194 | Regulation 61-58.9
      (ii) Implementation by the public water system of such additional control measures as the
Department may require for each contaminant covered by the variance.

     (d) The proposed schedule for compliance will specify dates by which steps toward compliance are
to be taken, including at the minimum, where applicable:

      (i) The date by which arrangement for an alternative raw water source or improvement of existing
raw water source will be completed.

        (ii) The date of initiation of the connection for the alternative raw water source or improvement of
the existing raw water source.

       (iii) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved.

     (e) The proposed schedule may, if the public water system has no access to an alternative raw water
source and can effect or anticipate no adequate improvement of the existing raw water source, specify an
indefinite time period for compliance until a new and effective treatment technology is developed at which
time a new compliance schedule will be prescribed by the Department.

     (f) The proposed schedule for implementation of additional interim control measures during the
period of variance will specify interim treatment techniques, methods and equipment, and dates by which
steps toward meeting the additional interim control measures are to be met.

    (g) The schedule will be prescribed by the Department at the time of the granting of the variance,
subsequent to provision of opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (5) below.

  (5) Public notice and opportunity for hearing.

     (a) Before a variance and schedule proposed by the Department pursuant to paragraph (4) above may
take effect, the Department will provide notice and opportunity for public hearing on the variance and
schedule. A notice given pursuant to the preceding section may cover the granting of more that one variance
and a hearing held pursuant to such notice will include each of the variances covered by the notice.

    (b) Public notice of an opportunity for hearing on a variance and schedule will be circulated in a
manner designed to inform interested and potentially interested persons of the proposed variance and
schedule, and will include at least the following:

       (i) Posting of a notice in the principal post office of each municipality or area served by the public
water system, and publishing of a notice in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the area
served by the public water system; and,

        (ii) Such notice will include a summary of the proposed variance and schedule and shall inform
interested persons that they may request a public hearing on the proposed variance and schedule.

    (c) Requests for hearing may be submitted by any interested person. Frivolous or insubstantial
requests for hearing may be denied by the Department. Requests must be submitted to the Department

Department does not determine to hold a public hearing on its own motion.

  (6) Action after hearing.

   If a public hearing is held pursuant to paragraph (5) above, the Department will take into consideration
information obtained during such hearing and confirm, revise or rescind the proposed variance and
schedule.

  (7) Variance for alternative treatment techniques.

   The Department may grant a variance from any treatment technique requirement of a state primary
drinking water regulation to a supplier of water upon a showing from the supplier that an alternative
treatment technique not included in such requirement is at least as efficient in lowering the level of the
contaminant with respect to which such requirement was prescribed. A variance under this paragraph shall
be conditioned on the use of the alternative treatment technique which is the basis of the variance.

C. Exemptions.

   (1) The Department may exempt any public water system within the State from any requirement
respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement, or from both, of an
applicable state primary drinking water regulation upon a finding that:

    (a) Due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors), the public water system is
unable to comply with such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement;

     (b) The public water system was in operation on the effective date of such contaminant level or
treatment technique requirement; and,

     (c) The granting of the exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health.

196 | Regulation 61-58.9

practicable steps to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

  (8) Bottled water, point-of-use and point-of-entry devices.

     (a) The Department may require a public water system to use bottled water, point-of- use, or point-
of-entry devices as a condition for granting an exemption from the requirements of R.61-58.5.B(2), D(2)(b)
and N.

     (b) Public water systems that use bottled water as a condition of obtaining an exemption from the
requirements of R.61-58.5.B(2), D(2)(b) and N must meet the requirements set out in R.61-58.9.F(8).

199 | Regulation 61-58.9
     (c) Public water systems that use point-of-use or point-of-entry devices as a condition for receiving
an exemption must meet the requirements of R.61-58.9.F(9).

D. Variances from the Maximum Contaminant Level for Total Trihalomethanes.

  (1) The following are identified as the best technology, treatment techniques or other means generally
available for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant level for total trihalomethanes
(TTHM):

     (a) Use of chloramines as an alternate or supplemental disinfectant or oxidant.

     (b) Use of chlorine dioxide as an alternate or supplemental disinfectant or oxidant.

     (c) Improved existing clarification for THM precursor reduction.

      (d) Moving the point of chlorination to reduce TTHM formation and, where necessary, substituting
for the use of chlorine as a pre-oxidant chloramines, chlorine dioxide or potassium permanganate.

     (e) Use of powdered activated carbon for THM precursor or TTHM reduction seasonally or
intermittently at dosages not to exceed 10 mg/L on an annual average basis.

   (2) The Department will consider a request for a variance from the maximum contaminant level for
total trihalomethanes only from a community system which has installed the best available technology or
treatment method specified in paragraph (1) above unless the Department determines that such treatment
method is not available and effective for TTHM control for the system. A treatment method will not be
considered to be "available and effective" for an individual system if the treatment method would not be
technically appropriate and technically feasible for that system or would only result in a marginal reduction
in TTHM for the system. The Department's determination as to the availability and effectiveness of such
treatment methods will be based upon studies by the system and other relevant information. If a system
submits information intending to demonstrate that a treatment method is not available and effective for
TTHM control for that system, the Department will make a finding whether this information supports a
decision that such treatment method is not available and effective for that system before requiring
installation and/or use of such treatment method.

  (3) Pursuant to R.61-58.9(B)(4)(c) - (g), the Department will issue a schedule of compliance that may
require the system being granted the variance to examine the following treatment methods to determine the
probability that any of these methods will significantly reduce the level of TTHM for that system and, if
such probability exists, to determine whether any of these methods are technically feasible and
economically reasonable, and that the TTHM reductions obtained will be commensurate with the costs
incurred with the installation and use of such treatment methods for that system:

     (a) Introduction of off-line water storage for THM precursor reduction.

     (b) Aeration for TTHM reduction, where geographically and environmentally appropriate.

     (c) Introduction of clarification where not currently practiced.

200 | Regulation 61-58.9
     (d) Consideration of alternative sources of raw water.

     (e) Use of ozone as an alternate or supplemental disinfectant or oxidant.

   (4) If the Department determines that a treatment method identified in paragraph (3) above is technically
feasible, economically reasonable and will achieve TTHM reductions commensurate with the costs incurred
with the installation and/or use of such treatment method for the system, the Department will require the
system to install and/or use that treatment method in connection with its compliance schedule. The
Department's determination will be based upon studies by the system and other relevant information. In no
event will the Department require a system to install and/or use a treatment method not described in
paragraph (1) or (3) above to obtain or maintain a variance from the TTHM maximum contaminant level
or in connection with any variance compliance schedule.

E. Variances from the Maximum Contaminant Level for Fluoride.

  (1) The following are identified as the best technology, treatment techniques or other means generally
available for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant level for fluoride:

     (a) Activated alumina absorption, centrally applied; and,

     (b) Reverse osmosis, centrally applied.

   (2) The Department will consider a request for a variance from the maximum contaminant level for
fluoride only from a community water system which has installed the best available technology or treatment
method specified in paragraph (1) above unless the Department determines that such treatment method is
not available and effective for fluoride control for the system. A treatment method will not be considered
to be "available and effective" for an individual system if the treatment method would not be technically
appropriate and technically feasible for that system. The Department's determination as to the availability
and effectiveness of such treatment methods will be based upon studies by the system and other relevant
information. If a system submits information to demonstrate that a treatment method is not available and
effective for fluoride control for that system, the Department will make a finding whether this information
supports a decision that such treatment method is not available and effective for that system before requiring
installation and/or use of such treatment method.

  (3) Pursuant to R.61-58.9(B)(4)(c)-(g), the Department will issue a schedule of compliance that may
require the system being granted the variance to examine the following treatment methods to determine the
probability that any of these methods will significantly reduce the level of fluoride for that system and, if
such probability exists, to determine whether any of these methods are technically feasible and
economically reasonable and that the fluoride reductions obtained will be commensurate with the costs
incurred with the installation and use of such treatment methods for that system:

     (a) Modification of lime softening

     (b) Alum coagulation

     (c) Electrodialysis

201 | Regulation 61-58.9
    (d) Anion exchange resins

    (e) Well field management

    (f) Alternate source

    (g) Regionalization

   (4) If the Department determines that a treatment method identified in paragraph (3) above or other
treatment method is technically feasible, economically reasonable, and will achieve fluoride reductions
commensurate with the costs incurred with the installation and/or use of such treatment method for the
system, the Department will require the system to install and/or use that treatment method in connection
with its compliance schedule. The Department's determination will be based upon studies by the system
and other relevant information.

F. Variances and Exemptions from the Maximum Contaminant Levels for Organic and Inorganic Chemicals
and Exemptions from the Treatment Technique for Lead and Copper.

  (1) The following are identified as the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means available
for achieving compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for volatile organic chemicals as listed in
R.61-58.5.N and the organic chemicals listed in R.61-58.5.D(2):

1
  Section 1412(b)(4)(E)(ii) of SDWA specifies that SSCTs must be affordable and technically feasible for
small systems.
2
  SSCTs for Arsenic V. Pre-oxidation may be required to convert Arsenic III to Arsenic V.
3
  The Act (ibid.) specifies three categories of small systems: (i) those serving 25 or more, but fewer than
501, (ii) those serving more than 500, but fewer than 3,301, and (iii) those serving more than 3,300, but
fewer than 10,001.
4
  When POU or POE devices are used for compliance, programs to ensure proper long-term operation,
maintenance, and monitoring must be provided by the water system to ensure adequate performance.
5
  Unlikely to be installed solely for arsenic removal. May require pH adjustment to optimal range if high
removals are needed.
6
  Technologies reject a large volume of water--may not be appropriate for areas where water quantity may
be an issue.
7
  To obtain high removals, iron to arsenic ratio must be at least 20:1.

   (4) The Department shall require community water systems and non-transient, non- community water
systems to install and/or use any treatment method identified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the section as a
condition for granting a variance except as provided in paragraph (4) of this section. If, after the system's
installation of the treatment method, the system cannot meet the MCL, that system shall be eligible for a
variance under the provisions of section B above.

   (5) If a system can demonstrate through comprehensive engineering assessments, which may include
pilot plant studies, that the treatment methods identified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the section would only
achieve a de minimis reduction in contaminants, the Department may issue a schedule of compliance that
requires the system being granted the variance to examine other treatment methods as a condition of
obtaining the variance.

   (6) If the Department determines that a treatment method identified in paragraph (4) of this section is
technically feasible, the Department may require the system to install and/or use that treatment method in
connection with a compliance schedule issued under the provisions of R.61-58.9.B(4)(c) through (g). The
Department's determination shall be based upon studies by the system and other relevant information.

  (7) The Department may require a public water system to use bottled water, point-of-use devices, point-
of-entry devices or other means as a condition of granting a variance or an exemption from the requirements

205 | Regulation 61-58.9
of R.61-58.5.B(2), D(2)(b) and N, to avoid an unreasonable risk to health. The Department may require a
public water system to use bottled water and point-of-use devices or other means, but not point-of-entry
devices, as a condition for granting an exemption from corrosion control treatment requirements for lead
and copper in R.61-58.11.C and D to avoid an unreasonable risk to health. The Department may require a
public water system to use point-of-entry devices as a condition for granting an exemption from the source
water and lead service line replacement requirements for lead and copper under R.61-58.11.E or F to avoid
an unreasonable risk to health.

   (8) Public water systems that use bottled water as a condition for receiving a variance or exemption
from the requirements of R.61-58.5.B(2), D(2)(b) and N, or an exemption from the requirements of R.61-
58.11.C through F, must meet the requirements in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section in addition to
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section:

     (a) The public water system must develop and put in place a monitoring program approved by the
Department that provides reasonable assurances that the bottled water meets all maximum contaminant
levels. The public water system must monitor a representative sample of the bottled water for all
contaminants regulated under R.61- 58.5.B(2), D(2)(b) and N the first quarter that it supplies the bottled
water to the public, and annually thereafter. Results of the monitoring program shall be provided to the
Department annually.

     (b) The public water system must obtain the bottled water from a bottled water company that has
been permitted by the Department. The public water system must certify such to the Department the first
quarter after it supplies bottled water and annually thereafter.

    (c) The public water system is fully responsible for the provision of sufficient quantities of bottled
water to every person supplied by the public water system, via door- to-door bottled water delivery.

  (9) Public water systems that use point-of-use or point-of-entry devices as a condition for obtaining a
variance or exemption from the maximum contaminant levels listed in R.61-58.5.B(2), D(2)(b) and N must
meet the following requirements:

     (a) It is the responsibility of the public water system to operate and maintain the point-of-use and/or
point-of-entry treatment system.

     (b) The public water system must develop a monitoring plan and obtain Department approval for the
plan before point-of-use or point-of-entry devices are installed for compliance. This monitoring plan must
provide health protection equivalent to a monitoring plan for central water treatment.

    (c) Effective technology must be properly applied under a plan approved by the Department and the
microbiological safety of the water must be maintained at all times.

     (d) The public water system must provide adequate certification of performance, field testing, and, if
not included in the certification process, a rigorous engineering design review of the point-of-use and/or
point-of-entry devices.

     (e) The design and application of the point-of-use and/or point-of-entry devices must consider the
tendency for an increase in heterotrophic bacteria concentrations in water treated with activated carbon. It

206 | Regulation 61-58.9
may be necessary to use frequent backwashing, post- contactor disinfection, and Heterotrophic Plate Count
monitoring to ensure that the microbiological safety of the water is not compromised.

     (f) All consumers shall be protected. Every building connected to the system must have a point-of-
use or point-of-entry device installed, maintained, and adequately monitored. The Department must be
assured by the public water system that every building is subject to treatment and monitoring, and that the
rights and responsibilities of the public water system customer convey with title upon sale of the property.

     (g) In requiring the use of a point-of-entry device as a condition for granting an exemption from the
treatment requirements for lead and copper under R.61-58.11.E or F, the Department must be assured that
use of the device will not cause increased corrosion of lead and copper bearing materials located between
the device and the tap that could increase contaminant levels at the tap.

G. Variances and Exemptions from the Maximum Contaminant Level for Total Coliforms.

  (1) The following are identified as the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means available
for achieving compliance with the MCL for total coliforms:

     (a) Protection of wells from contamination by coliforms by appropriate placement and construction;

     (b) Maintenance of a disinfectant residual throughout the distribution system;

     (c) Proper maintenance of the distribution system including appropriate pipe replacement and repair
procedures, main flushing programs, proper operation and maintenance of storage tanks and reservoirs, and
continual maintenance of positive water pressure in all parts of the distribution system;

    (d) Filtration and/or disinfection of surface water, as described in R.61-58.10, or disinfection of
ground water using strong oxidants such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or ozone; or

    (e) The development and implementation of an EPA-approved State Wellhead Protection Program
under section 1428 of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

   (2) No variances or exemptions from the maximum contaminant levels in R.61-58.5.F or the treatment
technique requirements of R.61-58.10 are permitted. In accordance with EPA rules, the Department has
stayed the effective date of this section relating to the total coliform MCL of R.61- 58.5.F(1) for systems
that demonstrate to the Department that the violation of the total coliform MCL is due to persistent growth
of total coliforms in the distribution system rather than fecal or pathogenic contamination, a treatment lapse
or deficiency, or a problem in the operation or maintenance of the distribution system. This is stayed until
March 31, 2016, at which time the total coliform MCL is no longer effective.

H. Variances and Exemptions from the Filtration and Disinfection Requirements.

  (1) No variances from the filtration and disinfection requirements are permitted.

  (2) No exemptions from the disinfection requirements of R.61-58.10.D(1)(c) and (2)(b) are permitted.

  A POU, or "point-of-use" technology is a treatment device installed at a single tap used for the purpose of
reducing contaminants in drinking water at that one tap. POU devices are typically installed at the kitchen
tap. See the April 21, 2000 NODA for more details.

Limitations Footnotes: Technologies for Radionuclides:
a
  The regeneration solution contains high concentrations of the contaminant ions. Disposal options should
be carefully considered before choosing this technology.
b
   When POU devices are used for compliance, programs for long-term operation, maintenance, and
monitoring must be provided by water utility to ensure proper performance.
c
  Reject water disposal options should be carefully considered before choosing this technology. See other
RO limitations described in the SWTR compliance technologies table.
d
  The combination of variable source water quality and the complexity of the water chemistry involved may
make this technology too complex for small surface water systems.
e
  Removal efficiencies can vary depending on water quality.
f
  This technology may be very limited in application to small systems. Since the process requires static
mixing, detention basins, and filtration, it is most applicable to systems with sufficiently high sulfate levels
that already have a suitable filtration treatment train in place.
g
  This technology is most applicable to small systems that already have filtration in place.
h
  Handling of chemicals required during regeneration and pH adjustment may be too difficult for small
systems without an adequately trained operator.
i
  Assumes modification to a coagulation/filtration process already in place.

    Note: Numbers correspond to those technologies found listed in the Table B to this paragraph.

   (3) The Department shall require community water systems to install and/or use any treatment
technology identified in Table A to this section, or in the case of small water systems (those serving 10,000
persons or fewer), Table B and Table C of this section, as a condition for granting a variance except as
provided in paragraph (4) of this section. If, after the system's installation of the treatment technology, the
system cannot meet the MCL, that system shall be eligible for a variance under the provisions of this section.

   (4) If a community water system can demonstrate through comprehensive engineering assessments,
which may include pilot plant studies, that the treatment technologies identified in this section would only
achieve a de minimus reduction in the contaminant level, the Department may issue a schedule of
compliance that requires the system being granted the variance to examine other treatment technologies as
a condition of obtaining the variance.

   (5) If the Department determines that a treatment technology identified under paragraph (4) of this
section is technically feasible, the Administrator or the Department may require the system to install and/or
use that treatment technology in connection with a compliance schedule issued under the provisions of this
section. The Department's determination shall be based upon studies by the system and other relevant
information.

  (6) The Department may require a community water system to use bottled water, point-of- use devices,
point-of-entry devices or other means as a condition of granting a variance or an exemption from the
requirements of R.61-58R.5.6.H1 of this regulation, to avoid an unreasonable risk to health.

  (7) Community water systems that use bottled water as a condition for receiving a variance or an
exemption from the requirements of R.61-58R.5.6H1 of this regulation must meet the requirements
specified in Section F(7)(a) through (c) above.

  (8) Community water systems that use point-of-use or point-of-entry devices as a condition for
obtaining a variance or an exemption from the radionuclides SPDWRs must meet the conditions in Section
F(8) above.




210 | Regulation 61-58.9
                                 FILTRATION AND DISINFECTION

A. Applicability.

  (1) This regulation establishes criteria and requirements for the filtration and disinfection of drinking
water served to the public. This regulation shall apply to each community and non-community water
system, unless the water system meets all of the following conditions:

      (a) Consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and does not have any collection and treatment
facilities);

     (b) Obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a public water system to which
such regulations apply;

     (c) Does not sell water to any person; and

     (d) Is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate commerce.

   (2) The requirements of R.61-58.10.B through R61-58.10.G apply to all public water systems supplied
by a surface water source and all public water systems supplied by a ground water source under the direct
influence of surface water. In addition to these requirements, all public water systems supplied by a surface
water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water which serve at least 10,000
people must also comply with R.61-58.10.H and for all public water systems supplied by a surface water
source or a groundwater source under the direct influence of surface water which serve fewer than 10,000
people must also comply with R.61-58.10.I.

B. General Requirements.

   (1) The requirements of this regulation constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These
regulations establish criteria under which filtration is required as a treatment technique for public water
systems supplied by a surface water source and public water systems supplied by a ground water source
under the direct influence of surface water. In addition, these regulations establish treatment technique
requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants: Giardia lamblia,
viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria, Legionella, and turbidity. Each public water system with a
surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water shall provide
treatment of that source water that complies with these treatment technique requirements. The treatment
technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which
reliably achieve:

     (a) At least 99.9 percent (3-log) removal and/or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts between a point
where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream
before or at the first customer; and

      (b) At least 99.99 percent (4-log) removal and/or inactivation of viruses between a point where the
raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the
first customer.


211 | Regulation 61-58.10
   (2) A public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct
influence of surface water is considered to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this
section if:

     (a) It meets the requirements for avoiding filtration in R.61-58.10.C and the disinfection requirements
in R.61-58.10.D(1); or,

    (b) It meets the filtration requirements in R.61-58.10.E and the disinfection requirements in R.61-
58.10.D(2).

   (3) Each public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct
influence of surface water shall be operated by qualified personnel who meet the requirements specified by
the Department.

C. Criteria for Avoiding Filtration.

   A public water system that uses a surface water source shall meet all of the conditions of paragraphs (1)
and (2) of this section, and is subject to paragraph (3) of this section, beginning December 30, 1991, unless
the Department has determined, in writing, that filtration is required. A public water system that uses a
ground water source under the direct influence of surface water shall meet all of the conditions of
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section and is subject to paragraph (3) of this section, beginning 18 months
after the Department determines that it is under the direct influence of surface water, or December 30, 1991,
whichever is later, unless the Department has determined, in writing, that filtration is required. If the
Department determines, in writing, before December 30, 1991, that filtration is required, the system shall
have installed filtration and meet the criteria for filtered systems specified in R.61-58.10.D(2) and R.61-
58.10.E by June 29, 1993. Within 18 months of the failure of a system using surface water or a ground
water source under the direct influence of surface water to meet any one of the requirements of paragraphs
(1) and (2) of this section or after June 29, 1993, whichever is later, the system shall have installed filtration
and meet the criteria for filtered systems specified in R.61- 58.10.D(2) and R.61-58.10.E.

  (1) Source water quality conditions.

     (a) The fecal coliform concentration must be equal to or less than 20/100 ml, or the total coliform
concentration must be equal to or less than 100/100 ml [measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(a) and
(b) and (2)(a)], in representative samples of the source water immediately prior to the first or only point of
disinfectant application in at least 90 percent of the measurements made for the 6 previous months that the
system served water to the public on an ongoing basis. If a system measures both fecal and total coliforms,
the fecal coliform criterion, but not the total coliform criterion, in this paragraph must be met.

     (b) The turbidity level cannot exceed 5 NTU [measured as specified in R.61- 58.10.F(1)(d) and
(2)(b)] in representative samples of the source water immediately prior to the first or only point of
disinfectant application unless:

      (i) The Department determines that any such event was caused by circumstances that were unusual
and unpredictable; and



212 | Regulation 61-58.10
        (ii) As a result of any such event, there have not been more than two events in the past 12 months
the system served water to the public, or more than five events in the past 120 months the system served
water to the public, in which the turbidity level exceeded 5 NTU. An "event" is a series of consecutive days
during which at least one turbidity measurement each day exceeds 5 NTU.

  (2) Site-specific conditions.

     (a) (i) The public water system shall meet the requirements of R.61- 58.10.D(1)(a) at least 11 of the
12 previous months that the system served water to the public, on an ongoing basis, unless the system fails
to meet the requirements during 2 of the 12 previous months that the system served water to the public, and
the Department determines that at least one of these failures was caused by circumstances that were unusual
and unpredictable.

       (ii) The public water system shall meet the requirements of R.61- 58.10.D(1)(b) at all times the
system serves water to the public.

       (iii) The public water system shall meet the requirements of R.61- 58.10.D(1)(c) at all times the
system serves water to the public unless the Department determines that any such failure was caused by
circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable.

       (iv) The public water system shall meet the requirements of R.61- 58.10.D(1)(d) on an ongoing
basis unless the Department determines that failure to meet these requirements was not caused by a
deficiency in treatment of the source water.

     (b) The public water system shall maintain a watershed control program which minimizes the
potential for contamination by Giardia lamblia cysts and viruses in the source water. The Department shall
determine whether the watershed control program is adequate to meet this goal. The adequacy of a program
to limit potential contamination by Giardia lamblia cysts and viruses shall be based on: the
comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the system's program to monitor and
control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which the water system has
maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed. At a minimum, the watershed
control program shall;

       (i) Characterize the watershed hydrology and land ownership;

       (ii) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source
water quality; and

       (iii) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.

The public water system shall demonstrate through ownership and/or written agreements with landowners
within the watershed that it can control all human activities which may have an adverse impact on the
microbiological quality of the source water. The public water system shall submit an annual report to the
Department that identifies any special concerns about the watershed and how they are being handled;
describes activities in the watershed that affect water quality; and projects what adverse activities are
expected to occur in the future and describes how the public water system expects to address them. For
systems using a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, an approved wellhead

213 | Regulation 61-58.10
protection program developed under section 1428 of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act may be used, if
the Department deems it appropriate, to meet these requirements.

     (c) The public water system shall be subject to an annual on-site inspection to assess the watershed
control program and disinfection treatment process. Either the Department or a party approved by the
Department shall conduct the on-site inspection. The inspection shall be conducted by competent
individuals such as sanitary and civil engineers, sanitarians, or technicians who have experience and
knowledge about the operation and maintenance of a public water system, and who have a sound
understanding of public health principles and waterborne diseases. A report of the on-site inspection
summarizing all findings shall be prepared every year. The on-site inspection shall indicate to the
Department's satisfaction that the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process are
adequately designed and maintained. The on-site inspection shall include:

       (i) A review of the effectiveness of the watershed control program;

       (ii) A review of the physical condition of the source intake and how well it is protected;

        (iii) A review of the system's equipment maintenance program to ensure there is low probability for
failure of the disinfection process;

       (iv) An inspection of the disinfection equipment for physical deterioration;

       (v) A review of operating procedures;

       (vi) A review of data records to ensure that all required tests are being conducted and recorded and
disinfection is effectively practiced; and

       (vii) Identification of any improvements which are needed in the equipment, system maintenance
and operation, or data collection.

     (d) The public water system shall not have been identified as a source of a waterborne disease
outbreak, or if it has been so identified, the system shall have been modified sufficiently to prevent another
such occurrence, as determined by the Department.

     (e) The public water system shall comply with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total
coliforms in R.61 58.5.F(1) and (2) and the MCL for E. coli in R.61- 58.5.F(3) at least 11 months of the 12
previous months that the system served water to the public, on an ongoing basis, unless the Department
determines that failure to meet this requirement was not caused by a deficiency in treatment of the source
water.

     (f) The public water system must comply with the requirements for trihalomethanes in R.61-58.13.

  (3) Treatment technique violations.

     (a) A system is in violation of a treatment technique requirement if:



214 | Regulation 61-58.10
      (i) it fails to meet any one of the criteria in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section and/or the
Department has determined, in writing, that filtration is required; and

       (ii) it fails to install filtration by the date specified in the introductory paragraph of this section.

     (b) A system that has not installed filtration is in violation of a treatment technique requirement if:

      (i) The turbidity level [measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(d) and (2)(b)] in a representative
sample of the source water immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfection application exceeds
5 NTU; or

       (ii) The system is identified as a source of a waterborne disease outbreak.

D. Disinfection.

   A public water system that uses a surface water source and does not provide filtration treatment shall
provide the disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (1) of this section beginning December 30, 1991,
unless the Department determines, in writing, that filtration is required. A public water system that uses a
ground water source under the direct influence of surface water and does not provide filtration treatment
shall provide disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (1) of this section beginning December 30, 1991,
or 18 months after the Department determines that the ground water source is under the influence of surface
water, whichever is later, unless the Department has determined, in writing, that filtration is required. If the
Department has determined that filtration is required, the system shall comply with any interim disinfection
requirements the Department deems necessary before filtration is installed. A system that uses a surface
water source that provides filtration treatment shall provide the disinfection treatment specified in paragraph
(2) of this section beginning June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed, whichever is later. A
system that uses a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water and provides filtration
treatment shall provide disinfection treatment as specified in paragraph (2) of this section by June 29, 1993,
or beginning when filtration is installed, whichever is later. Failure to meet any requirement of this section
after the applicable date specified in this introductory paragraph is a treatment technique violation.

  (1) Disinfection requirements for public water systems that do not provide filtration.

   Each public water system that does not provide filtration treatment shall provide disinfection treatment
as follows:

      (a) The disinfection treatment shall be sufficient to ensure at least 99.9 percent (3- log) inactivation
of Giardia lamblia cysts and 99.99 percent (4-log) inactivation of viruses, every day the system serves water
to the public, except any one day each month. Each day a system serves water to the public, the public
water system shall calculate the CT value(s) from the system's treatment parameters, using the procedure
specified in R.61-58.10.F(2)(c), and determine whether this value(s) is sufficient to achieve the specified
inactivation rates for Giardia lamblia cysts and viruses. If a system uses a disinfectant other than chlorine,
the system may demonstrate to the Department, through the use of a Department-approved protocol for on-
site disinfection challenge studies or other information satisfactory to the Department, that CT99.9 values
other than those specified in Tables 2.1 and 3.1 in R.61-58.10.F(2)(c) or other operational parameters are
adequate to demonstrate that the system is achieving minimum inactivation rates required by paragraph
(1)(a) of this section.

215 | Regulation 61-58.10
     (b) The disinfection system shall have either:

        (i) redundant components, including an auxiliary power supply with automatic start-up and alarm
to ensure that disinfectant application is maintained continuously while water is being delivered to the
distribution system, or

       (ii) automatic shut-off of delivery of water to the distribution system whenever there is less than
0.2 mg/L of residual disinfectant concentration in the water. If the Department determines that automatic
shut-off would cause unreasonable risk to health or interfere with fire protection, the system shall comply
with paragraph (1)(b)(i) of this section.

     (c) The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system, measured as
specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(e) and (2)(e), cannot be less than 0.2 mg/L for more than 4 hours.

     (d) (i) The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine,
combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1) (e) and (2)(f), cannot be
undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any two consecutive months that the
system serves water to the public. Water in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria
concentration less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in
R.61-58.10.F(1)(c), is deemed to have a detectable disinfectant residual for purposes of determining
compliance with this requirement. Thus, the value "V" in the following formula cannot exceed 5 percent in
one month, for any two consecutive months.

     V = c + d + e x 100
           a+b


where:


     a = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured;
     b = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured but heterotrophic
     bacteria plate count (HPC) is measured;
     c = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not
     detected and no HPC is measured;
     d = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not detected and
     where the HPC is >500/ml; and
     e = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured and HPC is
     >500/ml.


        (ii) If the Department determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means
for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and
temperature conditions specified by R.61-58.10.F(1)(c) and that the system is providing adequate
disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (1)(d)(i) of this section do not apply
to that system.

216 | Regulation 61-58.10
  (2) Disinfection requirements for public water systems which provide filtration.

   Each public water system that provides filtration treatment shall provide disinfection treatment as
follows:

     (a) The disinfection treatment shall be sufficient to ensure that the total treatment processes of that
system achieve at least 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivation and/or removal of Giardia lamblia cysts and at least
99.99 percent (4-log) inactivation and/or removal of viruses, as determined by the Department.

     (b) The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system, measured as
specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(e) and (3)(b), cannot be less than 0.2 mg/L for more than four (4) hours.

     (c) (i) The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine,
combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1) (e) and (3)(c), cannot be
undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any two consecutive months that the
system serves water to the public. Water in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria
concentration less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in
R.61-58.10(F)(1)(c), is deemed to have a detectable disinfectant residual for purposes of determining
compliance with this requirement. Thus, the value "V" in the following formula cannot exceed 5 percent in
one month, for any two consecutive months.

     V = c + d + e x 100
           a+b


where:


     a = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured;
     b = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured but heterotrophic
     bacteria plate count (HPC) is measured;
     c = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not
     detected and no HPC is measured;
     d = number of instances where no residual disinfectant concentration is detected and where the HPC
     is >500/ml; and
     e = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured and HPC is
     >500/ml.


       (ii) If the Department determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means
for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and
temperature conditions specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(c) and that the system is providing adequate
disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (2)(c)(i) of this section do not apply.




217 | Regulation 61-58.10
E. Filtration.

   A public water system that uses a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence
of surface water, and does not meet all of the criteria in R.61-58.10.C(1) and (2) for avoiding filtration,
shall provide treatment consisting of both disinfection, as specified in R.61-58.10.D(2), and filtration
treatment which complies with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section by June
29, 1993, or within 18 months of the failure to meet any one of the criteria for avoiding filtration in R.61-
58.10.C(1) and (2), whichever is later. Failure to meet any requirement of this section after the date specified
in this introductory paragraph is a treatment technique violation.

  (1) Conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration.

     (a) For systems using conventional filtration or direct filtration, the turbidity level of representative
samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 0.5 NTU in at least 95 percent of the
measurements taken each month, measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(d) and (3)(a), except that if the
Department determines that the system is capable of achieving at least 99.9 percent removal and/or
inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts at some turbidity level higher than 0.5 NTU in at least 95 percent of
the measurements taken each month, the Department may substitute this higher turbidity limit for that
system. However, in no case may the Department approve a turbidity limit that allows more than 1 NTU in
more than 5 percent of the samples taken each month, measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(d) and
(3)(a).

    (b) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed
5 NTU, measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(d) and (3)(a).

     (c) Beginning January 1, 2002, systems serving at least 10,000 people must meet the requirements
of R.61-58.10.H(4)(a)

     (d) Beginning January 1, 2005, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must meet the turbidity
requirements in Section I(6) below.

  (2) Slow sand filtration.

      (a) For systems using slow sand filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a system's
filtered water must be less than or equal to 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each
month, measured as specified in R.61- 58.10.F(1)(d) and (3)(a), except that if the Department determines
there is no significant interference with disinfection at a higher turbidity level, the Department may
substitute this higher turbidity limit for that system.

    (b) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed
5 NTU, measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(d) and (3)(a).

  (3) Diatomaceous earth filtration.

     (a) For systems using diatomaceous earth filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a
system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken
each month, measured as specified in R.61- 58.10.F(1) (d) and (3)(a).

218 | Regulation 61-58.10
    (b) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed
5 NTU, measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1)(d) and (3)(a).

  (4) Other filtration technologies.

   A public water system may use a filtration technology not listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this
section if it demonstrates to the Department, using pilot plant studies or other means, that the alternative
filtration technology, in combination with disinfection treatment that meets the requirements of Section
D(2), above, consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts and
99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses. For a system that makes this demonstration, the
requirements of paragraph (2) of this section apply. Beginning January 1, 2002, systems serving at least
10,000 people must meet the requirements for other filtration technologies in R.61-58.10.H(4)(b).
Beginning January 1, 2005, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must meet the requirements for other
filtration technologies in Section I(6) below.

F. Analytical and Monitoring Requirements.

  (1) Analytical requirements.

   Only the analytical method(s) specified in this paragraph, or otherwise approved by EPA, may be used
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of R.61-58.10.C, R.61-58.10.D, and R.61-58.10.E.
Measurements for pH, temperature, turbidity and residual disinfectant concentrations shall be conducted by
a party approved by the Department. Measurements for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and HPC shall be
conducted by a laboratory certified by the Department or EPA to do such analysis. Until laboratory
certification criteria are developed for the analysis of HPC and fecal coliforms, any laboratory certified for
total coliform analysis by EPA is deemed certified for HPC and fecal coliform analysis. All procedures
shall be performed in accordance with EPA-approved methods outlined in 40 CFR 141 (11-8- 06 edition).

  (2) Monitoring requirements for systems that do not provide filtration.

  A public water system that uses a surface water source and does not provide filtration treatment shall
begin monitoring, as specified in this paragraph, beginning December 31, 1990, unless the Department has
determined in writing that filtration is required, in which case the Department may specify alternative
monitoring requirements, as appropriate, until filtration is in place. A public water system that uses a ground
water source under the direct influence of surface water and does not provide filtration treatment shall begin
monitoring as specified in this paragraph beginning December 31, 1990, or 6 months after the Department
determines that the ground water source is under the direct influence of surface water, whichever is later,
unless the Department has determined in writing that filtration is required, in which case the Department
may specify alternative monitoring requirements, as appropriate, until filtration is in place.

     (a) Fecal coliform or total coliform density measurements as required by R.61- 58.10.C(1)(a) shall
be performed on representative source water samples immediately prior to the first or only point of
disinfectant application. The system shall sample for fecal or total coliforms at the following minimum
frequency each week the system serves water to the public:

                  >25,000                                                    5

                  1 Must   be taken on separate days.

   Also, one fecal or total coliform density measurement shall be made every day the system serves water
to the public and the turbidity of the source water exceeds 1 NTU (these samples count towards the weekly
coliform sampling requirements) unless the Department determines that the system, for logistical reasons
outside the system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection.

     (b) Turbidity measurements as required by R.61-58.10.C(1)(b) shall be performed on representative
grab samples of source water immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant application every
four hours (or more frequently) that the system serves water to the public. A public water system may
substitute continuous turbidity monitoring for grab sample monitoring if it validates the continuous
measurement for accuracy on a regular basis using a protocol approved by the Department.

     (c) The total inactivation ratio for each day that the system is in operation shall be determined based
on the CT99.9 values in Table 1.1 - 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1 of this section, as appropriate. The parameters necessary
to determine the total inactivation ratio shall be monitored as follows:

       (i) The temperature of the disinfected water shall be measured at least once per day at each residual
disinfectant concentration sampling point.

        (ii) If the system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water shall be measured at least once per
day at each chlorine residual disinfectant concentration sampling point.

        (iii) The disinfectant contact time(s) ("T") shall be determined for each day during peak hourly
flow.

      (iv) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) ("C") of the water before or at the first customer shall
be measured each day during peak hourly flow.

       (v) If a system uses a disinfectant other than chlorine, the system may demonstrate to the
Department, through the use of a Department-approved protocol for on-site disinfection challenge studies
or other information satisfactory to the Department, that CT99.9 values other than those specified in Tables
2.1 and 3.1 in this section or other operational parameters are adequate to demonstrate that the system is
achieving the minimum inactivation rates required by R.61-58.10.D(1)(a).

  1These  values are for pH values of 6 to 9. These CT values may be assumed to achieve greater than 99.99 percent inactivation
  of viruses only if chlorine is added and mixed in the water prior to the addition of ammonia. If this condition is not met, the
  system shall demonstrate, based on on-site studies or other information, as approved by the Department, that the system is
  achieving at least 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses. CT values between the indicated temperatures may be determined by
  linear interpolation. If no interpolation is used, use the CT99.9 value at the lower temperature for determining CT99.9 values
  between indicated temperatures.

    (d) The total inactivation ratio shall be calculated at follows:

       (i) If the system uses only one point of disinfectant application, the system may determine the total
inactivation ratio based on either of the following two methods:
224 | Regulation 61-58.10
         (A) One inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT99.9) is determined before or at the first customer during
peak hourly flow and if the CTcalc/CT99.9 ≥1.0, the 99.9 percent Giardia lamblia inactivation requirement
has been achieved; or

          (B) Successive CTcalc/CT99.9 values, representing sequential inactivation ratios, are
determined between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during
peak hourly flow. Under this alternative, the following method shall be used to calculate the total
inactivation ratio:

          Step 1: Determine CTcalc for each sequence
                                    CT99.9

          Step 2: Add the      CTcalc values together ∑ (CTcalc)
                               CT99.9                  CT99.9

          Step 3: If           ∑ CTcalc ≥1.0,
                               CT99.9

the 99.9 percent Giardia lamblia inactivation requirement has been achieved.

        (ii) If the system uses more than one point of disinfectant application before or at the first customer,
the system shall determine the CT value of each disinfection sequence immediately prior to the next point
of disinfectant application during peak hourly flow. The CTcalc/CT99.9 value of each sequence and

       ∑ CTcalc
         CT99.9

shall be calculated using the method in paragraph (2)(d)(i)(B) of this section to determine if the system is
in compliance with R.61-58.10.D(1).

       (iii) Although not required, the total percent inactivation for a system with one or more points of
residual disinfectant concentration monitoring may be calculated by solving the following equation:

       Percent inactivation = 100 - 100
                                    10z

       where z = 3 x ∑ CTcalc
                       CT99.9

     (e) The residual disinfectant concentration of the water entering the distribution system shall be
monitored continuously, and the lowest value shall be recorded each day, except that if there is a failure in
the continuous monitoring equipment, grab sampling every 4 hours may be conducted in lieu of continuous
monitoring, but for no more than 5 working days following the failure of the equipment, and systems
serving 3,300 or fewer persons may take grab samples in lieu of providing continuous monitoring on an
ongoing basis at the frequencies prescribed below:

                  1The day's samples cannot be taken at the same time. The sampling intervals are subject to Department
                  review and approval.

   If at any time the residual disinfectant concentration falls below 0.2 mg/L in a system using grab sampling
in lieu of continuous monitoring, the system shall take a grab sample every 4 hours until the residual
concentration is equal to or greater than 0.2 mg/L.

     (f) (i) Until March 31, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration shall be measured at least at the
same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in
R.61 58.5.G. Beginning April 1, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration shall be measured at least at
the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified
in R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.I. The Department may allow a public water system which uses both
a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, and a ground
water source, to take disinfectant residual samples at points other than the total coliform sampling points if
the Department determines that such points are more representative of treated (disinfected) water quality
within the distribution system. Heterotrophic bacteria, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as
specified in R.61-58.10.F(1), may be measured in lieu of residual disinfectant concentration.

       (ii) If the Department determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means
for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and
temperature conditions specified by paragraph (1)(c) of this section and that the system is providing
adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (2)(f)(i) of this section do
not apply to that system.

  (3) Monitoring requirements for systems using filtration treatment.

  A public water system that uses a surface water source or a ground water source under the influence of
surface water and provides filtration treatment shall monitor in accordance with this paragraph beginning
June 29, 1993, or when filtration is installed, whichever is later.

     (a) Turbidity measurements as required by R.61-58.10.E shall be performed on representative
samples of the system's filtered water every four hours (or more frequently) that the system serves water to
the public. A public water system may substitute continuous turbidity monitoring for grab sample
monitoring if it validates the continuous measurement for accuracy on a regular basis using a protocol
approved by the Department. For any systems using slow sand filtration or filtration treatment other than
conventional treatment, direct filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration, the Department may reduce the
sampling frequency to once per day if it determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate
effective filtration performance. For systems serving 500 or fewer persons, the Department may reduce the
turbidity sampling frequency to once per day, regardless of the type of filtration treatment used if the
Department determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration
performance.


226 | Regulation 61-58.10
     (b) The residual disinfectant concentration of the water entering the distribution system shall be
monitored continuously, and the lowest value shall be recorded each day, except that if there is a failure in
the continuous monitoring equipment, grab sampling every 4 hours may be conducted in lieu of continuous
monitoring, but for no more than 5 working days following the failure of the equipment, and systems
serving 3,300 or fewer persons may take grab samples in lieu of providing continuous monitoring on an
ongoing basis at the frequencies each day prescribed below:

                  System size by population              Samples/day1
                  ≤500                                          1
                  501 to 1,000                                  2
                  1,001 to 2,500                                3
                  2,501 to 3,300                                4
                   1The day's samples cannot be taken at the same time. The sampling intervals are subject to Department
                  review and approval.

   If at any time the residual disinfectant concentration falls below 0.2 mg/L in a system using grab sampling
in lieu of continuous monitoring, the system shall take a grab sample every 4 hours until the residual
disinfectant concentration is equal to or greater than 0.2 mg/L.

   (c) (i) Until March 31, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration shall be measured at least at the
same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in
R.61-68.5.G. Beginning April 1, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration shall be measured at least at
the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified
in R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.I. The Department may allow a public water system which uses both
a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, and a ground
water source to take disinfectant residual samples at points other than the total coliform sampling points if
the Department determines that such points are more representative of treated (disinfected) water quality
within the distribution system. Heterotrophic bacteria, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as
specified in R.61-58.10.F(1), may be measured in lieu of residual disinfectant concentration.

       (ii) If the Department determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means
for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and
temperature conditions specified by paragraph (1)(c) of this section and that the system is providing
adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (3)(c)(i) of this section do
not apply to that system.

          e = the value in paragraph (1)(b)(viii)(E) of this section.

          (G) If the Department determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no
means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite
time and temperature conditions specified by R.61- 58.10.F(1)(c) and that the system is providing adequate

H. Enhanced Filtration and Disinfection - Systems Serving 10,000 or More People (Interim Enhanced
Surface Water Treatment Rule).

  (1) General requirements.

      (a) The requirements of this regulation constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These
regulations establish requirements for filtration and disinfection that are in addition to criteria under which
filtration and disinfection are required under Sections B through G above. The requirements of this section
are applicable to public water systems supplied by a surface water source and public water systems supplied

232 | Regulation 61-58.10
by a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water serving at least 10,000 people,
beginning January 1, 2002 unless otherwise specified. These regulations establish or extend treatment
technique requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants: Giardia
lamblia, viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria, Legionella, Cryptosporidium, and turbidity. Each
public water system supplied by a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence
of surface water system serving at least 10,000 people must provide treatment of its source water that
complies with these treatment technique requirements and are in addition to those identified in Sections B
through G above. The treatment technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water
treatment processes which reliably achieve:

        (i) At least 99 percent (2-log) removal of Cryptosporidium between a point where the raw water
is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first
customer for filtered systems, or Cryptosporidium control under the watershed control plan for unfiltered
systems.

        (ii) Compliance with the profiling and benchmark requirements under the provisions of paragraph
(3) of this section.

   (b) A public water system subject to the requirements of these regulations is considered to be in
compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this section if:

       (i) It meets the requirements for avoiding filtration in R.61-58.10.C and R.61-58.10.H(2) and the
disinfection requirements in R.61-58.10.D and R.61- 58.10.H(3); or

        (ii) It meets the applicable filtration requirements in either R.61-58.10.E or R.61-58.10.H(4) and
the disinfection requirements in R.61-58.10.D and R.61- 58.10.H(3).

    (c) Systems are not permitted to begin construction of uncovered finished water storage facilities
beginning February, 16, 1999.

     (d) Systems with a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface
water that did not conduct optional monitoring under Section H(3) because they served fewer than 10,000
persons when such monitoring was required, but served at least 10,000 persons prior to January 1, 2005
must comply with Section H. These systems must also consult with the Department to establish a
disinfection benchmark. A system that decides to make a significant change to its disinfection practice, as
described in Section H(3)(c)(i) must consult with the Department prior to making such change.

  (2) Criteria for avoiding filtration.

   In addition to the requirements of R.61-58.10.C, a public water system subject to the requirements of this
section that does not provide filtration must meet all of the conditions of paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) of
this section.

     (a) Site-specific conditions. In addition to site-specific conditions in R.61- 58.10.C(2), systems must
maintain the watershed control program under R.61- 58.10.C(2)(b) to minimize the potential for
contamination by Cryptosporidium oocysts in the source water. The watershed control program must, for
Cryptosporidium:

233 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (i) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source
water quality; and

       (ii) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.

     (b) During the onsite inspection conducted under the provisions of R.61- 58.10.C(2)(c), the
Department must determine whether the watershed control program established under 58.10.C(2)(b) is
adequate to limit potential contamination by Cryptosporidium oocysts. The adequacy of the program must
be based on the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the system's program to
monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which the water
system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed.

  (3) (a) Using data gathered from monitoring conducted by the Department during the time period of
January 1, 1999 through March 1, 2000, any system having either a TTHM annual average greater than or
equal to 0.064 mg/L or an HAA5 annual average greater than or equal to 0.048 mg/L during this period
must comply with paragraph (3)(b) of this section.

     (b) Disinfection profiling.

        (i) Any system that meets the criteria in paragraph (3)(a) of this section must develop a disinfection
profile of its disinfection practice for a period of up to three years.

        (ii) The system must monitor daily for a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months to
determine the total logs of inactivation for each day of operation, based on the CT99.9 values in Tables 1.1
- 1.6, 2.1, and 3.1 of R.61- 58.10.F(2), as appropriate, through the entire treatment plant. This system must
begin this monitoring not later than March 16, 2000. As a minimum, the system with a single point of
disinfectant application prior to entrance to the distribution system must conduct the monitoring in
paragraphs (3)(b)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section. A system with more than one point of disinfectant
application must conduct the monitoring in paragraphs (3)(b)(i) through (iv) of this section for each
disinfection segment. The system must monitor the parameters necessary to determine the total inactivation
ratio, using EPA approved analytical methods specified in 40 CFR 141, as follows:

        (iii) In lieu of the monitoring conducted under the provisions of paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to
develop the disinfection profile, the system may elect to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(iii)(A) of
this section. In addition to the monitoring conducted under the provisions of paragraph (b)(ii) of this section
to develop the disinfection profile, the system may elect to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(iii)(B)
of this section.

          (A) A PWS that has three years of existing operational data may submit those data, a profile
generated using those data, and a request that the State approve use of those data in lieu of monitoring under
the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section not later than March 16, 2000. The State must determine
whether these operational data are substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of
paragraph (b)(ii) of this section. These data must also be representative of Giardia lamblia inactivation
through the entire treatment plant and not just of certain treatment segments. Until the State approves this
request, the system is required to conduct monitoring under the provisions of paragraph (b)(ii) of this
section.

234 | Regulation 61-58.10
          (B) In addition to the disinfection profile generated under paragraph (3)(b)(ii) of this section, a
PWS that has existing operational data may use those data to develop a disinfection profile for additional
years. Such systems may use these additional yearly disinfection profiles to develop a benchmark under the
provisions of paragraph (3)(c) of this section. The State must determine whether these operational data are
substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of paragraph (3)(b)(ii) of this section. These
data must also be representative of inactivation through the entire treatment plant and not just of certain
treatment segments.

        (iv) If the system uses only one point of disinfectant application, the system may determine the total
inactivation ratio for the disinfection segment based on either of the methods in paragraph (3)(b)(iv)(A) or
(3)(b)(iv)(B) of this section.

          (A) Determine one inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT99.9) before or at the first customer during peak
hourly flow.

         (B) Determine successive CTcalc/CT99.9 values, representing sequential inactivation ratios,
between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourly
flow. Under this alternative, the system must calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining
(CTcalc/CT99.9) for each sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/CT99.9) values together to determine (Ó
(CTcalc/CT99.9)).

       (v) If the system uses more than one point of disinfectant application before the first customer, the
system must determine the CT value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next point of
disinfectant application, or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during peak hourly flow.
The (CTcalc/CT99.9) value of each segment and (∑ (CTcalc/CT99.9)) must be calculated using the method
in paragraph (3)(b)(iv) of this section.

       (vi) The system must determine the total logs of inactivation by multiplying the value calculated in
paragraph (b)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section by 3.0.

        (vii) A system that uses either chloramines or ozone for primary disinfection must also calculate the
logs of inactivation for viruses using a method approved by the Department.

        (viii) The system must retain disinfection profile data in graphic form, as a spreadsheet, or in some
other format acceptable to the Department for review as part of the sanitary survey.

     (c) Disinfection Benchmarking

       (i) Any system required to develop a disinfection profile under the provisions of paragraphs (3)(a)
and (3)(b) of this section and that decides to make a significant change to its disinfection practice must
consult with the Department prior to making such change. Significant changes to disinfection practice are:

          (A) Changes to the point of disinfection;

          (B) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;


235 | Regulation 61-58.10
          (C) Changes to the disinfection process; and

          (D) Any other modification identified by the Department.

       (ii) Any system that is modifying its disinfection practice must calculate its disinfection benchmark
using the following procedure:

          (A) For each year of profiling data collected and calculated under paragraph (b) of this section,
the system must determine the lowest average monthly Giardia lamblia inactivation in each year of
profiling data. The system must determine the average Giardia lamblia inactivation for each calendar month
for each year of profiling data by dividing the sum of daily Giardia lamblia of inactivation by the number
of values calculated for that month.

           (B) The disinfection benchmark is the lowest monthly average value (for systems with one year
of profiling data) or average of lowest monthly average values (for systems with more than one year of
profiling data) of the monthly logs of Giardia lamblia inactivation in each year of profiling data.

       (iii) A system that uses either chloramines or ozone for primary disinfection must also calculate the
disinfection benchmark for viruses using a method approved by the Department.

       (iv) The system must submit information in paragraphs (3)(c)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section to
the Department as part of its consultation process.

          (A) A description of the proposed change;

           (B) The disinfection profile for Giardia lamblia (and, if necessary, viruses) under paragraph (b)
of this section and benchmark as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

          (C) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current levels of disinfection.

  (4) Filtration

  A public water system subject to the requirements of this section that does not meet all of the criteria in
Section C above and paragraph (2) of this section for avoiding filtration must provide treatment consisting
of both disinfection, as specified in Section D above, and filtration treatment which complies with the
requirements of paragraph 4(a) or 4(b) of this section or Section E(2) or (3) by December 31, 2001.

     (a) Conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration.

      (i) For systems using conventional filtration or direct filtration, the turbidity level of representative
samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of the
measurements taken each month, measured as specified in Section F(1)(d) and (3)(a) above.

      (ii) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed
1 NTU, measured as specified in Section F(1)(d) and (3)(a) above.



236 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (iii) A system that uses lime softening may acidify representative samples prior to analysis using a
protocol approved by the Department.

      (b) Filtration technologies other than conventional filtration treatment, direct filtration, slow sand
filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration.

   A public water system may use a filtration technology not listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this section or in
Section E(2) or (3) if it demonstrates to the Department, using pilot plant studies or other means, that the
alternative filtration technology, in combination with disinfection treatment that meets the requirements of
Section D, consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts and
99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses, and 99 percent removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts,
and the Department approves the use of the filtration technology. For each approval, the Department will
set turbidity performance requirements that the system must meet at least 95 percent of the time and that
the system may not exceed at any time at a level that consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal and/or
inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts, 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses, and 99 percent
removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts.

  (5) Filtration sampling requirements

     (a) Monitoring requirements for systems using filtration treatment. In addition to monitoring required
by Section F above, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that provides
conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration must conduct continuous monitoring of turbidity for
each individual filter using an approved method in Section F above, and must calibrate turbidimeters using
the procedure specified by the manufacturer. Systems must record the results of individual filter monitoring
every fifteen (15) minutes.

     (b) If there is a failure in the continuous turbidity monitoring equipment, the system must conduct
grab sampling every four hours in lieu of continuous monitoring, but for no more than five working days
following the failure of the equipment.

  (6) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

   In addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in Section G above, a public water system
subject to the requirements of this subpart that provides conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration
must report monthly to the Department the information specified in paragraphs (6)(a) and (6)(b) of this
section beginning December 31, 2001. In addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in
Section G above, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that provides filtration
approved under paragraph (4)(b) of this section must report monthly to the Department the information
specified in paragraph (a) of this section beginning December 31, 2001. The reporting in paragraph (6)(a)
of this section is in lieu of the reporting specified in Section G above.

     (a) Turbidity measurements as required by paragraph (4) of this section must be reported within 10
days after the end of each month the system serves water to the public. Information that must be reported
includes:

       (i)   The total number of filtered water turbidity measurements taken during the month.


237 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (ii) The number and percentage of filtered water turbidity measurements taken during the month
which are less than or equal to the turbidity limits specified in paragraph (4)(a) or (4)(b) of this section.

        (iii) The date and value of any turbidity measurements taken during the month which exceed 1 NTU
for systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration, or which exceed the maximum level
set by the Department under paragraph (4)(b) of this section.

      (b) Systems must maintain the results of individual filter monitoring taken under paragraph (5) of
this section for at least three years. Systems must report that they have conducted individual filter turbidity
monitoring under paragraph (5) of this section within 10 days after the end of each month the system serves
water to the public. Systems must report individual filter turbidity measurement results taken under
paragraph (5) of this section within 10 days after the end of each month the system serves water to the
public only if measurements demonstrate one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (6)(b)(i) through (iv)
of this section. Systems that use lime softening may apply to the Department for alternative exceedance
levels for the levels specified in paragraphs (6)(b)(i) through (iv) of this section if they can demonstrate
that higher turbidity levels in individual filters are due to lime carryover only and not due to degraded filter
performance.

       (i) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 1.0 NTU in two
consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart, the system must report the filter number, the turbidity
measurement, and the date(s) on which the exceedance occurred. In addition, the system must either
produce a filter profile for the filter within 7 days of the exceedance (if the system is not able to identify an
obvious reason for the abnormal filter performance) and report that the profile has been produced or report
the obvious reason for the exceedance.

       (ii) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 0.5 NTU in two
consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart at the end of the first four hours of continuous filter
operation after the filter has been backwashed or otherwise taken offline, the system must report the filter
number, the turbidity, and the date(s) on which the exceedance occurred. In addition, the system must either
produce a filter profile for the filter within 7 days of the exceedance (if the system is not able to identify an
obvious reason for the abnormal filter performance) and report that the profile has been produced or report
the obvious reason for the exceedance.

        (iii) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 1.0 NTU in two
consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart at any time in each of three consecutive months, the
system must report the filter number, the turbidity measurement, and the date(s) on which the exceedance
occurred. In addition, the system must conduct a self-assessment of the filter within 14 days of the
exceedance and report that the self-assessment was conducted. The self assessment must consist of at least
the following components: assessment of filter performance; development of a filter profile; identification
and prioritization of factors limiting filter performance; assessment of the applicability of corrections; and
preparation of a filter self-assessment report.

       (iv) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 2.0 NTU in two
consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart at any time in each of two consecutive months, the
system must report the filter number, the turbidity measurement, and the date(s) on which the exceedance
occurred. In addition, the system must arrange for the conduct of a comprehensive performance evaluation
by the Department or a third party approved by the Department no later than 30 days following the

238 | Regulation 61-58.10
exceedance and have the evaluation completed and submitted to the Department no later than 90 days
following the exceedance.

     (c) Additional reporting requirements.

       (i) If at any time the turbidity exceeds one (1) NTU in representative samples of filtered water in
a system using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration, the system must inform the Department
as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day.

       (ii) If at any time the turbidity in representative samples of filtered water exceeds the maximum
level set by the Department under paragraph 4(b) of this section for filtration technologies other than
conventional filtration treatment, direct filtration, slow sand filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration, the
system must inform the Department as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day.

I. Enhanced Filtration and Disinfection - Systems Serving Fewer Than 10,000 People (Long Term 1
Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule).

  (1) General Requirements

      (a) The requirements of this regulation constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These
regulations establish requirements for filtration and disinfection that are in addition to criteria under which
filtration and disinfection are required for systems with surface water sources or ground water sources under
the influence of surface water. This regulation establishes or extends treatment technique requirements in
lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants: Giardia lamblia, viruses,
heterotrophic plate count bacteria, Legionella, Cryptosporidium and turbidity. The treatment technique
requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which reliably achieve:

        (i) At least 99 percent (2 log) removal of Cryptosporidium between a point where the raw water
is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first
customer for filtered systems, or Cryptosporidium control under the watershed control plan for unfiltered
systems; and

       (ii) Compliance with the profiling and benchmark requirements in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this
section.

     (b) Who is subject to the requirements of this section? You are subject to these requirements if your
system:

       (i)   Is a public water system;

       (ii) Uses surface water or GWUDI as a source; and

       (iii) Serves fewer than 10,000 persons.

     (c) When must my system comply with these requirements? You must comply with these
requirements in this regulation beginning January 1, 2005 except where otherwise noted.


239 | Regulation 61-58.10
   (d) What does this regulation require? There are seven (7) requirements of this subpart, and you must
comply with all requirements that are applicable to your system. These requirements are:

       (i) You must cover any finished water reservoir that you began to construct on or after March 15,
2002 as described in paragraph (2) of this section;

       (ii) If your system is an unfiltered system, you must comply with the updated watershed control
requirements described in paragraph (3) of this section;

       (iii) If your system is a community or non-transient non-community water systems you must
develop a disinfection profile as described in paragraph (4) of this section;

       (iv) If your system is considering making a significant change to its disinfection practices, you must
develop a disinfection benchmark and consult with the Department for approval of the change as described
in paragraph (5) of this section;

       (v) If your system is a filtered system, you must comply with the combined filter effluent
requirements as described in paragraph (6) of this section;

       (vi) If your system is a filtered system that uses conventional or direct filtration, you must comply
with the individual filter turbidity requirements as described in paragraph (7) of this section; and,

       (vii) You must comply with the applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements as described
in paragraph (8) of this section.

  (2) Finished Water Reservoirs

     (a) Is my system subject to the new finished water reservoir requirements? All surface water systems
and ground water systems under the direct influence of surface water which serve fewer than 10,000 people
are subject to this requirement.

     (b) What is required of new finished water reservoirs? If your system begins construction of a
finished water reservoir on or after March 15, 2002 the reservoir must be covered. Finished water reservoirs
for which your system began construction prior to March 15, 2002 are not subject to this requirement.

  (3) Additional Watershed Control Requirements for Unfiltered Systems

      (a) Is my system subject to the updated watershed control requirements? If you are a surface water
system or a ground water system under the direct influence of surface water serving fewer than 10,000
persons which does not provide filtration, you must continue to comply with all of the filtration avoidance
criteria in Section C, as well as the additional watershed control requirements in paragraph (3)(b) of this
section.

     (b) What updated watershed control requirements must my unfiltered system implement to continue
to avoid filtration? Your system must take any additional steps necessary to minimize the potential for
contamination by Cryptosporidium oocysts in the source water. Your system's watershed control program
must, for Cryptosporidium:

240 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (i) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source
water quality; and

       (ii) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.

     (c) How does the Department determine whether my system's watershed control requirements are
adequate? During an onsite inspection conducted under the provisions of Section C(2)(c), the Department
must determine whether your watershed control program is adequate to limit potential contamination by
Cryptosporidium oocysts. The adequacy of the program must be based on the comprehensiveness of the
watershed review; the effectiveness of your program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring
in the watershed; and the extent to which your system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled
land use within the watershed.

  (4) Disinfection Profile

     (a) What is a Disinfection Profile and who must develop one? A disinfection profile is a graphical
representation of your system's level of Giardia lamblia or virus inactivation measured during the course
of a year. If you are a surface water system or a ground water system under the direct influence of surface
water which serves fewer than 10,000 persons, your system must develop a disinfection profile unless the
Department determines that your system's profile is unnecessary. The Department may approve the use of
a more representative data set for disinfection profiling than the data set required under paragraph (4) (c)
through (f) of this section.

     (b) What criteria must the Department use to determine that a profile is unnecessary? The Department
may only determine that a system's profile is unnecessary if a system's TTHM and HAA5 levels are below
0.064 mg/L and 0.048 mg/L, respectively. To determine these levels, TTHM and HAA5 samples must be
collected after January 1, 1998, during the month with the warmest water temperature, and at the point of
maximum residence time in your distribution system. The Department may approve a more representative
TTHM and HAA5 data set to determine these levels

     (c) How does my system develop a Disinfection Profile and when must it begin? A disinfection
profile consists of three steps:

       (i) First, your system must collect data for several parameters from the plant as discussed in
paragraph (4)(d) of this section, over the course of twelve (12) months. If your system serves between 500
and 9,999 persons you must begin to collect data no later than July 1, 2003. If your system serves fewer
than 500 persons you must begin to collect data no later than January 1, 2004.

       (ii) Second, your system must use this data to calculate weekly log inactivation as discussed in
paragraphs (4)(e) and (f) of this section.

        (iii) Third, your system must use these weekly log inactivations to develop a disinfection profile as
specified in paragraph (4)(g) of this section.




241 | Regulation 61-58.10
     (d) What data must my system collect to calculate a Disinfection Profile? Your system must monitor
the following parameters to determine the total log inactivation using the analytical methods in Section F,
once per week on the same calendar day, over twelve (12) consecutive months:

       (i) The temperature of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling
point during peak hourly flow;

      (ii) If your system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant
concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow;

       (iii) The disinfectant contact time(s) ('T') during peak hourly flow; and

        (iv) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) ('C') of the water before or at the first customer and
prior to each additional point of disinfection during peak hourly flow.

     (e) How does my system use this data to calculate an inactivation ratio? Use the tables in R-
61.58.10.F(1)(c)(v) to determine the appropriate CT99.9 value. Calculate the total inactivation ratio as
follows, and multiply the value by 3.0 to determine log inactivation of Giardia lamblia:


  If your system * * *                      Your system must determine * * *

  (a) Uses only one point of              (1) One inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT99.9) before or at the first
      disinfectant application                customer during peak hourly flow
                                               or
                                          (2) Successive CTcalc/CT99.9 values, representing sequential
                                              inactivation ratios, between the point of disinfectant
                                              application and a point before or at the first customer during
                                              peak hourly flow. Under this alternative, your system must
                                              calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining
                                              (CTcalc/CT99.9) for each sequence and then adding the
                                              (CTcalc/CT99.9) values together to determine (ΣCTcalc/CT99.9).

  (b) Uses more than one point of         The (CTcalc/CT99.9) value of each disinfection segment
  disinfectant application before the        immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant application,
  first customer                             or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during
                                             peak hourly flow using the procedure specified in paragraph
                                             (a)(2) of this section.

     (f) What if my system uses chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection? If your
system uses chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection, you must also calculate the
logs of inactivation for viruses and develop an additional disinfection profile for viruses using methods
approved by the Department.

     (g) My system has developed an inactivation ratio; what must we do now? Each log inactivation
serves as a data point in your disinfection profile. Your system will have obtained fifty-two (52)
measurements (one (1) for every week of the year). This will allow your system and the Department the

242 | Regulation 61-58.10
opportunity to evaluate how microbial inactivation varied over the course of the year by looking at all fifty-
two (52) measurements (your Disinfection Profile). Your system must retain the Disinfection Profile data
in graphic form, such as a spreadsheet, which must be available for review by the Department as part of a
sanitary survey. Your system must use this data to calculate a benchmark if you are considering changes to
disinfection practices.

  (5) Disinfection Benchmark

     (a) Who has to develop a Disinfection Benchmark? If you are a surface water system or a ground
water system under the direct influence of surface water you are required to develop a disinfection profile
under paragraphs (4)(a) through (g) of this section. Your system must develop a Disinfection Benchmark
if you decide to make a significant change to your disinfection practice. Your system must consult with the
Department for approval before you can implement a significant disinfection practice change.

     (b) What are significant changes to disinfection practice? Significant changes to disinfection practice
include:

       (i)   Changes to the point of disinfection;

       (ii) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;

       (iii) Changes to the disinfection process; or

       (iv) Any other modification identified by the Department.

     (c) What must my system do if we are considering a significant change to disinfection practices? If
your system is considering a significant change to its disinfection practice, your system must calculate a
disinfection benchmark(s) as described in paragraphs (5)(c) and (d) of this section, and provide the
benchmark(s) to the Department. Your system may only make a significant disinfection practice change
after consulting with the Department for approval. Your system must submit the following information to
the Department as part of the consultation and approval process:

       (i)   A description of the proposed change;

      (ii) The disinfection profile for Giardia lamblia (and, if necessary, viruses) and disinfection
benchmark;

       (iii) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current levels of disinfection; and

       (iv) Any additional information requested by the Department.

      (d) How is the Disinfection Benchmark calculated? If your system is making a significant change to
its disinfection practice, it must calculate a disinfection benchmark using the procedure specified in the
following table.




243 | Regulation 61-58.10
  To calculate a disinfection benchmark your system must perform the following steps


  Step 1: Using the data your system collected to develop the Disinfection Profile, determine the average
         Giardia lamblia inactivation for each calendar month by dividing the sum of all Giardia lamblia
         inactivations for that month by the number of values calculated for that month.
  Step 2: Determine the lowest monthly average value out of the twelve (12) values. This value becomes
         the disinfection benchmark.


     (e) What if my system uses chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection? If your
system uses chloramines, ozone or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection your system must calculate the
disinfection benchmark from the data your system collected for viruses to develop the disinfection profile
in addition to the Giardia lamblia disinfection benchmark calculated under paragraph (5)(d) of this section.
This viral benchmark must be calculated in the same manner used to calculate the Giardia lamblia
disinfection benchmark in paragraph (5)(d) of this section.

  (6) Combined Filter Effluent Requirements

     (a) Is my system required to meet this regulation's combined filter effluent turbidity limits? All
surface water systems and ground water systems under the direct influence of surface water which serve
populations fewer than 10,000, and that utilize filtration other than slow sand filtration or diatomaceous
earth filtration, must meet the combined filter effluent turbidity requirements of paragraphs (6)(b) through
(d) of this section If your system uses slow sand or diatomaceous earth filtration you are not required to
meet the combined filter effluent turbidity limits of this regulation, but you must continue to meet the
combined filter effluent turbidity limits in Section E.

    (b) What strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits must my system meet? Your system
must meet two strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits.

        (i) The first combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a "95th percentile" turbidity limit that your
system must meet in at least ninety (95) percent of the turbidity measurements taken each month.
Measurements must continue to be taken as described in Section F(1) and (3). Monthly reporting must be
completed according to paragraph (8) of this section. The following table describes the required limits for
specific filtration technologies.


  If your system consists of * * *                                Your 95th percentile turbidity value is * * *


  (1) Conventional Filtration or Direct                           0.3 NTU
   Filtration......
                                                                  A value determined by the Department (not to
  (2) All other 'Alternative' Filtration.......................     exceed 1 NTU) based on the demonstration
                                                                    described in paragraph (6)(c)of this section.


244 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (ii) The second combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a "maximum" turbidity limit which your
system may at no time exceed during the month. Measurements must continue to be taken as described in
Sections F(1) and C. Monthly reporting must be completed according to paragraph (8) of this section. The
following table describes the required limits for specific filtration technologies.


  If your system consists of * * *                         Your maximum turbidity value is * * *


  (1) Conventional Filtration or Direct                    1 NTU
  Filtration…...
                                                           A value determined by the Department (not to
  (2) All other 'Alternative'                                exceed 5 NTU) based on the demonstration as
  Filtration.........................                        described in paragraph (6)(c) of this section.

     (c) My system consists of "alternative filtration'' and is required to conduct a demonstration--what is
required of my system and how does the Department establish my turbidity limits?

       (i) If your system consists of alternative filtration(filtration other than slow sand filtration,
diatomaceous earth filtration, conventional filtration, or direct filtration) you are required to conduct a
demonstration (see tables in paragraph (6)(b) of this section). Your system must demonstrate to the
Department, using pilot plant studies or other means, that your system's filtration, in combination with
disinfection treatment, consistently achieves:

              (A) 99 percent removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts;

              (B) 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts; and

              (C) 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses.

        (ii) [Reserved]

     (d) My system practices lime softening--is there any special provision regarding my combined filter
effluent? If your system practices lime softening, you may acidify representative combined filter effluent
turbidity samples prior to analysis using a protocol approved by the Department.

  (7) Individual Filter Turbidity Requirements

     (a) Is my system subject to individual filter turbidity requirements? If your system is a surface water
system or a ground water system under the direct influence of surface water serving fewer than 10,000
people and utilizing conventional filtration or direct filtration, you must conduct continuous monitoring of
turbidity for each individual filter at your system. The following requirements apply to continuous turbidity
monitoring:

         (C) The system does not conduct E. coli monitoring as described in R.61-58.10.K(2)(a)(iii).

          (D) Systems using a GWUDI source must comply with the requirements of R.61-
58.10.K(2)(a)(iv) based on the E. coli level that applies to the nearest surface water body. If no surface
water body is nearby, the system must comply based on the requirements that apply to systems using lake
or reservoir sources.

        (v) For filtered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people, the Department may approve monitoring
for an indicator other than E. coli under R.61- 58.10.K(2)(a)(iii). The Department also may approve an
alternative to the E. coli concentration in paragraph R.61-58.10.K(2)(a)(iv)(A), (B) or (D) to trigger
Cryptosporidium monitoring. This approval by the Department must be in writing and will include the basis
for the Department’s determination that the alternative indicator and/or trigger level will provide a more
accurate identification of whether a system will exceed the Bin 1 Cryptosporidium level in R.61-
58.10.K(11).

      (vi) Unfiltered systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must sample their source water for
Cryptosporidium at least twice per month for 12 months or at least monthly for 24 months.

       (vii) Systems may sample more frequently than required under this section if the sampling frequency
is evenly spaced throughout the monitoring period.

    (b) Second round of source water monitoring.

  Systems must conduct a second round of source water monitoring that meets the requirements for
monitoring parameters, frequency, and duration described in R.61-58.10.K(2)(a), unless they meet the
monitoring exemption criteria in R.61- 58.10.K(2)(d). Systems must conduct this monitoring on the
schedule in R.61- 58.10.K(2)(c).

    (c) Monitoring Schedule

  Systems must begin the monitoring required in R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) and (b) no later than the month
beginning with the date listed in R.61-58.10.K(2)(c)(i) through (v).




253 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (i) Systems that serve at least 100,000 people must begin the first round of source water
monitoring no later than the month beginning October 1, 2006, and must begin the second round of source
water monitoring no later than the month beginning April 1, 2015.

       (ii) Systems that serve from 50,000 to 99,999 people must begin the first round of source water
monitoring no later than the month beginning April 1, 2007, and must begin the second round of source
water monitoring no later than the month beginning October 1, 2015.

       (iii) Systems that serve from 10,000 to 49,999 people must begin the first round of source water
monitoring no later than the month beginning April 1, 2008, and must begin the second round of source
water monitoring no later than the month beginning October 1, 2016.

       (iv) Systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people and monitor for E. coli (applies only to filtered
systems) must begin the first round of source water monitoring no later than the month beginning October
1, 2008, and must begin the second round of source water monitoring no later than the month beginning
October 1, 2017.

         (v) Systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people and monitor for Cryptosporidium must begin the
first round of source water monitoring no later than the month beginning April 1, 2010, and must begin the
second round of source water monitoring no later than the month beginning April 1, 2019. (Applies to
filtered systems that meet the conditions of R.61-58.10.K(2)(a)(iv) and unfiltered systems).

     (d) Monitoring Avoidance.

        (i) Filtered systems are not required to conduct source water monitoring under R.61-58.10.K if
the system will provide a total of at least 5.5-log of treatment for Cryptosporidium, equivalent to meeting
the treatment requirements of Bin 4 in R.61-58.10.K(12).

       (ii) Unfiltered systems are not required to conduct source water monitoring under R.61-58.10.K if
the system will provide a total of at least 3-log Cryptosporidium inactivation, equivalent to meeting the
treatment requirements for unfiltered systems with a mean Cryptosporidium concentration of greater than
0.01 oocysts per L in R.61-58.10.K(13).

        (iii) If a system chooses to provide the level of treatment in R.61- 58.10.K(2)(d)(1) or (2), as
applicable, rather than start source water monitoring, the system must notify the Department in writing no
later than the date the system is otherwise required to submit a sampling schedule for monitoring under
R.61-58.10.K(3). Alternatively, a system may choose to stop sampling at any point after it has initiated
monitoring if it notifies the Department in writing that it will provide this level of treatment. Systems must
install and operate technologies to provide this level of treatment by the applicable treatment compliance
date in R.61-58.10.K(14).

     (e) Plants Operating Only Part of the Year.

Systems with subpart H plants that operate for only part of the year must conduct source water monitoring
in accordance with R.61-58.10.K with the following modifications:



254 | Regulation 61-58.10
       (i) Systems must sample their source water only during the months that the plant operates unless
the Department specifies another monitoring period based on plant operating practices.

      (ii) Systems with plants that operate less than six months per year and that monitor for
Cryptosporidium must collect at least six Cryptosporidium samples per year during each of two years of
monitoring. Samples must be evenly spaced throughout the period the plant operates.

    (f) New Sources.

       (i) A system that begins using a new source of surface water or ground water under the direct
influence of surface water after the system is required to begin monitoring under R.61-58.10.K(2)(c) must
monitor the new source on a schedule approved by the Department. Source water monitoring must meet
the requirements of R.61-58.10.K. The system must also meet the bin classification and Cryptosporidium
treatment requirements of R.61-58.10.K(11) and R.61- 58.10.K(12) or R.61-58.10.K(13), as applicable, for
the new source on a schedule approved by the Department.

      (ii) The requirements of R.61-58.10.K(2)(f) apply to subpart H systems that begin operation after
the monitoring start date applicable to the system's size under R.61-58.10.K(2)(c).

       (iii) The system must begin a second round of source water monitoring no later than 6 years
following initial bin classification under R.61-58.10.K(11) or determination of the mean Cryptosporidium
level under R.61-58.10.K(13), as applicable.

     (g) Failure to collect any source water sample required under R.61-58.10.K(2) in accordance with
the sampling schedule, sampling location, analytical method, approved laboratory, and reporting
requirements of R.61-58.10.K(3) through R.61-58.10.K(7) is a monitoring violation.

    (h) Grandfathering Monitoring Data.

  Systems may use (grandfather) monitoring data collected prior to the applicable monitoring start date in
R.61-58.10.K(2)(c) to meet the initial source water monitoring requirements in R.61-58.10.K(2)(a).
Grandfathered data may substitute for an equivalent number of months at the end of the monitoring period.
All data submitted under this paragraph must meet the requirements in R.61-58.10.K(8).

  (3) Sampling Schedules.

    (a) Systems required to conduct source water monitoring under R.61-58.10.K(2) must submit a
sampling schedule that specifies the calendar dates when the system will collect each required sample.

        (i) Systems must submit sampling schedules no later than 3 months prior to the applicable date
listed in R.61-58.10.K(2)(c) for each round of required monitoring.

       (ii) Electronic Submittal of Sample Schedules for Systems Serving at Least 10,000 People.

          (A) Systems serving at least 10,000 people must submit their sampling schedule for the initial
round of source water monitoring under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) to EPA electronically.


255 | Regulation 61-58.10
          (B) If a system is unable to submit the sampling schedule electronically, the system may use an
alternative approach for submitting the sampling schedule that EPA approves.

       (iii) Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must submit their sampling schedules for the initial
round of source water monitoring under R.61- 58.10.K(2)(a) to the Department.

       (iv) Systems must submit sampling schedules for the second round of source water monitoring
under R.61-58.10.K(2)(b) to the Department.

       (v) If EPA or the Department does not respond to a system regarding its sampling schedule, the
system must sample according to the submitted schedule.

    (b) Systems must collect samples within two days before or two days after the dates indicated in their
sampling schedule (i.e., within a five-day period around the schedule date) unless one of the conditions of
R.61-58.10.K(3)(b)(i) or (ii) applies.

       (i) If an extreme condition or situation exists that may pose danger to the sample collector, or that
cannot be avoided and causes the system to be unable to sample in the scheduled five-day period, the system
must sample as close to the scheduled date as is feasible unless the Department approves an alternative
sampling date. The system must submit an explanation for the delayed sampling date to the Department at
the same time the sample is shipped to the laboratory.

       (ii) Replacement Samples.

          (A) If a system is unable to report a valid analytical result for a scheduled sampling date due to
equipment failure, loss of or damage to the sample, failure to comply with the analytical method
requirements, including the quality control requirements in R.61-58.10.K(5), or the failure of an approved
laboratory to analyze the sample, then the system must collect a replacement sample.

          (B) The system must collect the replacement sample not later than 21 days after receiving
information that an analytical result cannot be reported for the scheduled date unless the system
demonstrates that collecting a replacement sample within this time frame is not feasible or the Department
approves an alternative resampling date. The system must submit an explanation for the delayed sampling
date to the Department at the same time the sample is shipped to the laboratory.

     (c) Systems that fail to meet the criteria of R.61-58.10.K(3)(b) for any source water sample required
under R.61-58.10.K(2) must revise their sampling schedules to add dates for collecting all missed samples.
Systems must submit the revised schedule to the Department for approval prior to when the system begins
collecting the missed samples.

  (4) Sampling Locations.

     (a) Systems required to conduct source water monitoring under R.61-58.K(2) must collect samples
for each plant that treats a surface water or a GWUDI source. Where multiple plants draw water from the
same influent, such as the same pipe or intake, the Department may approve one set of monitoring results
to be used to satisfy the requirements of R.61-58.10.K(2) for all plants.


256 | Regulation 61-58.10
     (b) Sampling Prior to Chemical Treatment.

       (i) Systems must collect source water samples prior to chemical treatment, such as coagulants,
oxidants and disinfectants, unless the system meets the condition of R.61-58.10.K(4)(b)(ii).

        (ii) The Department may approve a system to collect a source water sample after chemical
treatment if the Department determines that collecting a sample prior to chemical treatment is not feasible
for the system and that the chemical treatment is unlikely to have a significant adverse effect on the analysis
of the sample.

      (c) Systems that recycle filter backwash water must collect source water samples prior to the point
of filter backwash water addition.

     (d) Bank Filtration.

        (i) Systems that receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit for bank filtration under R.61-
58.10.H(4)(b) or R.61-58.10.I(6)(c), as applicable, must collect source water samples in the source water
prior to bank filtration.

       (ii) Systems that use bank filtration as pretreatment to a filtration plant must collect source water
samples from the well (i.e., after bank filtration). Use of bank filtration during monitoring must be consistent
with routine operational practice. Systems collecting samples after a bank filtration process may not receive
treatment credit for the bank filtration under R.61-58.10.K(18)(c).

     (e) Multiple Sources.

   Systems with plants that use multiple water sources, including multiple surface water sources and
blended surface water and ground water sources, must collect samples as specified in R.61-58.10.K(4)(e)(i)
or (ii). The use of multiple sources during monitoring must be consistent with routine operational practice.

        (i) If a sampling tap is available where the sources are combined prior to treatment, systems must
collect samples from the tap.

       (ii) If a sampling tap where the sources are combined prior to treatment is not available, systems
must collect samples at each source near the intake on the same day and must follow either R.61-
58.10.K(4)(e)(ii)(A) or (B) for sample analysis.

           (A) Systems may composite samples from each source into one sample prior to analysis. The
volume of sample from each source must be weighted according to the proportion of flow from each source
in the total plant flow at the time the sample is collected.

          (B) Systems may analyze samples from each source separately and calculate a weighted average
of the analysis results for each sampling date. The weighted average must be calculated by multiplying the
analysis result for each source by the fraction that each source contributed to total plant flow at the time the
sample was collected and then summing these values.

     (f) Additional Requirements.

257 | Regulation 61-58.10
   Systems must submit a description of their sampling location(s) to the Department at the same time as
the sampling schedule required under R.61- 58.10.K(3). This description must address the position of the
sampling location in relation to the system's water source(s) and treatment processes, including
pretreatment, points of chemical treatment, and filter backwash recycle. If the Department does not respond
to a system regarding sampling location(s), the system must sample at the submitted location(s).

  (5) Analytical Methods.

      (a) Cryptosporidium. Systems must analyze for Cryptosporidium using EPA- approved methods
listed in 40 CFR 141.704 (1-05-06 edition).

       (i) Systems must analyze at least a 10 L sample or a packed pellet volume of at least 2 mL. Systems
unable to process a 10 L sample must analyze as much sample volume as can be filtered by two filters
approved by EPA, up to a packed pellet volume of at least 2 mL.

      (ii) (A) Matrix spike (MS) samples, must be spiked and filtered by a laboratory approved for
Cryptosporidium analysis under R.61-58.10.K(6).

          (B) If the volume of the matrix spike sample is greater than 10 L, the system may filter all but
10 L of the matrix spike sample in the field, and ship the filtered sample and the remaining 10 L of source
water to the laboratory. In this case, the laboratory must spike the remaining 10 L of water and filter it
through the filter used to collect the balance of the sample in the field.

      (iii) Flow cytometer-counted spiking suspensions must be used for matrix spike samples and
ongoing precision and recovery (OPR) samples.

    (b) E. coli. Systems must use methods for enumeration of E. coli in source water approved in 40 CFR
136.3(a) (1-05-06 edition).

       (i) The time from sample collection to initiation of analysis may not exceed 30 hours unless the
system meets the condition of R.61-58.10.K(5)(b)(ii).

        (ii) The Department may approve on a case-by-case basis the holding of an
E. coli sample for up to 48 hours between sample collection and initiation of analysis if the Department
determines that analyzing an E. coli sample within 30 hours is not feasible. E. coli samples held between
30 to 48 hours must be analyzed by the Colilert reagent version of Standard Methods 9223B as listed in 40
CFR 136.3(a) (1-05-06 edition).

       (iii) Samples must be maintained between 0 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius during storage
and transit to the laboratory.

    (c) Turbidity. Systems must use methods for turbidity measurement approved in 40 CFR
141.74(a)(1) (1-05-06 edition).

  (6) Approved Laboratories


258 | Regulation 61-58.10
      (a) Cryptosporidium. Systems must have Cryptosporidium samples analyzed by a laboratory that is
approved under EPA's Laboratory Quality Assurance Evaluation Program for Analysis of Cryptosporidium
in Water or a laboratory that has been certified for Cryptosporidium analysis by the Department’s laboratory
certification program.

     (b) E. coli. E. coli analyses for compliance with R.61-58.10.K must be performed by a certified
laboratory.

     (c) Turbidity. Measurements of turbidity must be made by a party approved by the Department.

  (7) Reporting Source Water Monitoring Results.

      (a) Systems must report results from the source water monitoring required under R.61-58.10.K(2) no
later than 10 days after the end of the first month following the month when the sample is collected.

     (b) Electronic Reporting for Systems Serving at Least 10,000 People.

      (i) All systems serving at least 10,000 people must report the results from the initial source water
monitoring required under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) to EPA electronically.

        (ii) If a system serving at least 10,000 people is unable to report monitoring results electronically,
the system may use an alternative approach for reporting monitoring results that EPA approves.

    (c) Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must report results from the initial source water
monitoring required under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) to the Department.

    (d) All systems must report results from the second round of source water monitoring required under
R.61-58.10.K(2)(b) to the Department.

    (e) Systems must report the applicable information in R.61-58.10.K(7)(e)(i) and (ii) for the source
water monitoring required under R.61-58.10.K(2).

        (i) Systems must report the following data elements for Cryptosporidium analysis: PWS ID,
Facility ID, Sample collection date, Sample type (field or matrix spike), Sample volume filtered (to nearest
one quarter of a L), Whether or not 100 percent of the filtered volume was examined, and the Number of
oocysts counted.

        (A) For matrix spike samples, systems must also report the sample volume spiked and estimated
number of oocysts spiked. These data are not required for field samples.

         (B) For samples in which less than 10 L is filtered or less than 100 percent of the sample volume
is examined, systems must also report the number of filters used and the packed pellet volume.

         (C) For samples in which less than 100 percent of sample volume is examined, systems must
also report the volume of resuspended concentrate and volume of this resuspension processed through
immunomagnetic separation.


259 | Regulation 61-58.10
        (ii) Systems must report the following data elements for each E. coli analysis: PWS ID, Facility
ID, Sample collection date, Analytical method number, Method type, Source type (flowing stream, lake or
reservoir, GWUDI), E. coli per100 mL, and Turbidity. Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people that are
not required to monitor for turbidity under R.61-58.10.K(2) are not required to report turbidity with their
E. coli results.

  (8) Grandfathering Previously Collected Data.

     (a) Sample Requirements.

         (i) Systems may comply with the initial source water monitoring requirements of R.61-
58.10.K(2)(a) by grandfathering sample results collected before the system is required to begin monitoring
(i.e., previously collected data). To be grandfathered, the sample results and analysis must meet the criteria
in R.61-58.10.K(8) and be approved by the Department.

       (ii) A filtered system may grandfather Cryptosporidium samples to meet the requirements of R.61-
58.10.K(2)(a) when the system does not have corresponding E. coli and turbidity samples. A system that
grandfathers Cryptosporidium samples without E. coli and turbidity samples is not required to collect E.
coli and turbidity samples when the system completes the requirements for Cryptosporidium monitoring
under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a).

    (b) E. coli sample analysis. The analysis of E. coli samples must meet the analytical method and
approved laboratory requirements of R.61-58.10.K(5) and R.61-58.10.K(6).

   (c) Cryptosporidium sample analysis. Cryptosporidium samples must be analyzed as outlined in 40
CFR 141.707(c) (1-05-06 edition).

     (d) Sampling Location. The sampling location must meet the conditions in R.61- 58.10.K(4).

     (e) Sampling Frequency.

  Cryptosporidium samples must have been collected no less frequently than each calendar month on a
regular schedule, beginning no earlier than January 1999. Sample collection intervals may vary for the
conditions specified in R.61- 58.10.K(3)(b)(i) and (ii) if the system provides documentation of the condition
when reporting monitoring results.

       (i) The Department may approve grandfathering of previously collected data where there are time
gaps in the sampling frequency if the system conducts Department-specified additional monitoring to
ensure that the data used to comply with R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) are seasonally representative and unbiased.

        (ii) Systems may grandfather previously collected data where the sampling frequency within each
month varied. If the Cryptosporidium sampling frequency varied, systems must follow the monthly
averaging procedure in R.61- 58.10.K(11)(b)(v) or R.61-58.10.K(13)(a)(iii), as applicable, when
calculating the bin classification for filtered systems or the mean Cryptosporidium concentration for
unfiltered systems.

     (f) Reporting Monitoring Results for Grandfathering.

260 | Regulation 61-58.10
   Systems that request to grandfather previously collected monitoring results must report the following
information specified in R.61-58.10.K(8)(f)(i) and (ii) by the applicable dates listed. Systems serving at
least 10,000 people must report this information to EPA unless the Department approves reporting directly
to the Department rather than EPA. Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must report this information
to the Department.

        (i) Systems must report that they intend to submit previously collected monitoring results for
grandfathering. This report must specify the number of previously collected results the system will submit,
the dates of the first and last sample, and whether a system will conduct additional source water monitoring
to meet the requirements of R.61-58.10.K(2)(a). Systems must report this information no later than the date
the sampling schedule found in R.61- 58.10.K(3) is required.

       (ii) Systems must report previously collected monitoring results for grandfathering, along with the
associated documentation listed in R.61- 58.10.K(8)(f)(ii)(A) through (D) , no later than two months after
the applicable date listed in R.61-58.10.K(2)(c).

          (A) For each sample result, systems must report the applicable data elements in R.61-58.10.K(7).

          (B) Systems must certify that the reported monitoring results include all results that the system
generated during the time period beginning with the first reported result and ending with the final reported
result. This applies to samples that were collected from the sampling location specified for source water
monitoring, not spiked, and analyzed using the laboratory's routine process for the analytical methods.

          (C) Systems must certify that the samples were representative of a plant's source water(s) and
the source water(s) have not changed. Systems must report a description of the sampling location(s), which
must address the position of the sampling location in relation to the system's water source(s) and treatment
processes, including points of chemical addition and filter backwash recycle.

          (D) For Cryptosporidium samples, the laboratory or laboratories that analyzed the samples must
provide a letter certifying that the quality control criteria specified in the methods listed in 40 CFR 141.707
(1-05- 06 edition) were met for each sample batch associated with the reported results. Alternatively, the
laboratory may provide bench sheets and sample examination report forms for each field, matrix spike,
IPR, OPR, and method blank sample associated with the reported results.

     (g) If the Department determines that a previously collected data set submitted for grandfathering
was generated during source water conditions that were not normal for the system, such as a drought, the
Department may disapprove the data. Alternatively, the Department may approve the previously collected
data if the system reports additional source water monitoring data, as determined by the Department, to
ensure that the data set used under R.61-58.10.K(11) or R.61-58.10.K(13) represents average source water
conditions for the system.

      (h) If a system submits previously collected data that fully meet the number of samples required for
initial source water monitoring under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) and some of the data are rejected due to not
meeting the requirements of R.61-58.10.K(8), systems must conduct additional monitoring to replace
rejected data on a schedule the Department approves. Systems are not required to begin this additional


261 | Regulation 61-58.10
monitoring until two months after notification that data have been rejected and additional monitoring is
necessary.

  (9) Requirements When Making a Significant Change in Disinfection Practice.

     (a) Following the completion of initial source water monitoring under R.61- 58.10.K(2)(a), a system
that plans to make a significant change to its disinfection practice, as defined in R.61-58.10.K(9)(b), must
develop a disinfection profile and calculate a disinfection benchmark for Giardia lamblia and viruses as
described in R.61- 58.10.K(10). Prior to changing the disinfection practice, the system must notify the
Department and must include in this notice the information listed in R.61- 58.10.K(9)(a)(i) through (iii).

       (i) A completed disinfection profile and disinfection benchmark for Giardia lamblia and viruses
as described in R.61-58.10.K(10).

       (ii) A description of the proposed change in disinfection practice.

       (iii) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current level of disinfection.

    (b) Significant changes to disinfection practice are defined as follows:

       (i)   Changes to the point of disinfection;

       (ii) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;

       (iii) Changes to the disinfection process; or

       (iv) Any other modification identified by the Department as a significant change to disinfection
practice.

  (10) Developing the Disinfection Profile and Benchmark.

     (a) Systems required to develop disinfection profiles under R.61-58.10.K(9) must follow the
requirements of R.61-58.10.K(10). Systems must monitor at least weekly for a period of 12 consecutive
months to determine the total log inactivation for Giardia lamblia and viruses. If systems monitor more
frequently, the monitoring frequency must be evenly spaced. Systems that operate for fewer than 12 months
per year must monitor weekly during the period of operation. Systems must determine log inactivation for
Giardia lamblia through the entire plant, based on CT99.9 values in Tables 1.1 through 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1 of
R.61-58.10.F as applicable. Systems must determine log inactivation for viruses through the entire
treatment plant based on a protocol approved by the Department.

     (b) Systems with a single point of disinfectant application prior to the entrance to the distribution
system must conduct the monitoring in R.61-58.10(K)(10)(b)(i) through (iv). Systems with more than one

       (i) For systems using a disinfectant other than UV, the temperature of the disinfected water must
be measured at each residual concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow or at an alternative
location approved by the Department.

       (ii) For systems using chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water must be measured at each chlorine
residual sampling point during peak hourly flow or at an alternative location approved by the Department.

       (iii) The disinfectant contact time(s) (t) must be determined during peak hourly flow.

        (iv) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (C) of the water before or at the first customer and
prior to each additional point of disinfectant application must be measured during peak hourly flow.

     (c) In lieu of conducting new monitoring under R.61-58.10(K)(10)(b), systems may elect to meet the
requirements of R.61-58.10(K)(10)(c)(i) or (ii).

        (i) Systems that have at least one year of existing data that are substantially equivalent to data
collected under the provisions of R.61-58.10(K)(10)(b) may use these data to develop disinfection profiles
if the system has neither made a significant change to its treatment practice nor changed sources since the
data were collected. Systems may develop disinfection profiles using up to three years of existing data.

       (ii) Systems may use disinfection profile(s) developed under R.61-58.10.H or R.61-58.10.I in lieu
of developing a new profile if the system has neither made a significant change to its treatment practice nor
changed sources since the profile was developed. Systems that have not developed a virus profile under
R.61-58.10.H or R.61-58.10.I must develop a virus profile using the same monitoring data on which the
Giardia lamblia profile is based.

    (d) Systems must calculate the total inactivation ratio for Giardia lamblia as specified in R.61-
58.10(K)(10)(d)(i) through (iii).

hourly flow.

         (B) Determine successive CTcalc/CT99.9 values, representing sequential inactivation ratios,
between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourly
flow. The system must calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining (CTcalc/CT 99.9) for each
sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/CT99.9) values together to determine the sum of CTcalc/CT99.9.

       (ii) Systems using more than one point of disinfectant application before the first customer must
determine the CT value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant
application, or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during peak hourly flow. The
(CTcalc/CT99.9) value of each segment and the sum of CTcalc/CT99.9 must be calculated using the method
in R.61-58.10.K(10)(d)(i)(B).


263 | Regulation 61-58.10
      (iii) The system must determine the total logs of inactivation by multiplying the value calculated in

year of profiling data by dividing the sum of daily or weekly Giardia lamblia and virus log inactivation by
the number of values calculated for that month.

        (ii) The disinfection benchmark is the lowest monthly mean value (for systems with one year of
profiling data) or the mean of the lowest monthly mean values (for systems with more than one year of
profiling data) of Giardia lamblia and virus log inactivation in each year of profiling data.

  (11) Bin Classification for Filtered Systems.

     (a) Following completion of the initial round of source water monitoring required under R.61-
58.10.K(2)(a), filtered systems must calculate an initial Cryptosporidium bin concentration for each plant

year (i.e., collect 24 samples in 12 months), the bin concentration is equal to the arithmetic mean of all
sample concentrations.

       (iv) For systems with plants operating only part of the year that monitor fewer than 12 months per
year under R.61-58.10.K(2)(e), the bin concentration is equal to the highest arithmetic mean of all sample
concentrations during any year of Cryptosporidium monitoring.

      (v) If the monthly Cryptosporidium sampling frequency varies, systems must first calculate a
monthly average for each month of monitoring. Systems must then use these monthly average

264 | Regulation 61-58.10
concentrations, rather than individual sample concentrations, in the applicable calculation for bin
classification in R.61- 58.10.K(11)(b)(i) through (iv).

     (c) Filtered systems that are required to monitor under R.61-58.10.K(2) must determine their initial
bin classification from the Bin Classification Table that follows and using the Cryptosporidium bin
concentration calculated under R.61-58.10.K(11)(a) and (b). The bin classification for filtered systems that
serve fewer than 10,000 people and are not required to monitor under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a)(iv)is Bin 1.

include the elements in R.61-58.10.K(17)(a)(ii)(A) through (D).

           (A) Identification of an “area of influence” outside of which the likelihood of Cryptosporidium
or fecal contamination affecting the treatment plant intake is not significant. This is the area to be evaluated
in future watershed surveys under R.61-58.10.K(17)(a)(v)(B).

         (B) Identification of both potential and actual sources of Cryptosporidium contamination and an
assessment of the relative impact of these sources on the system's source water quality.


271 | Regulation 61-58.10
         (C) An analysis of the effectiveness and feasibility of control measures that could reduce
Cryptosporidium loading from sources of contamination to the system's source water.

          (D) A statement of goals and specific actions the system will undertake to reduce source water
Cryptosporidium levels. The plan must explain how the actions are expected to contribute to specific goals,
identify watershed partners and their roles, identify resource requirements and commitments, and include
a schedule for plan implementation with deadlines for completing specific actions identified in the plan.

       (iii) Systems with existing watershed control programs (i.e., programs in place on January 5, 2006)
are eligible to seek this credit. Their watershed control plans must meet the criteria in R.61-
58.10.K(17)(a)(ii) and must specify ongoing and future actions that will reduce source water
Cryptosporidium levels.

       (iv) If the Department does not respond to a system regarding approval of a watershed control plan
submitted under R.61-58.10.K(17) and the system meets the other requirements of R.61-58.10.K(17), the
watershed control program will be considered approved and 0.5 log Cryptosporidium treatment credit will
be awarded unless and until the Department subsequently withdraws such approval.

       (v) Systems must complete the actions in R.61-58.10.K(17)(a)(v)(A) through (C) to maintain the
0.5-log credit.

           (A) Submit an annual watershed control program status report to the Department. The annual
watershed control program status report must describe the system's implementation of the approved plan
and assess the adequacy of the plan to meet its goals. It must explain how the system is addressing any
shortcomings in plan implementation, including those previously identified by the Department or as the
result of the watershed survey conducted under R.61-58.10.K(17)(a)(v)(B). The report must also describe
any significant changes that have occurred in the watershed since the last watershed sanitary survey. If a
system determines during implementation that making a significant change to its approved watershed
control program is necessary, the system must notify the Department prior to making any such changes. If
any change is likely to reduce the level of source water protection, the system must also list in its notification
the actions the system will take to mitigate this effect.

          (B) Undergo a watershed sanitary survey every three years for community water systems and
every five years for non-community water systems and submit the survey report to the Department. The
survey must be conducted according to Department guidelines and by persons approved by the Department.

             (1) The watershed sanitary survey must meet the following criteria: encompass the region
identified in the Department- approved watershed control plan as the area of influence; assess the
implementation of actions to reduce source water Cryptosporidium levels; and identify any significant new
sources of Cryptosporidium.

             (2) If the Department determines that significant changes may have occurred in the watershed
since the previous watershed sanitary survey, systems must undergo another watershed sanitary survey by
a date the Department requires, which may be earlier than the regular date in R.61- 58.10.K(17)(a)(v)(B).

          (C) The system must make the watershed control plan, annual status reports, and watershed
sanitary survey reports available to the public upon request. These documents must be in a plain language

272 | Regulation 61-58.10
style and include criteria by which to evaluate the success of the program in achieving plan goals. The
Department may approve systems to withhold from the public portions of the annual status report,
watershed control plan, and watershed sanitary survey based on water supply security considerations.

        (vi) If the Department determines that a system is not carrying out the approved watershed control
plan, the Department may withdraw the watershed control program treatment credit.

     (b) Alternative Source.

        (i) A system may conduct source water monitoring that reflects a different intake location (either
in the same source or for an alternate source) or a different procedure for the timing or level of withdrawal
from the source (alternative source monitoring). If the Department approves, a system may determine its
bin classification under R.61-58.10.K(11) based on the alternative source monitoring results.

       (ii) If systems conduct alternative source monitoring under R.61- 58.10.K(17)(b)(i), systems must
also monitor their current plant intake concurrently as described in R.61-58.10.K(2).

       (iii) Alternative source monitoring under R.61-58.10.K(17)(b)(i) must meet the requirements for
source monitoring to determine bin classification, as described in R.61-58.10.K(2) through (7). Systems
must report the alternative source monitoring results to the Department, along with supporting information
documenting the operating conditions under which the samples were collected.

       (iv) If a system determines its bin classification under R.61-58.10.K(11) using alternative source
monitoring results that reflect a different intake location or a different procedure for managing the timing
or level of withdrawal from the source, the system must relocate the intake or permanently adopt the
withdrawal procedure, as applicable, no later than the applicable treatment compliance date in R.61-
58.10.K(14).

  (18) Pre-filtration Treatment Toolbox Components.

     (a) Presedimentation.

  Systems receive 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit for a presedimentation basin during any month
the process meets the criteria in R.61-58.10.K(18)(a).

       (i) The presedimentation basin must be in continuous operation and must treat the entire plant
flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source.

          (ii) The system must continuously add a coagulant to the presedimentation basin.

          (iii) The presedimentation basin must achieve the performance criteria in R.61-58.10.K(18)(iii)(A)
or (B).

          (A) The system must demonstrate at least 0.5-log mean reduction of influent turbidity. This
reduction must be determined using daily turbidity measurements in the presedimentation process influent
and effluent and must be calculated as follows: log10(monthly mean of daily influent turbidity)-
log10(monthly mean of daily effluent turbidity).

273 | Regulation 61-58.10
           (B) The system must comply with Department-approved performance criteria that demonstrate
at least 0.5-log mean removal of micron-sized particulate material through the presedimentation process.

     (b) Two-stage Lime Softening.

   Systems receive an additional 0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit for a two-stage lime softening
plant if chemical addition and hardness precipitation occur in two separate and sequential softening stages
prior to filtration. Both softening stages must treat the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or
GWUDI source.

     (c) Bank Filtration.

   Systems receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit for bank filtration that serves as pretreatment to a
filtration plant by meeting the criteria in R.61- 58.10.K(18)(c). Systems using bank filtration when they
begin source water monitoring under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a) must collect samples as described in R.61-
58.10.K(4)(d) and are not eligible for this credit.

       (i) Wells with a ground water flow path of at least 25 feet receive 0.5-log treatment credit; wells
with a ground water flow path of at least 50 feet receive 1.0-log treatment credit. The ground water flow
path must be determined as specified in R.61-58.10.K(18)(c)(iv).

        (ii) Only wells in granular aquifers are eligible for treatment credit. Granular aquifers are those
comprised of sand, clay, silt, rock fragments, pebbles or larger particles, and minor cement. A system must
characterize the aquifer at the well site to determine aquifer properties. Systems must extract a core from
the aquifer and demonstrate that in at least 90 percent of the core length, grains less than 1.0 mm in diameter
constitute at least 10 percent of the core material.

       (iii) Only horizontal and vertical wells are eligible for treatment credit.

        (iv) For vertical wells, the ground water flow path is the measured distance from the edge of the
surface water body under high flow conditions (determined by the 100 year floodplain elevation boundary
or by the floodway, as defined in Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps) to the well
screen. For horizontal wells, the ground water flow path is the measured distance from the bed of the river
under normal flow conditions to the closest horizontal well lateral screen.

         (v) Systems must monitor each wellhead for turbidity at least once every four hours while the bank
filtration process is in operation. If monthly average turbidity levels, based on daily maximum values in the
well, exceed 1 NTU, the system must report this result to the Department and conduct an assessment within
30 days to determine the cause of the high turbidity levels in the well. If the Department determines that
microbial removal has been compromised, the Department may revoke treatment credit until the system
implements corrective actions approved by the Department to remediate the problem.

        (vi) Springs and infiltration galleries are not eligible for treatment credit under R.61-58.10.K(18),
but are eligible for credit under R.61-58.10.K(19)(c).

       (vii) Bank Filtration Demonstration of Performance.

274 | Regulation 61-58.10
  The Department may approve Cryptosporidium treatment credit for bank filtration based on a
demonstration of performance study that meets the criteria in this paragraph. This treatment credit may be
greater than 1.0- log and may be awarded to bank filtration that does not meet the criteria in R.61-
58.10.K(18)(c)(i) through (v).

          (A) The study must follow a Department-approved protocol and must involve the collection of
data on the removal of Cryptosporidium or a surrogate for Cryptosporidium and related hydrogeologic and
water quality parameters during the full range of operating conditions.

          (B) The study must include sampling both from the production well(s) and from monitoring
wells that are screened and located along the shortest flow path between the surface water source and the
production well(s).

  (19) Treatment Performance Toolbox Components.

     (a) Combined Filter Performance.

  Systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration treatment may receive an additional
0.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit during any month the system meets the criteria in this paragraph.
Combined filter effluent (CFE) turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.15 NTU in at least 95 percent of
the measurements. Turbidity must be measured as described in 40 CFR 141.74(a) and (c) (1-05-06 edition).

     (b) Individual Filter Performance.

  Systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration treatment may receive 0.5-log
Cryptosporidium treatment credit, which can be in addition to the 0.5-log credit under R.61-58.10.K(19)(a),
during any month the system meets the criteria in this paragraph (b). Compliance with these criteria must
be based on individual filter turbidity monitoring as described in R.61-58.10.H(5) or R.61- 58.10.I(7), as
applicable.

         (i) The filtered water turbidity for each individual filter must be less than or equal to 0.15 NTU in
at least 95 percent of the measurements recorded each month.

      (ii) No individual filter may have a measured turbidity greater than 0.3 NTU in two consecutive
measurements taken 15 minutes apart.

        (iii) Any system that has received treatment credit for individual filter performance and fails to meet
the requirements of R.61-58.10.K(19)(b)(i) or (ii) during any month does not receive a treatment technique
violation under R.61- 58.10.K(12)(c) if the Department determines the following:

         (A) The failure was due to unusual and short-term circumstances that could not reasonably be
prevented through optimizing treatment plant design, operation, and maintenance.

          (B) The system has experienced no more than two such failures in any calendar year.

     (c) Demonstration of Performance.

275 | Regulation 61-58.10
  The Department may approve Cryptosporidium treatment credit for drinking water treatment processes
based on a demonstration of performance study that meets the criteria in this paragraph (c). This treatment
credit may be greater than or less than the prescribed treatment credits in R.61-58.10.K(12) or R.61-
58.10.K(18) through (21) and may be awarded to treatment processes that do not meet the criteria for the
prescribed credits.

       (i) Systems cannot receive the prescribed treatment credit for any toolbox box option in R.61-
58.10.K(18) through R.61-58.10.K(21) if that toolbox option is included in a demonstration of performance
study for which treatment credit is awarded under this paragraph.

       (ii) The demonstration of performance study must follow a Department- approved protocol and
must demonstrate the level of Cryptosporidium reduction the treatment process will achieve under the full
range of expected operating conditions for the system.

       (iii) Approval by the Department must be in writing and may include monitoring and treatment
performance criteria that the system must demonstrate and report on an ongoing basis to remain eligible for
the treatment credit. The Department may designate such criteria where necessary to verify that the
conditions under which the demonstration of performance credit was approved are maintained during
routine operation.

  (20) Additional Filtration Toolbox Components.

     (a) Bag and Cartridge Filters.

   With Department approval, systems may receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit of up to 2.0-log for
individual bag or cartridge filters and up to 2.5-log for bag or cartridge filters operated in series by meeting
the criteria in R.61-58.10.K(20)(a)(i) through (x). To be eligible for this credit, systems must report the
results of challenge testing that meets the requirements of R.61-58.10.K(20)(a)(ii) through (ix) to the
Department. The filters must treat the entire plant flow taken from a subpart H source.

        (i) The Cryptosporidium treatment credit awarded to bag or cartridge filters must be based on the
removal efficiency demonstrated during challenge testing that is conducted according to the criteria in R.61-
58.10.K(20)(a)(ii) through (ix). A factor of safety equal to 1-log for individual bag or cartridge filters and
0.5- log for bag or cartridge filters in series must be applied to challenge testing results to determine removal
credit. Systems may use results from challenge testing conducted prior to January 5, 2006 if the prior testing
was consistent with the criteria specified in R.61-58.10.K(20)(a)(ii) through (ix).

        (ii) Challenge testing must be performed on full-scale bag or cartridge filters, and the associated
filter housing or pressure vessel, that are identical in material and construction to the filters and housings
the system will use for removal of Cryptosporidium. Bag or cartridge filters must be challenge tested in the
same configuration that the system will use, either as individual filters or as a series configuration of filters.

        (iii) Challenge testing must be conducted using Cryptosporidium or a surrogate that is removed no
more efficiently than Cryptosporidium. The microorganism or surrogate used during challenge testing is
referred to as the challenge particulate. The concentration of the challenge particulate must be determined


276 | Regulation 61-58.10
using a method capable of discreetly quantifying the specific microorganism or surrogate used in the test;
gross measurements such as turbidity may not be used.

       (iv) The maximum feed water concentration that can be used during a challenge test must be based
on the detection limit of the challenge particulate in the filtrate (i.e., filtrate detection limit) and must be
calculated using the following equation:

       Maximum Feed Concentration = 10,000 x (Filtrate Detection Limit)

       (v) Challenge testing must be conducted at the maximum design flow rate for the filter as specified
by the manufacturer.

       (vi) Each filter evaluated must be tested for a duration sufficient to reach 100 percent of the terminal
pressure drop. This maximum pressure drop is the pressure drop under which the filter may be used to
comply with the requirements of R.61-58.10(K).

       (vii) Removal efficiency of a filter must be determined from the results of the challenge test and
expressed in terms of log removal values using the following equation:

       LRV = LOG10(Cf)-LOG10(Cp)

Where: LRV = log removal value demonstrated during challenge testing; Cf = the feed concentration
measured during the challenge test; and Cp = the filtrate concentration measured during the challenge
test. In applying this equation, the same units must be used for the feed and filtrate concentrations. If the
challenge particulate is not detected in the filtrate, then the term Cp must be set equal to the detection
limit.

         (viii) Each filter tested must be challenged with the challenge particulate during three periods over
the filtration cycle: within two hours of start-up of a new filter; when the pressure drop is between 45 and
55 percent of the terminal pressure drop; and at the end of the cycle after the pressure drop has reached 100
percent of the terminal pressure drop. A log removal value must be calculated for each of these challenge
periods for each filter tested. The log removal value for the filter must be assigned the value of the minimum
log removal value observed during the three challenge periods for that filter.

         (ix) If fewer than 20 filters are tested, the overall removal efficiency for the filter product line must
be set equal to the lowest filter log removal value among the filters tested. If 20 or more filters are tested,
the overall removal efficiency for the filter product line must be set equal to the 10th percentile of the set
of filter log removal values for the various filters tested. The percentile is defined by (i/(n+1)) where i is
the rank of n individual data points ordered lowest to highest. If necessary, the 10th percentile may be
calculated using linear interpolation.

         (x) If a previously tested filter is modified in a manner that could change the removal efficiency of
the filter product line, challenge testing to demonstrate the removal efficiency of the modified filter must
be conducted and submitted to the Department.

     (b) Membrane Filtration.


277 | Regulation 61-58.10
        (i) Systems may receive Cryptosporidium treatment credit for membrane filtration that meets the
criteria of this paragraph (b). Membrane cartridge filters that meet the definition of membrane filtration in
R.61-58.B are eligible for this credit. The level of treatment credit a system receives is equal to the lower
of the values determined under R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(i)(A) and (B).

         (A) The removal efficiency demonstrated during challenge testing conducted under the
conditions in R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(ii).

          (B) The maximum removal efficiency that can be verified through direct integrity testing used
with the membrane filtration process under the conditions in R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(iii).

       (ii) Challenge Testing. The membrane used by the system must undergo challenge testing to
evaluate removal efficiency, and the system must report the results of challenge testing to the Department.
Challenge testing must be conducted according to the criteria in R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(ii)(A) through (G).
Systems may use data from challenge testing conducted prior to January 5, 2006 if the prior testing was
consistent with the criteria in R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(ii)(A) through (G).

          (A) Challenge testing must be conducted on either a full-scale membrane module, identical in
material and construction to the membrane modules used in the system's treatment facility, or a smaller-
scale membrane module, identical in material and similar in construction to the full-scale module. A module
is defined as the smallest component of a membrane unit in which a specific membrane surface area is
housed in a device with a filtrate outlet structure.

          (B) Challenge testing must be conducted using Cryptosporidium oocysts or a surrogate that is
removed no more efficiently than Cryptosporidium oocysts. The organism or surrogate used during
challenge testing is referred to as the challenge particulate. The concentration of the challenge particulate,
in both the feed and filtrate water, must be determined using a method capable of discretely quantifying the
specific challenge particulate used in the test; gross measurements such as turbidity may not be used.

          (C) The maximum feed water concentration that can be used during a challenge test is based on
the detection limit of the challenge particulate in the filtrate and must be determined according to the
following equation:

          Maximum Feed Concentration = 3,160,000 x (Filtrate Detection Limit)

           (D) Challenge testing must be conducted under representative hydraulic conditions at the
maximum design flux and maximum design process recovery specified by the manufacturer for the
membrane module. Flux is defined as the throughput of a pressure driven membrane process expressed as
flow per unit of membrane area. Recovery is defined as the volumetric percent of feed water that is
converted to filtrate over the course of an operating cycle uninterrupted by events such as chemical cleaning
or a solids removal process (i.e., backwashing).

         (E) Removal efficiency of a membrane module must be calculated from the challenge test results
and expressed as a log removal value according to the following equation:

          LRV = LOG10(Cf) - LOG10(Cp)


278 | Regulation 61-58.10
Where: LRV = log removal value demonstrated during the challenge test; Cf = the feed concentration
measured during the challenge test; and Cp = the filtrate concentration measured during the challenge test.
Equivalent units must be used for the feed and filtrate concentrations. If the challenge particulate is not
detected in the filtrate, the term Cp is set equal to the detection limit for the purpose of calculating the log
removal value. A log removal value must be calculated for each membrane module evaluated during the
challenge test.

           (F) The removal efficiency of a membrane filtration process demonstrated during challenge
testing must be expressed as a log removal value. If fewer than 20 modules are tested, then the challenge
test log removal value is equal to the lowest of the representative log removal values among the modules
tested. If 20 or more modules are tested, then the challenge test log removal value is equal to the 10th
percentile of the representative log removal values among the modules tested. The percentile is defined by
(i/(n+1)) where i is the rank of n individual data points ordered lowest to highest. If necessary, the 10th
percentile may be calculated using linear interpolation.

          (G) The challenge test must establish a quality control release value for a non-destructive
performance test that demonstrates the Cryptosporidium removal capability of the membrane filtration
module. This performance test must be applied to each production membrane module used by the system
that was not directly challenge tested in order to verify Cryptosporidium removal capability. Production
modules that do not meet the established quality control release value are not eligible for the treatment
credit demonstrated during the challenge test.

          (H) If a previously tested membrane is modified in a manner that could change the removal
efficiency of the membrane or the applicability of the non-destructive performance test and associated
quality control release value, additional challenge testing to demonstrate a new removal efficiency and
quality control release value must be conducted and submitted to the Department.

         (iii) Direct integrity testing. Systems must conduct direct integrity testing in a manner that
demonstrates a removal efficiency equal to or greater than the removal credit awarded to the membrane
filtration process and meets the requirements described in R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(iii)(A) through (F). A direct
integrity test is defined as a physical test applied to a membrane unit in order to identify and isolate integrity
breaches (i.e., one or more leaks that could result in contamination of the filtrate).

           (A) The direct integrity test must be independently applied to each membrane unit in service. A
membrane unit is defined as a group of membrane modules that share common valving that allows the unit
to be isolated from the rest of the system for the purpose of integrity testing or other maintenance.

          (B) The direct integrity method must have a resolution of 3 micrometers or less, where resolution
is defined as the size of the smallest integrity breach that contributes to a response from the direct integrity
test.

           (C) The direct integrity test must have a sensitivity sufficient to verify the log treatment credit
awarded to the membrane filtration process by the Department, where sensitivity is defined as the maximum
log removal value that can be reliably verified by a direct integrity test. Sensitivity must be determined
using the approach in either R.61- 58.10.K(20)(b)(iii)(C)(1) or (2) as applicable to the type of direct
integrity test the system uses.


279 | Regulation 61-58.10
             (1) For direct integrity tests that use an applied pressure or vacuum, the direct integrity test
sensitivity must be calculated according to the following equation:

             LRVDIT = LOG10 (Qp /(VCF x Qbreach))

            Where:LRVDIT = the sensitivity of the direct integrity test; Qp = total design filtrate flow from
the membrane unit; Qbreach = flow of water from an integrity breach associated with the smallest integrity
test response that can be reliably measured, and VCF = volumetric concentration factor. The volumetric
concentration factor is the ratio of the suspended solids concentration on the high pressure side of the
membrane relative to that in the feed water.

             (2) For direct integrity tests that use a particulate or molecular marker, the direct integrity test
sensitivity must be calculated according to the following equation:

             LRVDIT = LOG10(Cf)-LOG10(Cp)

            Where:LRVDIT = the sensitivity of the direct integrity test; Cf = the typical feed concentration
of the marker used in the test; and Cp = the filtrate concentration of the marker from an integral membrane
unit.

          (D) Systems must establish a control limit within the sensitivity limits of the direct integrity test
that is indicative of an integral membrane unit capable of meeting the removal credit awarded by the
Department.

           (E) If the result of a direct integrity test exceeds the control limit established under R.61-
58.10.K(20)(b)(iii)(D), the system must remove the membrane unit from service. Systems must conduct a
direct integrity test to verify any repairs, and may return the membrane unit to service only if the direct
integrity test is within the established control limit.

          (F) Systems must conduct direct integrity testing on each membrane unit at a frequency of not
less than once each day that the membrane unit is in operation. The Department may approve less frequent
testing, based on demonstrated process reliability, the use of multiple barriers effective for
Cryptosporidium, or reliable process safeguards.

        (iv) Indirect integrity monitoring. Systems must conduct continuous indirect integrity monitoring
on each membrane unit according to the criteria in R.61- 58.10.K(20)(b)(iv)(A) through (E). Indirect
integrity monitoring is defined as monitoring some aspect of filtrate water quality that is indicative of the
removal of particulate matter. A system that implements continuous direct integrity testing of membrane
units in accordance with the criteria in R.61- 58.10.K(20)(b)(iii)(A) through (E) is not subject to the
requirements for continuous indirect integrity monitoring. Systems must submit a monthly report to the
Department summarizing all continuous indirect integrity monitoring results triggering direct integrity
testing and the corrective action that was taken in each case.

         (A) Unless the Department approves an alternative parameter, continuous indirect integrity
monitoring must include continuous filtrate turbidity monitoring.



280 | Regulation 61-58.10
           (B) Continuous monitoring must be conducted at a frequency of no less than once every 15
minutes.

           (C) Continuous monitoring must be separately conducted on each membrane unit.

         (D) If indirect integrity monitoring includes turbidity and if the filtrate turbidity readings are
above 0.15 NTU for a period greater than 15 minutes (i.e., two consecutive 15-minute readings above 0.15
NTU), direct integrity testing must immediately be performed on the associated membrane unit as specified
in R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(iii)(A) through (E).

           (E) If indirect integrity monitoring includes a Department-approved alternative parameter and if
the alternative parameter exceeds a Department-approved control limit for a period greater than 15 minutes,
direct integrity testing must immediately be performed on the associated membrane units as specified in
R.61-58.10.K(20)(b)(iii)(A) through (E).

     (c) Second stage filtration. With Department approval, systems may receive 0.5-log Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for a separate second stage of filtration that consists of sand, dual media, GAC, or other
fine grain media following granular media filtration. To receive this credit, the first stage of filtration must
be preceded by a coagulation step and both filtration stages must treat the entire plant flow taken from a
surface water or GWUDI source. A cap, such as GAC, on a single stage of filtration is not eligible for this
credit. The Department must approve the treatment credit based on an assessment of the design
characteristics of the filtration process.

     (d) Slow Sand Filtration (as Secondary Filter).

   With Department approval, systems may receive 2.5-log Cryptosporidium treatment credit for a slow
sand filtration process that follows a separate stage of filtration if both filtration stages treat entire plant

water to the slow sand filtration process. The Department must approve the treatment credit based on an
assessment of the design characteristics of the filtration process. This paragraph does not apply to treatment
credit awarded to slow sand filtration used as a primary filtration process.

  (21) Inactivation Toolbox Components.

     (a) Calculation of CT Values.

       (i) CT is the product of the disinfectant contact time (T, in minutes) and disinfectant concentration
(C, in milligrams per liter). Systems with treatment credit for chlorine dioxide or ozone under R.61-
58.10.K(21)(b) or (c) must calculate CT at least once each day, with both C and T measured during peak
hourly flow as specified in R.61-58.10.F(1) and (2).

        (ii) Systems with several disinfection segments in sequence may calculate CT for each segment,
where a disinfection segment is defined as a treatment unit process with a measurable disinfectant residual
level and a liquid volume. Under this approach, systems must add the Cryptosporidium CT values in each
segment to determine the total CT for the treatment plant.

     (b) CT values for Chlorine Dioxide and Ozone.

system conducts that follows a Department-approved protocol.

    (d) Ultraviolet Light.

282 | Regulation 61-58.10
   Systems may receive Cryptosporidium, Giardia lamblia, and virus treatment credits for ultraviolet (UV)
light reactors by achieving the corresponding UV dose values shown in R.61-58.10.K(21)(d)(i). Systems
must validate and monitor UV reactors as described in R.61-58.10.K(21)(d)(ii) and (iii) to demonstrate that
they are achieving a particular UV dose value for treatment credit.

       (i)     UV Dose Table.

   The treatment credits listed in this table are for UV light at a wavelength of 254 nanometers as produced
by a low-pressure mercury vapor lamp. To receive treatment credit for other lamp types, systems must
demonstrate an equivalent germicidal dose through reactor validation testing, as described in R.61-
58.10.K(21)(d)(ii). The UV dose values in this table are applicable only to post-filter applications of UV in
filtered systems and to unfiltered systems.

       (ii) Reactor Validation Testing.

  Systems must use UV reactors that have undergone validation testing to determine the operating
conditions under which the reactor delivers the UV dose required in R.61-58.10.K(21)(d)(i) (i.e., validated
operating conditions). These operating conditions must include flow rate, UV intensity as measured by a
UV sensor, and UV lamp status.

           (A) When determining validated operating conditions, systems must account for the following
factors: UV absorbance of the water; lamp fouling and aging; measurement uncertainty of on-line sensors;
UV dose distributions arising from the velocity profiles through the reactor; failure of UV lamps or other
critical system components; and inlet and outlet piping or channel configurations of the UV reactor.

          (B) Validation testing must include full scale testing of a reactor that conforms uniformly to the
UV reactors used by the system. In addition, the validation testing must include inactivation information
on a test microorganism whose dose response characteristics have been quantified with a low-pressure
mercury vapor lamp.

             (C) The Department may approve an alternative approach to validation testing.

       (iii) Reactor Monitoring.


283 | Regulation 61-58.10
          (A) Systems must monitor their UV reactors to determine if the reactors are operating within
validated conditions, as determined under R.61-58.10.K(21)(d)(ii). This monitoring must include UV
intensity as measured by a UV sensor, flow rate, lamp status, and other parameters the Department
designates based on UV reactor operation. Systems must verify the calibration of UV sensors and must
recalibrate sensors in accordance with a protocol the Department approves.

          (B) To receive treatment credit for UV light, systems must treat at least 95 percent of the water
delivered to the public during each month by UV reactors operating within validated conditions for the
required UV dose, as described in R.61-58.10.K(21)(d)(i) and (ii). Systems must demonstrate compliance
with this condition by the monitoring required under R.61-58.10.K(21)(d)(iii)(A).

288 | Regulation 61-58.10
                                 CONTROL OF LEAD AND COPPER

A. Applicability.

   This regulation establishes a treatment technique that includes requirements for corrosion control
treatment, source water treatment, lead service line replacement, and public education. These requirements
are triggered, in some cases, by lead and copper action levels measured in samples collected at consumers'
taps. This regulation shall apply to each community and noncommunity water system, unless the water
system meets all of the following conditions:

  (1) Consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and does not have any collection and treatment
facilities);

  (2) Obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a public water system to which such
regulations apply;

  (3) Does not sell water to any person; and

  (4) Is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate commerce.

B. General Requirements.

   The requirements of this regulation constitute as the drinking water regulation for lead and copper. Unless
otherwise indicated, each of the provisions of this regulation applies to community water systems and non-
transient, non-community water systems (hereinafter referred to as "water systems" or "systems").

  (1) Lead and Copper Action Levels

     (a) The lead action level is exceeded if the concentration of lead in more than 10 percent of tap water
samples collected during any monitoring period conducted in accordance with Section H below is greater
than 0.015 mg/L (i.e., if the "90th percentile" lead level is greater than 0.015 mg/L).

     (b) The copper action level is exceeded if the concentration of copper in more than 10 percent of tap
water samples collected during any monitoring period conducted in accordance with Section H below is
greater than 1.3 mg/L (i.e., if the "90th percentile" copper level is greater than 1.3 mg/L).

     (c) The 90th percentile lead and copper levels shall be computed as follows:

        (i) The results of all lead or copper samples taken during a monitoring period shall be placed in
ascending order from the sample with the lowest concentration to the sample with the highest concentration.
Each sampling result shall be assigned a number, ascending by single integers beginning with the number
1 for the sample with the lowest contaminant level. The number assigned to the sample with the highest
contaminant level shall be equal to the total number of samples taken;

       (ii) The number of samples taken during the monitoring period shall be multiplied by 0.9;



289 | Regulation 61-58.11
        (iii) The contaminant concentration in the numbered sample yielded by the calculation in paragraph
(1)(c)(ii) is the 90th percentile contaminant level; and,

       (iv) For water systems serving fewer than 100 people that collect 5 samples per monitoring period,
the 90th percentile is computed by taking the average of the highest and second highest concentrations.

       (v) For a water system that has been allowed by the Department to collect fewer than five samples
in accordance with Section H(3) the sample result with the highest concentration is considered the 90th
percentile value.

291 | Regulation 61-58.11
     (c) Any water system is deemed to have optimized corrosion control if it submits results of tap water
monitoring conducted in accordance with Section H below, and source water monitoring conducted in
accordance with Section J below, that demonstrates for two (2) consecutive six (6) month monitoring
periods that the difference between the 90th percentile tap water lead level computed under Section B(1)(c)
and the highest source water lead concentration, is less than the Practical Quantitation Level for lead
specified in Section K(1)(a).

       (i) Those systems whose highest source water lead level is below the Method Detection Limit may
also be deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph if the 90th percentile tap water
lead level is less than or equal to the Practical Quantitation Level for lead for two consecutive 6-month
monitoring periods.

       (ii) Any water system deemed to have optimized corrosion control in accordance with this
paragraph shall continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap no less frequently than once every three
calendar years using the reduced number of sites specified in Section H(3) below and collecting the samples
at times and locations specified in Section H(4)(d)(iv) below. Any such system that has not conducted a
round of monitoring pursuant to Section H(4) below, since September 30, 1997, shall complete a round of
monitoring pursuant to this paragraph no later than September 30, 2000.

        (iii) Any water system deemed to have optimized corrosion control pursuant to this paragraph shall
notify the Department in writing pursuant to Section L(1)(c) below, of any upcoming long term change in
treatment or the addition of a new source as described in that section. The Department must review and
approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment before it is implemented by
the water system. The Department may require any such system to conduct additional monitoring or to take
other action the Department deems appropriate to ensure that such systems maintain minimal levels of
corrosion in the distribution system.

        (iv) As of July 12, 2001, a system is not deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this
paragraph, and shall implement corrosion control treatment pursuant to paragraph (2)(c)(v) of this section
unless it meets the copper action level.

        (v) Any system triggered into corrosion control because it is no longer deemed to have optimized
corrosion control under this paragraph shall implement corrosion control treatment in accordance with the
deadlines in paragraph (5) of this section. Any such large system shall adhere to the schedule specified in
that paragraph for medium-size systems, with the time periods for completing each step being triggered by
the date the system is no longer deemed to have optimized corrosion control under this paragraph.

   (3) Any small or medium-size water system that is required to complete the corrosion control steps due
to its exceedance of the lead or copper action level may cease completing the treatment steps whenever the
system meets both action levels during each of two consecutive monitoring periods conducted pursuant to
Section H below, and submits the results to the Department. If any such water system thereafter exceeds
the lead or copper action level during any monitoring period, the system (or the Department, as the case
may be) shall recommence completion of the applicable treatment steps, beginning with the first treatment
step which was not previously completed in its entirety. The Department may require a system to repeat
treatment steps previously completed by the system where the Department determines that this is necessary
to implement properly the treatment requirements of this section. The Department shall notify the system
in writing of such a determination and explain the basis for its decision. The requirement for any small or

292 | Regulation 61-58.11
medium-size system to implement corrosion control treatment steps in accordance with Paragraph (5) of
this section (including systems deemed to have optimized corrosion control under Paragraph (2)(a) of this
section) is triggered whenever any small or medium-size system exceeds the lead or copper action level.

   (4) Treatment Steps and Deadlines for Large Systems - Except as provided in paragraph (2)(b) and (c)
of this section, large systems shall complete the following corrosion control treatment steps (described in

paragraph (2) of this section, small and medium-size systems shall complete the following corrosion control
treatment steps (described in the referenced portions of Sections D, H and I below) by the indicated time
periods:

     (a) Step 1: The system shall conduct initial tap sampling (Section H(4)(a) and Section I(2) below)
until the system either exceeds the lead or copper action level or becomes eligible for reduced monitoring
under Section (H)(4)(d) below. A system exceeding the lead or copper action level shall recommend
optimal corrosion control treatment (Section D(1) below) within six (6) months after the end of the
monitoring period during which it exceeds one of the action levels.

     (b) Step 2: Within twelve (12) months after the end of the monitoring period during which a system
exceeds the lead or copper action level, the Department may require the system to perform corrosion control
studies (Section D(2) below). If the Department does not require the system to perform such studies, the
Department shall specify optimal corrosion control treatment (Section D(4)) within the following time
frames:


293 | Regulation 61-58.11
       (i) For medium-size systems, within eighteen (18) months after the end of the monitoring period
during which such system exceeds the lead or copper action level; and,

       (ii) For small systems, within twenty-four (24) months after the end of the monitoring period
during which such system exceeds the lead or copper action level.

     (c) Step 3: If the Department requires a system to perform corrosion control studies under Step 2, the
system shall complete the studies (Section D(3) below) within eighteen (18) months after the Department

Section I(4) below).

D. Description of Corrosion Control Treatment Requirements.

  Each system shall complete the corrosion control treatment requirements described below which are
applicable to such system under Section C above.

  (1) System Recommendation Regarding Corrosion Control treatment - Based upon the results of lead
and copper tap monitoring and water quality parameter monitoring, small and medium-size water systems
exceeding the lead or copper action level shall recommend installation of one or more of the corrosion
control treatments listed in paragraph (3)(a) of this section which the system believes constitutes optimal
corrosion control for that system. The Department may require the system to conduct additional water
quality parameter monitoring in accordance with Section I(2) to assist the Department in reviewing the
system's recommendation.

   (2) Department Decision to Require Studies of Corrosion Control Treatment (applicable to small and
medium-size systems) - The Department may require any small or medium-size system that exceeds the
lead or copper action level to perform corrosion control studies under paragraph (3) of this section to
identify optimal corrosion control treatment for the system.

  (3) Performance of Corrosion Control Studies


294 | Regulation 61-58.11
     (a) Any public water system performing corrosion control studies shall evaluate the effectiveness of
each of the following treatments, and, if appropriate, combinations of the following treatments to identify
the optimal corrosion control treatment for that system:

       (i)   Alkalinity and pH adjustment;

       (ii) Calcium hardness adjustment; and,

       (iii) The addition of a phosphate or silicate based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to
maintain an effective residual concentration in all test tap samples.

      (b) The water system shall evaluate each of the corrosion control treatments using either pipe rig/loop
tests, metal coupon tests, partial-system tests, or analyses based on documented analogous treatments with
other systems of similar size, water chemistry and distribution system configuration.

    (c) The water system shall measure the following water quality parameters in any tests conducted
under this paragraph before and after evaluating the corrosion control treatments listed above:

       (i)   Lead;

       (ii) Copper;

       (iii) pH;

       (iv) Alkalinity;

       (v) Calcium;

       (vi) Conductivity;

       (vii) Orthophosphate (when an inhibitor containing a phosphate compound is used);

       (viii) Silicate (when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is used); and,

       (ix) Water temperature.

     (d) The water system shall identify all chemical or physical constraints that limit or prohibit the use
of a particular corrosion control treatment and document such constraints with at least one of the following:

       (i) Data and documentation showing that a particular corrosion control treatment has adversely
affected other water treatment processes when used by another water system with comparable water quality
characteristics; and/or,

        (ii) Data and documentation demonstrating that the water system has previously attempted to
evaluate a particular corrosion control treatment and has found that the treatment is ineffective or adversely
affects other water quality treatment processes.


295 | Regulation 61-58.11
     (e) The water system shall evaluate the effect of the chemicals used for corrosion control treatment
on other water quality treatment processes.

      (f) On the basis of an analysis of the data generated during each evaluation, the water system shall
recommend to the Department in writing the treatment option that the corrosion control studies indicate
constitutes optimal corrosion control treatment for that system. The water system shall provide a rationale
for its recommendation along with all supporting documentation specified in paragraphs 3(a) through (e)
of this section.

  (4) Department Designation of Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment

     (a) Based upon consideration of available information including, where applicable, studies
performed under paragraph (3) of this section and a system's recommended treatment alternative, the
Department shall either approve the corrosion control treatment option recommended by the system, or
designate alternative corrosion control treatment(s) from among those listed in paragraph (3)(a) of this
section. When designating optimal treatment the Department shall consider the effects that additional
corrosion control treatment will have on water quality parameters and on other water quality treatment
processes.

      (b) The Department shall notify the system of its decision on optimal corrosion control treatment in
writing and explain the basis for this determination. If the Department requests additional information to
aid its review, the water system shall provide the information.

   (5) Installation of Optimal Corrosion Control - Each system shall properly install and operate
throughout its distribution system the optimal corrosion control treatment designated by the Department
under paragraph (4) of this section.

   (6) Department Review of Treatment and Specification of Optimal Water Quality Control Parameters
- The Department shall evaluate the results of all lead and copper tap samples and water quality parameter
samples submitted by the water system and determine whether the system has properly installed and
operated the optimal corrosion control treatment designated by the Department in paragraph (4) of this
section. Upon reviewing the results of tap water and water quality parameter monitoring by the system,
both before and after the system installs optimal corrosion control treatment, the Department shall
designate:

     (a) A minimum value or a range of values for pH measured at each entry point to the distribution
system;

     (b) A minimum pH value, measured in all tap samples. Such value shall be equal to or greater than
7.0, unless the Department determines that meeting a pH level of 7.0 is not technologically feasible or is
not necessary for the system to optimize corrosion control;

     (c) If a corrosion inhibitor is used, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for the
inhibitor, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and in all tap samples, that the Department
determines is necessary to form a passivating film on the interior walls of the pipes of the distribution
system;


296 | Regulation 61-58.11
      (d) If alkalinity is adjusted as part of optimal corrosion control treatment, a minimum concentration
or a range of concentrations for alkalinity, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and in all
tap samples; and,

      (e) If calcium carbonate stabilization is used as part of corrosion control, a minimum concentration
or a range of concentrations for calcium, measured in all tap samples.

  The values for the applicable water quality control parameters listed above shall be those that the
Department determines to reflect optimal corrosion control treatment for the system. The Department may
designate values for additional water quality control parameters determined by the Department to reflect
optimal corrosion control for the system. The Department shall notify the system in writing of these
determinations and explain the basis for its decisions.

   (7) Continued Operation and Monitoring - All systems shall maintain water quality parameter values at
or above minimum values or within ranges designated by the Department under paragraph (6) of this section
in each sample collected under Section I(4) below. If the water quality parameter value of any sample is
below the minimum value or outside the range designated by the Department, then the system is out of
compliance with this paragraph. As specified in Section (I)(4) below, the system may take a confirmation
sample for any water quality parameter value no later than 3 days after the first sample. If a confirmation
sample is taken, the result must be averaged with the first sampling result and the average must be used for
any compliance determinations under this paragraph. All systems optimizing corrosion control shall
continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, including maintaining water quality
parameters at or above minimum values or within ranges designated by the Department under paragraph
(6) of this section, in accordance with this paragraph for all samples collected under Section I(4)-(6) below.
Compliance with the requirements of this paragraph shall be determined every six months, as specified
under Section I(4) below. A water system is out of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph for
a six-month period if it has excursions for any Department-specified parameter on more than nine days
during the period. An excursion occurs whenever the daily value for one or more of the water quality
parameters measured at a sampling location is below the minimum value or outside the range designated
by the Department. Daily values are calculated as follows. The Department has discretion to delete results
of obvious sampling errors from this calculation.

    (a) On days when more than one measurement for the water quality parameter is collected at the
sampling location, the daily value shall be the average of all results collected during the day regardless of
whether they are collected through continuous monitoring, grab sampling, or a combination of both.

     (b) On days when only one measurement for the water quality parameter is collected at the sampling
location, the daily value shall be the result of that measurement.

     (c) On days when no measurement is collected for the water quality parameter at the sampling
location, the daily value shall be the daily value calculated on the most recent day on which the water
quality parameter was measured at the sample site.

  (8) Modification of Department Treatment Decisions - Upon its own initiative or in response to a
request by a water system or other interested party, a Department may modify its determination of the
optimal corrosion control treatment under paragraph (4) of this section or optimal water quality control
parameters under paragraph (6) of this section. A request for modification by a system or other interested

297 | Regulation 61-58.11
party shall be in writing, explain why the modification is appropriate, and provide supporting
documentation. The Department may modify its determination where it concludes that such change is
necessary to ensure that the system continues to optimize corrosion control treatment. A revised
determination shall be made in writing, set forth the new treatment requirements, explain the basis for the
Department's decision, and provide an implementation schedule for completing the treatment
modifications.

E. Source Water Treatment Requirements.

  Systems shall complete the applicable source water monitoring and treatment requirements (described in
the referenced portions of paragraph (2) of this section, and in Sections H and J by the following deadlines.

  (1) Deadlines for Completing Source Water Treatment Steps

     (a) Step 1: A system exceeding the lead or copper action level shall complete lead and copper source
water monitoring (Section J(2) below) and make a treatment recommendation to the Department (paragraph
(2)(a) of this section) no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the end of the monitoring period
during which the lead or copper action level was exceeded.

     (b) Step 2: The Department shall make a determination regarding source water treatment (paragraph
(2)(b) of this section) within six (6) months after submission of monitoring results under Step 1.

      (c) Step 3: If the Department requires installation of source water treatment, the system shall install
the treatment (paragraph (2)(c) of this section) within twenty-four (24) months after completion of Step 2.

     (d) Step 4: The system shall complete follow-up tap water monitoring (Section H(4)(b) below) and
source water monitoring (Section J(3) below) within thirty-six (36) months after completion of Step 2.

     (e) Step 5: The Department shall review the system's installation and operation of source water
treatment and specify maximum permissible source water levels (paragraph (2)(d) of the section) within six
(6) months after completion of Step 4.

    (f) Step 6: The system shall operate in compliance with the Department-specified maximum
permissible lead and copper source water levels (paragraph (2)(d) of this section) and continue source water
monitoring (Section J(4) below).

  (2) Description of Source Water Treatment Requirements

     (a) System Treatment Recommendation - Any system which exceeds the lead or copper action level
shall recommend in writing to the Department the installation and operation of one of the source water
treatments listed in paragraph (2)(b) of this section. A system may recommend that no treatment be installed
based upon a demonstration that source water treatment is not necessary to minimize lead and copper levels
at users' taps.

     (b) Department Determination Regarding Source Water Treatment - The Department shall complete
an evaluation of the results of all source water samples submitted by the water system to determine whether
source water treatment is necessary to minimize lead or copper levels in water delivered to users' taps. If

298 | Regulation 61-58.11
the Department determines that treatment is needed, the Department shall either require installation and
operation of the source water treatment recommended by the system (if any) or require the installation and
operation of another source water treatment from among the following: ion exchange, reverse osmosis,
lime softening or coagulation/filtration. If the Department requests additional information to aid in its
review, the water system shall provide the information by the date specified by the Department in its
request. The Department shall notify the system in writing of its determination and set forth the basis for
its decision.

    (c) Installation of Source Water Treatment - Each system shall properly install and operate the source
water treatment designated by the Department under paragraph (2)(b) of this section.

     (d) Department Review of Source Water Treatment and Specification of Maximum Permissible
Source Water Levels - The Department shall review the source water samples taken by the water system
both before and after the system installs source water treatment, and determine whether the system has
properly installed and operated the source water treatment designated by the Department. Based upon its
review, the Department shall designate the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations for
finished water entering the distribution system. Such levels shall reflect the contaminant removal capability
of the treatment properly operated and maintained. The Department shall notify the system in writing and
explain the basis for its decision.

     (e) Continued Operation and Maintenance - Each water system shall maintain lead and copper levels
below the maximum permissible concentrations designated by the Department at each sampling point
monitored in accordance with Section J. The system is out of compliance with this paragraph if the level of
lead or copper at any sampling point is greater than the maximum permissible concentration designated by
the Department.

     (f) Modification of Department Treatment Decisions - Upon its own initiative or in response to a
request by a water system or other interested party, the Department may modify its determination of the
source water treatment under paragraph (b) of this section, or maximum permissible lead and copper
concentrations for finished water entering the distribution system under paragraph (d) of this section. A
request for modification by a system or other interested party shall be in writing, explain why the
modification is appropriate, and provide supporting documentation. The Department may modify its
determination where it concludes that such change is necessary to ensure that the system continues to
minimize lead and copper concentrations in source water. A revised determination shall be made in writing,
set forth the new treatment requirements, explain the basis for the Department's decision, and provide an
implementation schedule for completing the treatment modifications.

F. Lead Service Line Replacement Requirements.

   (1) Systems that fail to meet the lead action level in tap samples taken pursuant to Section H(4)(b), after
installing corrosion control and/or source water treatment (whichever sampling occurs later), shall replace
lead service lines in accordance with the requirements of this section. If a system is in violation of Section
C or Section E for failure to install source water or corrosion control treatment, the Department may require
the system to commence lead service line replacement under this section after the date by which the system
was required to conduct monitoring under Section H(4)(b) below, has passed.



299 | Regulation 61-58.11
   (2) (a) A water system shall replace annually at least seven (7) percent of the initial number of lead
service lines in its distribution system. The initial number of lead service lines is the number of lead lines
in place at the time the replacement program begins. The system shall identify the initial number of lead
service lines in its distribution system, including an identification of the portions(s) owned by the system,
based on a materials evaluation, including the evaluation required under Section H(1) below and relevant
legal authorities (e.g. contracts, local ordinances) regarding the portion owned by the system. The first year
of lead service line replacement shall begin on the first day following the end of the monitoring period in
which the action level was exceeded under paragraph (1) of this section. If monitoring is required annually
or less frequently, the end of the monitoring period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the
sampling occurs. If the Department has established an alternate monitoring period, then the end of the
monitoring period will be the last day of that period.

      (b) Any water system resuming a lead service line replacement program after the cessation of its lead
service line replacement program as allowed by paragraph (6) of this section shall update its inventory of
lead service lines to include those sites that were previously determined not to require replacement through
the sampling provision under paragraph (3) of this section. The system will then divide the updated number
of remaining lead service lines by the number of remaining years in the program to determine the number
of lines that must be replaced per year (seven (7) percent lead service line replacement is based on a fifteen
(15) year replacement program, so, for example, systems resuming lead service line replacement after
previously conducting two years of replacement would divide the updated inventory by thirteen (13)). For
those systems that have completed a fifteen (15) year lead service line replacement program, the Department
will determine a schedule for replacing or retesting lines that were previously tested out under the
replacement program when the system re exceeded the action level.

  (3) A system is not required to replace an individual lead service line if the lead concentration in all
service line samples from that line, taken pursuant to Section H(2)(c), is less than or equal to 0.015 mg/L.

  (4) A water system shall replace that portion of the lead service line that it owns. In cases where the
system does not own the entire lead service line, the system shall notify the owner of the line, or the owner's
authorized agent, that the system will replace the portion of the service line that it owns and shall offer to
replace the owner’s portion of the line. A system is not required to bear the cost of replacing the privately-
owned portion of the line, nor is it required to replace the privately-owned portion where the owner chooses
not to pay the cost of replacing the privately-owned portion of the line, or where replacing the privately-
owned portion would be precluded by State, local or common law. A water system that does not replace
the entire length of the service line also shall complete the following tasks.

      (a) At least forty-five (45) days prior to commencing with the partial replacement of a lead service
line, the water system shall provide notice to the resident(s) of all buildings served by the line explaining
that they may experience a temporary increase of lead levels in their drinking water, along with guidance
on measures consumers can take to minimize their exposure to lead. The Department may allow the water
system to provide notice under the previous sentence less than forty-five (45) days prior to commencing
partial lead service line replacement where such replacement is in conjunction with emergency repairs. In
addition, the water system shall inform the resident(s) served by the line that the system will, at the system’s
expense, collect a sample from each partially-replaced lead service line that is representative of the water
in the service line for analysis of lead content, as prescribed under Section H(2)(c) below, within seventy-
two (72) hours after the completion of the partial replacement of the service line. The system shall collect
the sample and report the results of the analysis to the owner and the resident(s) served by the line within

300 | Regulation 61-58.11
three (3) business days of receiving the results. Mailed notices post-marked within three (3) business days
of receiving the results shall be considered "on time."

     (b) The water system shall provide the information required by paragraph (4)(a) of this section to the
residents of individual dwellings by mail or by other methods approved by the Department. In instances
where multi-family dwellings are served by the line, the water system shall have the option to post the
information at a conspicuous location.

  (5) The Department shall require a system to replace lead service lines on a shorter schedule than that
required by this section, taking into account the number of lead service lines in the system, where such a
shorter replacement schedule is feasible. The Department shall make this determination in writing and
notify the system of its finding within 6 months after the system is triggered into lead service line
replacement based on monitoring referenced in paragraph (1) of this section.

   (6) Any system may cease replacing lead service lines whenever first draw samples collected pursuant
to Section H(2)(b) below, meet the lead action level during each of two consecutive monitoring periods and
the system submits the results to the Department. If the first draw tap samples collected in any such system
thereafter exceeds the lead action level, the system shall recommence replacing lead service lines pursuant
to paragraph (2) of this section.

  (7) To demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (1) through (4) of this section, a system shall report to
the Department the information specified in Section L(5) below.

G. Public Education and Supplemental Monitoring Requirements.

  All water systems must deliver a consumer notice of lead tap water monitoring results to persons served
by the water system at sites that are tested, as specified in paragraph (4) of this section. A water system that
exceeds the lead action level based on tap water samples collected in accordance with Section H shall
deliver the public education materials contained in paragraph (1) this section in accordance with the
requirements in paragraph (2) of this section. Water systems that exceed the lead action level must sample
the tap water of any customer who requests it in accordance with paragraph (3) of this section.

  (1) Content of written public education materials.

      (a) Community water systems and Non-transient non-community water systems. Water systems must
include the following elements in printed material (e.g., brochures and pamphlets) in the same order as
listed below. In addition, language in paragraphs (1)(a)(i) through (ii) and (1)(a)(vi) of this section must be
included in the materials, exactly as written, except for the brackets in these paragraphs for which the water
system must include system-specific information. Any additional information presented by a water system
must be consistent with the information below and be in plain language that can be understood by the
general public. Water systems must submit all written public education materials to the Department prior
to delivery. The Department may require the system to obtain approval of the content of written public
materials prior to delivery.

    (i) IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LEAD IN YOUR DRINKING WATER. [INSERT
NAME OF WATER SYSTEM] found elevated levels of lead in drinking water in some homes/buildings.


301 | Regulation 61-58.11
Lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Please read
this information closely to see what you can do to reduce lead in your drinking water.

        (ii) Health effects of lead. Lead can cause serious health problems if too much enters your body
from drinking water or other sources. It can cause damage to the brain and kidneys, and can interfere with
the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body. The greatest risk of lead
exposure is to infants, young children, and pregnant women. Scientists have linked the effects of lead on
the brain with lowered IQ in children. Adults with kidney problems and high blood pressure can be affected
by low levels of lead more than healthy adults. Lead is stored in the bones, and it can be released later in
life. During pregnancy, the child receives lead from the mother’s bones, which may affect brain
development.

       (iii) Sources of Lead.

             (A) Explain what lead is.

          (B) Explain possible sources of lead in drinking water and how lead enters drinking water.
Include information on homes/building plumbing materials and service lines that may contain lead.

             (C) Discuss other important sources of lead exposure in addition to drinking water (e.g., paint).

       (iv) Discuss the steps the consumer can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water.

             (A) Encourage running the water to flush out the lead.

          (B) Explain concerns with using hot water from the tap and specifically caution against the use
of hot water for preparing baby formula.

             (C) Explain that boiling water does not reduce lead levels.

          (D) Discuss other options consumers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water, such
as alternative sources or treatment of water.

             (E) Suggest that parents have their child’s blood tested for lead.

       (v) Explain why there are elevated levels of lead in the system’s drinking water (if known) and
what the water system is doing to reduce the lead levels in homes/buildings in this area..

       (vi) For more information, call us at [INSERT YOUR NUMBER] [(IF APPLICABLE), or visit our
Web site at [INSERT YOUR WEB SITE HERE]]. For more information on reducing lead exposure around
your home/building and the health effects of lead, visit EPA’s website at http://www.epa.gov/lead or contact
your health care provider.

      (b) Community water systems. In addition to including the elements specified in paragraph (1)(a) of
this section, community water systems must:

       (i)     Tell consumers how to get their water tested.

302 | Regulation 61-58.11
       (ii) Discuss lead in plumbing components and the difference between low lead and lead free.

  (2) Delivery of public education materials:

     (a) For public water systems serving a large proportion of non-English speaking consumers, as
determined by the Department, the public education material must contain information in the appropriate
language(s) regarding the importance of the notice or contain a telephone number or address where persons
served may contact the water system to obtain a translated copy of the public education materials or to
request assistance in the appropriate language.

     (b) A community water system that exceeds the lead action level on the basis of tap water samples
collected in accordance with Section H and that is not already conducting public education tasks under this
section, must conduct the public education tasks under this section within 60 days after the end of the
monitoring period in which the exceedance occurred:

         (i) Deliver printed materials meeting the content requirements of paragraph (1) of this section to
all bill paying customers.

        (ii) (A) Contact customers who are most at risk by delivering education materials that meet the
content requirements of paragraph (1) of this section to local public health agencies even if they are not
located within the water system's service area, along with an informational notice that encourages
distribution to all the organization's potentially affected customers or community water system's users. The
water system must contact the local public health agencies directly by phone or in person. The local public
health agencies may provide a specific list of additional community based organizations serving target
populations, which may include organizations outside the service area of the water system. If such lists are
provided, systems must deliver education materials that meet the content requirements of paragraph (1) of
this section to all organizations on the provided lists.

           (B) Contact customers who are most at risk by delivering materials that meet the content
requirements of paragraph (1) of this section to the following organizations listed in (1) through (6) below

deliver materials that meet the content requirements of paragraph (1) of this section to them, along with an
informational notice that encourages distribution to all potentially affected customers or users. The good
faith effort to contact at risk customers may include requesting a specific contact list of these organizations
from the local public health agencies, even if the agencies are not located within the water system's service
area:

            (1) Licensed childcare centers.

            (2) Public and private preschools.

            (3) Obstetricians Gynecologist and Midwives.

       (iii) No less often than quarterly, provide information on or in each water bill as long as the system
exceeds the action level for lead. The message on the water bill must include the following statement exactly
as written except for the text in brackets for which the water system must include system-specific
information: [INSERT NAME OF WATER SYSTEM] found high levels of lead in drinking water in some
homes. Lead can cause serious health problems. For more information please call [INSERT NAME OF

          (H) Direct material distribution to all multi family homes and institutions.

304 | Regulation 61-58.11
          (I) Other methods approved by the Department.

        (vii) For systems that are required to conduct monitoring annually or less frequently, the end of the
monitoring period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs, or, if the Department
has established an alternate monitoring period, the last day of that period.

    (c) As long as a community water system exceeds the action level, it must repeat the activities
pursuant to paragraph (2)(b) of this section as described in paragraphs (2)(c)(i) through (iv) of this section.

        (i) A community water system shall repeat the tasks contained in paragraphs (2)(b)(i), (ii) and (vi)
of this section every 12 months.

       (ii) A community water system shall repeat the tasks contained in paragraph (2)(b)(iii) of this

        (iv) The community water system shall repeat the task in paragraph (2)(b)(v) of this section twice
every twelve (12) months on a schedule agreed upon with the Department. The Department can allow
activities in paragraph (2)(b) of this section to extend beyond the sixty (60) day requirement if needed for
implementation purposes on a case by case basis; however, this extension must be approved in writing by
the Department in advance of the sixty (60) day deadline.

     (d) Within sixty (60) days after the end of the monitoring period in which the exceedance occurred
(unless it already is repeating public education tasks pursuant to paragraph (2)(e) of this section), a non-
transient non-community water system shall deliver the public education materials specified in paragraph
(a) of this section as follows:

        (i) Post informational posters on lead in drinking water in a public place or common area in each
of the buildings served by the system; and:

       (ii) Distribute informational pamphlets and/or brochures on lead in drinking water to each person
served by the non-transient non-community water system. The Department may allow the system to utilize
electronic transmission in lieu of or combined with printed materials as long as it achieves at least the same
coverage.

        (iii) For systems that are required to conduct monitoring annually or less frequently, the end of the
monitoring period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs, or, if the Department
has established an alternate monitoring period, the last day of that period.

     (e) A non-transient non-community water system shall repeat the tasks contained in paragraph (2)(d)
of this section at least once during each calendar year in which the system exceeds the lead action level.
The Department can allow activities in (2)(d) of this section to extend beyond the sixty (60) day requirement
if needed for implementation purposes on a case-by-case basis; however, this extension must be approved
in writing by the Department in advance of the sixty (60) day deadline.

305 | Regulation 61-58.11
     (f) A water system may discontinue delivery of public education materials if the system has met the
lead action level during the most recent six-month monitoring period conducted pursuant to Section H.
Such a system shall recommence public education in accordance with this section if it subsequently exceeds
the lead action level during any monitoring period.

     (g) A community water system may apply to the Department, in writing (unless the Department has
waived the requirement for prior Department approval), to use only the text specified in paragraph (1)(a)
of this section in lieu of the text in paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(b) of this section and to perform the tasks listed
in paragraphs (2)(d) and (2)(e) of this section in lieu of the tasks in paragraphs (2)(b) and (2)(c) of this
section if:

       (i) The system is a facility, such as a prison or a hospital, where the population served is not
capable of or is prevented from making improvements to plumbing or installing point of use treatment
devices; and

       (ii) The system provides water as part of the cost of services provided and does not separately
charge for water consumption.

    (h) A community water system serving 3,300 or fewer people may limit certain aspects of their public
education programs as follows:

       (i) With respect to the requirements of paragraph (2)(b)(vi) of this section, a system serving 3,300
or fewer people must implement at least one of the activities listed in that paragraph.

        (ii) With respect to the requirements of paragraph (2)(b)(ii) of this section, a system serving 3,300
or fewer people may limit the distribution of the public education materials required under that paragraph
to facilities and organizations served by the system that are most likely to be visited regularly by pregnant
women and children.

       (iii) With respect to the requirements of paragraph (2)(b)(v) of this section, the Department may
waive this requirement for systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons as long as the system distributes notices
to every household served by the system.

  (3) Supplemental monitoring and notification of results.

  A water system that fails to meet the lead action level on the basis of tap samples collected in accordance
with Section H shall offer to sample the tap water of any customer who requests it. The system is not
required to pay for collecting or analyzing the sample, nor is the system required to collect and analyze the
sample itself.

  (4) Notification of results.

     (a) Reporting requirements. All water systems must provide a notice of the individual tap results
from lead tap water monitoring carried out under the requirements of Section H to the persons served by
the water system at the specific sampling site from which the sample was taken (e.g., the occupants of the
residence where the tap was tested).

306 | Regulation 61-58.11
     (b) Timing of notification. A water system must provide the consumer notice as soon as practical,
but no later than thirty (30) days after the system learns of the tap monitoring results.

     (c) Content. The consumer notice must include the results of lead tap water monitoring for the tap
that was tested, an explanation of the health effects of lead, list steps consumers can take to reduce exposure
to lead in drinking water and contact information for the water utility. The notice must also provide the
maximum contaminant level goal and the action level for lead and the definitions for these two terms from
R.61-58.12.C(3).

      (d) Delivery. The consumer notice must be provided to persons served at the tap that was tested,
either by mail or by another method approved by the Department. For example, upon approval by the
Department, a non-transient non-community water system could post the results on a bulletin board in the
facility to allow users to review the information. The system must provide the notice to customers at sample
taps tested, including consumers who do not receive water bills.

H. Monitoring Requirements for Lead and Copper in Tap Water.

  (1) Sample Site Location

     (a) By the applicable date for commencement of monitoring under paragraph (4)(a) of this section,
each water system shall complete a materials evaluation of its distribution system in order to identify a pool
of targeted sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section, and which is sufficiently large to
ensure that the water system can collect the number of lead and copper tap samples required in paragraph
(3) of this section. All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be selected from this pool of
targeted sampling sites. Sampling sites may not include faucets that have point-of-use or point-of-entry
treatment devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants.

     (b) A water system shall use the information on lead, copper, and galvanized steel that it is required
to collect under R.61-58.5.V, Special Corrosivity Characteristics, of this part [special monitoring for
corrosivity characteristics] when conducting a materials evaluation. When an evaluation of the information
collected pursuant to R.61-58.5.V, Special Monitoring for Corrosivity Characteristics, is insufficient to
locate the requisite number of lead and copper sampling sites that meet the targeting criteria in paragraph
(1) of this section, the water system shall review the sources of information listed below in order to identify
a sufficient number of sampling sites. In addition, the system shall seek to collect such information where
possible in the course of its normal operations (e.g., checking service line materials when reading water
meters or performing maintenance activities):

        (i) All plumbing codes, permits, and records in the files of the building department(s) which
indicate the plumbing materials that are installed within publicly and privately owned structures connected
to the distribution system;

        (ii) All inspections and records of the distribution system that indicate the material composition of
the service connections that connect a structure to the distribution system; and




307 | Regulation 61-58.11
       (iii) All existing water quality information, which includes the results of all prior analyses of the
system or individual structures connected to the system, indicating locations that may be particularly
susceptible to high lead or copper concentrations.

     (c) The sampling sites selected for a community water system's sampling pool ("Tier 1 sampling
sites") shall consist of single family structures that:

       (i)   Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982 or contain lead pipes; and/or,

       (ii) Are served by a lead service line. When multiple-family residences comprise at least twenty
(20) percent of the structures served by a water system, the system may include these types of structures in
its sampling pool.

     (d) Any community water system with insufficient Tier 1 sampling sites shall complete its sampling
pool with "Tier 2 sampling sites", consisting of buildings, including multiple-family residences that:

       (i)   Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982 or contain lead pipes; and/or,

       (ii) Are served by a lead service line.

      (e) Any community water system with insufficient Tier 1 and Tier 2 sampling sites shall complete
its sampling pool with "tier 3 sampling sites," consisting of single family structures that contain copper
pipes with lead solder installed before 1983. A community water system with insufficient Tier 1, Tier 2,
and Tier 3 sampling sites shall complete its sampling pool with representative sites throughout the
distribution system. For the purpose of this paragraph, a representative site is a site in which the plumbing
materials used at that site would be commonly found at other sites served by the water system.

     (f) The sampling sites selected for a non-transient non-community water system ("Tier 1 sampling
sites") shall consist of buildings that:

       (i)   Contain copper pipes with lead solder installed after 1982 or contain lead pipes; and/or,

       (ii) Are served by a lead service line.

      (g) A non-transient non-community water system with insufficient tier 1 sites that meet the targeting
criteria in paragraph (1)(f) of this section shall complete its sampling pool with sampling sites that contain
copper pipes with lead solder installed before 1983. If additional sites are needed to complete the sampling
pool, the non-transient non- community water system shall use representative sites throughout the
distribution system. For the purpose of this paragraph, a representative site is a site in which the plumbing
materials used at that site would be commonly found at other sites served by the water system.

     (h) Any water system whose distribution system contains lead service lines shall draw 50 percent of
the samples it collects during each monitoring period from sites that contain lead pipes, or copper pipes
with lead solder, and 50 percent of the samples from sites served by a lead service line. A water system that
cannot identify a sufficient number of sampling sites served by a lead service line shall collect first draw
samples from all of the sites identified as being served by such lines.


308 | Regulation 61-58.11
  (2) Sample Collection Methods

     (a) All tap samples for lead and copper collected in accordance with this section, with the exception
of lead service line samples collected under Section F(3) above, and samples collected under paragraph
(2)(e) of this section, shall be first draw samples.

     (b) Each first draw tap sample for lead and copper shall be one (1) liter in volume and have stood
motionless in the plumbing system of each sampling site for at least six (6) hours. First draw samples from
residential housing shall be collected from the cold water kitchen tap or bathroom sink tap. First-draw
samples from a nonresidential building shall be one liter in volume and shall be collected at an interior tap
from which water is typically drawn for consumption. Non-first-draw samples collected in lieu of first-
draw samples pursuant to paragraph (2)(e) of this section shall be one liter in volume and shall be collected
at an interior tap from which water is typically drawn for consumption. First draw samples may be collected
by the system or the system may allow residents to collect first draw samples after instructing the residents
of the sampling procedures specified in this paragraph. To avoid problems of residents handling nitric acid,
acidification of first draw samples may be done up to fourteen (14) days after the sample is collected. After
acidification to resolubilize the metals, the sample must stand in the original container for the time specified
in the approved EPA method before the sample can be analyzed. If a system allows residents to perform
sampling, the system may not challenge, based on alleged errors in sample collection, the accuracy of
sampling results.

     (c) Each service line sample shall be one liter in volume and have stood motionless in the lead service
line for at least six (6) hours. Lead service line samples shall be collected in one of the following three
ways:

       (i) At the tap after flushing the volume of water between the tap and the lead service line. The
volume of water shall be calculated based on the interior diameter and length of the pipe between the tap
and the lead service line;

       (ii) Tapping directly into the lead service line; or,

       (iii) If the sampling site is a building constructed as a single-family residence, allowing the water
to run until there is a significant change in temperature which would be indicative of water that has been
standing in the lead service line.

      (d) A water system shall collect each first draw tap sample from the same sampling site from which
it collected a previous sample. If, for any reason, the water system cannot gain entry to a sampling site in
order to collect a follow-up tap sample, the system may collect the follow-up tap sample from another
sampling site in its sampling pool as long as the new site meets the same targeting criteria, and is within
reasonable proximity of the original site.

      (e) A non-transient non-community water system, or a community water system that meets the
criteria of Section G(2)(g) above, that does not have enough taps that can supply first-draw samples, as
defined in R.61-58(B), may apply to the Department in writing to substitute non-first-draw samples. Such
systems must collect as many first-draw samples from appropriate taps as possible and identify sampling
times and locations that would likely result in the longest standing time for the remaining sites. The


309 | Regulation 61-58.11
Department has the discretion to waive the requirement for prior Department approval of non-first-draw
sample sites selected by the system, either through State regulation or written notification to the system.

   (3) Number of Samples - Water systems shall collect at least one (1) sample during each monitoring
period specified in paragraph (4) of this section from the number of sites listed in the first column ("standard
monitoring") of the table in this paragraph. A system conducting reduced monitoring under paragraph (4)(d)
of this section shall collect at least one (1) sample from the number of sites specified in the second column
("reduced monitoring") of the table in this paragraph during each monitoring period specified in paragraph
(4)(d) of this section. Such reduced monitoring sites shall be representative of the sites required for standard
monitoring. A public water system that has fewer than five drinking water taps, that can be used for human
consumption meeting the sample site criteria of paragraph (1) of this section to reach the required number
of sample sites listed in paragraph (3) of this section, must collect at least one sample from each tap and
then must collect additional samples from those taps on different days during the monitoring period to meet
the required number of sites. Alternatively the Department may allow these public water systems to collect
a number of samples less than the number of sites specified in paragraph (3) of this section, provided that
one hundred (100) percent of all taps that can be used for human consumption are sampled. The Department
must approve this reduction of the minimum number of samples in writing based on a request from the
system or onsite verification by the Department. The Department may specify sampling locations when a
system is conducting reduced monitoring. The table is as follows:

  System Size                           # of Sites                            # of Sites

         (i)   All large systems shall monitor during two (2) consecutive six (6)month periods.

         (ii) All small and medium-size systems shall monitor during each six (6) month monitoring period
until:



310 | Regulation 61-58.11
          (A) The system exceeds the lead or copper action level and is therefore required to implement
the corrosion control treatment requirements under Section C above, in which case the system shall continue
monitoring in accordance with paragraph (4)(b) of this section; or,

           (B) The system meets the lead and copper action levels during two (2) consecutive six (6) month
monitoring periods, in which case the system may reduce monitoring in accordance with paragraph (4)(d)
of this section

    (b) Monitoring After Installation of Corrosion Control and Source Water Treatment

        (i) Any large system which installs optimal corrosion control treatment pursuant to Section
C(4)(d) above, shall monitor during two (2) consecutive six (6) month monitoring periods by the date
specified in Section C(4)(e) above.

        (ii) Any small or medium-size system which installs optimal corrosion control treatment pursuant
to Section C(5)(e) above, shall monitor during two (2) consecutive six (6) month monitoring periods by the
date specified in Section C(5)(f) above.

       (iii) Any system which installs source water treatment pursuant to Section E(1)(c) above, shall
monitor during two (2) consecutive six (6) month monitoring periods by the date specified in Section
E(1)(d) above.

     (c) Monitoring After the Department Specifies Water Quality Parameter Values for Optimal
Corrosion Control - After the Department specifies the values for water quality control parameters under
Section D(6) above, the system shall monitor during each subsequent six-month monitoring period, with
the first monitoring period to begin on the date the Department specifies the optimal values under Section
D(6) above.

    (d) Reduced Monitoring

       (i) A small or medium-size water system that meets the lead and copper action levels during each
of two (2) consecutive six (6) month monitoring periods may reduce the number of samples in accordance
with paragraph (3) of this section, and reduce the frequency of sampling to once per year. A small or
medium water system collecting fewer than five (5) samples as specified in paragraph (3) of this section,
that meets the lead and copper action levels during each of two consecutive six- month monitoring periods
may reduce the frequency of sampling to once per year. In no case can the system reduce the number of
samples required below the minimum of one sample per available tap. This sampling shall begin during the
calendar year immediately following the end of the second consecutive six-month monitoring period.

       (ii) Any water system that meets the lead action level and maintains the range of values for the
water quality control parameters reflecting optimal corrosion control treatment specified by the Department
under Section D(6) above, during each of two consecutive six-month monitoring periods may reduce the
frequency of monitoring to once per year and to reduce the number of lead and copper samples in
accordance with paragraph (3) of this section if it receives written approval from the Department. This
sampling shall begin during the calendar year immediately following the end of the second consecutive six-
month monitoring period. The Department shall review monitoring, treatment, and other relevant
information submitted by the water system in accordance with Section L below, and shall notify the system

311 | Regulation 61-58.11
in writing when it determines the system is eligible to commence reduced monitoring pursuant to this
paragraph. The Department shall review, and where appropriate, revise its determination when the system
submits new monitoring or treatment data, or when other data relevant to the number and frequency of tap
sampling becomes available.

        (iii) A small or medium-size water system that meets the lead and copper action levels during three
(3) consecutive years of monitoring may reduce the frequency of monitoring for lead and copper from
annually to once every three (3) years. Any water system that meets the lead action level and maintains the
range of values for the water quality control parameters reflecting optimal corrosion control treatment
specified by the Department under Section D(6), during three consecutive years of monitoring may reduce
the frequency of monitoring from annually to once every three years if it receives written approval from
the Department. Samples collected once every three years shall be collected no later than every third
calendar year. The Department shall review monitoring, treatment, and other relevant information
submitted by the water system in accordance with Section L below, and shall notify the system in writing,
when it determines the system is eligible to reduce the frequency of monitoring to once every three years.
The Department shall review, and where appropriate, revise its determination when the system submits new
monitoring or treatment data, or when other data relevant to the number and frequency of tap sampling
becomes available.

       (iv) A water system that reduces the number and frequency of sampling shall collect these samples
from representative sites included in the pool of targeted sampling sites identified in paragraph (1) of this
section. Systems sampling annually or less frequently shall conduct the lead and copper tap sampling during
the months of June, July, August or September.

           (A) The Department, at its discretion, may approve a different period for conducting the lead and
copper tap sampling for systems collecting a reduced number of samples. Such a period shall be no longer
than four (4) consecutive months and must represent a time of normal operation where the highest levels of
lead are most likely to occur. For a non-transient non- community water system that does not operate during
the months of June through September, and for which the period of normal operation where the highest
levels of lead are most likely to occur is not known, the Department shall designate a period that represents
a time of normal operation for the system. This sampling shall begin during the period approved or
designated by the Department in the calendar year immediately following the end of the second consecutive
six-month monitoring period for systems initiating annual monitoring and during the three-year period
following the end of the third consecutive calendar year of annual monitoring for systems initiating triennial
monitoring.

          (B) Systems monitoring annually, that have been collecting samples during the months of June
through September and that receive Department approval to alter their sample collection period under
paragraph (4)(a)(iv)(A) of this section, must collect their next round of samples during a time period that
ends no later than forty-five (45) months after the previous round of sampling. Subsequent rounds of
sampling must be collected annually or triennially, as required by this section. Small systems with waivers,
granted pursuant to paragraph (7) of this section, that have been collecting samples during the months of
June through September and receive Department approval to alter their sample collection period under
paragraph (4)(d)(iv)(A) of this section, must collect their next round of samples before then end of the nine
(9) year period.



312 | Regulation 61-58.11
        (v) Any water system that demonstrates for two (2) consecutive six (6) month monitoring periods
that the tap water lead level computed under Section B(1)(c) above, is less than or equal to 0.005 mg/L and
the tap water copper level computed under Section B(1)(c) above, is less than or equal to 0.65 mg/L may
reduce the number of samples in accordance with paragraph (3) of this section and reduce the frequency of
sampling to once every three (3) calendar years.

        (vi) (A) A small or medium-size water system subject to reduced monitoring that exceeds the lead
or copper action level shall resume sampling in accordance with paragraph (4)(c) of this section and collect
the number of samples specified for standard monitoring under paragraph (3) of this section. Such a system
shall also conduct water quality parameter monitoring in accordance with Section I(2), (3) or (4) below (as
appropriate), during the monitoring period in which it exceeded the action level. Any such system may
resume annual monitoring for lead and copper at the tap at the reduced number of sites specified in
paragraph (3) of this section after it has completed two subsequent consecutive six-month rounds of
monitoring that meet the criteria of paragraph (4)(d)(i) of this section and/or may resume triennial
monitoring for lead and copper at the reduced number of sites after it demonstrates through subsequent
rounds of monitoring that it meets the criteria of either paragraph (4)(d)(iii) or (4)(d)(v) of this section.

          (B) Any water system subject to the reduced monitoring frequency that fails to meet the lead
action level during any four-month monitoring period or that fails to operate at or above the minimum value
or within the range of values for the water quality parameters specified by the Department under Section
D(6) above, for more than nine (9) days in any six-month period specified in Section I(4) below, shall
conduct tap water sampling for lead and copper at the frequency specified in paragraph (4)(c) of this section,
collect the number of samples specified for standard monitoring under paragraph (3) of this section, and
shall resume monitoring for water quality parameters within the distribution system in accordance with
Section I(4) below. This standard tap water sampling shall begin no later than the six-month period
beginning January 1 of the calendar year following the lead action level exceedance or water quality
parameter excursion. Such a system may resume reduced monitoring for lead and copper at the tap and for
water quality parameters within the distribution system under the following conditions:

            (1) The system may resume annual monitoring for lead and copper at the tap at the reduced
number of sites specified in paragraph (3) of this section after it has completed two subsequent six-month
rounds of monitoring that meet the criteria of paragraph (4)(d)(ii) of this section and the system has received
written approval from the Department that it is appropriate to resume reduced monitoring on an annual
frequency. This sampling shall begin during the calendar year immediately following the end of the second
consecutive six-month monitoring period.

            (2) The system may resume triennial monitoring for lead and copper at the tap at the reduced
number of sites after it demonstrates through subsequent rounds of monitoring that it meets the criteria of
either paragraph (4)(d)(iii) or (4)(d)(v) of this section and the system has received written approval from
the Department that it is appropriate to resume triennial monitoring.

             (3) The system may reduce the number of water quality parameter tap water samples required
in accordance with Section I(5)(a) below, and the frequency with which it collects such samples in
accordance with Section I(5)(b) below. Such a system may not resume triennial monitoring for water
quality parameters at the tap until it demonstrates, in accordance with the requirements of Section I(5)(b)
below, that it has re-qualified for triennial monitoring.


313 | Regulation 61-58.11
        (vii) Any water system subject to a reduced monitoring frequency under paragraph (4)(d) of this
section shall notify the Department in writing in accordance with Section L(1)(c) of any upcoming long-
term change in treatment or addition of a new source as described in that section. The Department must
review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment before it is
implemented by the water system. The Department may require the system to resume sampling in
accordance with paragraph (4)(c) of this section and collect the number of samples specified for standard
monitoring under paragraph (3) of this section or take other appropriate steps such as increased water quality
parameter monitoring or re-evaluation of its corrosion control treatment given the potentially different water
quality considerations

  (5) Additional Monitoring by Systems - The results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the
minimum requirements of this section shall be considered by the system and the Department in making any
determinations (i.e., calculating the 90th percentile lead or copper level) under this section.

  (6) Invalidation of lead or copper tap water samples. A sample invalidated under this paragraph does
not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels under Section B(1)(c) above, or toward
meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of paragraph (3) of this section.

    (a) The Department may invalidate a lead or copper tap water sample at least if one of the following
conditions is met.

       (i)   The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused erroneous results.

        (ii) The Department determines that the sample was taken from a site that did not meet the site
selection criteria of this section.

       (iii) The sample container was damaged in transit.

       (iv) There is substantial reason to believe that the sample was subject to tampering.

    (b) The system must report the results of all samples to the Department and all supporting
documentation for samples the system believes should be invalidated.

     (c) To invalidate a sample under paragraph (6)(a) of this section, the decision and the rationale for
the decision must be documented in writing. The Department may not invalidate a sample solely on the
grounds that a follow-up sample result is higher or lower than that of the original sample.

      (d) The water system must collect replacement samples for any samples invalidated under this section
if, after the invalidation of one or more samples, the system has too few samples to meet the minimum
requirements of paragraph (3) of this section. Any such replacement samples must be taken as soon as
possible, but no later than 20 days after the date the Department invalidates the sample or by the end of the
applicable monitoring period, whichever occurs later. Replacement samples taken after the end of the
applicable monitoring period shall not also be used to meet the monitoring requirements of a subsequent
monitoring period. The replacement samples shall be taken at the same locations as the invalidated samples
or, if that is not possible, at locations other than those already used for sampling during the monitoring
period.


314 | Regulation 61-58.11
   (7) Monitoring waivers for small systems. Any small system that meets the criteria of this paragraph
may apply to the Department to reduce the frequency of monitoring for lead and copper under this section
to once every nine years (i.e., a “full waiver”) if it meets all of the materials criteria specified in paragraph
(7)(a) of this section and all of the monitoring criteria specified in paragraph (7)(b) of this section. Any
small system that meets the criteria in paragraphs (7)(a) and (b) of this section only for lead, or only for
copper, may apply to the Department for a waiver to reduce the frequency of tap water monitoring to once
every nine years for that contaminant only (i.e., a “partial waiver”).

     (a) Materials criteria. The system must demonstrate that its distribution system and service lines and
all drinking water supply plumbing, including plumbing conveying drinking water within all residences
and buildings connected to the system, are free of lead-containing materials and/or copper-containing
materials, as those terms are defined in this paragraph, as follows:

        (i) Lead. To qualify for a full waiver, or a waiver of the tap water monitoring requirements for
lead (i.e., a “lead waiver”), the water system must provide certification and supporting documentation to
the Department that the system is free of all lead-containing materials, as follows:

          (A) It contains no plastic pipes which contain lead plasticizers, or plastic service lines which
contain lead plasticizers; and

           (B) It is free of lead service lines, lead pipes, lead soldered pipe joints, and leaded brass or bronze
alloy fittings and fixtures, unless such fittings and fixtures meet the specifications of any standard
established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300g-6(e) (SDWA section 1417(e)).

        (ii) Copper. To qualify for a full waiver, or a waiver of the tap water monitoring requirements for
copper (i.e., a “copper waiver”), the water system must provide certification and supporting documentation
to the Department that the system contains no copper pipes or copper service lines.

     (b) Monitoring criteria for waiver issuance. The system must have completed at least one 6-month
round of standard tap water monitoring for lead and copper at sites approved by the Department and from
the number of sites required by paragraph (3) of this section and demonstrate that the 90th percentile levels
for any and all rounds of monitoring conducted since the system became free of all lead-containing and/or
copper-containing materials, as appropriate, meet the following criteria.

       (i) Lead levels. To qualify for a full waiver, or a lead waiver, the system must demonstrate that
the 90th percentile lead level does not exceed 0.005 mg/L.

        (ii) Copper levels. To qualify for a full waiver, or a copper waiver, the system must demonstrate
that the 90th percentile copper level does not exceed 0.65 mg/L.

     (c) Department approval of waiver application. The Department shall notify the system of its waiver
determination, in writing, setting forth the basis of its decision and any condition of the waiver. As a
condition of the waiver, the Department may require the system to perform specific activities (e.g., limited
monitoring, periodic outreach to customers to remind them to avoid installation of materials that might void
the waiver) to avoid the risk of lead or copper concentration of concern in tap water. The small system must
continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap as required by paragraphs (4)(a) through (4)(d) of this


315 | Regulation 61-58.11
section, as appropriate, until it receives written notification from the Department that the waiver has been
approved.

     (d) Monitoring frequency for systems with waivers.

        (i) A system with a full waiver must conduct tap water monitoring for lead and copper in
accordance with paragraph (4)(d)(iv) of this section at the reduced number of sampling sites identified in
paragraph (3) of this section at least once every nine (9) years and provide the materials certification
specified in paragraph (7)(a) of this section for both lead and copper to the Department along with the
monitoring results. Samples collected every nine (9) years shall be collected no later than every ninth
calendar year.

        (ii) A system with a partial waiver must conduct tap water monitoring for the waived contaminant
in accordance with paragraph (4)(d)(iv) of this section at the reduced number of sampling sites specified in
paragraph (3) of this section at least once every nine (9) years and provide the materials certification
specified in paragraph (7)(a) of this section pertaining to the waived contaminant along with the monitoring
results. Such a system also must continue to monitor for the non- waived contaminant in accordance with
requirements of paragraph (4)(a) through (4)(d) of this section, as appropriate.

        (iii) Any water system with a full or partial waiver shall notify the Department in writing in
accordance with Section L(1)(c) of any upcoming long-term change in treatment or addition of a new
source, as described in that section. The Department must review and approve the addition of a new source
or long-term change in water treatment before it is implemented by the water system. The Department has
the authority to require the system to add or modify waiver conditions (e.g., require recertification that the
system is free of lead-containing and/or copper-containing materials, require additional round(s) of
monitoring), if it deems such modifications are necessary to address treatment or source water changes at
the system.

        (iv) If a system with a full or partial waiver becomes aware that it is no longer free of lead-
containing or copper-containing materials, as appropriate, (e.g., as a result of new construction or repairs),
the system shall notify the Department in writing no later than sixty (60) days after becoming aware of such
a change.

     (e) Continued eligibility. If the system continues to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (7)(d) of
this section, the waiver will be renewed automatically, unless any of the conditions listed in paragraph
(7)(e)(i) through (7)(e)(iii) of this section occurs. A system whose waiver has been revoked may re-apply
for a waiver at such time as it again meets the appropriate materials and monitoring criteria of paragraphs
(7)(a) and (7)(b) of this section.

       (i) A system with a full waiver or a lead waiver no longer satisfies the materials criteria of
paragraph (7)(a)(i) of this section or has a 90th percentile lead level greater than 0.005 mg/L.

       (ii) A system with a full waiver or a copper waiver no longer satisfies the materials criteria of
paragraph (7)(a)(ii) of this section or has a 90th percentile copper level greater than 0.65 mg/L.

       (iii) The Department notifies the system, in writing, that the waiver has been revoked, setting forth
the basis of its decision.

316 | Regulation 61-58.11
    (f) Requirements following waiver revocation. A system whose full or partial waiver has been
revoked by the Department is subject to the corrosion control treatment and lead and copper tap water
monitoring requirements, as follows:

       (i) If the system exceeds the lead and/or copper action level, the system must implement corrosion
control treatment in accordance with the deadlines specified in Section C(5), and any other applicable
requirements of this subpart.

        (ii) If the system meets both the lead and the copper action level, the system must monitor for lead
and copper at the tap no less frequently than once every three years using the reduced number of sample
sites specified in paragraph (3) of this section.

     (g) Pre-existing waivers. Small system waivers approved by the Department in writing prior to April
11, 2000 shall remain in effect under the following conditions:

         (i) If the system has demonstrated that it is both free of lead-containing and copper-containing
materials, as required by paragraph (7)(a) of this section and that its 90th percentile lead levels and 90th
percentile copper levels meet the criteria of paragraph (7)(b) of this section, the waiver remains in effect so
long as the system continues to meet the waiver eligibility criteria of paragraph (7)(e) of this section. The
first round of tap water monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (7)(d) of this section shall be completed
no later than nine years after the last time the system has monitored for lead and copper at the tap.

        (ii) If the system has met the materials criteria of paragraph (7)(a) of this section but has not met
the monitoring criteria of paragraph (7)(b) of this section, the system shall conduct a round of monitoring
for lead and copper at the tap demonstrating that it meets the criteria of paragraph (7)(b) of this section no
later than September 30, 2000. Thereafter, the waiver shall remain in effect as long as the system meets the
continued eligibility criteria of paragraph (7)(e) of this section. The first round of tap water monitoring
conducted pursuant to paragraph (7)(d) of this section shall be completed no later than nine (9) years after
the round of monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (7)(b) of this section.

I. Monitoring requirements for Water Quality Parameters.

All large water systems, and all small and medium-size systems that exceed the lead or copper action level
shall monitor water quality parameters in addition to lead and copper in accordance with this section. The
requirements of this section are summarized in the table at the end of this section.

  (1) General Requirements

     (a) Sample Collection Methods

         (i) Tap samples shall be representative of water quality throughout the distribution system taking
into account the number of persons served, the different sources of water, the different treatment methods
employed by the system, and seasonal variability. Tap sampling under this section is not required to be
conducted at taps targeted for lead and copper sampling under Section H(1) above. [Note: Systems may
find it convenient to conduct tap sampling for water quality parameters at sites used for coliform sampling
under R.61-58.5(G), Microbiological Contaminant Sampling and Analytical Requirements.]

317 | Regulation 61-58.11
       (ii) Samples collected at the entry point(s) to the distribution system shall be from locations
representative of each source after treatment. If a system draws water from more than one source and the
sources are combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system
during periods of normal operating conditions (i.e., when water is representative of all sources being used).

     (b) Number of Samples

       (i) Systems shall collect two tap samples for applicable water quality parameters during each
monitoring period specified under paragraphs (2) through (5) of this section from the following number of
sites.

                          System Size                                      # Of Sites For
                          (# People Served)                                Water Quality Parameters

                           >100,000                                         25
                           10,001 to 100,000                                10
                           3,301 to 10,000                                  3
                           501 to 3,300                                     2
                           101 to 500                                       1
                           <=100                                            1

        (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (3)(c) of the section, systems shall collect two (2) samples for
each applicable water quality parameter at each entry point to the distribution system during each
monitoring period specified in paragraph (2) of this section. During each monitoring period specified in
paragraphs (3) through (5) of this section, systems shall collect one (1) sample for each applicable water
quality parameter at each entry point to the distribution system .

   (2) Initial Sampling - All large water systems shall measure the applicable water quality parameters as
specified below at taps and at each entry point to the distribution system during each six (6) month
monitoring period specified in Section H(4)(a) above. All small and medium-size systems shall measure
the applicable water quality parameters at the locations specified below during each six (6) month
monitoring period specified in Section (H)(4)(a) during which the system exceeds the lead or copper action
level.

     (a) At taps:

       (i)   pH;

       (ii) Alkalinity;

       (iii) Orthophosphate, when an inhibitor containing a phosphate compound is used;

       (iv) Silica, when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is used;

       (v) Calcium;

       (vi) Conductivity; and,
318 | Regulation 61-58.11
       (vii) Water temperature.

     (b) At each entry point to the distribution system: all of the applicable parameters listed in paragraph
(2)(a) above.

   (3) Monitoring After Installation of Corrosion Control - Any large system which installs optimal
corrosion control treatment pursuant to Section C(4)(d) above, shall measure the water quality parameters
at the locations and frequencies specified below during each six (6) month monitoring period specified in
Section H(4)(b)(i) above. Any small or medium-size system which installs optimal corrosion control
treatment shall conduct such monitoring during each six (6) month monitoring period specified in Section
H(4)(b)(ii) above, in which the system exceeds the lead or copper action level.

     (a) At taps, two samples for:

       (i)   pH;

       (ii) Alkalinity;

       (iii) Orthophosphate, when an inhibitor containing a phosphate compound is used;

       (iv) Silica, when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is used; and,

       (v) Calcium, when calcium carbonate stabilization is used as part of corrosion control.

     (b) Except as provided in paragraph (3)(c) of the section at each entry point to the distribution system,
one (1) sample every two (2) weeks (bi-weekly) for:

       (i)   pH;

       (ii) When alkalinity is adjusted as part of optimal corrosion control, a reading of the dosage rate of
the chemical used to adjust alkalinity, and the alkalinity concentration; and,

        (iii) When a corrosion inhibitor is used as part of optimal corrosion control, a reading of the dosage
rate of the inhibitor used, and the concentration of orthophosphate or silica (whichever is applicable).

      (c) Any ground water system can limit entry point sampling described in paragraph (3)(b) of this
section to those entry points that are representative of water quality and treatment conditions throughout
the system. If water from untreated ground water sources mixes with water from treated ground water
sources, the system must monitor for water quality parameters both at representative entry points receiving
treatment and representative entry points receiving no treatment. Prior to the start of any monitoring under
this paragraph, the system shall provide to the Department written information identifying the selected entry
points and documentation, including information on seasonal variability, sufficient to demonstrate that the
sites are representative of water quality and treatment conditions throughout the system.

  (4) Monitoring After the Department Specifies Water Quality Parameter Values for Optimal Corrosion
Control -- After the Department specifies the values for applicable water quality control parameters

319 | Regulation 61-58.11
reflecting optimal corrosion control treatment under Section D(6) above, all large systems shall measure
the applicable water quality parameters in accordance with paragraph (3) of this section and determine
compliance with the requirements of Section D(7) every six (6) months with the first six (6) month period
to begin on either January 1 or July 1, whichever comes first, after the Department specifies the optimal
values under Section D(6) above. Any small or medium-size system shall conduct such monitoring during
each six (6) month period specified in this paragraph in which the system exceeds the lead or copper action
level. For any such small and medium-size system that is subject to a reduced monitoring frequency
pursuant to Section H(4)(d) at the time of the action level exceedance, the start of the applicable six-month
monitoring period under this paragraph shall coincide with the start of the applicable monitoring period
under Section H(4)(d) above. Compliance with Department-designated optimal water quality parameter
values shall be determined as specified under Section D(7).

  (5) Reduced Monitoring

     (a) Any water system that maintains the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting

     (b) (i) Any water system that maintains the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting
optimal corrosion control treatment specified by the Department under Section D(6) above during three
(3) consecutive years of monitoring may reduce the frequency with which it collects the number of tap
samples for applicable water quality parameters specified in this paragraph (5)(a) of this section from every
six months to annually. This sampling begins during the calendar year immediately following the end of
the monitoring period in which the third consecutive year of six-month monitoring occurs. Any water
system that maintains the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting optimal corrosion
control treatment specified by the Department under D(6) during three (3) consecutive years of annual
monitoring under this paragraph may reduce the frequency with which it collects the number of tap samples
for applicable water quality parameters specified in paragraph (5)(a) of this section from annually to every
three (3) years. This sampling begins no later than the third calendar year following the end of the
monitoring period in which the third consecutive year of monitoring occurs.

        (ii) A water system may reduce the frequency with which it collects tap samples for applicable water
quality parameters specified in paragraph (5)(a) of this section to every three (3) years if it demonstrates
during two (2) consecutive monitoring periods that its tap water lead level at the 90th percentile is less than
or equal to the PQL for lead specified in Section K(1)(a)(ii) above, that its tap water copper level at the 90th
320 | Regulation 61-58.11
percentile is less than or equal to 0.65 mg/L for copper in Section B(1)(b) above, and that it also has
maintained the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting optimal corrosion control
treatment specified by the Department under Section D(6) above. Monitoring conducted every three (3)
years shall be done no later than every third calendar year.

     (c) A water system that conducts sampling annually shall collect these samples evenly throughout
the year so as to reflect seasonal variability.

      (d) Any water system subject to reduced monitoring frequency that fails to operate at or above the
minimum value or within the range of values for the water quality parameters specified by the Department
under Section D(6) above, for more than nine (9) days in any six (6) month period specified in Section D(7)
above, shall resume distribution system tap water sampling in accordance with the number and frequency
requirements in paragraph (4) of this section. Such a system may resume annual monitoring for water
quality parameters at the tap at the reduced number of sites specified in paragraph (5)(a) of this section after
it has completed two (2) subsequent consecutive six (6) month rounds of monitoring that meet the criteria
of that paragraph and/or may resume triennial monitoring for water quality parameters at the tap at the
reduced number of sites after it demonstrates through subsequent rounds of monitoring that it meets the
criteria of either paragraph (5)(b)(i) or (5)(b)(ii) of this section.

  (6) Additional Monitoring by Systems - The results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the
minimum requirements of this section shall be considered by the system and the Department in making any
determinations (i.e., determining concentrations of water quality parameters) under this section or Section
D above.

 quality parameters at the tap if they have maintained 90th percentile lead levels less than or equal to 0.005 mg/L, 90th
 percentile copper levels less than or equal to 0.65 mg/L, and the range of water quality parameters designated by the
 Department under Section D(5) above, as representing optimal corrosion control during two consecutive six-month
 monitoring periods.

J. Monitoring Requirements for Lead and Copper in Source Water.

     (1) Sample Location, Collection Methods, and Number of Samples

     (a) A water system that fails to meet the lead or copper action level on the basis of tap samples
collected in accordance with Section H above, shall collect lead and copper source water samples in
accordance with the requirements regarding sample location, number of samples, and collection methods.

        (i) Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one (1) sample at every entry point to the
distribution system which is representative of each well after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point).
The system shall take one (1) sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling
point more representative of each source or treatment plant.

        (ii) Surface water systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the
distribution system after any application of treatment or in the distribution system at a point which is
representative of each source after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). The system shall take each


322 | Regulation 61-58.11
sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of
each source or treatment plant.

NOTE: For the purposes of this paragraph, surface water systems include systems with a combination of
surface and ground sources.

        (iii) if a system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before
distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal
operating conditions (i.e., when water is representative of all sources being used).

        (iv) The Department may reduce the total number of samples which must be analyzed by allowing
the use of compositing. Compositing of samples must be done by certified laboratory personnel. Composite
samples from a maximum of five (5) samples are allowed, provided that if the lead concentration in the
composite sample is greater than or equal to 0.001 mg/L or the copper concentration is greater than or equal
to 0.160 mg/L, then either:

          (A) A follow-up sample shall be taken and analyzed within fourteen (14) days at each sampling
point included in the composite; or

          (B) If duplicates of or sufficient quantities from the original samples from each sampling point
used in the composite are available, the system may use these instead of resampling.

     (b) Where the results of sampling indicate an exceedance of maximum permissible source water
levels established under Section E(2)(d) above, the Department may require that one additional sample be
collected as soon as possible after the initial sample was taken (but not to exceed two weeks) at the same
sampling point. If a Department- required confirmation sample is taken for lead or copper, then the results
of the initial and confirmation sample shall be averaged in determining compliance with the Department-
specified maximum permissible levels. Any sample value below the detection limit shall be considered to
be zero. Any value above the detection limit but below the PQL shall either be considered as the measured
value or be considered one-half the PQL.

   (2) Monitoring Frequency After System Exceeds Tap Water Action Level -- Any system which exceeds
the lead or copper action level at the tap shall collect one source water sample from each entry point to the
distribution system no later than six (6) months after the end of the monitoring period during which the lead
or copper action level was exceeded. For monitoring periods that are annual or less frequent, the end of the
monitoring period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs, or if the Department
has established an alternate monitoring period, the last day of that period.

   (3) Monitoring Frequency After Installation of Source Water Treatment - Any system which installs
source water treatment pursuant to Section E(1)(c) above, shall collect an additional source water sample
from each entry point to the distribution system during two consecutive six (6) month monitoring periods
by the deadline specified in Section E(1)(d) above.

  (4) Monitoring frequency after Department specifies maximum permissible source water levels or
determines that source water treatment is not needed.



323 | Regulation 61-58.11
     (a) A system shall monitor at the frequency specified below in cases where the Department specifies
maximum permissible source water levels under Section E(2)(d) above, or determines that the system is
not required to install source water treatment under Section E(2)(b) above.

       (i) A water system using only groundwater shall collect samples once during the three (3) year
compliance period (as that term is defined in R.61-58.B, Definitions) in effect when the applicable
Department determination under paragraph (4)(a) of this section is made. Such systems shall collect
samples once during each subsequent compliance period. Triennial samples shall be collected every third
calendar year.

       (ii) A water system using surface water (or a combination of surface and groundwater) shall collect
samples once during each calendar year, the first annual monitoring period to begin during the year in which
the applicable Department determination is made under paragraph (4)(a) of this section.

    (b) A system is not required to conduct source water sampling for lead and/or copper if the system
meets the action level for the specific contaminant in tap water samples during the entire source water
sampling period applicable to the system under paragraph (4)(a)(i) or (ii) of this section.

  (5) Reduced Monitoring Frequency

     (a) A water system using only ground water may reduce the monitoring frequency for lead and copper
in source water to once during each nine-year compliance cycle (as that term is defined in R.61-58.B,
Definitions) provided that the samples are collected no later than every ninth calendar year and if the
systems meets one of the following criteria:

        (i) The system demonstrates that finished drinking water entering the distribution system has been
maintained below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the Department
in Section E(2)(d) above, during at least three consecutive compliance periods under paragraph (4)(a) of
this section; or

       (ii) The Department has determined that source water treatment is not needed and the system
demonstrates that, during at least three consecutive compliance periods in which sampling was conducted
under paragraph (4)(a) of this section, the concentration of lead in source water was less than or equal to
0.005 mg/L and the concentration of copper in source water was less than or equal to 0.65 mg/L.

     (b) A water system using surface water (or a combination of surface and ground waters) may reduce
the monitoring frequency in paragraph (4)(a) of this section to once during each nine-year compliance cycle
(as that term is defined in R.61-58.B, Definitions) provided that the samples are collected no later than
every ninth calendar year and if the system meets one of the following criteria:

        (i) The system demonstrates that finished drinking water entering the distribution system has been
maintained below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the Department
in Section E(2)(d) above, for at least three (3) consecutive years; or

        (ii) The Department has determined that source water treatment is not needed and the system
demonstrates that, during at least three (3) consecutive years, the concentration of lead in source water was
less than or equal to 0.005 mg/L and the concentration of copper in source water was less than or equal to

324 | Regulation 61-58.11
0.65 mg/L.

    (c) A water system that uses a new source of water is not eligible for reduced monitoring for lead
and/or copper until concentrations in samples collected from the new source during three consecutive
monitoring periods are below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the
Department in Section E(1)(e) above.

K. Analytical Methods.

  (1) Analyses for lead, copper, pH, conductivity, calcium, alkalinity, orthophosphate, silica, and
temperature shall be conducted using EPA approved methods and other requirements listed in 40 CFR
141.89.

    (a) Analyses under this section shall only be conducted by laboratories that are certified by the
Department.

     (b) The Department has the authority to allow the use of previously collected monitoring data for
purposes of monitoring, if the data were collected and analyzed in accordance with the requirements of this
section.

    (c) All lead and copper levels measured between the PQL and the MDL must be either reported as
measured or they can be reported as one half the PQL specified for lead and copper in paragraph (1)(d)
below. All levels below the lead and copper MDL must be reported as zero.

    (d) The Practical Quantitation Level, or PQL for lead is 0.005 mg/L. The Practical Quantitation
Level, or PQL for copper is 0.050 mg/L.

L. Reporting Requirements.

  All water systems shall report all of the following information to the Department in accordance with this
section.

 (1) Reporting requirements for tap water monitoring for lead and copper and for water quality parameter
monitoring.

     (a) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(a)(viii) of this section a water system shall report the
information specified below for all tap water samples specified in Section H and for all water quality
parameter samples specified in Section I within the first 10 days following the end of each applicable
monitoring period specified in Sections H, and I above (i.e., every six (6) months, annually, every three (3)
years, or every nine (9) years). For monitoring periods with a duration less than six (6) months, the end of
the monitoring period is the last date samples can be collected during that period as specified in section H
and I.

        (i) The results of all tap samples for lead and copper including the location of each site and the
criteria under Section H(1)(c), (d), (e), (f), and/or (g) above, under which the site was selected for the
system's sampling pool;


325 | Regulation 61-58.11
       (ii) Documentation for each tap water lead or copper sample for which the water system requests
invalidation pursuant to Section H(5)(b) above;

        (iii) The 90th percentile lead and copper concentrations measured from among all lead and copper
tap water samples collected during each monitoring period (calculated in accordance with Section B.3(c)
above) unless the Department calculates the system's 90th percentile lead and copper levels under paragraph
(8) of this section;

       (iv) With the exception of initial tap sampling conducted pursuant to Section H(4)(a) above, the
system shall designate any site which was not sampled during previous monitoring periods, and include an
explanation of why sampling sites have changed;

      (v) The results of all tap samples for pH, and where applicable, alkalinity, calcium, conductivity,
temperature, and orthophosphate or silica collected under Section I(2) through (5) above; and,

       (vi) The results of all samples collected at the entry point(s) to the distribution system for applicable
water quality parameters under Section I(2) through (5) above.

        (vii) A water system shall report the results of all water quality parameter samples collected under
Section I(3) - (6) above, during each six-month monitoring period specified in Section I(4) above, within
the first 10 days following the end of the monitoring period unless the Department has specified a more
frequent reporting requirement.

      (b) For a non-transient non-community water system, or a community water system meeting the
criteria of Section G(2)(g) above, that does not have enough taps that can provide first-draw samples, the
system must either:

        (i) Provide written documentation to the Department identifying standing times and locations for
enough non-first-draw samples to make up its sampling pool under Section H(2)(e) above, by the start of
the first applicable monitoring period under Section H(4) above, that commences after April 11, 2000,
unless the Department has waived prior Department approval of non-first-draw sample sites selected by the
system pursuant to Section H(2)(e) above; or

       (ii) If the Department has waived prior approval of non-first-draw sample sites selected by the
system, identify, in writing, each site that did not meet the six-hour minimum standing time and the length
of standing time for that particular substitute sample collected pursuant to Section H(2)(e) above, and
include this information with the lead and copper tap sample results required to be submitted pursuant to
paragraph (1)(a)(i) of this section.

     (c) At a time specified by the Department, or if no specific time is designated by the Department,
then as early as possible prior to the addition of a new source or any long-term change in water treatment,
a water system deemed to have optimized corrosion control under Section C(2)(c), a water system subject
to reduced monitoring pursuant to Section H(4)(d), or a water system subject to a monitoring waiver
pursuant to Section H(7), shall submit written documentation to the Department describing the change or
addition. The Department must review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in
treatment before it is implemented by the water system. Examples of long-term treatment changes include
the addition of a new treatment process or modification of an existing treatment process. Examples of

326 | Regulation 61-58.11
modifications include switching secondary disinfectants, switching coagulants (e.g., alum to ferric
chloride), and switching corrosion inhibitor products (e.g., orthophosphate to blended phosphate). Long-
term changes can include dose changes to existing chemicals if the system is planning long-term changes
to its finished water pH or residual inhibitor concentration. Long-term treatment changes would not include
chemical dose fluctuations associated with daily raw water quality changes.

    (d) Any small system applying for a monitoring waiver under Section H(7) above, or subject to a
waiver granted pursuant to Section H(7)(c) above, shall provide the following information to the
Department in writing by the specified deadline:

       (i) By the start of the first applicable monitoring period in Section H(4) above, any small water
system applying for a monitoring waiver shall provide the documentation required to demonstrate that it
meets the waiver criteria of Section H(7)(a) and (b) above.

        (ii) No later than nine years after the monitoring previously conducted pursuant to Section H (7)(b)
or (d)(i) above, each small system desiring to maintain its monitoring waiver shall provide the information
required by Section H(7)(d)(i) and (ii) above.

       (iii) No later than 60 days after it becomes aware that it is no longer free of lead-containing and/or
copper-containing material, as appropriate, each small system with a monitoring waiver shall provide
written notification to the Department, setting forth the circumstances resulting in the lead-containing
and/or copper-containing materials being introduced into the system and what corrective action, if any, the
system plans to remove these materials.

     (iv) By October 10, 2000, any small system with a waiver granted prior to April 11, 2000 and that has
not previously met the requirements of Section H(7)(b) above, shall provide the information required by
that paragraph.

     (e) Each ground water system that limits water quality parameter monitoring to a subset of entry
points under Section I(3)(c) above, shall provide, by the commencement of such monitoring, written
correspondence to the Department that identifies the selected entry points and includes information
sufficient to demonstrate that the sites are representative of water quality and treatment conditions
throughout the system.

  (2) Source Water Monitoring Reporting Requirements

     (a) A water system shall report the sampling results for all source water samples collected in
accordance with Section J above within the first 10 days following the end of each source water monitoring
period (i.e., annually, per compliance period, per compliance cycle) specified in Section J above.

     (b) With the exception of the first round of source water sampling conducted pursuant to Section J(2)
above, the system shall specify any site which was not sampled during previous monitoring periods, and
include an explanation of why the sampling point has changed.

     (c) If the system has performed additional monitoring which indicates the presence of other
contaminants in the finished water, the Department strongly encourages systems to report any results which
may indicate a health concern. To determine if results may indicate a health concern, the Department
recommends that systems find out if EPA has proposed an NPDWR or issued a health advisory for that
contaminant by calling the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791). EPA and the Department
considers detects above a proposed MCL or health advisory level to indicate possible health concerns. For
such contaminants, EPA and the Department recommends that the report include:

       (i)   The results of the monitoring; and

exemption.

  (11) Additional information:

     (a) The report shall contain a brief explanation regarding contaminants which may reasonably be
expected to be found in drinking water including bottled water. This explanation may include the language
of paragraphs (i) through (iii) below or systems may use their own comparable language. The report also
shall include the language of paragraph (iv) below:

        (i) “The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams,
ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it
dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances
resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.”

       (ii) “Contaminants that may be present in source water include:

          (A) Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage
treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.

         (B) Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result
from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production,
mining, or farming.

          (C) Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture,
urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.

          (D) Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which
are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations,
urban stormwater runoff, and septic systems.


337 | Regulation 61-58.12
         (E) Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and gas
production and mining activities.”

        (iii) “In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA and the Department prescribe regulations
which limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. FDA regulations
establish limits for contaminants in bottled water which shall provide the same protection for public health.”

        (iv) “Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small
amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses
a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling
the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).”

   (b) The report shall include the telephone number of the owner, operator, or designee of the
community water system as a source of additional information concerning the report.

     (c) In communities with a large proportion of non-English speaking residents, as determined by the
Department, the report shall contain information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance
of the report or contain a telephone number or address where such residents may contact the system to
obtain a translated copy of the report or assistance in the appropriate language.

    (d) The report shall include information (e.g., time and place of regularly scheduled board meetings)
about opportunities for public participation in decisions that may affect the quality of the water.

    (e) The systems may include such additional information as they deem necessary for public education
consistent with, and not detracting from, the purpose of the report.

     (f) Systems required to comply with R.61-58.16.

        (i) Any ground water system that receives notice from the Department of a significant deficiency
or notice from a laboratory of a fecal indicator positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated
by the Department must inform its customers of any significant deficiency that is uncorrected at the time
of the next report or of any fecal indicator positive ground water source sample in the next report. The
system must continue to inform the public annually until the Department determines that particular
significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal contamination in the ground water source is addressed under
R.61 58.16.F(1). Each report must include the following elements.

           (A) The nature of the particular significant deficiency or the source of the fecal contamination
(if the source is known) and the date the significant deficiency was identified by the Department or the
dates of the fecal indicator positive ground water source samples.

         (B) If the fecal contamination in the ground water source has been addressed under R.61
58.16.F(1) and the date of such action.

          (C) For each significant deficiency or fecal contamination in the ground water source that has
not been addressed under R.61-58.16.F(1), the Department approved plan and schedule for correction,
including interim measures, progress to date, and any interim measures completed; and

          (D) If the system receives notice of a fecal indicator positive ground water source sample that is
not invalidated by the Department, the potential health effects using the health effects language of Appendix
D of R.61 58.12.

       (ii) If directed by the Department, a system with significant deficiencies that have been corrected
before the next report is issued must inform its customers of the significant deficiency, how the deficiency
was corrected, and the date of correction.

     (g) Systems required to comply with R.61-58.17:

       (i) Any system required to comply with the Level 1 assessment requirement or a Level 2
assessment requirement that is not due to an E. coli MCL violation must include in the report the text found
in paragraph R.61-58.12.C(11)(g)(i)(A) and paragraphs R.61-58.12.C(11)(g)(i)(B) and R.61-
58.12.C(11)(g)(i)(C) as appropriate, filling in the blanks accordingly and the text found in paragraphs R.61-
58.12.C(11)(g)(i)(D)(1) and R.61-58.12.C(11)(g)(i)(D)(2) if appropriate.

           (A) Coliforms are bacteria that are naturally present in the environment and are used as an
indicator that other, potentially harmful, waterborne pathogens may be present or that a potential pathway
exists through which contamination may enter the drinking water distribution system. We found coliforms
indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we
are required to conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found
during these assessments.

         (B) During the past year we were required to conduct [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 1
ASSESSMENTS] Level 1 assessment(s). [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 1 ASSESSMENTS] Level 1
assessment(s) were completed. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE
ACTIONS] of these actions.

         (C) During the past year [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 2 ASSESSMENTS] Level 2
assessments were required to be completed for our water system. [INSERT NUMBER OF LEVEL 2
ASSESSMENTS] Level 2 assessments were completed. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT
NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.

          (D) Any system that has failed to complete all the required assessments or correct all identified
sanitary defects, is in violation of the treatment technique requirement and must also include one or both of
the following statements, as appropriate:

              (1) During the past year we failed to conduct all of the required assessment(s).

              (2) During the past year we failed to correct all identified defects that were found during the
assessment.

       (ii) Any system required to conduct a Level 2 assessment due to an E. coli MCL violation must
include in the report the text found in paragraphs R.61- 58.12.C(11)(g)(ii)(A) and R.61-58.12.C(11)(g)(ii)


339 | Regulation 61-58.12
(B), filling in the blanks accordingly and the text found in paragraphs R.61-58.12.C(11)(g)(ii)(C)(1) and
R.61-58.12.C(11)(g)(ii)(C)(2), if appropriate.

          (A) E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human
or animal wastes. Human pathogens in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps,
nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a greater health risk for infants, young children, the
elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems. We found E. coli bacteria, indicating the
need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we are required to
conduct assessment(s) to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found during these
assessments.

          (B) We were required to complete a Level 2 assessment because we found E. coli in our water
system. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS]
corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.

          (C) Any system that has failed to complete the required assessment or correct all identified
sanitary defects is in violation of the treatment technique requirement and must also include one or both of
the following statements, as appropriate:

             (1) We failed to conduct the required assessment.

             (2) We failed to correct all sanitary defects that were identified during the assessment that we
conducted.

       (iii) If a system detects E. coli and has violated the E. coli MCL, in addition to completing the table
as required in R.61-58.12.C(4)(d), the system must include one or more of the following statements to
describe any noncompliance, as applicable:

          (A) We had an E. coli-positive repeat sample following a total coliform-positive routine sample.

          (B) We had a total coliform-positive repeat sample following an E. coli-positive routine sample.

          (C) We failed to take all required repeat samples following an E. coli-positive routine sample.

          (D) We failed to test for E. coli when any repeat sample tests positive for total coliform.

        (iv) If a system detects E. coli and has not violated the E. coli MCL, in addition to completing the
table as required in paragraph R.61-58.12.C(4)(d), the system may include a statement that explains that
although they have detected E. coli, they are not in violation of the E. coli MCL.

D. Required Additional Health Information.

   (1) All reports shall prominently display the following language: “Some people may be more vulnerable
to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as
persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with
HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from
infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers.

340 | Regulation 61-58.12
EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other
microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).”

  (2) Ending in the report due by July 1, 2001, a system which detects arsenic at levels above 0.25 mg/L,
but below the 0.05 mg/L, and beginning in the report due by July 1, 2002, a system that detects arsenic
above 0.005 mg/L and up to and including 0.01 mg/L:

     (a) Shall include in its report a short informational statement about arsenic, using language such as:
While your drinking water meets State and Federal standards for arsenic, it does contain low levels of
arsenic. The Federal standard balances the current understanding of arsenic's possible health effects against
the cost of removing arsenic from drinking water. EPA continues to research health effects of low levels of
arsenic, which is a mineral known to cause cancer in humans at high concentrations and is linked to other
health effects such as skin damage and circulatory problems.

     (b) May write its own educational statement, but only in consultation with the Department.

  (3) A system which detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/L, but below the MCL:

     (a) Shall include a short informational statement about the impacts of nitrate on children using
language such as: Nitrate in drinking water at levels above 10 ppm is a health risk for infants of less than
six months of age. High nitrate levels in drinking water can cause blue baby syndrome. Nitrate levels may
rise quickly for short periods of time because of rainfall or agricultural activity. If you are caring for an
infant you should ask advice from your health care provider.

     (b) May write its own educational statement, but only in consultation with the Department.

  (4) Every report must include the following lead-specific information:

     (a) A short informational statement about lead in drinking water and its effect on children. The
statement must include the following information: If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health
problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from
materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. [NAME OF UTILITY] is
responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in
plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential
for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using water for drinking or
cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information
on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from
the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or http://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.

     (b) A system may write its own educational statement, but only in consultation with the Department.

   (5) Community water systems that detect TTHM above 0.080 mg/L, but below the MCL in R.61-58.5.L,
as an annual average, monitored and calculated under the provisions of R.61-58.5.M, must include health
effects language prescribed by of Appendix D to of this regulation.




341 | Regulation 61-58.12
   (6) Beginning in the report due by July 1, 2002 and ending January 22, 2006, a community water system
that detects arsenic above 0.01 mg/L and up to and including 0.05 mg/L must include the arsenic health
effects language prescribed by Appendix D to this regulation.

E. Report Delivery and Recordkeeping.

   (1) Except as provided in paragraph (7) below, each community water system shall mail or otherwise
directly deliver one copy of the report to each customer.

   (2) The system shall make a good faith effort to reach consumers who do not get water bills, using
means recommended by the Department. The Department expects that an adequate good faith effort will
be tailored to the consumers who are served by the system but are not bill-paying customers, such as renters
or workers. A good faith effort to reach consumers would include a mix of methods appropriate to the
particular system such as: Posting the reports on the Internet; mailing to postal patrons in metropolitan
areas; advertising the availability of the report in the news media; publication in a local newspaper; posting
in public places such as cafeterias or lunch rooms of public buildings; delivery of multiple copies for
distribution by single-billed customers such as apartment buildings or large private employers; delivery to
community organizations.

  (3) No later than the date the system is required to distribute the report to its customers, each community
water system shall mail a copy of the report to the Department, followed within 3 months by a certification
that the report has been distributed to customers, and that the information is correct and consistent with the
compliance monitoring data either provided by or submitted to the Department.

  (4) No later than the date the system is required to distribute the report to its customers, each community
water system shall deliver the report to any other agency or clearinghouse identified by the Department.

  (5) Each community water system shall make its reports available to the public upon request.

   (6) Each community water system serving 100,000 or more persons shall post its current year's report
to a publicly-accessible site on the Internet.

  (7) The Department can waive the requirement of paragraph (1) of this section for community water
systems serving fewer than 10,000 persons.

     (a) Such systems shall:

       (i)   Publish the reports in one or more local newspapers serving the area in which the system is
located;

        (ii) Inform the customers that the reports will not be mailed, either in the newspapers in which the
reports are published or by other means approved by the Department; and

       (iii) Make the reports available to the public upon request.




342 | Regulation 61-58.12
      (b) Systems serving 500 or fewer persons may forego the requirements of paragraphs (7)(a)(i) above,
if they provide notice at least once per year to their customers by mail, door-to-door delivery or by posting
in an appropriate location that the report is available upon request.

   (8) Any system subject to this regulation shall retain copies of its Consumer Confidence Report for no
less than three (3) years.

for determining the minimum number of TTHM and HAA5 samples required, with Department approval
in accordance with criteria developed by the Department and agreed to by the Administrator

     (c) Failure to monitor in accordance with the monitoring plan required under paragraph (6) of this
section is a monitoring violation.



345 | Regulation 61-58.13
     (d) Failure to monitor will be treated as a violation for the entire period covered by the annual average
where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and
the system's failure to monitor makes it impossible to determine compliance with MCLs or MRDLs.

    (e) Systems may use only data collected under the provisions of this regulation to qualify for reduced
monitoring.

  (2) Monitoring Requirements for Disinfection Byproducts.

     (a) TTHMs and HAA5 - At least twenty-five (25) percent of all samples collected each quarter shall
be at locations representing maximum residence time in the distribution system. Remaining samples shall
be collected from locations representative of at least average residence time in the distribution systems and
representing the entire distribution system, taking into account number of persons served, different sources
of water and different treatment methods. The minimum number of samples required shall be determined
based on the source of supply and the populations served by a public water system.

       (i) CWSs and NTNCWSs that use a surface water source or a ground water source under the
influence of surface water which serve 10,000 or more persons must collect samples as follows:

in accordance with paragraph (2)(a) of this section.

          (B) Reduced Monitoring - If the system has a source water annual average TOC level, before
any treatment, less than 4.0 mg/L and a TTHM annual average less than 0.040 mg/L and HAA5 annual
average less than 0.030 mg/L, then the minimum number of samples required may be reduced to one (1)
sample per treatment plant per quarter at a distribution system location reflecting maximum residence time.

          (C) Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as
the average of all samples taken in the year (for systems which must monitor quarterly) or the result of the
sample (for systems which must monitor no more frequently than annually) is no more than 0.060 mg/L
and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and HAA5, respectively. Systems that do not meet these levels must resume
monitoring at the frequency identified in paragraph (2)(a)(i)(A) of this section in the quarter immediately
following the monitoring period in which the system exceeds 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and
HAA5, respectively.

          (D) The system may be returned to routine monitoring at any time at the Department's discretion.

       (ii) CWSs and NTNCWSs that use a surface water source or a ground water source under the
influence of surface water which serve from 500 to 9,999 persons must collect samples as follows:

          (A) Routine Monitoring - A minimum of one (1) water sample per treatment plant per quarter at
a location representing maximum residence time in the distribution system.

          (B) Reduced Monitoring - If the system has a source water annual average TOC level, before

sample per treatment plant per year during a month of warmest water temperature at a distribution system
location reflecting maximum residence time.

          (C) Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as
the average of all samples taken in the year (for systems which must monitor quarterly) or the result of the
sample (for systems which must monitor no more frequently than annually) is no more than 0.060 mg/L
and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and HAA5, respectively. Systems that do not meet these levels must resume
monitoring at the frequency identified in paragraph (2)(a)(ii)(A) of this section in the quarter immediately
following the monitoring period in which the system exceeds 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and
HAA5, respectively.

         (D) The system may be returned to routine monitoring at any time at the Department's discretion.

       (iii) CWSs and NTNCWSs that use a surface water source or a ground water source under the
influence of surface water which serve less than 500 persons must collect samples as follows:

         (A) Routine Monitoring - A minimum of one water sample per treatment plant per year during a
month of warmest water temperature at a location representing maximum residence time in the distribution
system.

         (B) Reduced Monitoring - There is no reduced monitoring allowed for these systems

taken) exceeds the MCL, the system must increase monitoring to one sample per treatment plant per quarter,
taken at a point reflecting the maximum residence time in the distribution system, until the system meets
criteria in paragraph (2)(a)(iii)(D) of this section.

          (D) Systems on increased monitoring may return to routine monitoring if, after at least one year
of monitoring their TTHM annual average is less than or equal to 0.060 mg/L and their HAA5 annual
average is less than or equal to 0.045 mg/L.

       (iv) CWSs and NTNCWSs that use only ground water not under the influence of surface water
which serve 10,000 or more persons and use a chemical disinfectant must collect samples as follows:

          (A) Routine Monitoring - A minimum of one water sample per treatment plant per quarter at a
location representing maximum residence time in the distribution system.

           (B) Reduced Monitoring - If the system has a TTHM annual average less than 0.040 mg/L and
HAA5 annual average less than 0.030 mg/L, then the minimum number of samples required may be reduced
to one (1) sample per treatment plant per year during a month of warmest water temperature at a distribution
system location reflecting maximum residence time.

          (C) Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as

347 | Regulation 61-58.13
following the monitoring period in which the system exceeds 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and
HAA5, respectively.

         (D) The system may be returned to routine monitoring at any time at the Department's discretion.

       (v) CWSs and NTNCWSs that use only ground water not under the influence of surface water
which serve less than 10,000 persons and use a chemical disinfectant must collect samples as follows:

           (A) Routine Monitoring - A minimum of one (1) water sample per treatment plant per year during
a month of warmest water temperature at a location representing maximum residence time in the
distribution system.

           (B) Increased Monitoring - If the sample taken, or average of annual samples if more than one
(1) sample is taken, exceeds the MCL, the system must increase monitoring to one sample per treatment
plant per quarter, taken at a location representing the maximum residence time in the distribution system,
until the system meets the criteria in paragraph (2)(a)(v)(F) of this section for reduced monitoring.

         (C) Reduced Monitoring - If the system has a TTHM annual average less than 0.040 mg/L and
HAA5 annual average less than 0.030 mg/L for two (2) consecutive years, or a TTHM annual average less
than 0.020 mg/L and HAA5 annual average less than 0.015 mg/L for one (1) year, then the minimum
number of samples required may be reduced to one sample per treatment plant per three (3) year cycle taken
during a month of warmest water temperature at a distribution system location reflecting maximum
residence time, with the three (3) year cycle beginning on January 1 following the quarter in which the
system qualifies for reduced monitoring.

          (D) Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as
the average of all samples taken in the year is no more than 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and
HAA5, respectively. Systems that do not meet these levels must resume monitoring at the frequency
identified in paragraph (v)(A) of this section in the quarter immediately following the monitoring period in
which the system exceeds 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and HAA5, respectively. If either the
TTHM annual average is greater than 0.080 mg/L or the HAA5 annual average is greater than 0.060 mg/L,
the system must go to the increased monitoring identified in paragraph (v)(B) of this section in the quarter
immediately following the monitoring period in which the system exceeds the 0.080 mg/L or 0.060 mg/L
for TTHMs or HAA5 respectively.

         (E) The system may be returned to routine monitoring at any time at the Department's discretion.

          (F) Systems on increased monitoring may return to routine monitoring if, after at least one (1)
year of monitoring their TTHM annual average is less than or equal to 0.060 mg/L and their HAA5 annual
average is less than or equal to 0.045 mg/L.

       (vi) Monitoring requirements for source water TOC.

   In order to qualify for reduced monitoring for TTHM and HAA5 under paragraph C(2)(a)(i)(B) or
C(2)(a)(ii)(B) of this section, Subpart H systems not monitoring under the provisions of paragraph C(4) of
this section must take monthly TOC samples every 30 days at a location prior to any treatment, beginning
April 1, 2008 or earlier, if specified by the Department. In addition to meeting other criteria for reduced

348 | Regulation 61-58.13
monitoring in paragraph C(2)(a)(i)(B) or C(2)(a)(ii)(B) of this section, the source water TOC running
annual average must be less than or equal to 4.0 mg/L (based on the most recent four quarters of monitoring)
on a continuing basis at each treatment plant to reduce or remain on reduced monitoring for TTHM and
HAA5. Once qualified for reduced monitoring for TTHM and HAA5 under paragraph C(2)(a)(i)(B) or
C(2)(a)(ii)(B) of this section, a system may reduce source water TOC monitoring to quarterly TOC samples
taken every 90 days at a location prior to any treatment.

     (b) Chlorite. Community and non-transient, non-community water systems using chlorine dioxide,
for disinfection or oxidation, must conduct monitoring for chlorite.

       (i)   Routine Monitoring.

           (A) Daily monitoring. Systems must take daily samples at the entrance to the distribution system.
For any daily sample that exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system must take additional samples in the
distribution system the following day at the locations required by R.61- 58.13.C(2)(b)(ii) in addition to the
sample required at the entrance to the distribution system.

           (B) Monthly monitoring. Systems must take a three-sample set each month in the distribution
system. The system must take one sample at each of the following locations: near the first customer, at a
location representative of average residence time, and at a location reflecting the maximum residence time
in the distribution system. Any additional routine sampling must be conducted in the same manner (as three-
sample sets, at the specified locations). The system may use the results of additional monitoring conducted
under R.61-58.13.C(2)(b)(ii) to meet the requirement for this monitoring.

        (ii) Additional monitoring. On each day following a routine sample monitoring result that exceeds
the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system, the system is required to take three chlorite
distribution system samples at the following locations: as close to the first customer as possible, in a location
representative of average residence time, and as close to the end of the distribution system as possible
(reflecting maximum residence time in the distribution system).

       (iii) Reduced monitoring.

         (A) Chlorite monitoring at the entrance to the distribution system required by R.61-
58.13.C(2)(b)(i)(A) may not be reduced.

           (B) Chlorite monitoring in the distribution system required by R.61- 58.13.C(2)(b)(i)(B) may be
reduced to one three-sample set per quarter after one year of monitoring where no individual chlorite sample
taken in the distribution system under R.61-58.13.C(2)(b)(i)(B) has exceeded the chlorite MCL and the
system has not been required to conduct monitoring under R.61-58.13.C(2)(b)(ii). The system may remain
on the reduced monitoring schedule until either of the three individual chlorite samples taken quarterly in
the distribution system under R.61- 58.13.C(2)(b)(i)(B) exceeds the chlorite MCL or the system is required
to conduct monitoring under R.61-58.13.C(2)(b)(ii), at which time, the system must revert to routine
monitoring.

     (c) Bromate



349 | Regulation 61-58.13
       (i) Routine monitoring. Community and non-transient, non-community systems using ozone, for
disinfection or oxidation, must take one sample per month for each treatment plant in the system using
ozone. Systems must take samples monthly at the entrance to the distribution system while the ozonation
system is operating under normal conditions.

       (ii) Reduced Monitoring

           (A) Until March 31, 2009, Systems required to analyze for bromate may reduce monitoring from
monthly to once per quarter, if the system demonstrates that the average source water bromide concentration
is less than 0.05 mg/L based upon representative monthly bromide measurements for one year. The system
may remain on reduced bromate monitoring until the running annual average source water bromide
concentration, computed quarterly, is equal to or greater than 0.05 mg/L based upon representative monthly
measurements. If the running annual average source water bromide concentration is greater than or equal
to 0.05 mg/L, the system must resume routine monitoring required by R.61- 58.13.C(2)(c)(i).

          (B) Beginning April 1, 2009, systems may no longer use the provisions of R.61-58.C(2)(c)(ii)(A)
to qualify for reduced monitoring. A system required to analyze for bromate may reduce monitoring from
monthly to quarterly, if the system's running annual average bromate concentration is less than or equal to
0.0025 mg/L based on monthly bromate measurements under R.61-58.13.C(2)(c)(i) for the most recent four
quarters, with samples analyzed using analytical methods identified in 40 CFR 141.132 (b)(3)(ii)(B) (1-04-
06 edition). If a system has qualified for reduced bromate monitoring under R.61-58.13.C(2)(c)(ii)(A), that
system may remain on reduced monitoring as long as the running annual average of quarterly bromate
samples is less than or equal to 0.0025 mg/L based on samples analyzed using analytical methods identified
in 40 CFR 141.132(b)(3)(ii)(B) (1-04-06 edition). If the running annual average bromate concentration is
greater than 0.0025 mg/L, the system must resume routine monitoring required by R.61-58.13.C(2)(c)(i).

  (3) Monitoring requirements for disinfectant residuals.

    (a) Chlorine and Chloramines.

        (i) Routine Monitoring Until March 31, 2016, community and non-transient non community water
systems that use chlorine or chloramines must measure the residual disinfectant level in the distribution
system at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as
specified in R.61 58.5.G. Beginning April 1, 2016, community and non-transient non-community water
systems that use chlorine or chloramines must measure the residual disinfectant level in the distribution
system at the same point in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as
specified in R.61-58.17.E through R.61-68.17.I. Systems that use a surface water source or a ground water
source under the influence of surface water may use the results of residual disinfectant concentration
sampling conducted under R.61 58.10.F(2)(f) for unfiltered systems or R.61 58.10.F(3)(c) for systems
which filter, in lieu of taking separate samples.

       (ii) Reduced Monitoring - Monitoring may not be reduced.

    (b) Chlorine Dioxide.

       (i) Routine Monitoring - CWSs, NTNCWSs, and TNCWSs that use chlorine dioxide for
disinfection or oxidation must take daily samples at the entrance to the distribution system. For any daily

350 | Regulation 61-58.13
sample that exceeds the MRDL, the system must take samples in the distribution system the following day
at the locations required by paragraph (3)(b)(ii) of this section, in addition to the sample required at the
entrance to the distribution system.

        (ii) Additional Monitoring - On each day following a routine sample monitoring result that exceeds
the MRDL, the system is required to take three chlorine dioxide distribution system samples. If chlorine
dioxide or chloramines are used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system, or if chlorine
is used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system and there are no disinfection addition
points after the entrance to the distribution system (i.e., no booster chlorination), the system must take three
samples as close to the first customer as possible, at intervals of at least six hours. If chlorine is used to
maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system and there are one or more disinfection addition
points after the entrance to the distribution system (i.e., booster chlorination), the system must take one
sample at each of the following locations: as close to the first customer as possible, in a location
representative of average residence time, and as close to the end of the distribution system as possible
(reflecting maximum residence time in the distribution system).

       (iii) Reduced Monitoring - Chlorine dioxide monitoring may not be reduced.

  (4) Monitoring Requirements for Disinfection Byproduct Precursors (DBPP).

      (a) Routine Monitoring - Surface water systems and ground water systems under the influence of
surface water which use conventional filtration treatment must monitor each treatment plant for Total
Organic Carbon (TOC) no later than the point of combined filter effluent turbidity monitoring and
representative of the treated water. All systems required to monitor under this paragraph must also monitor
for TOC in the source water prior to any treatment at the same time as monitoring for TOC in the treated
water. These samples (source water and treated water) are referred to as paired samples. At the same time
as the source water sample is taken, systems must monitor for alkalinity in the source water prior to any
treatment. Systems must take one paired sample and one source water alkalinity sample per month per plant
at a time representative of normal operating conditions and influent water quality.

     (b) Reduced Monitoring - Surface water systems and ground water systems under the influence of
surface water with an average treated water TOC of less than 2.0 mg/L for two consecutive years, or less
than 1.0 mg/L for one year, may reduce monitoring for both TOC and alkalinity to one paired sample and
one source water alkalinity sample per plant per quarter. The system must revert to routine monitoring in
the month following the quarter when the annual average treated water TOC of equal or greater than 2.0
mg/L.

   (5) Bromide - Systems required to analyze for bromate may reduce bromate monitoring from monthly
to once per quarter, if the system demonstrates that the average source water bromide concentration is less
than 0.05 mg/L based upon representative monthly measurements for one year. The system must continue
bromide monitoring to remain on reduced bromate monitoring.

  (6) Monitoring Plans - Each system required to monitor under this regulation must develop and
implement a monitoring plan. The system must maintain the plan and make it available for inspection by
the Department and the general public no later than 30 days following the applicable compliance dates in
R.61-58.13.B(2). All surface water systems and ground water systems under the influence of surface water
serving more than 3300 people must submit a copy of the monitoring plan to the Department no later than

351 | Regulation 61-58.13
the date of the first report required under R.61-58.13.E. The Department may also require the plan to be
submitted by any other system. After review, the Department may require changes in any plan elements.
The plan must include at least the following elements.

     (a) Specific locations and schedules for collecting samples for any parameters included in this
regulation.

    (b) How the system will calculate compliance with MCLs, MRDLs, and treatment techniques.

    (c) If approved for monitoring as a consecutive system, or if providing water to a consecutive system,
under the provisions of R.61-58.5.X, the sampling plan must reflect the entire distribution system.

D. Compliance Requirements.

  (1) General Requirements.

     (a) Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or
averages and the system fails to monitor for TTHM, HAA5, or bromate, this failure to monitor will be
treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average. Where compliance is
based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system's failure to
monitor makes it impossible to determine compliance with MRDLs for chlorine and chloramines, this
failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual
average.

     (b) All samples taken and analyzed under the provisions of this regulation must be included in
determining compliance, even if that number is greater than the minimum required.

     (c) If, during the first year of monitoring under R.61-58.13.C, any individual quarter's average will
cause the running annual average of that system to exceed the MCL, the system is out of compliance at the
end of that quarter.

  (2) Disinfection Byproducts

    (a) TTHMs and HAA5.

        (i) For systems monitoring quarterly, compliance with MCLs in R.61-58.5.P must be based on a
running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples
collected by the system as prescribed in Section C(2)(a) above.

        (ii) For systems monitoring less frequently than quarterly, systems demonstrate MCL compliance
if the average of samples taken that year under the provisions of Section C(2)(a) above, does not exceed
the MCLs in R.61-58.5.P. If the average of these samples exceeds the MCL, the system must increase
monitoring to once per quarter per treatment plant and such a system is not in violation of the MCL until it
has completed one year of quarterly monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring
will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation at the
end of that quarter. Systems required to increase monitoring frequency to quarterly monitoring must


352 | Regulation 61-58.13
calculate compliance by including the sample which triggered the increased monitoring plus the following
three quarters of monitoring.

       (iii) If the running annual arithmetic average of quarterly averages covering any consecutive four-
quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant
to R.61-58.6 in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to Section E above.

        (iv) If a PWS fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL
for the last four-quarter compliance period must be based on an average of the available data.

      (b) Bromate. Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly,
of monthly samples (or, for months in which the system takes more than one sample, the average of all
samples taken during the month) collected by the system as prescribed by R.61-58.13.C(2)(c). If the average
of samples covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the
MCL and must notify the public pursuant to R.61-58.6, in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant
to R.61-58.13.E. If a PWS fails to complete 12 consecutive months’ monitoring, compliance with the MCL
for the last four-quarter compliance period must be based on an average of the available data.

     (c) Chlorite. Compliance must be based on an arithmetic average of each three sample set taken in
the distribution system as prescribed by R.61-58.13.C(2)(b)(i)(B) and R.61-58.13.C(2)(b)(ii). If the
arithmetic average of any three sample set exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and
must notify the public pursuant to R.61- 58.6, in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to R.61-
58.13.E.

  (3) Disinfectant Residuals.

    (a) Chlorine and Chloramines.

       (i) Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of
monthly averages of all samples collected by the system under Section C(3)(a) above. If the average
covering any consecutive four- quarter period exceeds the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL
and must notify the public pursuant to R.61-58.6, in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to
Section E below.

        (ii) In cases where systems switch between the use of chlorine and chloramines for residual
disinfection during the year, compliance must be determined by including together all monitoring results
of both chlorine and chloramines in calculating compliance. Reports submitted pursuant to Section E below
must clearly indicate which residual disinfectant was analyzed for each sample.

    (b) Chlorine Dioxide.

        (i) Acute Violations - Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the
system under Section C(3)(b) above. If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system
exceeds the MRDL, and on the following day one (or more) of the three (3) samples taken in the distribution
system exceed the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take immediate corrective
action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL and must notify the public pursuant to the
procedures for acute health risks in R.61-58.6.E in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to

353 | Regulation 61-58.13
Section E(3) below. Failure to take samples in the distribution system the day following an exceedance of
the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system will also be considered an MRDL
violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for acute
violations under R.61-58.6.E in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to Section E(3) below.

        (ii) Non-acute Violations - Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by
the system under Section C(3)(b) above. If any two (2) consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to
the distribution system exceed the MRDL and all distribution system samples taken are below the MRDL,
the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide
below the MRDL at the point of sampling and will notify the public pursuant to the procedures for Non-
acute health risks in R.61-58.6.E in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to Section E(3) below.
Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine
dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MRDL violation and the system must
notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for Non-acute violations under R.61-
58.6.E in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to Section E(3) below.

   (4) Disinfection Byproduct Precursors - Compliance must be determined as specified by Section F(3)
below. Systems may begin monitoring to determine whether Step 1 TOC removals can be met twelve (12)
months prior to the compliance date for the system. This monitoring is not required and failure to monitor
during this period is not a violation. However, any system that does not monitor during this period, and
then determines in the first twelve (12) months after the compliance date that it is not able to meet the Step
1 requirements in Section F(2)(b) below and must therefore apply for alternate minimum TOC removal
(Step 2) requirements, is not eligible for retroactive approval of alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2)
requirements as allowed pursuant to Section F(2)(c) below and is in violation. Systems may apply for
alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements any time after the compliance date. For systems
required to meet Step 1 TOC removals, if the value calculated under Section F(3)(a)(iv) below, is less than
1.00, the system is in violation of the treatment technique requirements and must notify the public pursuant
to R.61-58.6.E, in addition to reporting to the Department pursuant to R.61- 58.13.E(4).

E. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements.

  (1) Systems required to sample quarterly or more frequently must report to the Department within 10
days after the end of each quarter in which samples were collected, notwithstanding the provisions of R.61-
58.6. Systems required to sample less frequently than quarterly must report to the Department within 10
days after the end of each monitoring period in which samples were collected.

F. Treatment Technique for Control of Disinfection Byproduct (DBP) Precursors.

  (1) Systems using surface water or a ground water under the influence of surface water which utilize
conventional filtration treatment must operate with enhanced coagulation or enhanced softening to achieve
the TOC percent removal levels specified in paragraph (2) of this section unless the system meets at least
one of the alternative compliance criteria listed in paragraph (1)(a) or (1)(b) of this section.

     (a) Alternative Compliance Criteria for Enhanced Coagulation and Enhanced Softening Systems -
Systems using surface water or a ground water under the influence of surface water which utilize
conventional filtration treatment may use the alternative compliance criteria in paragraphs (1)(a)(i) through
(vi) of this section to comply with this section in lieu of complying with paragraph (2) of this section.
Systems must still comply with monitoring requirements in R.61-58.13.C(4).

above, to use of technologies that will limit the levels of TTHMs and HAA5 to no more than 0.040 mg/L
and 0.030 mg/L, respectively. Systems must submit evidence of a clear and irrevocable financial
commitment, in addition to a schedule containing milestones and periodic progress reports for installation
and operation of appropriate technologies, to the Department for approval not later than the effective date
for compliance in R.61-58.13.B(2). These technologies must be installed and operating not later than June
30, 2005. Failure to install and operate these technologies by the date in the approved schedule will
constitute a violation of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.

        (iv) The TTHM and HAA5 running annual averages are no greater than 0.040 mg/L and 0.030
mg/L, respectively, and the system uses only chlorine for primary disinfection and maintenance of a residual

  (2) Enhanced coagulation and enhanced softening performance requirements.




358 | Regulation 61-58.13
    (a) Systems must achieve the percent reduction of TOC specified in paragraph (2)(b) of this section
between the source water and the combined filter effluent, unless the Department approves a system's
request for alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements under paragraph (2)(c) of this section.

     (b) Required Step 1 TOC reductions, indicated in the following table, are based upon specified source
water parameters measured in accordance with EPA approved methods specified in 40 CFR 141.131(d).
Systems practicing softening are required to meet the Step 1 TOC reductions in the far-right column (Source
water alkalinity greater than 120 mg/L) for the specified source water TOC:

 a       Systems meeting at least one of the conditions in paragraphs (1)(a)(i) through (vi) of this
         section are not required to operate with enhanced coagulation.
 b
         Softening systems meeting one of the alternative compliance criteria in paragraph (1)(b) of
         this section are not required to operate with enhanced softening.
 c       Systems practicing softening must meet the TOC removal requirements in this column.

     (c) Systems using surface water or a ground water under the influence of surface water which utilize
conventional filtration treatment that cannot achieve the Step 1 TOC removals required by paragraph (2)(b)
of this section due to water quality parameters or operational constraints must apply to the Department,
within three (3) months of failure to achieve the TOC removals required by paragraph (2)(b) of this section,
for approval of alternative minimum TOC (Step 2) removal requirements submitted by the system. If the
Department approves the alternative minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, the Department may
make those requirements retroactive for the purposes of determining compliance. Until the Department
approves the alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, the system must meet the Step 1 TOC
removals contained in paragraph (2)(b) of this section.

     (d) Alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements. Applications made to the Department
by enhanced coagulation systems for approval of alternative minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements
under paragraph (2)(c) of this section must include, as a minimum, results of bench- or pilot-scale testing
conducted under paragraph (2)(d)(i) of this section. The submitted bench-or-pilot scale testing must be used
to determine the alternate enhanced coagulation level.


359 | Regulation 61-58.13
        (i) Alternate enhanced coagulation level is defined as: Coagulation at a coagulant dose and pH as
determined by the method described in paragraphs (2)(d)(i) through (v) of this section such that an
incremental addition of 10 mg/L of alum (or equivalent amount of ferric salt) results in a TOC removal of
greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/L. The percent removal of TOC at this point on the "TOC removal versus
coagulant dose" curve is then defined as the minimum TOC removal required for the system. Once approved
by the Department, this minimum requirement supersedes the minimum TOC removal required by the table
in paragraph (2)(b) of this section. This requirement will be effective until such time as the Department
approves a new value based on the results of a new bench- or pilot-scale test. Failure to achieve
Department-set alternative minimum TOC removal levels is a violation of National Primary Drinking Water
Regulations.

        (ii) Bench- or pilot-scale testing of enhanced coagulation must be conducted by using
representative water samples and adding 10 mg/L increments of alum (or equivalent amounts of ferric salt)
until the pH is reduced to a level less than or equal to the enhanced coagulation Step 2 target pH shown in
the following table:

                              ENHANCED COAGULATION STEP 2 TARGET pH


                              ALKALINITY                       TARGET pH
                              (mg/L as CaCO3)

                              0-60                             5.5

                              >60-120                          6.3

                              >120-240                         7.0

                              >240                             7.5

        (iii) For waters with alkalinities of less than 60 mg/L for which addition of small amounts of alum
or equivalent addition of iron coagulant drives the pH below 5.5 before significant TOC removal occurs,
the system must add necessary chemicals to maintain the pH between 5.3 and 5.7 in samples until the TOC
removal of 0.3 mg/L per 10 mg/L alum added (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) is reached.

    (iv) The system may operate at any coagulant dose or pH necessary (consistent with other
NPDWRs) to achieve the minimum TOC percent removal approved under paragraph (2)(c) of this section.

        (v) If the TOC removal is consistently less than 0.3 mg/L of TOC per 10 mg/L of incremental alum
dose at all dosages of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant), the water is deemed to contain TOC
not amenable to enhanced coagulation. The system may then apply to the Department for a waiver of
enhanced coagulation requirements.

  (3) Compliance Calculations.

     (a) Systems using surface water or a ground water under the influence of surface water other than
those identified in paragraph (1)(a) or (1)(b) of this section must comply with requirements contained in
360 | Regulation 61-58.13
R.61-58.13.F(2)(b) or (c). Systems must calculate compliance quarterly, beginning after the system has
collected 12 months of data, by determining an annual average using the following method:

      (i) Determine actual monthly TOC percent removal, equal to: (1- (treated water TOC/source water
TOC)) x 100.

       (ii) Determine the required monthly TOC percent removal (from either the table in paragraph (2)(b)
or from paragraph (2)(c) of this section).

       (iii) Divide the value in paragraph (3)(a)(i) of this section by the value in paragraph (3)(a)(ii) of this
section.

       (iv) Add together the results of paragraph (3)(a)(iii) of this section for the last twelve (12) months
and divide by twelve (12).

      (v) If the value calculated in paragraph (3)(a)(iv) of this section is less than 1.00, the system is not
in compliance with the TOC percent removal requirements.

     (b) Systems may use the provisions in paragraphs (3)(b)(i) through (v) of this section in lieu of the
calculations in paragraph (3)(a)(i) through (v) of this section to determine compliance with TOC percent
removal requirements.

      (i) In any month that the system's treated or source water TOC level, measured according to EPA
approved methods specified in 40 CFR 141.131(d)(3), is less than 2.0 mg/L, the system may assign a
monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (3)(a)(iii) of this section) when calculating
compliance under the provisions of paragraph (3)(a) of this section.

        (ii) In any month that a system practicing softening removes at least 10 mg/L of magnesium
hardness (as CaCO3), the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in
paragraph (3)(a)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (3)(a)
of this section.

        (iii) In any month that the system's source water SUVA, prior to any treatment and measured
according to EPA approved methods specified in 40 CFR 141.131(d)(4), is less than or equal to 2.0 L/mg-
m, the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (3)(a)(iii) of
this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (3)(a) of this section.

       (iv) In any month that the system's finished water SUVA, measured according to EPA approved
methods specified in 40 CFR 141.131(d)(4) (11-8- 2006 edition), is less than or equal to 2.0 L/mg-m, the
system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (3)(a)(iii) of this
section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (3)(a) of this section.

        (v) In any month that a system practicing enhanced softening lowers alkalinity below 60 mg/L (as
CaCO3), the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph
(3)(a)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (3)(a) of this
section.


361 | Regulation 61-58.13
    (c) Systems using surface water or a ground water under the influence of surface water which utilize
conventional treatment may also comply with the requirements of this section by meeting the criteria in
paragraph (1)(a) or (1)(b) of this section.

    (a) All systems must monitor during the month of highest disinfection byproduct (DBP)
concentrations.

     (b) Systems on quarterly monitoring must take dual sample sets every 90 days at each monitoring
location, except for subpart H systems serving 500- 3,300. Systems on annual monitoring and subpart H
systems serving 500-3,300 are required to take individual TTHM and HAA5 samples (instead of a dual
sample set) at the locations with the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations, respectively. Only one
location with a dual sample set per monitoring period is needed if highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations
occur at the same location, and month, if monitored annually.

residence time compliance monitoring location for ground water systems) with the highest HAA5 LRAA
not previously selected as an R.61-58.15 monitoring location.

     (d) Location with the highest TTHM LRAA not previously selected as an R.61-58.15 monitoring
location.

     (e) Location with the highest TTHM LRAA not previously selected as an R.61-58.15 monitoring
location.

     (f) Location with the highest HAA5 LRAA not previously selected as an R.61-58.15 monitoring
location.

     (g) Existing R.61-58.13 average residence time compliance monitoring location (maximum
residence time compliance monitoring location for ground water systems) with the highest TTHM LRAA
not previously selected as a R.61-58.15 monitoring location.

     (h) Location with the highest HAA5 LRAA not previously selected as an R.61-58.15 monitoring
location.

  (4) A system may recommend locations other than those specified in paragraph (3) of this section if
they include a rationale for selecting other locations. If the Department approves the alternate locations, the
system must monitor at these locations to determine compliance under R.61-58.15.

   (5) The recommended schedule must include R.61-58.15 monitoring during the peak historical month
for TTHM and HAA5 concentration, unless the Department approves another month. Once the peak
historical month has been identified, and if the system is required to conduct routine monitoring at least
quarterly, the system must schedule R.61-58.15 compliance monitoring at a regular frequency of every 90
days or fewer.

                    STAGE 2 DISINFECTION BYPRODUCTS REQUIREMENTS

A. Applicability.

  This part R.61-58.15 applies to community water systems an non-transient non-community water
systems that uses a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light or delivers water that has
been treated with a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light.

B. General Requirements.

   (1) The requirements of this part R.61-58.15 constitute national primary drinking water regulations.
The regulations in this part establish monitoring and other requirements for achieving compliance with
maximum contaminant levels based on locational running annual averages (LRAA) for total
trihalomethanes (TTHM) and haloacetic acids (five)(HAA5), and for achieving compliance with maximum
residual disinfectant levels for chlorine and chloramine for certain consecutive systems.

  (2) Schedule – Systems subject to this part R.61-58.15 must comply with the requirements of this part
on the following schedule:

     (a) Systems that are not part of a combined distribution system and systems that serve the largest
population in the combined distribution system and serve 100,000 people or greater must comply with this
part R.61-58.15 by April 1, 2012.

     (b) Systems that are not part of a combined distribution system and systems that serve the largest
population in the combined distribution system and serve between 50,000 and 99,999 people must comply
with this part R.61-58.15 by October 1, 2012.

     (c) Systems that are not part of a combined distribution system and systems that serve the largest
population in the combined distribution system and serve between 10,000 and 49,999 people must comply
with this part R.61-58.15 by October 1, 2013.

    (d) Systems that are not part of a combined distribution system and systems that serve the largest
population in the combined distribution system and serve less than 10,000 must comply with this part R.61-
58.15 by October 1, 2013 if no Cryptosporidium monitoring is required under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a)(iv), or
by October 1, 2014 if Cryptosporidium monitoring is required under R.61-58.10.K(2)(a)(iv).

     (e) Systems that are part of a combined distribution system must comply with this part R.61-58.15 at
the same time as the system with the earliest compliance date in the combined distribution system.

     (f) The Department may grant systems up to an additional 24 months from the specified date for
compliance with MCLs and operational evaluation levels if capital improvements are required to comply
with an MCL.

    (g) Systems monitoring frequency is specified in R.61-58.15.C(1)(b)

        (i) If systems are required to conduct quarterly monitoring, then they must begin monitoring in
the first full calendar quarter that includes the compliance date in this paragraph (2).

379 | Regulation 61-58.15
       (ii) If systems are required to conduct monitoring at a frequency that is less than quarterly, then
they must begin monitoring in the calendar month recommended in the IDSE report prepared under R.61-
58.14.C or R.61-58.14.D or the calendar month identified in the monitoring plan developed under R.61-
58.15.D no later than 12 months after the compliance date in this paragraph (2).

     (h) If systems are required to conduct quarterly monitoring, then they must make compliance
calculations at the end of the fourth calendar quarter that follows the compliance date and at the end of each
subsequent quarter (or earlier if the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data would cause
the MCL to be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters). If systems are required
to conduct monitoring at a frequency that is less than quarterly, then they must make compliance
calculations beginning with the first compliance sample taken after the compliance date.

     (i)   Reserved.

      (j) For the purpose of the schedule in this paragraph (2), the Department may determine that the
combined distribution system does not include certain consecutive systems based on factors such as
receiving water from a wholesale system only on an emergency basis or receiving only a small percentage
and small volume of water from a wholesale system. The Department may also determine that the combined
distribution system does not include certain wholesale systems based on factors such as delivering water to
a consecutive system only on an emergency basis or delivering only a small percentage and small volume
of water to a consecutive system.

  (3) Monitoring and compliance.

     (a) In order for systems that are required to monitor quarterly to comply with MCLs in R.61-
58.5.P(2)(b), they must calculate LRAAs for TTHM and HAA5 using monitoring results collected under
this part R.61-58.15 and determine that each LRAA does not exceed the MCL. If the system fails to
complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, they must calculate compliance with the MCL based on
the average of the available data from the most recent four quarters. If the system takes more than one
sample per quarter at a monitoring location, they must average all samples taken in the quarter at that
location to determine a quarterly average to be used in the LRAA calculation.

    (b) In order for systems required to monitor yearly or less frequently to determine compliance with
MCLs in R.61-58.5.P(2)(b), they must determine that each sample taken is less than the MCL. If any sample
exceeds the MCL, the system must comply with the requirements of section R.61-58.15.G. If no sample
exceeds the MCL, the sample result for each monitoring location is considered the LRAA for that
monitoring location.

  (4) Systems are in violation of the monitoring requirements for each quarter that a monitoring result
would be used in calculating an LRAA if they fail to monitor.

C. Routine Monitoring.

  (1) Monitoring



380 | Regulation 61-58.15
     (a) If a system submitted an IDSE report, they must begin monitoring at the locations and months
recommended in the IDSE report submitted under section R.61-
58.14.G following the schedule in R.61-58.15.B(2), unless the Department requires other locations or
additional locations after its review. If the system submitted a 40/30 certification under section R.61-
58.14.E or they qualified for a very small system waiver under section R.61-58.14.F or they are a non-
transient non-community water system serving less than 10,000 people, they must monitor at the location(s)
and dates identified in their monitoring plan in R.61-58.13.C(6), updated as required by section R.61-
58.15.D.

    (b) Systems must monitor at no fewer than the number of locations identified in this paragraph (1)(b).

       (i)   All systems must monitor during month of highest DBP concentrations.

       (ii) Systems on quarterly monitoring must take dual sample sets every 90 days at each monitoring
location, except for subpart H systems serving 500- 3,300. Systems on annual monitoring and subpart H
systems serving 500-3,300 are required to take individual TTHM and HAA5 samples (instead of a dual
sample set) at the locations with the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations, respectively. Only one
location with a dual sample set per monitoring period is needed if highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations
occur at the same location (and month, if monitored annually).

    (c) Undisinfected systems that begin using a disinfectant other than UV light after the dates in R.61-
58.14 for complying with the Initial Distribution System Evaluation requirements must consult with the
Department to identify compliance monitoring locations for this part R.61-58.15. The systems must then
develop a monitoring plan under R.61-58.15.D that includes those monitoring locations.

  (2) Analytical Methods – Analyses used to determine compliance with this part R.61-58.15 must by
conducted using an approved method listed in 40 CFR 141.131 (1-04-06 edition) for TTHM and HAA5
analyses.

  (3) Certified Laboratory - Analyses under this part R.61-58.15 for disinfection byproducts must be
conducted by a certified laboratory.
381 | Regulation 61-58.15
D. Stage 2 DBP Monitoring Plans.

  (1) Monitoring Plan Development.

      (a) Systems must develop and implement a monitoring plan to be kept on file for Department and
public review. The monitoring plan must contain the elements in paragraphs (1)(a)(i) through (1)(a)(iv) of
this section and be complete no later than the date the system conducts initial monitoring under this part
R.61-58.15.

       (i)   Monitoring locations;

       (ii) Monitoring dates;

       (iii) Compliance calculation procedures; and.

       (iv) Monitoring plans for any other systems in the combined distribution system if the Department
has reduced monitoring requirements under the authority granted in 40 CFR 142.16(m) (1-04-06 edition).

     (b) For systems that were not required to submit an IDSE report under either section R.61-58.14.C
or section 61-58.14.D, and do not have sufficient R.61-58.13 monitoring locations to identify the required
number of R.61-58.15 compliance monitoring locations indicated in R.61-58.14.G(2), they must identify
additional locations by alternating selection of locations representing high TTHM levels and high HAA5
levels until the required number of compliance monitoring locations have been identified. Systems must
also provide the rationale for identifying the locations as having high levels of TTHM or HAA5. If a system
has more R.61-58.13 monitoring locations than required for R.61-58.15 compliance monitoring in R.61-
58.14.G(2), they must identify which locations they will use for R.61-58.15 compliance monitoring by
alternating selection of locations representing high TTHM levels and high HAA5 levels until the required
number of R.61-58.15 compliance monitoring locations have been identified.

   (2) Subpart H systems serving > 3,300 people must submit a copy of the monitoring plan required under
this section to the Department prior to the date the system begins initial monitoring under this part R.61-
58.15, unless the IDSE report submitted under R.61-58.14 contains all the information required by this
section.

  (3) Systems may revise their monitoring plan to reflect changes in treatment, distribution system
operations and layout (including new service areas), or other factors that may affect TTHM or HAA5
formation, or for Department approved reasons, after consultation with the Department regarding the need
for changes and the appropriateness of changes. If a system changes monitoring locations, they must replace
existing compliance monitoring locations that have the lowest LRAA with new locations that reflect the
current distribution system locations with expected high TTHM or HAA5 levels. The Department may also
require modifications in the monitoring plan. Subpart H systems serving > 3,300 people, must submit a
copy of their modified monitoring plan to the Department prior to the date they are required to comply with
the revised monitoring plan.




382 | Regulation 61-58.15
E. Reduced Monitoring.

   (1) Systems may reduce monitoring to the level specified in this paragraph (1) any time the LRAA is
less than or equal to 0.040 mg/L for TTHM and less than or equal to 0.030 mg/L for HAA5 at all monitoring
locations. Only data collected under the provisions of R.61-58.15 or R.61-58.13 may be used to qualify for
reduced monitoring. In addition, the source water annual average TOC level, before any treatment, must be
less than or equal to 4.0 mg/L at each treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under the direct
influence of surface water, based on monitoring conducted under either R.61-58.13.C(2)(a)(vi) or R.61-
58.13.C(4). Systems on reduced monitoring under this section that are required to monitor quarterly must
take dual sample sets every 90 days.

     (a) Subpart H systems serving less than 500 people may not reduce monitoring.

     (b) Subpart H systems serving between 500 and 3,300 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to one (1) TTHM sample per year taken at the location and during
the quarter with the highest TTHM single measurement, and one (1) HAA5 sample per year taken at the
location and during the quarter with the highest HAA5 single measurement. One (1) dual sample set per
year may be taken if the highest TTHM and HAA5 measurements occurred at the same location during the
same quarter.

     (c) Subpart H systems serving between 3,301 and 9,999 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to one (1) dual sample set per year taken at the location and during
the quarter with the highest TTHM single measurement, and one (1) dual sample set per year taken at the
location and during the quarter with the highest HAA5 single measurement.

    (d) Subpart H systems serving between 10,000 and 49,999 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to two (2) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations with the
highest TTHM and HAA5 LRAAs.

    (e) Subpart H systems serving between 50,000 and 249,999 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to four (4) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations with the
two highest TTHM and two highest HAA5 LRAAs.

     (f) Subpart H systems serving between 250,000 and 999,999 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to six (6) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations with the
three highest TTHM and three highest HAA5 LRAAs.

     (g) Subpart H systems serving between 1,000,000 and 4,999,999 people and meeting the criteria in
this paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to eight (8) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations
with the four highest TTHM and four highest HAA5 LRAAs.

     (h) Subpart H systems serving 5,000,000 or more people and meeting the criteria in this paragraph
(1) may reduce monitoring to ten (10) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations with the five
highest TTHM and five highest HAA5 LRAAs.

    (i) Ground water systems serving less than 500 people and meeting the criteria in this paragraph (1)
may reduce monitoring to one (1) TTHM sample every third year taken at the location and during the

383 | Regulation 61-58.15
quarter with the highest TTHM single measurement, and one (1) HAA5 sample every third year taken at
the location and during the quarter with the highest HAA5 single measurement. One (1) dual sample set
every third year may be taken if the highest TTHM and HAA5 measurements occurred at the same location
during the same quarter.

     (j) Ground water systems serving between 500 and 9,999 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to one (1) TTHM sample per year taken at the location and during
the quarter with the highest TTHM single measurement, and one (1) HAA5 sample per year taken at the
location and during the quarter with the highest HAA5 single measurement. One (1) dual sample set per
year may be taken if the highest TTHM and HAA5 measurements occurred at the same location during the
same quarter.

     (k) Ground water systems serving between 10,000 and 99,999 people and meeting the criteria in this
paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to one (1) dual sample set per year taken at the location and during
the quarter with the highest TTHM single measurement and one (1) dual sample set per year taken at the
location and during the quarter with the highest HAA5 single measurement.

      (l) Ground water systems serving between 100,000 and 499,999 people and meeting the criteria in
this paragraph (1) may reduce monitoring to two (2) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations with
the highest TTHM and HAA5 LRAAs.

     (m) Ground water systems serving 500,000 or more people and meeting the criteria in this paragraph
(1) may reduce monitoring to four (4) dual sample sets per quarter taken at the locations with the two highest
TTHM and two highest HAA5 LRAAs.

   (2) Systems on reduced monitoring may remain on reduced monitoring as long as the TTHM LRAA is
less than or equal to 0.040 mg/L and the HAA5 LRAA is less than or equal to 0.030 mg/L at each monitoring
location (for systems with quarterly reduced monitoring) or each TTHM sample is less than or equal to
0.060 mg/L and each HAA5 sample is less than or equal to 0.045 mg/L (for systems with annual or less
frequent monitoring). In addition, the source water annual average TOC level, before any treatment, must
be less than or equal to 4.0 mg/L at each treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under the
direct influence of surface water, based on monitoring conducted under either R.61- 58.13.C(2)(a)(vi) or
R.61-58.13.C(4).

  (3) If the LRAA based on quarterly monitoring at any monitoring location exceeds either 0.040 mg/L
for TTHM or 0.030 mg/L for HAA5 or if the annual (or less frequent) sample at any location exceeds either
0.060 mg/L for TTHM or 0.045 mg/L for HAA5, or if the source water annual average TOC level, before
any treatment, is greater than 4.0 mg/L at any treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under
the direct influence of surface water, the system must resume routine monitoring under R.61-58.15.C or
begin increased monitoring if R.61-58.15.G applies.

  (4) Systems may be returned to routine monitoring at the Department’s discretion.

F. Additional Requirements for Consecutive Systems.

   A consecutive system that does not add a disinfectant but delivers water that has been treated with a
primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light, must comply with analytical and monitoring

384 | Regulation 61-58.15
requirements for chlorine and chloramines in R.61-58.13.B and R.61-58.13.C(3)(a) and the compliance
requirements in R.61-58.13.D(3)(a) beginning April 1, 2009, unless required earlier by the Department, and
report monitoring results under R.61-58.13.E(3).

G. Conditions Requiring Increased Monitoring.

   (1) If a system is required to monitor at a particular location annually or less frequently than annually
under R.61-58.15.C or R.61-58.15.E, they must increase monitoring to dual sample sets once per quarter
(taken every 90 days) at all locations if a TTHM sample is greater than 0.080 mg/L or a HAA5 sample is
greater than 0.060 mg/L at any location.

  (2) A system is in violation of the MCL when the LRAA exceeds the R.61-58.15 MCLs in R.61-58.5.P,
calculated based on four consecutive quarters of monitoring (or the LRAA calculated based on fewer than
four quarters of data if the MCL would be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent
quarters). A system is in violation of the monitoring requirements for each quarter that a monitoring result
would be used in calculating an LRAA if they fail to monitor.

   (3) A system may return to routine monitoring once they have conducted increased monitoring for at
least four consecutive quarters and the LRAA for every monitoring location is less than or equal to 0.060
mg/L for TTHM and less than or equal to 0.045 mg/L for HAA5.

H. Operational Evaluation Levels.

   (1) A system has exceeded the operational evaluation level at any monitoring location where the sum
of the two previous quarters' TTHM results plus twice the current quarter's TTHM result, divided by 4 to
determine an average, exceeds 0.080 mg/L, or where the sum of the two previous quarters' HAA5 results
plus twice the current quarter's HAA5 result, divided by 4 to determine an average, exceeds 0.060 mg/L.

  (2) Operational Evaluations

     (a) If a system exceeds the operational evaluation level, they must conduct an operational evaluation
and submit a written report of the evaluation to the Department no later than 90 days after being notified of
the analytical result that causes them to exceed the operational evaluation level. The written report must be
made available to the public upon request.

     (b) The operational evaluation must include an examination of system treatment and distribution
operational practices, including storage tank operations, excess storage capacity, distribution system
flushing, changes in sources or source water quality, and treatment changes or problems that may contribute
to TTHM and HAA5 formation and what steps could be considered to minimize future exceedances.

        (i) A system may request and the Department may allow them to limit the scope of their evaluation
if they are able to identify the cause of the operational evaluation level exceedance.

        (ii) A request to limit the scope of the evaluation does not extend the schedule in paragraph (2)(a)
of this section for submitting the written report. The Department must approve this limited scope of
evaluation in writing and the system must keep that approval with the completed report.


385 | Regulation 61-58.15
I. Requirements for Remaining on Reduced TTHM and HAA5 Monitoring Based on R.61-58.13 Results.

  A system on reduced monitoring under R.61-58.13 may remain on reduced monitoring after the dates
identified in R.61-58.15.B for compliance with this subpart only if they qualify for a 40/30 certification
under R.61-58.14.E or have received a very small system waiver under R.61-58.14.F, plus they meet the
reduced monitoring criteria in R.61-58.15.E(1), and they do not change or add monitoring locations from
those used for compliance monitoring under R.61-58.13. If the system’s monitoring locations under this
part R.61-58.15 differ from the monitoring locations under R.61-58.13, the system may not remain on
reduced monitoring after the dates identified R.61-58.15.B for compliance with this part R.61-58.15.

J. Requirements for Remaining on Increased TTHM and HAA5 Monitoring Based on R.61-58.13 Results.

  If a system was on increased monitoring under R.61-58.13.C(2)(a), they must remain on increased
monitoring until they qualify for a return to routine monitoring under R.61-58.15.G(3). The system must
conduct increased monitoring under R.61-58.15.G at the monitoring locations in the monitoring plan
developed under R.61-58.15.D beginning at the date identified in R.61-58.15.B for compliance with this
part and remain on increased monitoring until they qualify for a return to routine monitoring under R.61-
58.15.G(3).

K. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements.

  (1) Reporting

     (a) Systems must report the following information for each monitoring location to the Department
within 10 days of the end of any quarter in which monitoring is required:

       (i)   Number of samples taken during the last quarter.

       (ii) Date and results of each sample taken during the last quarter.

         (iii) Arithmetic average of quarterly results for the last four quarters for each monitoring location
(LRAA), beginning at the end of the fourth calendar quarter that follows the compliance date and at the end
of each subsequent quarter. If the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data would cause
the MCL to be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters, the system must report
this information to the Department as part of the first report due following the compliance date or anytime
thereafter that this determination is made. If a system is required to conduct monitoring at a frequency that
is less than quarterly, they must make compliance calculations beginning with the first compliance sample
taken after the compliance date, unless they are required to conduct increased monitoring under R.61-
58.15.G.

      (iv) Whether, based on R.61-58.5.P(2)(b) and this part R.61-58.15, the MCL was violated at any
monitoring location.

       (v) Any operational evaluation levels that were exceeded during the quarter and, if so, the location
and date, and the calculated TTHM and HAA5 levels.



386 | Regulation 61-58.15
     (b) Subpart H systems seeking to qualify for or remain on reduced TTHM/HAA5 monitoring, must
report the following source water TOC information for each treatment plant that treats surface water or
ground water under the direct influence of surface water to the Department within 10 days of the end of any
quarter in which monitoring is required:

       (i)   The number of source water TOC samples taken each month during last quarter.

       (ii) The date and result of each sample taken during last quarter.

      (iii) The quarterly average of monthly samples taken during last quarter or the result of the quarterly
sample.

       (iv) The running annual average (RAA) of quarterly averages from the past four quarters.

       (v) Whether the RAA exceeded 4.0 mg/L.

     (c) The Department may choose to perform calculations and determine whether the MCL was
exceeded or the system is eligible for reduced monitoring in lieu of having the system report that
information.

  (2) Recordkeeping.

  Systems must retain any R.61-58.15 monitoring plans and monitoring results as required by R.61-58.6.D.




387 | Regulation 61-58.15
                                        GROUND WATER RULE

A. Applicability.

   This part R.61-58.16 applies to all public water systems that use ground water except that it does not
apply to public water systems that combine all of their ground water with surface water or with ground
water under the direct influence of surface water prior to treatment under 40 CFR 141, Subpart H. For the
purposes of this part, “ground water system” is defined as any public water system meeting this applicability
statement, including consecutive systems receiving finished ground water.

B. General Requirements.

   The requirements of R.61-58.16 constitute national primary drinking water regulations. Systems subject
to this part must comply with the following requirements:

  (1) Sanitary survey information requirements for all ground water systems as described in R.61-
58.16.D.

   (2) Microbial source water monitoring requirements for ground water systems that do not treat all of
their ground water to at least 99.99 percent (4-log) treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a
Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer
as described in R.61-58.16.E

   (3) Treatment technique requirements, described in R.61-58.16.F, that apply to ground water systems
that have fecally contaminated source waters, as determined by source water monitoring conducted under
R.61-58.16.E, or that have significant deficiencies that are identified by the Department or that are identified
by EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act section 1445. A ground water system with fecally contaminated
source water or with significant deficiencies subject to the treatment technique requirements of R.61-
58.16.F must implement one or more of the following corrective action options: correct all significant
deficiencies; provide an alternate source of water; eliminate the source of contamination; or provide
treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a
Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer.

  (4) Ground water systems that provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal,
or a Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first
customer are required to conduct compliance monitoring to demonstrate treatment effectiveness, as
described in R.61-58.16.F(2).

  (5) If requested by the Department, ground water systems must provide the Department with any
existing information that will enable the Department to perform a hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment.
For the purposes of this part R.61-58.16, “hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment” is a determination of
whether ground water systems obtain water from hydrogeologically sensitive settings.

C. Compliance Date.

  Ground water systems must comply, unless otherwise noted, with the requirements of R.61-58.16
beginning December 1, 2009.

388 | Regulation 61-58.16
D. Sanitary Surveys For Ground Water Systems.

   (1) Ground water systems must provide the Department, at the Department’s request, any existing
information that will enable the Department to conduct a sanitary survey.

   (2) For the purposes of R.61 58.16, a "sanitary survey," as conducted by the Department, includes, but
is not limited to, an onsite review of the water source(s) (identifying sources of contamination by using
results of source water assessments or other relevant information where available), facilities, equipment,
operation, maintenance, and monitoring compliance of a public water system to evaluate the adequacy of
the system, its sources and operations and the distribution of safe drinking water.

  (3) The sanitary survey must include an evaluation of the applicable components listed in paragraphs
R.61-58.16.D(3)(a) through (h).

    (a) Source,

    (b) Treatment,

    (c) Distribution system

    (d) Finished water storage

    (e) Pumps, pump facilities, and controls,

    (f) Monitoring, reporting, and data verification,

    (g) System management and operation, and

    (h) Operator compliance with Department requirements.

E. Ground Water Source Microbial Monitoring and Analytical Methods.

  (1) Triggered source water monitoring.

     (a) General Requirement. A ground water system must conduct triggered source water monitoring if
the conditions identified in paragraphs (1)(a)(i) and either (1)(a)(ii) or 1(a)(iii) of this section exist.

       (i) The system does not provide at least 4 log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or
a Department approved combination of 4 log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer
for each ground water source; and either

       (ii) The system is notified that a sample collected under R.61 58.5.G(1) is total coliform-positive
and the sample is not invalidated under R.61 58.5.G(3) until March 31, 2016, or

        (iii) The system is notified that a sample collected under R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.H is
total coliform-positive and the sample is not invalidated under R.61-58.17.D(3) beginning April 1, 2016.

389 | Regulation 61-58.16
     (b) Sampling Requirements. A ground water system must collect, within 24 hours of notification of
the total coliform-positive sample, at least one ground water source sample from each ground water source
in use at the time the total coliform-positive sample was collected under R.61 58.5.G(1) until March 31,
2016, or collected under R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.H beginning April 1, 2016, except as provided
in R.61-58.16.E(1)(b)(ii).

        (i) The Department may extend the 24 hour time limit on a case by case basis if the system cannot
collect the ground water source sample within 24 hours due to circumstances beyond its control. In the case
of an extension, the Department must specify how much time the system has to collect the sample.

        (ii) If approved by the Department, systems with more than one ground water source may meet the
requirements of R.61 58.16.E(1)(b) by sampling a representative ground water source or sources. If directed
by the Department, systems must submit a triggered source water monitoring plan for Department approval
that identifies one or more ground water sources that are representative of each monitoring site in the
system's sample siting plan under R.61 58.5.G(1) until March 31, 2016, or under R.61-58.17.D beginning
April 1, 2016, and that the system intends to use for representative sampling under this paragraph.

        (iii) Until, March 31, 2016, a ground water system serving 1,000 or fewer people may use a repeat
sample collected from a ground water source to meet both the requirements of R.61 58.5.G(2) and to satisfy
the monitoring requirements of R.61 58.16.E(1)(b) for that ground water source only if the Department
approves the use of E.coli as a fecal indicator for source water monitoring under R.61- 58.16.E(1). If the
repeat sample collected from the ground water source is E.coli- positive, the system must comply with R.61
58.16.E(1)(c).

       (i) Beginning April 1, 2016, a ground water system serving 1,000 or fewer people may use a repeat
sample collected from a ground water source to meet both the requirements of R.61-58.17 and to satisfy
the monitoring requirements of R.61-58.16.E(1)(b) for that ground water source only if the Department
approves the use of E. coli as a fecal indicator for source water monitoring under R.61-58.16.E(1) and
approves the use of a single sample for meeting both the triggered source water monitoring requirements
in R.61-58.16.E(1) and the repeat monitoring requirements in R.61-58.17.I. If the repeat sample collected
from the ground water source is E. coli-positive, the system must comply with R.61-58.16.E(1)(c).

     (c) Additional Requirements. If the Department does not require corrective action under R.61-
58.16.F(1)(b) for a fecal indicator positive source water sample collected under R.61-58.16.E(1)(b) that is
not invalidated under R.61 58.16.E(4), the system must collect five additional source water samples from
the same source within 24 hours of being notified of the fecal indicator positive sample.

    (d) Consecutive and wholesale systems.

       (i) In addition to the other requirements of R.61 58.16.E(1), a consecutive ground water system
that has a total coliform-positive sample collected under R.61 58.5.G(1) until March 31, 2016, or under
R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.H beginning April 1, 2016 must notify the wholesale system(s) within
24 hours of being notified of the total coliform-positive sample.

      (ii) In addition to the other requirements of R.61 58.16.E(1), a wholesale ground water system must
comply with R.61 58.16.E(1)(d)(ii)(A) and R.61 58.16.E(1)(d)(ii)(B).

390 | Regulation 61-58.16
          (A) A wholesale ground water system that receives notice from a consecutive system it serves
that a sample collected under R.61 58.5.G(1) until March 31, 2016, or collected under R.61-58.17.E through
R.61-58.17.H beginning April 1, 2016, is total coliform-positive must, within 24 hours of being notified,
collect a sample from its ground water source(s) under R.61-58.16.E(1)(b) and analyze it for a fecal
indicator under R.61-58.16.E(3).

          (B) If the sample collected under R.61-58.16.E(1)(d)(ii)(A) is fecal indicator positive, the
wholesale ground water system must notify all consecutive systems served by that ground water source of
the fecal indicator positive sample within 24 hours of being notified of the ground water source sample
monitoring result and must meet the requirements of R.61-58.16.E(1)(c).

     (e) Exceptions to the triggered source water monitoring requirements. A ground water system is not
required to comply with the source water monitoring requirements of R.61-58.16.E(1) if either one of the
following conditions exists:

        (i) The Department determines, and documents in writing, that the total coliform- positive sample
collected under R.61 58.5(G)(1) until March 31, 2016, or under R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.H
beginning April 1, 2016, is caused by a distribution system deficiency; or

      (ii) The total coliform-positive sample collected under R.61 58.5(G)(1) until March 31, 2016, or
under R.61-58.17.E through R.61-58.17.H beginning April 1, 2016, is collected at a location that meets
Department criteria for distribution system conditions that will cause total coliform-positive samples.

   (2) Assessment source water monitoring. If directed by the Department, ground water systems must
conduct assessment source water monitoring that meets Department-determined requirements for such
monitoring. A ground water system conducting assessment source water monitoring may use a triggered
source water sample collected under R.61-58.16.E(1)(b) to meet the requirements of R.61-58.16.E(2).
Department-determined assessment source water monitoring may include, but not be limited to the
following:

    (a) Collection of a total of 12 ground water source samples that represent each month the system
provides ground water to the public.

     (b) Collection of samples from each well unless the system obtains written Department approval to
conduct monitoring at one or more wells within the ground water system that are representative of multiple
wells used by that system and that draw water from the same hydrogeologic setting.

     (c) Collection of a standard sample volume of at least 100 mL for fecal indicator analysis regardless
of the fecal indicator or analytical method used.

    (d) Analysis of all ground water source samples using one of the analytical methods listed in R.61-
58.16.E(3) for the presence of E. coli, enterococci, or coliphage.

     (e) Collection of ground water source samples at a location prior to any treatment of the ground water
source unless the Department approves a sampling location after treatment.


391 | Regulation 61-58.16
      (f) Collection of ground water source samples at the well itself unless the system’s configuration
does not allow for sampling at the well itself and the Department approves an alternate sampling location
that is representative of the water quality of that well.

  (3) Analytical methods.

     (a) A ground water system subject to the source water monitoring requirements of R.61-58.16.E(1)
must collect a standard sample volume of at least 100 ml for fecal indicator analysis regardless of the fecal
indicator or analytical method used.

    (b) A ground water system must analyze all ground water source samples collected under R.61-
58.16.E(1) for E.coli, enterococci, or coliphage using EPA-approved methods listed in 40 CFR
141.402(c)(2) (Federal Register 11-8-2006 edition).

  (4) Invalidation of a fecal indicator positive ground water source sample.

    (a) A ground water system may obtain Department invalidation of a fecal indicator positive ground
water source sample collected under R.61-58.16.E(1) only under the conditions specified as follows:

      (i) The system provides the Department with written notice from the laboratory that improper
sample analysis occurred.

        (ii) The Department determines and documents in writing that there is substantial evidence that a
fecal indicator positive ground water source sample is not related to source water quality.

     (b) If the Department invalidates a fecal indicator positive ground water source sample, the ground
water system must collect another source water sample under R.61- 58.16.E(1) within 24 hours of being
notified by the Department of its invalidation decision and have it analyzed for the same fecal indicator
using the analytical methods listed in 40 CFR 141.402(c)(2) (Federal Register 11-8-2006 edition). The
Department may extend the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis if the system cannot collect the
source water sample within 24 hours due to circumstances beyond its control. In the case of an extension,
the Department will specify how much time the system has to collect the sample.

  (5) Sampling location.

     (a) Any ground water source sample required under R.61-58.16.E(1) must be collected at a location
prior to any treatment of the groundwater source unless the Department approves a sampling location after
treatment.

      (b) If the system’s configuration does not allow for sampling at the well itself, the system may collect
a sample at a Department-approved location to meet the requirements under R.61-58.16.E(1) if the sample
is representative of the water quality of that well.

   (6) New sources. If directed by the Department, a ground water system that places a new ground water
source into service after November 30, 2009, must conduct assessment source water monitoring under R.61-
58.16.E(2). If directed by the Department, the system must begin monitoring before the ground water source
is used to provide water to the public.

392 | Regulation 61-58.16
  (7) Public notification. A ground water system with a ground water source sample collected under R.61-
58.16.E(1) or (2) that is fecal indicator positive and that is not invalidated under R.61- 58.16.E(4), including
consecutive systems served by the ground water source, must conduct public notification under R.61-
58.6.E(2).

  (8) Monitoring violations. Failure to meet the requirements of R.61-58.16.E(1) through (6) is a
monitoring violation and requires the ground water system to provide public notification under R.61-
58.6.E(4).

F. Treatment technique requirements for ground water systems.

  (1) Ground water systems with significant deficiencies or source water fecal contamination.

    (a) The treatment technique requirements of R.61-58.16.F must be met by ground water systems
when a significant deficiency is identified or when a ground water source sample collected under R.61-
58.16.E(1)(c) is fecal indicator positive.

    (b) If directed by the Department, a ground water system with a ground water source sample collected
under R.61-58.16.E(1)(b), R.61-58.16.E(1)(d), or R.61-58.16.E(2) that is fecal indicator positive must
comply with the treatment technique requirements of R.61-58.16.F.

      (c) When a significant deficiency is identified at a Subpart H public water system that uses both
ground water and surface water or GWUDI, the system must comply with R.61-58.16.F except in cases
where the Department determines that the significant deficiency is in a portion of the distribution system
that is served solely by surface water or GWUDI.

     (d) Unless the Department directs the ground water system to implement a specific corrective action,
the ground water system must consult with the Department regarding the appropriate corrective action
within 30 days of receiving written notice from the Department of a significant deficiency, written notice
from a laboratory that a ground water source sample collected under R.61-58.16.E(1)(c) was found to be
fecal indicator positive, or direction from the Department that a fecal indicator positive sample collected
under R.61-58.16.E(1)(b), R.61-58.16.E(1)(d), or R.61-58.16.E(2) requires corrective action. For the
purposes of R.61-58.16, significant deficiencies include, but are not limited to, defects in design, operation,
or maintenance, or a failure or malfunction of the sources, treatment, storage, or distribution system that
the Department determines to be causing, or have the potential for causing, the introduction of
contamination into the water delivered to consumers.

     (e) Within 120 days, or earlier if directed by the Department, of receiving written notification from
the Department of a significant deficiency, written notice from a laboratory that a ground water source
sample collected under R.61-58.16.E.(1)(c) was found to be fecal indicator positive, or direction from the
Department that a fecal indicator positive sample collected under R.61-58.16.E(1)(b), R.61-58.16.E(1)(d),
or R.61-58.16.E(2) requires corrective action, the ground water system must either:

       (i) Have completed corrective action in accordance with applicable Department plan review
processes or other Department guidance or direction, if any, including Department-specified interim
measures; or


393 | Regulation 61-58.16
        (ii) Be in compliance with a Department-approved corrective action plan and schedule subject to
the following conditions:

         (A) Any subsequent modifications to a Department-approved corrective action plan and schedule
must also be approved by the Department.

          (B) If the Department specifies interim measures for the protection of public health pending
Department approval of the corrective action plan and schedule or pending completion of the corrective
action plan, the system must comply with these interim measures as well as with any schedule specified by
the Department.

    (f) Corrective action alternatives. Ground water systems that meet the conditions of R.61-
58.16.F(1)(a) or (b) must implement one or more of the following corrective action alternatives:

       (i)   Correct all significant deficiencies.

       (ii) Provide an alternate source of water.

       (iii) Eliminate the source of contamination.

        (iv) Provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation,
removal, or a Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the
first customer for the ground water source.

     (g) Special notice to the public of significant deficiencies or source water fecal contamination.

        (i) In addition to the applicable public notification requirements of R.61- 58.6.E(2), a community
ground water system that receives notice from the Department of a significant deficiency or notification of
a fecal indicator positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated by the Department must inform
the public served by the water system under R.61-58.12.C(11)(f) of the fecal indicator positive source
sample or of any significant deficiency that has not been corrected. The system must continue to inform the
public annually until the significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal contamination in the ground water
source is determined by the Department to be corrected under R.61- 58.16.F(1)(e).

       (ii) In addition to the applicable public notification requirements of R.61- 58.6.E(2), a non-
community ground water system that receives notice from the Department of a significant deficiency must
inform the public served by the water system in a manner approved by the Department of any significant
deficiency that has not been corrected within 12 months of being notified by the Department, or earlier if
directed by the Department. The system must continue to inform the public annually until the significant
deficiency is corrected. The information must include:

         (A) The nature of the significant deficiency and the date the significant deficiency was identified
by the Department.

          (B) The Department-approved plan and schedule for correction of the significant deficiency,
including interim measures, progress to date, and any interim measures completed.


394 | Regulation 61-58.16
          (C) For systems with a large proportion of non-English speaking consumers, as determined by
the Department, information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance of the notice or a
telephone number or address where consumers may contact the system to obtain a translated copy of the
notice or assistance in the appropriate language.

       (iii) If directed by the Department, a non-community water system with significant deficiencies that
have been corrected must inform its customers of the significant deficiencies, how the deficiencies were
corrected, and the dates of correction under R.61-58.16.F(1)(g)(ii).

  (2) Compliance monitoring

     (a) Existing ground water sources. A ground water system that is not required to meet the source
water monitoring requirements of R.61-58.16 because it provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using
inactivation, removal, or a Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)
before or at the first customer for any ground water source before December 1, 2009, must notify the
Department in writing that it provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a
Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer
for the specified ground water source and begin compliance monitoring in accordance with R.61-
58.16.F(2)(c) by December 1, 2009. Notification to the Department must include engineering, operational,
or other information that the Department requests to evaluate the submission. If the system subsequently
discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a Department-approved
combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for a ground water
source, the system must conduct ground water source monitoring as required under R.61-58.16.E.

      (b) New ground water sources. A ground water system that places a ground water source in service
after November 30, 2009, that is not required to meet the source water monitoring requirements of R.61-
58.16 because the system provides at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a
Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer
for the ground water source must comply with all of the requirements of R.61-58.16.F(2)(b)(i) to (iii).

       (i) The system must notify the Department in writing that it provides at least 4-log treatment of
viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a Department- approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation
and removal) before or at the first customer for the ground water source. Notification to the Department
must include engineering, operational, or other information that the Department requests to evaluate the
submission.

       (ii) The system must conduct compliance monitoring under R.61- 58.16.F(2)(c) within 30 days of
placing the source in service.

       (iii) The system must conduct ground water source monitoring under R.61-58.16.E if the system
subsequently discontinues 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a Department-
approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for the ground
water source.

     (c) Monitoring requirements. A ground water system subject to the requirements of R.61-58.16.F(1),
R.61-58.16.F(2)(a), or R.61-58.16.F(2)(b) must monitor the effectiveness and reliability of treatment for
that ground water source before or at the first customer as follows:

395 | Regulation 61-58.16
       (i)     Chemical disinfection

          (A) A ground water system that serves greater than 3,300 people must continuously monitor the
residual disinfectant concentration using analytical methods specified in 40 CFR 141.74(a)(2) at a location
approved by the Department and must record the lowest residual disinfectant concentration each day that
the water from the ground water source is served to the public. The ground water system must maintain the
Department determined residual disinfectant concentration every day the ground water system serves the
water from the ground water source to the public. If there is a failure in the continuous monitoring
equipment, the ground water system must conduct grab sampling every four hours until the continuous
monitoring equipment is returned to service. The system must resume continuous residual disinfectant
monitoring within 14 days.

          (B) A ground water system that serves 3,300 or fewer people must monitor the residual
disinfectant concentration using analytical methods specified in 40 CFR 141.74(a)(2) at a location approved
by the Department and record the residual disinfection concentration each day that the water from the
ground water source is served to the public. The ground water system must maintain the Department-
determined residual disinfectant concentration every day the ground water system serves water from the
ground water source to the public. The ground water system must take a daily grab sample during the hour
of peak flow or at another time specified by the Department. If any daily grab sample measurement falls
below the Department-determined residual disinfectant concentration, the ground water system must take
follow up samples every four hours until the residual disinfectant concentration is restored to the
Department-determined level. Alternatively, a ground water system that serves 3,300 or fewer people may
monitor continuously and meet the requirements of R.61-58.16.F.(2)(c)(i)(A).

         (ii) Membrane filtration. A ground water system that uses membrane filtration to meet the
requirements of R.61-58.16 must monitor the membrane filtration process in accordance with all
Department-specified monitoring requirements and must operate the membrane filtration in accordance
with all Department-specified compliance requirements. A ground water system that uses membrane
filtration is in compliance with the requirement to achieve at least 4-log removal of viruses when the
following conditions are met:

          (A) The membrane has an absolute molecular weight cut-off or an alternate parameter that
describes the exclusion characteristics of the membrane that can reliably achieve at least 4-log removal of
viruses.

         (B) The membrane process is operated in accordance with Department-specified compliance
requirements.

             (C) The integrity of the membrane is intact.

       (iii) Alternative treatment. A ground water system that uses a Department- approved alternative
treatment to meet the requirements of R.61-58.16 by providing at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using
inactivation, removal, or a Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal)
before or at the first customer must:



396 | Regulation 61-58.16
         (A) Monitor the alternative treatment in accordance with all Department-specified monitoring
requirements.

        (B) Operate the alternative treatment in accordance with all compliance requirements that the
Department determines to be necessary to achieve at least 4-log treatment of viruses.

   (3) A ground water system may discontinue 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or
a Department-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer
for a ground water source if the Department determines and documents in writing that 4-log treatment of
viruses is no longer necessary for that ground water source. A system that discontinues 4-log treatment of
viruses is subject to the source water monitoring and analytical methods requirements of R.61-58.16.E.

  (4) Failure to meet the monitoring requirements of R.61-58.16.F(2) is a monitoring violation and
requires the ground water system to provide public notification under R.61-58.6.E(4).

G. Treatment technique violations for ground water systems.

  (1) A ground water system with a significant deficiency is in violation of the treatment technique
requirement if, within 120 days (or earlier if directed by the Department) of receiving written notice from
the Department of the significant deficiency, the system:

    (a) Does not complete corrective action in accordance with any applicable Department plan review
processes or other Department guidance and direction, including Department specified interim actions and
measures, or

     (b) Is not in compliance with a Department-approved corrective action plan and schedule.

  (2) Unless the Department invalidates a fecal indicator positive ground water source sample under R.61-
58.16.E(4), a ground water system is in violation of the treatment technique requirement if, within 120 days
(or earlier if directed by the Department) of meeting the conditions of R.61-58.16.F(1)(a) or R.61-
58.16.F(1)(b), the system:

    (a) Does not complete corrective action in accordance with any applicable Department plan review
processes or other Department guidance and direction, including Department-specified interim measures,
or

     (b) Is not in compliance with a Department-approved corrective action plan and schedule.

   (3) A ground water system subject to the requirements of R.61-58.16.F(2)(c) that fails to maintain at
least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a Department-approved combination of 4-
log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer for a ground water source is in violation
of the treatment technique requirement if the failure is not corrected within four hours of determining the
system is not maintaining at least 4-log treatment of viruses before or at the first customer.

   (4) Ground water systems must give public notification under R.61-58.6.E(3) for the treatment
technique violations specified in R.61-58.16.G(1), G(2), and G(3).


397 | Regulation 61-58.16
H. Reporting and recordkeeping for ground water systems.

  (1) Reporting. In addition to the requirements of R.61-58.6.B, a ground water system regulated under
R.61-58.16 must provide the following information to the Department:

     (a) A ground water system conducting compliance monitoring under R.61- 58.16.F(2) must notify
the Department any time the system fails to meet any Department- specified requirements including, but
not limited to, minimum residual disinfectant concentration, membrane operating criteria or membrane
integrity, and alternative treatment operating criteria, if operation in accordance with the criteria or
requirements is not restored within four hours. The ground water system must notify the Department as
soon as possible, but in no case later than the end of the next business day.

     (b) After completing any corrective action under R.61-58.16.F(1), a ground water system must notify
the Department within 30 days of completion of the corrective action.

     (c) If a ground water system subject to the requirements of R.61-58.16.E(1) does not conduct source
water monitoring under R.61-58.16.E(1)(e)(ii), the system must provide documentation to the Department
within 30 days of the total coliform positive sample that it met the Department criteria.

  (2) Recordkeeping. In addition to the requirements of R.61-58.6.D, a ground water system regulated
under R.61-58.16 must maintain the following information in its records:

    (a) Documentation of corrective actions shall be kept for a period of not less than ten years.

     (b) Documentation of notice to the public as required under R.61-58.16.F(1)(g) shall be kept for a
period of not less than three years.

     (c) Records of decisions under R.61-58.16.E(1)(e)(ii) and records of invalidation of fecal indicator
positive ground water source samples under R.61-58.16.E(4) shall be kept for a period of not less than five
years.

     (d) For consecutive systems, documentation of notification to the wholesale system(s) of total
coliform-positive samples that are not invalidated under R.61 58.5.G(3) until April 1, 2016, or under R.61-
58.17.D beginning April 1, 2016, shall be kept for a period of not less than five years.

    (e) For systems, including wholesale systems, that are required to perform compliance monitoring
under R.61-58.16.F(2):

        (i) Records of the Department-specified minimum disinfectant residual shall be kept for a period
of not less than ten years.

        (ii) Records of the lowest daily residual disinfectant concentration and records of the date and
duration of any failure to maintain the Department- specified minimum residual disinfectant concentration
for a period of more than four hours shall be kept for a period of not less than five years.

      (iii) Records of Department-specified compliance requirements for membrane filtration and of
parameters specified by the Department for Department-approved alternative treatment and records of the

398 | Regulation 61-58.16
date and duration of any failure to meet the membrane operating, membrane integrity, or alternative
treatment operating requirements for more than four hours shall be kept for a period of not less than five
years.




399 | Regulation 61-58.16
                                REVISED TOTAL COLIFORM RULE

A. Applicability.

  The provisions of R.61-58.17 apply to all community and non-community public water systems.

B. General Requirements.

  (1) General.

  The provisions of R.61-58.17 include both maximum contaminant level and treatment technique
requirements.

  (2) Compliance date.

  Systems must comply with the provisions of R.61-58.17 beginning April 1, 2016, unless otherwise
specified in R.61-58.17.

  (3) Violations of State Primary Drinking Water Regulations.

  Failure to comply with the applicable requirements of this regulation R.61-58.17 shall constitute a
violation of the State Primary Drinking Water Regulations.

C. Analytical Methods and Laboratory Certification

  (1) Analytical methodology.

      (a) The standard sample volume required for analysis, regardless of analytical method used, is 100
ml.

     (b) Systems need only determine the presence or absence of total coliforms and E. coli; a
determination of density is not required.

     (c) The time from sample collection to initiation of test medium incubation may not exceed 30 hours.
Systems are encouraged but not required to hold samples below 10 deg. C during transit.

     (d) If water having residual chlorine (measured as free, combined, or total chlorine) is to be analyzed,
sufficient sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) must be added to the sample bottle before sterilization to
neutralize any residual chlorine in the water sample. Dechlorination procedures are addressed in Section
9060A.2 of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (20th and 21st editions).

     (e) Systems must conduct total coliform and E. coli analyses in accordance with one of the analytical
methods in 40 CFR 141.852 or one of the alternative methods listed in Appendix A to subpart C of CFR
141.

  (2) Laboratory Certification.


400 | Regulation 61-58.17
  Systems must have all compliance samples required under R.61-58.17 analyzed by a laboratory certified
by the EPA or the Department to analyze drinking water samples. The laboratory used by the system must
be certified for each method (and associated contaminant(s)) used for compliance monitoring analyses
under this rule.

D. General Monitoring Requirements for All Public Water Systems.

  (1) Sample siting plans.

     (a) Systems must develop a written sample siting plan that identifies sampling sites and a sample
collection schedule that are representative of water throughout the distribution system not later than March
31, 2016. These plans are subject to Department review and revision. Systems must collect total coliform
samples according to the written sample siting plan. Monitoring required by R.61-58.17.E through R.61-
58.17.I may take place at a customer’s premise, dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance
sampling location. Routine and repeat sample sites and any sampling points necessary to meet the
requirements of R.61-58.16 must be reflected in the sampling plan.

     (b) Systems must collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that systems
that use only ground water and serve 4,900 or fewer people may collect all required samples on a single
day if they are taken from different sites.

     (c) Systems must take at least the minimum number of required samples even if the system has had
an E. coli MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in R.61-58.17.J(1).

     (d) A system may conduct more compliance monitoring than is required by R.61-58.17 to investigate
potential problems in the distribution system and use monitoring as a tool to assist in uncovering problems.
A system may take more than the minimum number of required routine samples and must include the results
in calculating whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in R.61-58.17.J(1)(a)(i) and (ii) has been
exceeded only if the samples are taken in accordance with the existing sample siting plan and are
representative of water throughout the distribution system.

     (e) Systems must identify repeat monitoring locations in the sample siting plan. Unless the provisions
of R.61-58.17.D(1)(e)(i) or (1)(e)(ii) are met, the system must collect at least one repeat sample from the
sampling tap where the original total coliform- positive sample was taken, and at least one repeat sample at
a tap within five service connections upstream and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service
connections downstream of the original sampling site. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of
the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system
must still take all required repeat samples. However, the Department may allow an alternative sampling
location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the
original sampling site. Except as provided for in R.61-58.17.D (1)(e)(ii), systems required to conduct
triggered source water monitoring under R.61-58.16.E(1) must take ground water source sample(s) in
addition to repeat samples required under R.61-58.17.

        (i) Systems may propose repeat monitoring locations to the Department that the system believes
to be representative of a pathway for contamination of the distribution system. A system may elect to specify
either alternative fixed locations or criteria for selecting repeat sampling sites on a situational basis in a
standard operating procedure (SOP) in its sample siting plan. The system must design its SOP to focus the

401 | Regulation 61-58.17
repeat samples at locations that best verify and determine the extent of potential contamination of the
distribution system area based on specific situations. The Department may modify the SOP or require
alternative monitoring locations as needed.

        (ii) Ground water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people may propose repeat sampling locations
to the Department that differentiate potential source water and distribution system contamination (e.g., by
sampling at entry points to the distribution system). A ground water system with a single well required to
conduct triggered source water monitoring may, with written Department approval, take one of its repeat
samples at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring under R.61-58.16.E(1)
if the system demonstrates to the Department’s satisfaction that the sample siting plan remains
representative of water quality in the distribution system. If approved by the Department, the system may
use that sample result to meet the monitoring requirements in both R.61-58.16.E(1) and this section R.61-
58.17.D.

           (A) If a repeat sample taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water
monitoring is E. coli-positive, the system has violated the E. coli MCL and must also comply with R.61-
58.16.E(1)(c). If a system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for
triggered source water monitoring, the system may reduce the number of additional source water samples
required under R.61- 58.16.E(1)(c) by the number of repeat samples taken at that location that were not E.
coli-positive.

           (B) If a system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for
triggered source water monitoring under R.61- 58.16.E(1), and more than one repeat sample is E. coli-
positive, the system has violated the E. coli MCL and must also comply with R.61- 58.16.F(1)(a).

           (C) If all repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water
monitoring are E. coli-negative and a repeat sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one
required for triggered source water monitoring is E. coli-positive, the system has violated the E. coli MCL,
but is not required to comply with R.61- 58.16.E(1)(c).

      (f) The Department may review, revise, and approve, as appropriate, repeat sampling proposed by
systems under R.61-58.17.D(1)(e)(i) and (ii). The system must demonstrate that the sample siting plan
remains representative of the water quality in the distribution system. The Department may determine that
monitoring at the entry point to the distribution system (especially for undisinfected ground water systems)
is effective to differentiate between potential source water and distribution system problems.

  (2) Special purpose samples.

   Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfection practices are sufficient
following pipe placement, replacement, or repair, must not be used to determine whether the coliform
treatment technique trigger has been exceeded. Repeat samples taken pursuant to R.61-58.17.I are not
considered special purpose samples, and must be used to determine whether the coliform treatment
technique trigger has been exceeded.

  (3) Invalidation of total coliform samples.



402 | Regulation 61-58.17
  A total coliform-positive sample invalidated under R.61-58.17.D(3) does not count toward meeting the
minimum monitoring requirements of this R.61-58.17.

    (a) The Department may invalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if the conditions of R.61-
58.17.D(3)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) are met.

          (i)   The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused the total coliform-positive
result.

        (ii) The Department, on the basis of the results of repeat samples collected as required under R.61-
58.17.I(1), determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other non-
distribution system plumbing problem. The Department cannot invalidate a sample on the basis of repeat
sample results unless all repeat sample(s) collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive
sample are also total coliform-positive, and all repeat samples collected at a location other than the original
tap are total coliform negative (e.g., the Department cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample on
the basis of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total coliform negative, or if the system has only
one service connection).

        (iii) The Department has substantial grounds to believe that a total coliform- positive result is due
to a circumstance or condition that does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case, the
system must still collect all repeat samples required under R.61-58.17.I(1), and use them to determine
whether a coliform treatment technique trigger in R.61-58.17.J has been exceeded. To invalidate a total
coliform-positive sample under this paragraph, the decision and supporting rationale must be documented
in writing, and approved and signed by the supervisor of the Department official who recommended the
decision. The Department must make this document available to EPA and the public. The written
documentation must state the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample, and what action the
system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem. The Department may not invalidate a total coliform-
positive sample solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform negative.

     (b) A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless total coliforms are detected) if the
sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas
formation is examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique), produces a turbid culture in the
absence of an acid reaction in the Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent growth or
produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter (e.g.,
Membrane Filter Technique). If a laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the system
must collect another sample from the same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notified
of the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system must
continue to re-sample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed until it obtains a valid result. The
Department may waive the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, the Department may
implement criteria for waiving the 24-hour sampling time limit to use in lieu of case-by-case extensions.

E. Routine monitoring requirements for non-community water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people using
only ground water.

  (1) General.



403 | Regulation 61-58.17
     (a) The provisions of this section apply to non-community water systems using only ground water
(except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in R.61-58.B - Definitions) and
serving 1,000 or fewer people.

    (b) Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of this section, systems
must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in R.61-58.17.I.

     (c) Once all monitoring required by this section R.61-58.17.E and R.61-58.17.I for a calendar month
has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified
in R.61-58.17.J have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments
as required by R.61-58.17.J.

     (d) For the purpose of determining eligibility for remaining on or qualifying for quarterly monitoring
under the provisions of R.61-58.17.E(6)(d) and (7)(b), respectively, of this section R.61-58.17.E for
transient non-community water systems, the Department may elect to not count monitoring violations under
R.61-58.17.K(3)(a) if the missed sample is collected no later than the end of the monitoring period
following the monitoring period in which the sample was missed. The system must collect the make-up
sample in a different week than the routine sample for that monitoring period and should collect the sample
as soon as possible during the monitoring period. The Department may not use this provision under R.61-
58.17.E(8). This authority does not affect the provisions of R.61-58.17.K(3)(a) and R.61-58.17.L(1)(d).

  (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms.

  Systems must monitor each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public, except for
seasonal systems or as provided under R.61-58.17.E(3) through R.61-58.17.E(8) and R.61- 58.17.E(10).
Seasonal systems must meet the monitoring requirements of R.61-58.17.E(9).

  (3) Transition to R.61-58.17 - Revised Total Coliform Rule.

     (a) Systems, including seasonal systems, must continue to monitor according to the total coliform
monitoring schedules under R.61-58.5.G(1) that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the
conditions for increased monitoring in R.61-58.17.E(6) are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless
otherwise directed by the Department.

     (b) Beginning April 1, 2016, the Department must perform a special monitoring evaluation during
each sanitary survey to review the status of the system, including the distribution system, to determine
whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the Department has performed the
special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey, the Department may modify the system’s
monitoring schedule, as necessary, or it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule,
consistent with the provisions of R.61-58.17.E. The Department may not allow systems to begin less
frequent monitoring under the special monitoring evaluation unless the system has already met the
applicable criteria for less frequent monitoring in R.61-58.17.E. For seasonal systems on quarterly or annual
monitoring, this evaluation must include review of the approved sample siting plan, which must designate
the time period(s) for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods of highest
demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). The seasonal system must collect compliance samples
during these time periods.


404 | Regulation 61-58.17
  (4) Annual site visits.

  Beginning no later than calendar year 2017, systems on annual monitoring, including seasonal systems,
must have an initial and recurring annual site visit by the Department that is equivalent to a Level 2
assessment or an annual voluntary Level 2 assessment that meets the criteria in R.61-58.17.J(2) to remain
on annual monitoring. The periodic required sanitary survey may be used to meet the requirement for an
annual site visit for the year in which the sanitary survey was completed.

   (5) Criteria for annual monitoring. Beginning April 1, 2016, the Department may reduce the monitoring
frequency for a well-operated ground water system from quarterly routine monitoring to no less than annual
monitoring, if the system demonstrates that it meets the criteria for reduced monitoring in R.61-
58.17.E(5)(a) through (5)(c), except for a system that has been on increased monitoring under the provisions
of R.61-58.17.E(6). A system on increased monitoring under R.61-58.17.E(6) must meet the provisions of
R.61-58.17.E(7) to go to quarterly monitoring and must meet the provisions of R.61- 58.17.E(8) to go to
annual monitoring.

     (a) The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months;

      (b) The most recent sanitary survey shows that the system is free of sanitary defects or has corrected
all identified sanitary defects, has a protected water source, and meets approved construction standards; and

      (c) The Department has conducted an annual site visit within the last 12 months and the system has
corrected all identified sanitary defects. The system may substitute a Level 2 assessment that meets the
criteria in R.61-58.17.J(2) for the Department annual site visit.

  (6) Increased Monitoring Requirements for systems on quarterly or annual monitoring.

  A system on quarterly or annual monitoring that experiences any of the events identified in R.61-
58.17.E(6)(a) through (6)(d) must begin monthly monitoring the month following the event. A system on
annual monitoring that experiences the event identified in R.61-58.17.E(6)(e) must begin quarterly
monitoring the quarter following the event. The system must continue monthly or quarterly monitoring
until the requirements in R.61-58.17.E(7) for quarterly monitoring or R.61-58.17.E(8) for annual
monitoring are met. A system on monthly monitoring for reasons other than those identified in R.61-
58.17.E(6)(a) through (6)(d) is not considered to be on increased monitoring for the purposes of R.61-
58.17.E(7) and (8).

    (a) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments under the provisions of
R.61-58.17.J in a rolling 12-month period.

     (b) The system has an E. coli MCL violation.

     (c) The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.

     (d) The system has two monitoring violations under R.61-58.17 or one monitoring violation under
R.61-58.17 and one Level 1 assessment under the provisions of R.61-58.17.J in a rolling 12-month period
for a system on quarterly monitoring.


405 | Regulation 61-58.17
    (e) The system has one monitoring violation under R.61-58.17 for a system on annual monitoring.

  (7) Requirements for returning to quarterly monitoring.

  The Department may reduce the monitoring frequency for a system on monthly monitoring triggered
under R.61-58.17.E(6) to quarterly monitoring if the system meets the criteria in R.61- 58.17.E(7)(a) and
(7)(b).

     (a) Within the last 12 months, the system must have a completed sanitary survey or a site visit by the
Department or a voluntary Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the Department, be free of sanitary
defects, and have a protected water source; and

    (b) The system must have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months.

  (8) Requirements for systems on increased monitoring to qualify for annual monitoring.

  The Department may reduce the monitoring frequency for a system on increased monitoring under R.61-
58.17.E(6) if the system meets the criteria in R.61-58.17.E(7) plus the criteria in R.61- 58.17.E(8)(a) and
(8)(b).

    (a) An annual site visit by the Department and correction of all identified sanitary defects. The system
may substitute a voluntary Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the Department for the Department
annual site visit in any given year.

     (b) The system must have in place or adopt one or more additional enhancements to the water system
barriers to contamination in R.61-58.17.E(8)(b)(i) through (8)(b)(v).

       (i)   Cross connection control, as approved by the Department.

        (ii) An operator certified by the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation -
Environmental Certification Board or regular visits by a circuit rider certified by an appropriate State
certification program.

       (iii) Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution
system in accordance with criteria specified by the Department.

       (iv) Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses as provided
for under R.61-58.16.F(2)(c).

       (v) Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as approved by the Department.

  (9) Seasonal systems.

     (a) Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal systems must demonstrate completion of a Department-
approved start-up procedure, which may include a requirement for startup sampling prior to serving water
to the public.


406 | Regulation 61-58.17
    (b) A seasonal system must monitor every month that it is in operation unless it meets the criteria in
R.61-58.17.E(9)(b)(i) through (iii) to be eligible for monitoring less frequently than monthly beginning
April 1, 2016, except as provided under R.61- 58.17.E(3).

       (i) Seasonal systems monitoring less frequently than monthly must have an approved sample siting
plan that designates the time period for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during
periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). Seasonal systems must collect
compliance samples during this time period.

       (ii) To be eligible for quarterly monitoring, the system must meet the criteria in R.61-58.17.E(7).

       (iii) To be eligible for annual monitoring, the system must meet the criteria under R.61-58.17.E(8).

     (c) The Department may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of the requirements for
seasonal systems if the entire distribution system remains pressurized during the entire period that the
system is not operating, except that systems that monitor less frequently than monthly must still monitor
during the vulnerable period designated by the Department.

  (10) Additional routine monitoring the month following a total coliform-positive sample.

   Systems collecting samples on a quarterly or annual frequency must conduct additional routine
monitoring the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1
treatment technique trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month,
except that the Department may waive this requirement if the conditions of R.61-58.17.E(10)(a), (b), or (c)
are met. Systems may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect
all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. Systems must use the
results of additional routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations under R.61-
58.17.J(1).

     (a) The Department may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in
which the system provides water to the public if the Department, or an agent approved by the Department,
performs a site visit before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to the public.
Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the
Department to determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The
Department cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an
agent approved by the Department to perform sanitary surveys.

     (b) The Department may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in
which the system provides water to the public if the Department has determined why the sample was total
coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem
before the end of the next month in which the system serves water to the public. In this case, the Department
must document this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing,
have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the Department official who recommends such a decision,
and make this document available to the EPA and public. The written documentation must describe the
specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take
to correct this problem.


407 | Regulation 61-58.17
     (c) The Department may not waive the requirement to collect three additional routine samples the
next month in which the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples
are total coliform negative. If the Department determines that the system has corrected the contamination
problem before the system takes the set of repeat samples required in R.61-58.17.I, and all repeat samples
were total coliform negative, the Department may waive the requirement for additional routine monitoring
the next month.

F. Routine monitoring requirements for community water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people using only
ground water.

  (1) General.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to community water systems using only ground water (except
ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in R.61-58.B - Definitions) and serving
1,000 or fewer people.

    (b) Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of this section, systems
must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in R.61-58.17.I.

     (c) Once all monitoring required by this section and R.61-58.17.I for a calendar month has been
completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in R.61-
58.17.J have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as
required by R.61-58.17.J.

  (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms.

  The monitoring frequency for total coliforms is one sample per month, except as provided for under
R.61-58.17.F(3) through (6).

  (3) Transition to R.61-58.17 - Revised Total Coliform Rule.

     (a) All systems must continue to monitor according to the total coliform monitoring schedules under
R.61-58.5.G that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the conditions in R.61-58.17.F(5) are
triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless otherwise directed by the Department.

     (b) Beginning April 1, 2016, the Department must perform a special monitoring evaluation during
each sanitary survey to review the status of the system, including the distribution system, to determine
whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the Department has performed the
special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey, the Department may modify the system’s
monitoring schedule, as necessary, or it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule,
consistent with the provisions of R.61-58.17.F. The Department may not allow systems to begin less
frequent monitoring under the special monitoring evaluation unless the system has already met the
applicable criteria for less frequent monitoring in R.61-58.17.F.

  (4) Criteria for reduced monitoring.



408 | Regulation 61-58.17
      (a) The Department may reduce the monitoring frequency from monthly monitoring to no less than
quarterly monitoring if the system is in compliance with Department- certified operator provisions and
demonstrates that it meets the criteria in R.61- 58.17.F(4)(a)(i) through (4)(a)(iii). A system that loses its
certified operator must return to monthly monitoring the month following that loss.

       (i)     The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months.

       (ii) The most recent sanitary survey shows the system is free of sanitary defects (or has an approved
plan and schedule to correct them and is in compliance with the plan and the schedule), has a protected
water source and meets approved construction standards.

       (iii) The system meets at least one of the following criteria:

          (A) An annual site visit by the Department that is equivalent to a Level 2 assessment or an annual
Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the Department and correction of all identified sanitary defects
(or an approved plan and schedule to correct them and is in compliance with the plan and schedule).

             (B) Cross connection control, as approved by the Department.

         (C) Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution
system in accordance with criteria specified by the Department.

         (D) Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses as
provided for under R.61-58.16.F(2)(c).

             (E) Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as approved by the Department.

     (b) Reserved

  (5) Return to routine monthly monitoring requirements.

 Systems on quarterly monitoring that experience any of the events in R.61-58.17.F(5)(a) through (5)(d)
must begin monthly monitoring the month following the event. The system must continue monthly
monitoring until it meets the reduced monitoring requirements in R.61-58.17.F(4).

    (a) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or triggers two Level 1 assessments in a rolling 12-
month period.

     (b) The system has an E. coli MCL violation.

     (c) The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.

     (d) The system has two monitoring violations under R.61-58.17 in a rolling 12- month period.

  (6) Additional routine monitoring the month following a total coliform-positive sample.



409 | Regulation 61-58.17
   Systems collecting samples on a quarterly frequency must conduct additional routine monitoring the
month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique
trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month, except that the
Department may waive this requirement if the conditions of R.61-58.17.F(6)(a), (b), or (c) are met. Systems
may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine
samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. Systems must use the results of additional
routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations.

     (a) The Department may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in
which the system provides water to the public if the Department, or an agent approved by the Department,
performs a site visit before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to the public.
Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the
Department to determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The
Department cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an
agent approved by the Department to perform sanitary surveys.

     (b) The Department may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in
which the system provides water to the public if the Department has determined why the sample was total
coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem
before the end of the next month in which the system serves water to the public. In this case, the Department
must document this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing,
have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the Department official who recommends such a decision,
and make this document available to the EPA and the public. The written documentation must describe the
specific cause of the total coliform- positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take
to correct this problem.

     (c) The Department may not waive the requirement to collect three additional routine samples the
next month in which the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples
are total coliform negative. If the Department determines that the system has corrected the contamination
problem before the system takes the set of repeat samples required in R.61-58.17.I, and all repeat samples
were total coliform negative, the Department may waive the requirement for additional routine monitoring
the next month.

G. Routine monitoring requirements for subpart H public water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people.

  (1) General.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to subpart H public water systems serving 1,000 or fewer
people.

     (b) Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of R.61- 58.17.G,
systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in R.61-
58.17.I.

   (c) Once all monitoring required by this section and R.61-58.17.I for a calendar month has been
completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in R.61-


410 | Regulation 61-58.17
58.17.J have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as
required by R.61-58.17.J.

     (d) Seasonal systems.

        (i) Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal systems must demonstrate completion of a Department-
approved start-up procedure, which may include a requirement for start-up sampling prior to serving water
to the public.

       (ii) The Department may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of the requirements for
seasonal systems if the entire distribution system remains pressurized during the entire period that the
system is not operating.

  (2) Routine monitoring frequency for total coliforms.

 Subpart H systems (including consecutive systems) must monitor monthly. Systems may not reduce
monitoring.

  (3) Unfiltered subpart H systems.

  A subpart H system that does not practice filtration in compliance with R.61-58.10 must collect at least
one total coliform sample near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the source water,
measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(2)(b), exceeds 1 NTU. When one or more turbidity measurements
in any day exceed 1 NTU, the system must collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first
exceedance, unless the Department determines that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's
control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection and identifies an alternative sample
collection schedule. Sample results from this coliform monitoring must be included in determining whether
the coliform treatment technique trigger in R.61-58.17.J has been exceeded.

H. Routine monitoring requirements for public water systems serving more than 1,000 people.

  (1) General.

     (a) The provisions of R.61-58.17.H apply to public water systems serving more than 1,000 persons.

     (b) Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of R.61- 58.17.H,
systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and E. coli analytical requirements in R.61-
58.17.I.

     (c) Once all monitoring required by this section and R.61-58.17.I for a calendar month has been
completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in R.61-
58.17.J have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as
required by R.61-58.17.J.

     (d) Seasonal systems.



411 | Regulation 61-58.17
        (i) Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal systems must demonstrate completion of a Department-
approved start-up procedure, which may include a requirement for start-up sampling prior to serving water
to the public.

       (ii) The Department may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of the requirements for
seasonal systems if the entire distribution system remains pressurized during the entire period that the
system is not operating.

  (2) Monitoring frequency for total coliforms.

   The monitoring frequency for total coliforms is based on the population served by the system, as
follows:

         MINIMUM NUMBER OF POPULATION                             MINIMUM NUMBER OF SERVED
                                                                  SAMPLES PER MONTH
                 1,001          to                2,500                2
                 2,501          to                3,300                3
                 3,301          to                4,100                4
                 4,101          to                4,900                5
                 4,901          to                5,800                6
                 5,801          to                6,700                7
                 6,701          to                7,600                8
                 7,601          to                8,500                9
                 8,501          to                12,900               10
                 12,901         to                17,200               15
                 17,201         to                21,500               20
                 21,501         to                25,000               25
                 25,001         to                33,000               30
                 33,001         to                41,000               40

                 50,001         to                59,000               60
                 59,001         to                70,000               70
                 70,001         to                83,000               80
                 83,001         to                96,000               90
                 96,001         to                130,000              100
                 130,001        to                220,000              120
                 220,001        to                320,000              150
                 320,001        to                450,000              180
                 450,001        to                600,000              210
                 600,001        to                780,000              240
                 780,001        to                970,000              270

                 3,960,001 or more                                     480


412 | Regulation 61-58.17
  (3) Unfiltered subpart H systems.

  A subpart H system that does not practice filtration in compliance with R.61-58.10 must collect at least
one total coliform sample near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the source water,
measured as specified in R.61-58.10.F(2)(b), exceeds 1 NTU. When one or more turbidity measurements
in any day exceed 1 NTU, the system must collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first
exceedance, unless the Department determines that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's
control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection and identifies an alternative sample
collection schedule. Sample results from this coliform monitoring must be included in determining whether
the coliform treatment technique trigger in R.61-58.17.J has been exceeded.

  (4) Reduced monitoring.

   Systems may not reduce monitoring, except for non-community water systems using only ground water
(and not ground water under the direct influence of surface water) serving 1,000 or fewer people in some
months and more than 1,000 persons in other months. In months when more than 1,000 persons are served,
the systems must monitor at the frequency specified in paragraph R.61-58.17.H(2). In months when 1,000
or fewer people are served, the Department may reduce the monitoring frequency, in writing, to a frequency
allowed under R.61-58.17.E for a similarly situated system that always serves 1,000 or fewer people, taking
into account the provisions in R.61-58.17.E(5) through (7).

I. Repeat monitoring and E. coli requirements.

  (1) Repeat monitoring.

     (a) If a sample taken under R.61-58.17.E though R.61-58.17.H is total coliform- positive, the system
must collect a set of repeat samples within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result. The system
must collect no fewer than three repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample found. The
Department may extend the 24-hour limit on a case-by-case basis if the system has a logistical problem in
collecting the repeat samples within 24 hours that is beyond its control. Alternatively, the Department may
implement criteria for the system to use in lieu of case-by-case extensions. In the case of an extension, the
Department must specify how much time the system has to collect the repeat samples. The Department
cannot waive the requirement for a system to collect repeat samples in R.61-58.17.I(1)(a) through (1)(c).

     (b) The system must collect all repeat samples on the same day, except that the Department may
allow a system with a single service connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a three-
day period or to collect a larger volume repeat sample(s) in one or more sample containers of any size, as
long as the total volume collected is at least 300 ml.

     (c) The system must collect an additional set of repeat samples in the manner specified in R.61-
58.17.I(1)(a) through (1)(c) if one or more repeat samples in the current set of repeat samples is total
coliform-positive. The system must collect the additional set of repeat samples within 24 hours of being
notified of the positive result, unless the Department extends the limit as provided in R.61-58.17.I(1)(a).
The system must continue to collect additional sets of repeat samples until either total coliforms are not
detected in one complete set of repeat samples or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique
trigger specified in R.61-58.17.J(1) has been exceeded as a result of a repeat sample being total coliform-
positive and notifies the Department. If a trigger identified in R.61-58.17.J is exceeded as a result of a

413 | Regulation 61-58.17
routine sample being total coliform- positive, systems are required to conduct only one round of repeat
monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample.

     (d) After a system collects a routine sample and before it learns the results of the analysis of that
sample, if it collects another routine sample(s) from within five adjacent service connections of the initial
sample, and the initial sample, after analysis, is found to contain total coliforms, then the system may count
the subsequent sample(s) as a repeat sample instead of as a routine sample.

     (e) Results of all routine and repeat samples taken under R.61-58.17.E through R.61-
58.17.I not invalidated by the Department must be used to determine whether a coliform treatment
technique trigger specified in R.61-58.17.J has been exceeded.

  (2) Escherichia coli (E. coli) testing.

     (a) If any routine or repeat sample is total coliform-positive, the system must analyze that total
coliform-positive culture medium to determine if E. coli are present. If E. coli are present, the system must
notify the Department by the end of the day when the system is notified of the test result, unless the system
is notified of the result after the Department office is closed and the Department does not have either an
after-hours phone line or an alternative notification procedure, in which case the system must notify the
Department before the end of the next business day.

      (b) The Department has the discretion to allow a system, on a case-by-case basis, to forgo E. coli
testing on a total coliform-positive sample if that system assumes that the total coliform-positive sample is
E. coli-positive. Accordingly, the system must notify the Department as specified in R.61-58.17.I(2)(a) and
the provisions of R.61-58.5.F(3) apply.

J. Coliform treatment technique triggers and assessment requirements for protection against potential fecal
contamination.

  (1) Treatment technique triggers.

   Systems must conduct assessments in accordance with R.61-58.17.J(2) of this section after exceeding
treatment technique triggers in R.61-58.17.J(1)(a) and (1)(b).

     (a) Level 1 treatment technique triggers.

       (i) For systems taking 40 or more samples per month, the system exceeds 5.0% total coliform-
positive samples for the month.

       (ii) For systems taking fewer than 40 samples per month, the system has two or more total coliform-
positive samples in the same month.

      (iii) The system fails to take every required repeat sample after any single total coliform-positive
sample.

     (b) Level 2 treatment technique triggers.


414 | Regulation 61-58.17
       (i)   An E. coli MCL violation, as specified in R.61-58.17.K(1).

        (ii) A second Level 1 trigger as defined in R.61-58.17.J(1)(a), within a rolling 12-month period,
unless the Department has determined a likely reason that the samples that caused the first Level 1 treatment
technique trigger were total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem.

       (iii) For systems with approved annual monitoring, a Level 1 trigger in two consecutive years.

  (2) Requirements for assessments.

     (a) Systems must ensure that Level 1 and 2 assessments are conducted in order to identify the possible
presence of sanitary defects and defects in distribution system coliform monitoring practices. Level 2
assessments must be conducted by parties approved by the Department.

     (b) When conducting assessments, systems must ensure that the assessor evaluates minimum
elements that include review and identification of inadequacies in sample sites; sampling protocol; sample
processing; atypical events that could affect distributed water quality or indicate that distributed water
quality was impaired; changes in distribution system maintenance and operation that could affect distributed
water quality (including water storage); source and treatment considerations that bear on distributed water
quality, where appropriate (e.g., small ground water systems); and existing water quality monitoring data.
The system must conduct the assessment consistent with any Department directives that tailor specific
assessment elements with respect to the size and type of the system and the size, type, and characteristics
of the distribution system.

     (c) Level 1 Assessments.

  A system must conduct a Level 1 assessment consistent with Department requirements if the system
exceeds one of the treatment technique triggers in R.61-58.17.J(1)(a).

        (i) The system must complete a Level 1 assessment as soon as practical after any trigger in R.61-
58.17.J(1)(a). In the completed assessment form, the system must describe sanitary defects detected,
corrective actions completed, and a proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed.
The assessment form may also note that no sanitary defects were identified. The system must submit the
completed Level 1 assessment form to the Department within 30 days after the system learns that it has
exceeded a trigger.

       (ii) If the Department reviews the completed Level 1 assessment and determines that the
assessment is not sufficient (including any proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already
completed), the Department must consult with the system. If the Department requires revisions after
consultation, the system must submit a revised assessment form to the Department on an agreed- upon
schedule not to exceed 30 days from the date of the consultation.

       (iii) Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the system, the Department must
determine if the system has identified a likely cause for the Level 1 trigger and, if so, establish that the
system has corrected the problem, or has included a schedule acceptable to the Department for correcting
the problem.


415 | Regulation 61-58.17
    (d) Level 2 Assessments.

   A system must ensure that a Level 2 assessment consistent with Department requirements is conducted
if the system exceeds one of the treatment technique triggers in R.61- 58.17.J(1)(b). The system must
comply with any expedited actions or additional actions required by the Department in the case of an E.
coli MCL violation.

        (i) The system must ensure that a Level 2 assessment is completed by the Department or by a party
approved by the Department as soon as practical after any trigger in R.61-58.17.J(1)(b). The system must
submit a completed Level 2 assessment form to the Department within 30 days after the system learns that
it has exceeded a trigger. The assessment form must describe sanitary defects detected, corrective actions
completed, and a proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed. The assessment form
may also note that no sanitary defects were identified.

        (ii) The system may conduct Level 2 assessments if the system has staff or management with the
certification or qualifications specified by the Department unless otherwise directed by the Department.

       (iii) If the Department reviews the completed Level 2 assessment and determines that the
assessment is not sufficient (including any proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already
completed), the Department must consult with the system. If the Department requires revisions after
consultation, the system must submit a revised assessment form to the Department on an agreed- upon
schedule not to exceed 30 days.

       (iv) Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the system, the Department must
determine if the system has identified a likely cause for the Level 2 trigger and determine whether the
system has corrected the problem, or has included a schedule acceptable to the Department for correcting
the problem.

  (3) Corrective Action.

   Systems must correct sanitary defects found through either Level 1 or 2 assessments conducted under
R.61-58.17.J(2). For corrections not completed by the time of submission of the assessment form, the
system must complete the corrective action(s) in compliance with a timetable approved by the Department
in consultation with the system. The system must notify the Department when each scheduled corrective
action is completed.

  (4) Consultation.

   At any time during the assessment or corrective action phase, either the water system or the Department
may request a consultation with the other party to determine the appropriate actions to be taken. The system
may consult with the Department on all relevant information that may impact on its ability to comply with
a requirement of R.61-58.17, including the method of accomplishment, an appropriate timeframe, and other
relevant information.

K.Violations

  (1) E. coli MCL Violation.

416 | Regulation 61-58.17
  A system is in violation of the MCL for E. coli when any of the conditions identified in R.61-
58.17.K(1)(a) through (1)(d) occur.

    (a) The system has an E. coli-positive repeat sample following a total coliform- positive routine
sample.

    (b) The system has a total coliform-positive repeat sample following an E. coli- positive routine
sample.

    (c) The system fails to take all required repeat samples following an E. coli-positive routine sample.

    (d) The system fails to test for E. coli when any repeat sample tests positive for total coliform.

  (2) Treatment technique violation.

      (a) A treatment technique violation occurs when a system exceeds a treatment technique trigger
specified in R.61-58.17.J(1) and then fails to conduct the required assessment or corrective actions within
the timeframe specified in R.61-58.17.J(2) and (3).

    (b) A treatment technique violation occurs when a seasonal system fails to complete a Department-
approved start-up procedure prior to serving water to the public.

  (3) Monitoring violations.

    (a) Failure to take every required routine or additional routine sample in a compliance period is a
monitoring violation.

     (b) Failure to analyze for E. coli following a total coliform-positive routine sample is a monitoring
violation.

  (4) Reporting violations.

    (a) Failure to submit a monitoring report or completed assessment form after a system properly
conducts monitoring or assessment in a timely manner is a reporting violation.

    (b) Failure to notify the Department following an E. coli-positive sample as required by R.61-
58.17.I(2)(a) in a timely manner is a reporting violation.

     (c) Failure to submit certification of completion of Department-approved start-up procedure by a
seasonal system is a reporting violation.

L. Reporting and recordkeeping.

  (1) Reporting.

    (a) E. coli.

417 | Regulation 61-58.17
       (i) A system must notify the Department by the end of the day when the system learns of an E.
coli MCL violation, unless the system learns of the violation after the Department office is closed and the
Department does not have either an after-hours phone line or an alternative notification procedure, in which
case the system must notify the Department before the end of the next business day, and notify the public
in accordance with R.61-58.6.

        (ii) A system must notify the Department by the end of the day when the system is notified of an
E. coli-positive routine sample, unless the system is notified of the result after the Department office is
closed and the Department does not have either an after-hours phone line or an alternative notification
procedure, in which case the system must notify the Department before the end of the next business day.

     (b) A system that has violated the treatment technique for coliforms in R.61-58.17.J must report the
violation to the Department no later than the end of the next business day after it learns of the violation, and
notify the public in accordance with R.61-58.6.

     (c) A system required to conduct an assessment under the provisions of R.61-58.17.J must submit
the assessment report within 30 days. The system must notify the Department in accordance with R.61-
58.17.J(3) when each scheduled corrective action is completed for corrections not completed by the time
of submission of the assessment form.

     (d) A system that has failed to comply with a coliform monitoring requirement must report the
monitoring violation to the Department within 10 days after the system discovers the violation, and notify
the public in accordance with R.61-58.6.

Appendix A to R.61-58.6 – Endnotes

† Until march 31, 2016
‡ Beginning April 1, 2016
1.
    Violations and other situations not listed in this table (e.g., failure to prepare Consumer Confidence
Reports), do not require notice, unless otherwise determined by the Department. The Department may, at
its option, also require a more stringent public notice tier (e.g., Tier 1 instead of Tier 2 instead of Tier 3)
for specific violations and situations listed in this Appendix, as authorized under R.61-58.6.E(2)(a) and
(3)(a).
2.
    MCL – Maximum contaminant level, MRDL – Maximum residual disinfectant level, TT – Treatment
technique.
3.
    The term Violations of State Primary Drinking Water Regulations (SPDWR) is used here to include
violations of MCL, MRDL, treatment technique, monitoring, and testing procedure requirements.
4.
   Failure to test for fecal coliform or E.coli is a Tier 1 violation if testing is not done after any repeat sample
tests positive for coliform. All other total coliform monitoring and testing procedure violations are Tier 3.
424 | Regulation 61-58
5.
     Systems that violate the turbidity MCL of 5 NTU based on an average of measurements over two
consecutive days must consult with the Department within 24 hours after learning of the violation. Based
on this consultation, the Department may subsequently decide to elevate the violation to Tier 1. If a system
is unable to make contact with the Department in the 24-hour period, the violation is automatically elevated
to Tier 1.
6.
   Systems with treatment technique violations involving a single exceedance of a maximum turbidity limit
under the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule
(IESWTR), or the Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR) are required to
consult with the Department within 24 hours after learning of the violation. Based on this consultation, the
Department may subsequently decide to elevate the violation to Tier 1. If a system is unable to make contact
with the Department in the 24-hour period, the violation is automatically elevated to Tier 1.
7.
    Most of the requirements of the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, R.61-58.10.B - C
become effective January 1, 2002 for surface water systems and ground water systems under the direct
influence of surface water serving at least 10,000 persons. However, R.61- 58.10.H(3) has some
requirements that become effective as early as April 16, 1999. The Surface Water Treatment Rule remains
in effect for systems serving at least 10,000 persons even after 2002; the Interim Enhanced Surface Water
Treatment Rule adds additional requirements and does not in many cases supersede the SWTR.
8.
   The arsenic MCL citations are effective January 23, 2006. Until then the citations are R.61-58.5(B)(2).
9.
   The arsenic Tier 3 violations MCL citations are effective January 23, 2006. Until then, the citations are
R.61-58.C(7).
10.
    Failure to take a confirmation sample within 24 hours for nitrate or nitrite after an initial sample exceeds
the MCL is a Tier 1 violation. Other monitoring violations for nitrate are Tier 3.
11.
    The uranium MCL, Tier 2 violation citations are effective December 8, 2003 for all community water
systems.
12.
    The uranium Tier 3 violation citations are effective December 8, 2000 for all community water systems.
13.
    Community and non-transient non-community surface water systems and ground water systems under
the direct influence of surface water serving 10,000 must comply with new DBP MCLs, disinfectant
MRDLs, and related monitoring requirements beginning January 1, 2002. All other community and non-
transient non-community systems must meet the MCLs and MRDLs beginning January 1, 2004. Transient
non-community surface water systems and ground water systems under the direct influence of surface water
serving 10,000 or more persons and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must comply with
the chlorine dioxide MRDL beginning January 1, 2002. Transient
non-community surface water systems and ground water systems under the direct influence of surface water
serving fewer than 10,000 persons and using only ground water not under the direct influence of surface
water and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must comply with the chlorine dioxide MRDL
beginning January 1, 2004.
14.
     R.61-58.5.L, and R.61-58.13.C(1) – (2) apply until R.61-58.14 and R.61-58.15 take effect under the
schedule in R.61-58.14.
15.
    Failure to monitor for chlorine dioxide at the entrance to the distribution system the day after exceeding
the MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is a Tier 2 violation.
16.
     If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL for chlorine
dioxide and one or more samples taken in the distribution system the next day exceed the MRDL, Tier 1
notification is required. Failure to take the required samples in the distribution system after the MRDL is
exceeded at the entry point also triggers Tier 1 notification.
17.
    Some water systems must monitor for certain unregulated contaminants listed in R.61-58.5.T
18.
    This citation refers to the requirements of R.61-58.9 that ``a schedule prescribed ….for a public water
system granted a variance [or exemption] shall require compliance by the system . . .''

425 | Regulation 61-58
19.
    In addition to R.61-58.9 specifies the items and schedule milestones that must be included in a variance
for small systems.
20.
    Other waterborne emergencies require a Tier 1 public notice under R.61-58.6.E(2)(a) for situations that
do not meet the definition of a waterborne disease outbreak given in R.61-58.B(174) but that still have the
potential to have serious adverse effects on health as a result of short-term exposure. These could include
outbreaks not related to treatment deficiencies, as well as situations that have the potential to cause
outbreaks, such as failures or significant interruption in water treatment processes, natural disasters that
disrupt the water supply or distribution system, chemical spills, or unexpected loading of possible pathogens
into the source water.
21.
    The Department may place other situations in any tier they believe appropriate, based on threat to public
health.
22.
    Failure to collect three or more samples for Cryptosporidium analysis is a Tier 2 violation requiring
special notice as specified in R.61- 58.6.E(11). All other monitoring and testing procedure violations are
Tier 3.

   There are various regulations that set turbidity standards for different types of systems, including the 1989 Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR),
the 1998 Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR), and the 2001 Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. Systems
subject to the Surface Water Treatment Rule (both filtered and unfiltered) may not exceed 5 NTU. In addition, in filtered systems, 95 percent of

   There are various regulations that set turbidity standards for different types of systems, including the 1989 Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR),
the 1998 Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR), and the 2002 Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule
(LT1ESWTR). For systems subject to the IESWTR (systems serving at least 10,000 people, using surface water or ground water under the direct
influence of surface water), that use conventional filtration or direct filtration, after January 1, 2002, the turbidity level of a system's combined filter
effluent may not exceed 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of monthly measurements, and the turbidity level of a system's combined filter effluent must
not exceed 1 NTU at any time. Systems subject to the IESWTR using technologies other than conventional, direct, slow sand, or diatomaceous earth
filtration must meet turbidity limits set by the Department. For systems subject to the LT1ESWTR (systems serving fewer than 10,000 people, using
surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water) that use conventional filtration or direct filtration, after January 1, 2005
the turbidity level of a system's combined filter effluent may not exceed 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of monthly measurements, and the turbidity
level of a system's combined filter effluent must not exceed 1 NTU at any time. Systems subject to the LT1ESWTR using technologies other than
conventional, direct, slow sand, or diatomaceous earth filtration must meet turbidity limits set by the Department.
