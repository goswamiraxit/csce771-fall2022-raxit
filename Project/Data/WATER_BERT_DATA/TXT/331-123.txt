Chapter 1: Introduction

1.0       Purpose and Scope
The Department of Health Office of Drinking Water (DOH) developed this Water System
Design Manual to establish uniform concepts for water system design and a framework
for state-licensed engineers to consistently review design documents. This manual is for
Group A public water systems regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and
state law (Chapter 246-290 WAC.) We developed separate Group B Water System
Design Guidelines 331-467, which are so small that only state law regulates them
(Chapter 246-291 WAC).
-
This manual provides guidelines and criteria for design engineers to use in preparing
portions of planning documents (WAC 246-290-100), project reports (WAC 246-290-
110), construction documents (WAC 246-290-120), and source approval documents
(WAC 246-290-130). This manual also clarifies engineering document submittal and
review requirements. Most of the requirements in this manual apply to Group A water
systems of all sizes. However, some of the design guidelines, such as the information on
demand estimation and capacity analysis in chapters 3 and 4, focus more on water
systems serving fewer than 1,000 connections.



1.1       Safety, Risk, and Reliability
Our mission is to work with others to protect the health of the people of Washington
state by ensuring safe and reliable drinking water. We believe water system owners,
operators, and design engineers share this mission.

This manual identifies design requirements and design standards for ensuring safe and
reliable drinking water sources and facilities. Where this manual doesn’t simply restate a
regulatory requirement, it reflects our best thinking on what constitutes the basis for
designing a safe, reliable, and sustainable water system—one that does not result in
exhausted water sources, empty reservoirs, premature equipment breakdowns,
contamination, low service pressures, or destructive pressure surges. While establishing
these standards, we attempted to balance the reduction of risk against the added cost
to provide that reduced risk and the capacity of water systems to maintain the
associated physical and human infrastructure. The State Board of Health’s view of a
water supplier’s responsibility to provide reliable water service is in WAC 246-290-420.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 1
A Washington state-licensed professional engineer must direct all water system design
work and all design documents must bear the professional engineer’s seal, date, and
signature (WAC 246-290-040). Our state-licensed professional engineers review
engineering documents with a focus on risk reduction and public health protection. In
reviewing engineering documents, we intend to ensure compliance with regulatory
standards. We also strive to share our collective experience to promote construction and
operation of appropriate, safe, reliable, and sustainable public water supply systems. Our
ultimate goal is to help the design engineer and water system owner build a project that
will be safe and reliable now and into the future. We do this by asking questions, exploring
risk versus available resources in the design phase, and helping water system owners and
design engineers identify potential consequences of operational failure (e.g. contamination
leading to illness, effects of health advisories, permit restriction, or legal liability).

Design engineers need to know what we think are appropriate design standards, but
they also need flexibility to approach the unique design circumstances they face. We
encourage design engineers to consider various alternatives and options, as long as the
selected approach does not conflict with regulation. If the designer’s selected approach
differs from our standards, we expect the design engineer to justify their design
decisions for us.

We are interested in hearing from readers who believe we misjudged the balance point
between cost and public health protection. Please contact one of our regional offices
with any comments or questions. We periodically review and update our design
guidance as appropriate.



1.2        Applying the Group A Rule
Our Group A Rule applies to all water systems that regularly serve 15 or more service
connections or 25 or more people per day for 60 or more days per year. Definitions of
Group A public water system types (community, nontransient noncommunity, transient
noncommunity) are in WAC 246-290-020. A water system, such as that serving people
within a large building, is not subject to our rules if the building’s water system meets all
the following criteria:
      1. It consists only of distribution or storage facilities without source or treatment
         facilities.
      2. It obtains all its water from another regulated water system.
      3. It is not an interstate passenger conveyance carrier.
      4. It does not sell water directly to any person.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    2
EPA issued policies to clarify whether the Safe Drinking Water Act applies in certain
situations. Based on our review of these policies:
      Submetering individual dwelling units within a larger multifamily building does
       not trigger regulation (chapter 246-290 WAC). We do not consider apartment
       owners who install meters (submeters) and bill their tenants for actual water
       consumption as water systems subject to regulation.
      Installing treatment within a building that serves 25 or more people per day for
       60 or more days per year does trigger regulation (chapter 246-290 WAC).
       However, depending on the purpose and type of treatment, and the size and
       type of population served, we may not require regulation of the building as a
       public water system. Please contact one of our regional offices for guidance.

We have policies to clarify and interpret state drinking water regulations. When we
published this manual, we had a number of policies that may influence water system
design and planning. We attempted to reference our policies in applicable sections of
this manual. Because we may add new policies and revise or rescind existing policies, we
encourage you to review our policy webpage to determine whether any current policies
apply to your design.

Many water systems were built before the current minimum design requirements were
established in chapter 246-290 WAC. Design engineers must use the most recent
standards and guidelines when designing new facilities or in planning expansion of an
existing system (WAC 246-290 Part 3).



1.3       “Must” versus “Should”
Throughout this manual we use “must,” “will,” “shall," or “required” when design
practice is sufficiently standardized to permit specific delineation of requirements, or
where safeguarding public health justifies definitive criteria or action (such as state
statute or rule requirements). Design engineers have an obligation to satisfy the criteria
in such instances.

“Should” or “recommend” indicate procedures, criteria, or methods that represent our
view of best practices and can be approached with some degree of flexibility. Design
engineers need to explain the basis of the altered approach or, in specific circumstances,
why another approach may be more applicable.

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  3
1.4       Engineering Requirements
Only Washington state-licensed professional engineers qualified and experienced in
design of drinking water systems may design water systems in our state (Chapter 18.43
RCW and WAC 246-290-040). There is a limited exception for federal employees who
practice engineering in Washington state for the federal government and who possess a
valid professional engineer’s license from another state (RCW 18.43.130(6)).

Engineers are professionally bound to perform work only within their own fields of
competence (WAC 196-27A-020(2)). Complex drinking water projects usually require
structural, electrical, mechanical, and other licensed professional engineers.



1.5       Minimum System Design Requirements
Design engineers must use good engineering practice (as determined by the
Washington State Professional Licensing Board) in all aspects of water system design
(WAC 246-290-200). The design engineer must consider the water system operation
under a full range of expected demands (minimum to maximum) and emergency
conditions (WAC 246-290-420). “Emergency” means a natural or man-made event that
causes damage or disrupts normal operations and requires prompt action to protect
public health and safety. Examples include fires, power outages, water main breaks,
water system component or treatment process failures, floods, or recent evidence of
contaminated drinking water.



1.6       Other Referenced Documents and Standards
We cite various waterworks-related laws, guides, standards, and other documents in this
manual to provide appropriate references. These references form a part of this manual,
but it is not our intent to duplicate them. If references are not available, this manual
defines the appropriate design procedures.

There are some waterworks industry standards and guidance documents, such as those
from the American Water Works Association (AWWA), the American Society of Civil
Engineers (ASCE), and Recommended Standards for Water Works (commonly called the
Ten State Standards). If information in this manual conflicts with any referenced
material, this manual should take precedence for purposes of designing water system
facilities to meet our requirements. We will request that the design engineer provide
adequate justification for deviation from guidelines in this manual when submitting the
project design to us for review and approval.

Where applicable, all water system designs also must comply with locally adopted
national model codes such as the International Building Code and Uniform Plumbing
Code (WAC 246-290-200).

See Appendix C for a list of professional organizations and agencies with established
standards and criteria referenced within this manual or the regulations.

Chapter 2: Project Reports and Construction Documents

2.0       General Engineering Project Submittal Requirements
Chapter 2 provides information to assist design engineers in preparing complete
engineering documents to submit for our review and approval. Complete, concise, accurate
submittals enable us to work efficiently and to meet our target review timeframe. We strive
to complete our initial review of project reports and construction documents within about
30 days. Incomplete submittals will delay the formal start of our review process.

Incomplete project submittals will result in delayed project review and may result in
increased review fees (due to the need for multiple reviews). We will return significantly
incomplete or inaccurate submittals to engineers without reviewing them. This manual
includes submittal checklists for many common projects. We suggest you reference
them before submitting your final design to us for approval. Doing so will help ensure
timely and efficient review of your submittal.

A complete submittal:
   1. Includes a completed Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149).
   2. Addresses all relevant elements identified in regulation and this manual.
   3. Articulates information clearly, concisely, and logically.



2.1       Project Reports, Construction Documents, and Planning
          Requirements
Water systems satisfy planning requirements in Chapter 246-290 WAC by preparing a
water system plan (WSP) or a small water system management program (SWSMP). The
conditions under which a water system must prepare a WSP or WSP amendment for our
review and approval are in WAC 246-290-100. Water systems not required to prepare a
WSP must develop and implement a SWSMP (WAC 246-290-105).

These planning documents provide a structured process for water systems to:
   1. Identify present and future needs.
   2. Set forth means for addressing those needs.
   3. Demonstrate the operational, technical, managerial, and financial capacity to
      achieve and maintain compliance with all relevant local, state, and federal plans
      and rules.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  6
   4. Demonstrate sufficient physical capacity and water rights for current and future
      needs. Together these comprise system capacity.

The water system planning requirement links closely with water system design. Water
systems preparing a WSP must assess system capacity, identify deficiencies, and where
needed establish an improvement plan necessary to maintain system capacity (WAC
246-290-100). Water systems preparing a SWSMP must assess its infrastructure and list
improvements associated with current and anticipated infrastructure deficiencies (WAC
246-290-105). Design engineers should reference information in a WSP or SWSMP when
preparing a project report for new facilities or modifications to existing facilities.

If a water system contemplates preparing a project report or construction documents
and the project is not included in a current, approved WSP, the water system and design
engineer should contact one of our regional offices for guidance on specific planning
requirements associated with the project.

A water system may combine project reports (but not construction documents) with a
WSP (WAC 246-290-100(3)). If all the information required for a project report (WAC
246-290-110) is in the water system’s approved WSP, a separate project report is not
required.



2.2       Submitting Project Reports and Construction Documents
Unless a project is otherwise exempt from the project report or construction document
submittal process (WAC 246-290-125), a water system proposing to construct any new
water system, or expand or improve a water system, must first submit a project report
(WAC 246-290-110) and construction document (WAC 246-290-120 and Policy J.21) to
us for review and approval. Sections 2.8 and 2.9 describe exceptions to this requirement.

Design engineers should plan to submit engineering documents to us for our approval
in paper form. At this time exceptions could be made, in advance, for small documents
(small file size) to be submitted electronically. Design engineers should consult with the
appropriate DOH review engineer prior to considering an electronic submittal.

If the construction documents will be part of a bidding package, we recommend design
engineers submit construction documents in time to complete the review before bid
solicitation starts. We expect to take about 30 calendar days to review construction
documents, measured from the date we receive a complete submittal. If the design


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 7
engineer fails to obtain approval prior to soliciting bids, the water system may have to
solicit new bids or deal with significant change orders or contract amendments.

If the initial review results in a comment letter requiring an additional submittal and
review cycle before approval, the approval timeline will extend significantly and may
result in additional review fees. Comments requiring resubmittal usually involve:
      Incomplete submittals, where basic requirements of the submittal are not met
      Errors and/or omissions
      Lack of clarity or consistency in the design
      Insufficient evidence or justification that the project objective(s) will be met


Anyone who constructs improvements to a water system without getting required prior
written approval from us, is subject to administrative penalties (WAC 246-290-050(7).
Contact one of our regional offices if you are uncertain whether the planned project
requires prior written approval.



2.3    Relationship between Project Approval and Operating
Permit
Every Group A public water system must obtain an annual operating permit (see
Chapter 246-294 WAC). Operating permit designations reflect compliance or approval
status, or both. Project report and construction document approval does not change a
water system’s operating permit designation. However, the approval of a WSP or
SWSMP, and the approval of construction documents and completion of the associated
construction may satisfy requirements necessary to maintain or improve a water
system’s compliance or approval status, and therefore maintain or change the water
system’s operating permit designation.



2.4       Project Reports
A project report describes the basis for a project and includes calculations to show how
the project will meet its objectives (WAC 246-290-110). Design engineers usually
prepare the project report before preparing construction documents. See Section 2.5
and WAC 246-290-120 for construction document requirements. Project reports must
reflect good engineering criteria and practices (WAC 246-290-200).




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    8
If you wish to receive a stamped and signed “Department of Health Approved” project
report from us, you need to submit an additional project report and request that the
additional report be stamped, signed, and returned.

The rest of Section 2.4 outlines the minimal items that should be in all project reports.
For specific project requirements, see the appropriate chapter of this manual or the
applicable sections of Chapter 246-290 WAC. The level of detail in the project report
should reflect the complexity of the project. We created checklists for several project
types (see Appendices) that detail our expectations for project report and design
submittal content.

2.4.1     Project Description
A complete and accurate project description provides us with valuable information
about the project basis, orients us for an efficient design review, and serves as an
important part of the overall design record. The project report must summarize the
following general project description information (WAC 246-290-110 (4)(a)), unless a
WSP describes it adequately:
   1. Why you propose the project and the problem or problems it will address.
   2. The recommended alternative (if applicable per Section 2.4.3), proposed
      construction schedule, estimated project cost, and financing method.
   3. The relationship of the project to other water system components.
   4. A statement of change in the physical capacity of the water system and its ability
      to serve customers, if applicable.
   5. A copy of the environmental impact statement or determination of non-
      significance, or an explanation why the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)
      does not apply to the project. See SEPA Chapter 246-03 WAC. See Section 2.4.9
      for information on SEPA.
   6. Source development information, if applicable.
   7. The type of treatment, if applicable.

2.4.2      Planning
This section discusses the relationship between planning and engineering document
submittal and review. Planning is an important element in project design. If an approved
WSP or SWSMP does not adequately address the following, the project report must
address them (WAC 246-290-110 (4)(b)):
   1. General project background, with population and water demand forecasts.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  9
   2. A service area map. Municipal water suppliers must identify their retail service
      area and their general service area on this map (WAC 246-290-106).
   3. A description of the project’s effect on neighboring water systems.
   4. Local requirements, such as flow rates and duration of fire flow.
   5. Additional management responsibilities, such as those in WAC 246-290-105, 415,
      and Chapter 246-292 WAC, Water Works Operator Certification. Also, see Section
      2.4.8.
   6. A project implementation and construction schedule, including project phasing, if
      applicable.
   7. Estimated capital and operating costs, and financing method, if applicable.
   8. A Water Rights Self-Assessment Form, if it applies to the type of project proposed.
   9. Confirmation of local government consistency (WAC 246-290-108 and Policy
      B.07).

2.4.3 Analysis of Alternatives
A comparison of alternative solutions helps to ensure the completed project meets the
project objectives (see WAC 246-290-110(4)(c)). These objectives may include minimum
life cycle costs, maximum efficiency and reliability, least lifetime maintenance, shortest
implementation schedule, or some combination of these outcomes. A poor or
nonexistent analysis of alternatives may result in the design failing to meet the project
objectives, expensive or unreliable operations, or noncompliance with operating
requirements. To the extent possible, design engineers should match engineering
solutions to the problem and the capacity of the water system to properly operate and
maintain the infrastructure.

2.4.4     Water Quality
Water quality should be the most important consideration in every water system design.
Design engineers should consider how every design element would influence quality
and public health. The project report must include a review of water quality as it relates
to the purpose of the proposed project, including results of raw and finished water
quality analyses conducted by a laboratory accredited to analyze drinking water
compliance samples in Washington state (WAC 246-290-110(4)(d)). If the project
involves water treatment or a filtration pilot study, see Chapter 11 and applicable
sections of Chapter 246-290 WAC.

Design engineers should consider water system design holistically, so that correcting
one water quality problem (e.g., replacing a source, adjusting pH, adding a chemical


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   10
disinfectant) does not lead to new or amplified water quality problems with the source
or in the distribution system. Examples of such problems include:
       Installing reverse osmosis or gaseous chlorination, or adjusting pH
        unintentionally increasing corrosivity, leading to increased levels of lead and
        copper.
       Installing a new source that has a higher pH, unintentionally precipitating iron
        and manganese in the distribution system.
       Installing a new source with a high level of disinfectant byproduct (DBP)
        precursors, unintentionally forming higher levels of DBPs in the distribution
        system.

2.4.5      Engineering Calculations
By submitting key calculations and referring to appropriate data residing elsewhere, you
support our ability to review the design efficiently. We want to ensure that the design
approach complies with the design criteria (Section 2.4.6). The project report must
include relevant technical considerations necessary to support the project, such as a
physical capacity analysis, hydraulic analysis, and sizing justification (WAC 246-290-
110(4)(f)). For guidance on ways to analyze the physical capacity of a water system, see
Chapter 4. For guidance on hydraulic analysis, see Chapter 6.

2.4.6      Design Criteria
Identifying the design criteria allows us to understand the overall project objective,
project constraints, and minimum project requirements. The project report must
describe specific design criteria (WAC 246-290-110(g) and (h)), such as:
   1. Design and construction standards, including performance standards,
      construction materials and methods, process control, and basis of sizing criteria,
      as applicable.
   2. Locally adopted design standards relevant to the project, such as fire flow
      requirements and minimum pressure throughout the distribution system.
Consult the appropriate chapters of this manual to determine whether we require any
additional engineering and design information for your project.

2.4.7      Water Rights and Other Legal Considerations
Design engineers should address legal considerations, such as land ownership and water
rights, early in project design because they can affect the viability of a project. In
preparing the project report, engineers must address water rights if the project involves
a new, replacement, or modification to a source; increased withdrawal from a source; or

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     11
an increase in the water system’s physical capacity or service area (WAC 246-290-
110(4)(e)). Design engineers should do so by completing a Water Rights Self-Assessment
Form and submitting it with the project report. We encourage design engineers and
water systems to review their water right self-assessment with the Department of
Ecology before submitting documents to us for approval.

Department of Ecology directs Washington’s water rights permitting program. Our role
is limited to ensuring design engineers include water rights information with their
submittals and sharing that information with Ecology. If a water system’s water rights
self-assessment indicates that, when complete, a project will exceed its water right
instantaneous or annual withdrawal limit, we may return the submittal and suggest the
water system consult with Ecology before resubmitting.

Water rights also play a key role in adequacy determinations Ecology and local
governments make. Our project-related correspondence (e.g., letter to acknowledge
receipt of the submittal and our letter approving the submittal) will include a statement
such as:
       DOH’s approval of your water system plan does not confer or guarantee any right
       to a specific quantity of water. The approved number of service connections is
       based on your representation of available water quantity. If the Washington
       Department of Ecology, a local planning agency, or other authority responsible for
       determining water rights and water system adequacy determines that you have use
       of less water than you represented, the number of approved connections may be
       reduced commensurate with the actual amount of water and your legal right to use
       it.

We will include such a statement in our correspondence unless, on a case-by-case basis,
our engineer determines that the project has no association with water resources, water
availability, or the approved number of connections. For example, installing a chemical
injection treatment system to an existing source, replacing an existing water main, or re-
coating the interior of a reservoir have no association with water resources, water
availability, or approved connections.

Project reports must also identify other legal issues, such as ownership, rights-of-way,
sanitary control area, and restrictive covenants (such as water-related restrictions
recorded on titles or deeds). Certain projects also may require coordination with the
local boundary review board or Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission
(WAC 246-290-110(4)(i)). Boundary review boards exist in most Washington counties.
They guide and control growth of municipalities and special purpose districts.

2.4.8      Operations and Maintenance Considerations
If the design engineer expects a project to add considerably to the water system’s
operational and maintenance responsibilities (such as reservoir, booster pump, source of
supply, and water treatment projects), the project report must include the following (see
WAC 246-290-110(4)):
   1. Describe the routine operations tasks and frequencies.
   2. Describe the preventive maintenance tasks and frequencies.
   3. Identify the estimated annual operations and maintenance costs (energy,
      equipment, labor) and life-cycle costs. Include costs in an updated water system
      budget.
   4. Explain whether the project triggers a requirement for a new or higher-level
      certified operator (Chapter 246-292 WAC) or—if creating a new water system—a
      satellite management agency (Chapter 246-295 WAC and Policy B.05)).

2.4.9      State Environmental Policy Act Requirements
Before construction, SEPA requires certain types of projects to have an environmental
impact statement, a SEPA determination of non-significance, or a document explaining
why SEPA does not apply to the project (see WAC 246-03-030(3) and Policy A.03).

These requirements apply to:
       All surface water source development.
       All water system storage facilities greater than 0.5 million gallons.
       New transmission lines longer than 1,000 feet and more than 12 inches in
        diameter located in a new right of way.
       Major extensions to existing water distribution systems that will use pipes more
        than 12 inches in diameter and increase the existing service area by more than 1-
        square mile.



2.5        Construction Documents
Construction documents, such as detailed design drawings and specifications, must
identify how a specific project will be constructed to satisfy the requirements and
conditions established in the project report or the WSP (WAC 246-290-120). See Section
2.4 and WAC 246-290-110 for project report requirements.

If you wish to receive a stamped and signed “Department of Health Approved” set of
construction documents from us, you need to submit an additional complete set of

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                13
construction documents and request that the additional set be stamped, signed, and
returned.

All construction documents should conform to the established standards of the
engineering profession. Approval of construction documents shall be in effect for two
years from the date of our approval, unless we determine the need to withdraw
approval sooner. The design engineer should contact us if construction completion
exceeds the two-year approval window, to request an extension of time for the
approval. We may apply additional design conditions before approving such an
extension.

2.5.1      Design Drawing Requirements
Design drawings submitted for our review and approval should be legible and include:
       All the information and project specifications necessary to construct the project,
        including all of its components in their proper location and orientation;
        demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations; follow standard practices;
        and satisfy the project’s objectives and the owner’s needs.
       A location plan indicating the location of the water system.
       A service-area map showing the service-area boundary and the location of each
        project element.
       Name of the project.
       Name of the legal water system owner.
       Scale.
       North arrow, where applicable.
       Date.
       Name, address, and phone number of the design engineer or consultant firm.
       Revision block with the initials of the design engineer and drafter.
       The stamp and signature of the design engineer. See Washington’s engineering
        registration requirements (WAC 246-290-040).
       Location of all applicable easements, right of ways, and property lines within the
        project area.
       Location of all existing aboveground and underground utilities and structures
        within the project impact area.
       The 100-year flood elevation within the project area, where applicable. The
        design must protect pump stations, wells, reservoirs, and treatment plants built
        with state revolving loan funds from a flood two feet higher than the 100-year
        flood elevation (WAC 246-296).

approval, stamp the submission Preliminary: For Review Only. Be sure to
communicate this to our regional staff at the time of submission. If we review and
comment on preliminary documents, we will charge for the review by applying our fee
regulation (WAC 246-290-990). We may review and comment on documents identified
as “preliminary” but we will not approve them.

2.5.2     Project Specifications
Project specifications submitted for our review and approval should include:
       All information, complemented by the design drawings, necessary to describe the
        means, methods, and standards necessary to purchase, install, and test project
        components to satisfy the project’s objectives and owner’s needs.
       Name of the project.
       Name of the municipality, association, individual, or other entity that legally owns
        the water system.
       Date.
       Name, phone number, and address of the design engineer.
       The stamp and signature of the design engineer. See Washington’s engineering
        registration requirements in WAC 246-290-040.
       A provision for the contractor to submit shop drawings for review by owners and
        design engineers.
       A detailed description of all equipment and water system start-up testing,
        disinfection and inspection (final acceptance) procedures (required by WAC 246-
        290-120(4)(c)). Cut-sheets of a product or material may not substitute for
        technical specifications.
       A summary of the means and methods for maintaining water service throughout
        the construction period, if necessary.
       Certification of components in substantial contact with potable water under
        ANSI/NSF Standard 61 is required (WAC 246-290-220).

2.5.3      Design Changes after Project Approval
Changes to an approved design could significantly alter the means, methods, objectives,
components, and even outcome of the project. Water systems must submit each
change order that significantly alters the scope of the project, drawings, or specifications


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   15
to us for review and approval (WAC 246-290-120(4)(d)). Contact the regional office
when in doubt about the need to submit design changes after approval.

Examples of changes considered “significant” and, therefore, subject to our approval:
       Change in treatment process.
       Change in type of chlorination or disinfection process used.
       Change in elevations of tank or booster stations.
       Change of materials that are in direct contact with finished water.
       Change in control systems or control strategies.
       Change in size for a storage tank.
       Change in designated pumping capacity.

Examples of insignificant change orders include minor adjustments to valve and piping
locations, piping configurations, security fencing materials, and a different pump model
with the same pumping characteristics. Design engineers may note changes not
considered “significant” on the record drawings (“as-built”). For guidance on whether a
particular change order is significant, contact the appropriate regional office.

If we do not approve significant changes to the approved project design, the engineer
cannot certify construction completion according to the approved design. See Section
2.13 for requirements to certify construction completed according to DOH-approved
construction documents.

2.5.4      Contractor-Supplied Design Components
Construction documents a design engineer submits to us for our review may refer to
construction drawings and specifications that the contractor needs to provide. If so, the
owner must submit these contractor drawings and specifications to us for review and
approval before construction begins (WAC 246-290-120(4)). We will apply the
professional engineering requirements of WAC 246-290-040 to contractor-supplied
drawings and specifications.

Examples of contractor-supplied design and construction documents that require DOH
approval:
       Reservoirs
       Skid-mounted pump stations
       Packaged water treatment plants

2.6       Coordination with Local Approving Authorities
Construction projects may be subject to local permits or approvals. Compliance with our
requirements does not guarantee compliance with local rules. Water systems must
ensure that their projects follow local approval processes (WAC 246-290-108; WAC 246-
290-120). Design engineers can usually get information on the local approval process
from county building departments and environmental health programs.



2.7       Design and Review Process
Figures 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 reflect a typical process flow-path for design and review of three
general project types. Refer to general and specific project submittal checklists in
Appendix A.3 for more detail.



2.8       Submittal Exceptions for Miscellaneous Components and
          Distribution Mains

2.8.1     Categorically Exempt
For the following types of projects, we do not require water systems to submit project
reports or construction documents to us for review and approval (WAC 246-290-125(1)):
   1. Installing hydrants, valves, fittings, meters, and backflow prevention assemblies.
   2. Repairing a water system component or replacing it with a component of similar
      capacity and materials described in the original approved design. For the
      purposes of replacing distribution mains, similar capacity includes up to one
      standard pipe size larger.
   3. Maintaining or painting surfaces not contacting potable water.

For the following components installed under the “valve” submittal exception, at a
minimum the design and specifications must meet the following standards:
   1. Automatic air-vacuum relief values installed in the distribution system: Must
      meet WAC 246-290-200(1)(c). See Chapter 6 for guidance on installation
      requirements.
   2. Backflow prevention assemblies: Must meet WAC 246-290-200(1)(g).

2.8.2      Exempt Distribution Main Projects
Water systems may elect not to submit project reports or construction documents for
new distribution mains or larger-capacity replacement mains if they meet the following
conditions (WAC 246-290-125(2)):
   1. The water system has a currently approved WSP that includes standard
      construction specifications for distribution mains and a hydraulic capacity analysis
      of the basic transmission and distribution main configuration for the water
      system.
   2. The water system maintains a completed Construction Completion Report for
      Distribution Main Projects (DOH 331-147) on file for each such project.


2.9        Submittal Exception: Distribution-Related Projects (not
           Distribution Mains)
For distribution-related projects larger and more complex than a distribution main
project, you may use the more extensive Submittal Exception Process under WAC 246-
290-125(3) if the design meets each condition. Eligible projects are limited to:
       Reservoirs
       Booster pump facilities
       Transmission mains
       Pipe linings
       Tank coatings

Water systems that meet the eligibility criteria (WAC 246-290-125(3)) and intend to
follow the submittal exception process must make an initial written request to us on the
Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149). If you intend to apply for this
submittal exemption, you should discuss the desired scope of exemption and planning
document requirements during the preplan conference with the regional planner and
engineer.

There is no submittal exception for source of supply (such as new or redeveloped wells
or springs, refurbished wells, surface water intakes, interties) or water quality treatment
projects (such as chlorination, corrosion control, filtration, iron, and manganese removal,
UV, and ozonation).

2.9.1       Design and Construction Standards for Reservoirs and Booster Pump
            Stations
To qualify for the submittal exception, the water system must include design and
construction standards for distribution-related projects in an approved WSP (WAC 246-
290-100(5)(b)).

The following items should be part of the WSP narrative:
   1. Reservoirs:
           General location of tank sites.
           Overflow and base elevations.
           Map of service area indicating elevations of service connections.
           Basis for sizing the storage volumes needed.
           Hydraulic analysis of the water system or individual pressure zones evaluating
            the storage improvements.
           Level control and alarms.
   2. Booster Pump Stations (BPS):
           General location of BPS site(s).
           Sizing basis for BPS capacity (flow and head) needed.
           Hydraulic analysis of the water system or pressure zones evaluating the effect
            of BPS operation.
           Flow, pressure, and process control.

The WSP standard specifications should include:
   1. Reservoirs
           Standard tank details, including level controls, high and low level alarm,
            external level indicator, access hatch, vent, drain, overflow (include sizing)
            drain and outfall, screens, and access ladder.
           Material specifications for tank construction together with construction
            specifications (concrete, steel, other). ANSI/NSF Standard 61 certified
            materials for all surfaces in substantial contact with the water.
           Specifications for all coatings, including application, curing, and ANSI/NSF
            compliance. Water quality testing needed before activating tanks, such as
            volatile organic chemicals, if applicable (see Appendix G).
           Leakage testing and disinfection procedures per AWWA C652 (include
            chlorinated water disposal specifications).

           Site piping plans (generic). Also include isolation valving, type and location of
            sample taps, provision to improve circulation in tanks (reduce stagnation), and
            piping material specifications for pipes under the foundation slab, in the tank
            or in the yard.
           Geotechnical considerations, such as bearing strength and seismic
            considerations.
           Water system-specific water quality concerns affecting treatment, such as
            coliform testing, chlorine residuals, pH, disinfection byproducts, and contact
            time requirements.
           Security elements.
   2. Booster Pump Stations:
           Performance specifications for booster pumps, overload capacity, and
            minimum shutoff heads.
           Electrical specifications, control strategies, and mechanisms.
           Pipe material, construction standards, and specifications for internal BPS
            piping.
           Specifications or standards for meters, control valves, and other
            appurtenances.
           General structural and construction specifications and standards for BPS
            housing.

2.9.2       Rescinding Submittal Exception Authority
We will rescind a water system’s eligibility for submittal exceptions (WAC 246-290-
125(2) and (3)) if the water system fails to maintain compliance with the eligibility criteria
or conditions. At that point, the water system must submit all engineering documents
(project reports and construction documents) to us for approval until it re-establishes
compliance with the eligibility criteria (WAC 246-290-125).



2.10        Resolving Disputed Department of Health Review Decisions
When our review engineer and the water system or consultant cannot reconcile a
difference, the water system or consultant may formally appeal our decision. We
established internal processes for these circumstances. Contact the appropriate regional
office for a complete description of the Brief Adjudicative Proceeding (BAP) process (see
Chapter 246-10 WAC).



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    23
2.11      Review Fees and Invoice
We charge fees for reviewing project documents. These fees are set in rule (WAC 246-
290-990) and may change periodically. After we complete a detailed review, we send an
approval letter or review letter to the water system with an invoice for the review fee.
We send a copy of the letter to the design engineer. A fee estimator worksheet is on our
water system design webpage.

The rule sets most of the planning and engineering document review fees. These fixed
fees cover the cost of reviewing the initial submittal and one re-submittal, if we do not
approve the initial submittal the first time. If documents require more than one re-
submittal, we will charge an additional fee for each subsequent review.

We assess an hourly fee for some of the fee-for-service activities listed in WAC 246-290-
990. We will charge the rate indicated in the rule for each hour spent on the hourly fee-
for-service activity. To minimize the cost and review time, design engineers should
ensure each submittal is as complete and accurate as possible. Use the Project Submittal
Checklists in the Appendices.



2.12      Project Approval Letter and Construction Completion
When construction documents meet all requirements, we will send an approval letter to
the system owner, with copies to the design engineer and others, as appropriate. A
typical construction-document approval includes the following enclosures:
      An invoice for the review fee, if we did not already send it.
      A Water Facilities Inventory Form, if project completion will change any
       information on the form. We will ask the water system to update and return the
       inventory form after completing the project.
      A Construction Completion Report Form (DOH 331-121).



2.13      Construction Completion Report Forms
There are three types of Construction Completion Report Form. Each form is used in
different circumstances, so it’s important to know the difference.
   1. Construction Completion Report Form (DOH 331-121). Use this form in the normal
      process of submitting documentation for a project that underwent our design
      review and approval; it certifies construction according to the DOH-approved



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 24
       design. This form applies to WAC 246-290-120(5). We will send it with the
       construction approval document referenced in Section 2.12.
   2. Construction Completion Report Form for Distribution Main Projects (DOH 331-
      147). Use this form only for distribution main projects not requiring prior written
      approval from us. The water system does not have to submit this form to us
      following construction completion. However, the water system must maintain a
      completed form on file and make it available to us upon request. This form
      applies to the submittal exception process (see Section 2.8 and WAC 246-290-
      125(2)).
   3. Construction Completion Report Form for Submittal Exception Process (DOH 331-
      146). Use this form only for distribution-related projects not requiring prior
      written approval from us. Distribution-related projects include booster pump
      stations, reservoirs, internal tank coatings, and transmission mains. The water
      system must submit this report to us after constructing a new reservoir or
      booster pump station, but only maintain a completed form on file for other
      distribution-related projects (WAC 246-290-125(3)(f)). This form applies to the
      submittal exception process (see Section 2.9 and WAC 246-290-125(3)).

If the completed project changes any information on the Water Facilities Inventory (WFI),
the water system is responsible for submitting an updated WFI with the signed
Construction Completion Report.



2.14      Record Drawings
The engineer who manages construction or inspection typically provides record
drawings to the water system when the project is complete. The water system must
maintain a complete set of record drawings and provide them to DOH on request (WAC
246-290-120(4)(e)).



2.15      Safety
Improperly designed facilities could put employees, contractors, and the public at risk. If
someone gets hurt, the water system could face a lawsuit or citations and penalties from
the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). Design engineers
should be aware of the full scope of state and federal regulation governing safe working
environments (Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act, 49.17 RCW; Occupational
Safety and Health Act).

Chapter 3: Estimating Water Demands

3.0       Applicability
Design engineers use water demand estimates to design new water systems or
additions to existing water systems. To size any water system or its component parts, an
engineer must estimate water system demand and consumers’ consumption (WAC 246-
290-221). This chapter provides basic, conservative water-demand design criteria
engineers may use if they lack information that is more appropriate.

Design engineers using historical water use records to design future water system
facilities should attempt to validate the information. Given the many variables that affect
consumer demand (see Section 3.2), design criteria based on historical data should
include a reasonable margin of safety. The more detailed the historical demand records
are, the longer the period that data covers, and the greater the designer’s confidence in
the validity of that data, the smaller the margin of safety needs to be. This basic concept
applies to every recommendation in this chapter.

This chapter has three parts:
   1. Residential Demand Estimates: Focuses on water systems where residential
      demands comprise a significant portion or all of the demand.
   2. Nonresidential Demand Estimates: Focuses on water systems where residential
      demands comprise an insignificant portion of total demand.
   3. General Considerations: Covers issues that apply to both residential and
      nonresidential demand estimates.



3.1       Demand versus Consumption
It is important for design engineers to differentiate between the productive
requirements of a water system and total consumptive demand. The difference in these
two values includes the volumetric loss through distribution system leakage (DSL). The
rule defines DSL percentage (WAC 246-290-820(2)) and the industry uses Equation 3-3
to determine DSL volume. For some existing water systems, DSL may be substantial
enough that ignoring its contribution to productive requirements would create a
meaningful deficit in design. Such a deficit might constrain the ability to operate within
approved design parameters. When designing new water systems, we expect design
engineers to consider the future state of the distribution system, and make an
appropriate allowance for DSL.

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  27
Part 1: Residential Demand Estimates

3.2       Consumer Demand
An equivalent residential unit (ERU) is central to the evaluation and design of water
systems with significant residential demand. An ERU is a system-specific unit of measure
used to express the amount of water consumed by a typical full-time single-family
residence (WAC 246-290-010). This value is particular to the existing water system that
derived it. In this manual, we refer to an ERU value reflecting various demand scenarios.
   ERU MDD is the amount of water a typical full-time single-family residence consumes
    during high demand. It approximates the maximum daily demand of a typical full-
    time single-family home. It is the ERU value used in a physical capacity assessment
    (see Chapter 4).
   ERU ADD value approximates the average daily demand of a typical full-time single-
    family residence. The ERUADD value may be used in assessing factors bounded
    annually, such as a water supply safe annual yield and a water right annual volume
    (Qa).

For most water systems, consumer consumption accounts for a significant majority of
water that the system’s supply must produce. In order of preference, the information
sources for estimating consumer’s consumption are:
1. Actual metered records, if the design engineer considers that data complete and
   accurate (see WAC 246-290-221(1)).
    a. Information on water production should be available from every existing Group A
       public water system. The requirements to install and maintain source meters and
       to read source meters at least once per month (WAC 246-290-100, -105, and -
       496, and WAC 173-173-060) have been in place for many years.
    b. Most community water systems have service meters. As of January 2017, all
       community water suppliers with 15 or more connections must install service
       meters, and must calculate and report distribution system leakage (WAC 246-
       290-820). We consider this primary consumptive data for an individual water
       system most applicable for projecting future consumer consumptive use if the
       data is complete and accurate, and the design engineer takes into account full-
       time and part-time consumers when evaluating this data.
2. Comparable metered data from an analogous water system, if the system serves all
   or almost all full-time residential customers. For elements we consider important
   when considering consumptive data from an existing system in the design of a new
   one, see WAC 246-290-221(3)(a) and Section 3.2.3.
3. The consumer demand criteria presented in this chapter and in Appendix D.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                28
The design engineer should assess the degree of confidence in the validity of available
data. The smaller the degree of confidence, the larger the design’s margin of safety
needs to be.

3.2.1     Evaluating Actual Water Demand
The analysis of historical water demand should include these considerations:

1. Use actual water demand information. Base additional services on actual water
   demands. Water systems cannot justify new services solely by committing to
   implement a water-use efficiency program. See Section 3.8.
2. Use multiple years of data. Base the historical water production and consumption
   analysis on meter readings covering at least two, but preferably more years. The
   meter readings should include daily production metered data for the peak usage
   period and weekly or monthly usage during the rest of the year. Most community
   water systems experience peak demand from June through September. Other water
   systems, such as ski resorts, may experience peak demand during the winter.
   For most water systems, the historical water use analysis must quantify distribution
   system leakage and total authorized consumption (WAC 246-290-820). See Section
   3.8 for information on distribution system leakage and authorized consumption.
   Keep in mind system-wide ADD and MDD production data include consumption plus
   distribution system leakage as defined in WAC 246-290-820.
3. Correlate data with occupancy. Water demand data must be correlated with the
   number of full- and part-time residential service connections actually in use when
   the data was collected (WAC 246-290-221(1)). To quantify residential demands more
   clearly, the analysis should separate industrial, commercial, or other water demands
   from residential demands.
4. Anticipate changes that might increase demand. The analysis should address
   potential changes in demand (see Section 3.5).
5. Normalize data based on climatic conditions. Review rainfall and temperature
   data to verify their effect on water system demand. Rainfall and cool weather usually
   decrease water demand; and hot, dry weather usually increases water demand
   (unless a system imposes drought restrictions). Appendix C includes climatological
   organizations (NOAA, Office of the State Climatologist, and Western Regional
   Climate Center) with data that may assist with determining how current-year
   precipitation compares with historic weather patterns.
   Design engineers should compare water demand data to historical climate
   information to determine if it is necessary to adjust historical demand data up or
   down. Summer temperature and precipitation data from the Office of the

   Washington State Climatologist will tell whether the data period was an unusually
   wet/cool summer, average, or what was considered a hot/dry summer. Visit
   http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/summary/Climsmwa.html, and use the statewide map to get
   precipitation and temperature data for the nearest gauging station.
        a. Water production and consumption data over wet/cool summer(s). In such
           cases, it would be appropriate to look at an expanded period of metered-use
           data, or adjust the calculated ERUADD and ERUMDD values higher, to account
           for the hotter, drier summers that will inevitably follow.
        b. Water production and consumption data over hot/dry summer(s). In such
           cases, it would be inappropriate to dismiss the data as “worst case” unless the
           rainfall and temperature represented conditions approaching a two-standard
           deviation difference from the mean as measured over many years. A hot, dry
           summer that isn’t a statistical anomaly is considered a normal operating
           condition. In addition, under this condition, engineers must design water
           system facilities to meet performance standards in WAC 246-290 Part 3.

3.2.2      Full-Time and Part-Time Single-Family Residential Users
We prefer that design engineers estimate ERUMDD based on consumptive use. If
consumptive use data is unavailable or considered invalid, then design engineers can
use source meter data to estimate ERUMDD if all customers are single-family residential,
all residences are occupied full time, and the design engineer acknowledges that the
ERUMDD value includes consumption and DSL. When customers occupy homes
intermittently, dividing total production by the total number of homes may significantly
underestimate future demand, as part-time customers become full-time customers.

Water demand design data must correlate to the number of full-time or part-time
equivalent residential units in service at any time (WAC 246-290-221(1)). “Full-time” is a
permanent place of residence. “Part-time” is a vacation home, used only seasonally, such
as on holidays or weekends. The rule makes this distinction because water systems
designed only for part-time residences may convert gradually over time to full-time
residences (due to retirement, changing housing markets, and other factors).

We will not approve a water system for part-time residential use unless obligatory
covenants or other binding agreements prohibit full-time occupancy. Water systems
designed only for part-time residences cannot expect to provide service levels adequate
for full-time occupancy. Future demand assigned to each proposed residential dwelling
unit must reflect full-time occupancy (WAC 246-290-221 (2)). Give the same
consideration to each existing part-time residence. This concept reduces concerns
associated with part-time residents changing to “full-time” without sufficient water

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 30
supply and delivery facilities. This concept also applies to part-time versus full-time
multifamily residences.

Obtaining source meter records over any selected period is relatively straightforward.
However, determining occupancy levels during that same period can be quite difficult.
Water systems can use the following approaches to correlate source meter data with
estimated occupancy levels. Each of these approaches has shortcomings, so we
recommend using more than one to achieve an appropriate safety factor based on the
degree of uncertainty.
   Survey customers. Very small water systems with about 50 or fewer connections
    may be able to use a survey to estimate daily or weekly occupancy for a short period
    of time when they can rigorously take meter readings. If the primary capacity
    limitation is associated with MDD, the survey could focus on the expected peak-
    demand period of summer.
   Service meter records. Many water systems have service meters, and all municipal
    water suppliers must install meters on their direct service connections (WAC 246-
    290-496(2)). Water systems usually read service meters monthly, bimonthly, or
    quarterly. The frequency of meter reading limits the outcome of this method. In one
    comprehensive study, median indoor residential water use ranged from 54 to 64
    gallons per capita per day for several communities throughout the United States
    (Mayer et al. 1999). When water use for a residence falls significantly below this
    range, residents probably occupy the dwelling intermittently. Reviewing service
    meter records may help you select the time to use an intensive meter-reading
    program to correlate demand with occupancy.
   Assume full occupancy on holidays. For some small recreational water systems, it
    may be reasonable to assume full occupancy during certain times of the year, such
    as Memorial Day or Labor Day weekends. Other water systems may be able to
    assume full occupancy on other days. Meter readings on those days, especially if the
    water system assumes high demands will occur, could help to estimate peak day
    demand. You should supplement this approach with a customer survey on these
    target weekends.
   Demand patterns. Demands that vary significantly between billing periods could
    indicate an intermittently occupied residence.
   Tax, voting, and other public records. These may help to determine occupancy
    levels. However, there are several shortcomings to using public records to estimate
    occupancy. For example, people who live part-time in Washington and part-time in a
    warmer climate appear as full-time residents on assessor and voting records. Rental
    properties are another example. Similar to vacation homes, the assessor sends tax

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    31
   records for rental properties to owners at their primary residences. Renters may not
   register to vote where they reside.

When using service meter records to establish the ERU MDD value, be sure to account for
any part-time uses that occurred during the record-keeping period (such as the
maximum month). You should use only residences occupied full time during the time of
metered data collection. Be sure to confirm the correlation between meter information
and the various types of service (residential versus nonresidential) when determining the
ERUMDD value for the water system.

3.2.3     Analogous Water Systems
Lacking metered water-use records, engineers may use comparable water use data from
an analogous water system (WAC 246-290-221(3)) to design a new water system.
Because existing water systems must have and read source meters (WAC 246-290-221),
there is generally no need to look elsewhere for appropriate production or demand
information. We consider analogous system information, when available, the best
information to use when designing a new water system.

To be analogous, water systems must have similar characteristics (WAC 246-290-
221(3)(a)). Characteristics include:
1. Population and development pattern. Demographics are the vital statistics of
   human populations such as size, growth, density, and distribution. Demographics
   change with the nature of the development. Population densities differ from single-
   family to multifamily residences, from housing provided for families to housing
   provided for single occupancy, and from individual lots to mobile home park
   developments.
2. Lot size. A major factor in water use related to larger lot sizes is in the irrigated area
   (lawns, gardens, and agricultural uses). However, it is possible to Xeriscape (use
   native flora, rockery, and pavement) multi-acre tracts with very little need for
   supplemental irrigation.
3. Climactic zone. Climate significantly effects water use. High temperatures and low
   precipitation usually lead to an increase in water use. To be analogous, water
   systems should have similar monthly and average annual temperature and
   precipitation. In areas where freezing temperatures are prevalent in winter, high
   demands may occur if users allow faucets to run to prevent freezing. You can also
   expect water demand to increase during the winter for water systems serving winter
   use activities, such as a ski resort.
4. Cost of water service. Water pricing structure relates to the use of “inclining block
   rates” versus “declining block rates.” Both require using individual meters. For “flat
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    32
   rates,” meters are often absent and analogous water demands are more difficult to
   predict. To be analogous, the existing and proposed water systems should provide
   the same level of metering and have similar rate structures.
5. Water conservation standards. The analogous water system’s conservation
   practices should be the same as the proposed water system. These practices include,
   but are not limited to, alternate day watering schedules, installing low-water-use
   fixtures, toilet-tank displacement devices, leak detection, and water demand
   reduction programs. Water use restrictions should mirror voluntary or mandatory
   curtailment measures requested of analogous water system consumers. These may
   be in community covenants, bylaws, local ordinances, or on property deeds. It is very
   important to determine whether the restrictions are enforceable. A legal opinion may
   be necessary to determine equivalent enforceability.
6. Soil type and community landscape standards. Soil types and landscaping can
   affect irrigation demands. Moisture retention and evaporation losses from sands and
   gravels differ from loams, silts, and clays. When designing a water system, engineers
   should check with the local Cooperative Extension office to determine and evaluate
   variables that may affect water demand. For example, water demands for
   landscaping vary largely between natural flora and more water-dependent plants.
7. Maintenance practices. Engineers should consider the analogous water system’s
   maintenance practices. These practices include the seasonality, frequency of, and
   volume of water used for line flushing, exercising hydrants and valves, and cleaning
   tanks.

There are more reasons for water-use patterns to vary between water systems.
Sociological factors play a role. It is nearly impossible for a design engineer to predict
the mind-set or water use ethic of consumers on a new water system. When basing a
water system design on characteristics analogous to another water system, we
recommend conservative water demand estimates. A safety factor is appropriate even if
the proposed water system has the same enforceable water use efficiency practices and
use restrictions as the identified analogous water system. It may be wise to discuss this
design approach with the regional engineer early in the design phase of a project.

3.2.4     DOH Default Water Demand Design Criteria (Appendix D)
Residential demand is the largest portion of total demand for most water systems. The
design engineer with adequate historical service or source meter records can usually
estimate residential demands with reasonable accuracy. It is also important for
engineers to estimate nonresidential demands related to industrial, commercial, and
similar types of uses.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 33
For new water systems or existing systems with inaccurate or insufficient records, and
without analogous system information to draw from, the design engineer may use the
information in Appendix D to estimate ERUADD and ERUMDD for residential connections
(WAC 246-290-221(3)). Limitations on using water demand estimating criteria in
Appendix D:
   ERUADD reflects consumptive use data (it does not include DSL), and therefore
    ERUMDD generated under Appendix D excludes DSL.
   The information in Appendix D does not specifically address commercial and
    industrial demands. Design engineers should use information in Table 3-2 for
    nonresidential consumer demand.
   Appendix D data does not adequately represent large-lot irrigation demands.
    Engineers designing new water systems that intend to serve residents who will use
    the public water system to irrigate lots greater than ½ acre should undertake a
    detailed estimate of ERUMDD. We recommend applying a value of 350 gallons per day
    to address in-house domestic demand (see Section 3.4.1) plus a detailed assessment
    of irrigation demand based on estimated irrigation demands in Table 3-2 or other
    published reference specific to the area, climate, and soil type.



3.3       Water System Demand
Maximum daily demand (MDD) is the highest actual or estimated quantity of water that
is, or is expected to be, used over a twenty-four hour period, excluding unusual events or
emergencies (WAC 246-290-010 defines).

For the purposes of this manual, we take a broad view of MDD as it applies to the term
“used.” We consider MDD to be the system-wide peak daily production requirement
necessary to meet the consumptive demands of all types of connections; other
intentional uses not associated with a connection; and the quantity of water lost
through leakage or illicit uses. When we refer to MDD in this manual, we mean the
maximum daily source production/treatment required within a 24-hour period to meet
all these withdrawals from the distribution system. Fire suppression is not a component
of MDD. Engineers must design water system source and treatment so that together
they can satisfy the maximum daily demand (WAC 246-290-222).

Average daily demand (ADD) is the total quantity of water used from all sources of
supply as measured or estimated over a calendar year divided by 365 (WAC 246-290-
010).



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                34
We take a broad view of ADD as it applies to the term “used.” We consider ADD to be
the system-wide average daily production requirement needed to meet the
consumptive demands of all types of connections; other intentional uses not associated
with a connection; and the water lost through leakage or illicit uses. When we use the
term “ADD” in this manual we mean the source production/treatment required to meet
all these withdrawals from the distribution system during an entire year divided by 365.

Design engineers using advanced analysis of complex demand scenarios may need to
analyze the component elements of MDD or ADD separately. For example, identifying
demand by customer class (such as MDD residential, MDD commercial).



3.4        Estimating Water System Demands
Engineers need to establish water demand estimates, with an appropriate factor of
safety, to assess the adequacy of the water system’s source and treatment capacity; to
assess the adequacy of the water system’s water rights; and to size pumping equipment,
transmission lines, distribution mains, and water storage facilities properly.

Water systems must read source meters at least monthly (WAC 246-290-100(4)(b),
105(4)(h), and WAC 173-173-060). Design engineers must use metered production
records to quantify MDD and ADD for most water systems (WAC 246-290-221). For new
water systems without metered data, design engineers can use analogous water system
data or the information in Appendix D to estimate the ERU MDD and ERUADD.

Design engineers must assess the adequacy of the water system’s water right, especially
the attributes of annual volume (Qa) and instantaneous withdrawal (Qi) (WAC 246-290-
110(4)). Qa is associated with ADD, and Qi is associated with MDD. See examples in
Section 3.12.

3.4.1      Maximum Day Demand
Ideally, the water system can provide the design engineer with daily production records
from each source of supply. A design engineer who can only rely on monthly source
meter records will need a peaking factor to estimate the system-wide MDD from the
maximum month’s average day demand (MMADD).

Based on our analysis of 79 water systems in Washington, we recommend the following
MDD to MMADD ratio:
       1.65 for systems serving fewer than 1,000 people
       1.35 for systems serving 1,000 to 100,000 people
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                               35
We recommend using an MDD to MMADD ratio between 1.35 and 1.65 for water
systems near the 1,000-person threshold. Appendix D.3 describes the results of this
analysis in more detail. For new water residential-only systems without metered data,
design engineers can use analogous water system data or the information in Appendix
D.1 to estimate the ERUMDD.

In general, the lower limit for ERUMDD is 350 gallons/day/residential connection (WAC
246-290-221(4)). This demand estimate is consistent with the Department of Ecology on
household water uses for developments that prohibit irrigation. There may be some
projects with sufficient verified information (meter records, at least two years of data) to
support an ERUMDD value of less than 350 gallons per day. The data may only be used in
support of expansion for that specific water system (WAC 246-290-221(4)).

Multifamily residences typically use less water per dwelling than separate single-family
residences. Water uses for multifamily residences vary from water system to water
system. They are usually specific to a given water system, but not always applicable to
another water system. Engineers should view multifamily-metered consumption data
apart from single-family data when calculating ERUMDD. Divide the total peak-day water
use for the multifamily connection(s) by the water system-specific ERUMDD to determine
the number of ERUs multifamily connections contribute.

In a few isolated cases in Western Washington, the ERU MDD has been as high as 2,000
gpd per connection. In Eastern Washington, the ERUMDD for some water systems has
been as high as 8,000 gpd per connection. Design engineers should recognize that
some water systems are outside the norm and will have much greater water demand,
and that our assumptions about ERUMDD = 2x ERUADD may result in a significant shortfall
in supply during built-out peak day demand.

3.4.2     Peak Hourly Demand (PHD)
Engineers need PHD estimates to size equalizing storage, distribution mains, and some
pumping facilities. They must design a water system to provide PHD while maintaining a
minimum pressure of 30 psi throughout the distribution system (WAC 246-290-230(5)).
Engineers can develop and use water system-specific diurnal demand curves to estimate
PHD (AWWA 2012). Engineers usually need multiple diurnal demand curves because
demand changes seasonally (AWWA 2012).

Design engineers may use Equation 3-1 to determine PHD for systems with
predominantly residential demands. This equation is consistent with the maximum
instantaneous demand values presented in previous editions of the state’s design

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   36
guidance manuals (WSDSHS 1973; WSDSHS 1983) known as the “Red Book” and “Blue
Book,” respectively. Equation 3-1 accounts for the ranges of PHD to MDD ratios
reported as a function of water system size and by various water systems in Washington.

Key concepts associated with the use of Equation 3-1:
      Applies to water systems with significant residential demand.
      N is the number of ERUs supplied by all sources. DSL has an associated number
       of ERUs (see examples in Section 3.12 and Worksheet 4-1). Therefore, N includes
       DSL. “N” is the number of connections only if there is no distribution system
       leakage and all connections are single-family homes.
      Check to be sure that ERUMDD times “N” equals total maximum daily source
       production.
      The ERU value is ERUMDD. It is not appropriate to apply the ERU ADD value to
       Equation 3-1.

Equation 3-1: Determine PHD

           PHD = (ERU MDD /1440) [(C)(N) + F] + 18

  Where       PHD      =     Peak Hourly Demand, total system (gallons per minute)
                  C    =     Coefficient Associated with Ranges of ERUs
                 N     =     Number of ERUs based on MDD
                  F    =     Factor Associated with Ranges of ERUs
            ERU MDD    =     Maximum Day Demand per ERU (gallons per day)

Table 3-1 identifies the appropriate coefficients and factors to substitute into Equation
3-1 for the ranges of single-family residential connections:

                                         Table 3-1
                              Number of ERUs (N)      C     F
                                    15 – 50          3.0    0
                                   51 – 100          2.5   25
                                  101 – 250          2.0   75
                                  251 – 500          1.8   125
                                     > 500           1.6   225


PHD relates to the hydraulic ability of a distribution system to accommodate a range of
ERUs. A PHD evaluation determines the physical capacity of the whole water system, not
each specific ERU. Engineers can use this equation to estimate the peak-hourly flow for

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  37
the whole water system, or a specific pressure zone, after determining the number of
ERUs.


3.5       Anticipating Changes in Demand: Systems with Mostly
          Residential Demand
Water demand estimates should address anticipated changes as a water system
matures. An analysis should address how future water-use patterns may change. For
example, vacation lots may become retirement homes, or be sold as permanent
residences in a phased plan for development.

The analysis should consider commercial activities associated with full build-out of the
development or community. Base MDD and PHD estimates for water systems serving
general commercial and business needs on the appropriate application of analogous
system data, Table 3-2, and the UPC fixture method (see Appendix D.2).

Adjustments to any established design criteria should reflect actual or anticipated
conditions. These adjustments should provide a realistic margin of safety for reasonably
anticipated increases in demand. For some projects, future water system demand, or
standby or fire suppression storage needs may exceed the engineer’s initial estimate.
This could occur when a water system experiences higher-than-expected growth,
changing uses among existing customers, has historical supply reliability problems, or
experiences higher or lower service demand due to changing economic and
demographic influences.

3.5.1     Referencing Data from Prior Years
Using meter data from several prior years will result in calculating different ERUADD and
ERUMDD from one year to the next. If the data is scattered, without any clear trend, then
apply the highest ERUADD and ERUMDD value within the study period to the design unless
one of the following:
       The design engineer can show that the data is unreliable or incomplete.
       The highest ERUADD and ERUMDD value is based on an unrepeatable event, such
        as a chronic failure of the reservoir level control, widespread installation of new
        landscaping requiring especially heavy irrigation, or use of the water supply to
        assist with dust control during an unusually active construction season.

Good water system design provides water systems with the capacity to supply the
volume of safe drinking water their customers demand during all normal operating
conditions. Applying an average of past normal operating conditions to future
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   38
customers by definition excludes some normal operating conditions. Generally,
engineers should not average water demand data spanning a period of several years to
determine ERUADD and ERUMDD for the built-out or planning year condition.

If production or consumption data reflect a clear trend toward higher or lower ERUADD
and ERUMDD with time, factor such trends into determining the selected design ERUADD
and ERUMDD value while not extrapolating below the lower limit of the data set.

In evaluating data, design engineers should exercise caution when water production
data spans a period of imposed water use restrictions. A water system’s decision to
impose water use restrictions in response to drought conditions can artificially skew
demand data lower. The National Drought Mitigation Center has historical drought
information. Contact information is in Appendix C.

3.5.2     Commercial, Industrial, and Public Facilities
Engineers can base MDD and PHD estimates for industrial water systems on customer
contracted volumes (gpd or gpm), defined process needs, and/or analogous system
data. Existing industrial and commercial users may have data logging capacity on their
service meters, providing the design engineer with primary data on MDD and PHD that
would be useful in designing for expansion of the system.

The analysis should address how future water-use may evolve without any change in the
number of structures or spaces. For example, a concert venue may become more
popular than anticipated, a second shift may be added to a place of work, the irrigation
or recreational water demands on the system may increase as the clientele of a facility
change, or a change in facility use may change water demand (e.g., a warehouse
becomes a brewery and restaurant).

Part 2: Nonresidential Demand Estimates

3.6       Estimating Nonresidential Water System Demand
Nonresidential water demand is the water users other than single or multifamily
residential units consume. These users include:
     Commercial facilities like retail or wholesale businesses, restaurants, hotels, office
      buildings, and car washes.
     Industrial customers that require process water.
     Public facilities like schools, public hospitals, governmental offices, parks,
      landscaped roads, and cemeteries.
     Other large users, like farms with irrigated crops.
     Recreational users like campgrounds, RV parks, ski resorts, and seasonal rental
      units.

We classify water systems that consist solely of these types of users as “transient
noncommunity” or “nontransient noncommunity” water systems (see WAC 246-290-
020). The ERU model does not apply to these types of water systems.

Design engineers should use different approaches to determine water demands for
nonresidential customers because these types of customers do not follow residential
water use patterns. Applying the principles of Section 3.2, use the following sources of
information to estimate ADD, MDD, and PHD for nonresidential uses:
     Actual water use information correlated to the expected future uses (for an
      expanding nonresidential system)
     Values from an analogous nonresidential water system
     Values from Table 3-2
     Fixture unit analysis based on Uniform Plumbing Code guidelines (see Appendix
      D.2 for guidance)

In evaluating data, design engineers should exercise caution when water production
data spans a period of imposed water use restrictions. A water system owner’s decision
to impose water use restrictions in response to drought conditions can artificially skew
demand data lower. Using artificially low production and demand data to design an
expansion to the system would permanently lock in constrained water use conditions.

3.6.1      Procedures for Estimating Nonresidential Demands
Design engineers can base ADD and MDD estimates for new nonresidential water
systems on similarly sized analogous facilities or water systems. Table 3-2 offers
reasonable estimates of daily water demands for a variety of uses. Design engineers can
create a reasonable estimate for MDD by multiplying the number of “units” (e.g.,
resident, RV, bed, patron, etc.) or maximum anticipated use (e.g., airport passengers,
vehicle visits) the water system serves times the unit water demand value in Table 3-2.
Table 3-2 does not account for outdoor watering needs and fire protection
requirements associated with uses listed.

Design engineers may find other information sources more valuable than Table 3-2. The
designer should review several information sources to ensure compliance with local
codes and to provide for an adequate factor of safety in the design. Recommended
resources include the:
       Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC). Under Appendix A of the UPC, engineers can
        total the number of water supply fixtures in a building and convert it to an
        estimated peak water system demand. Local jurisdictions may require a water
        system to use the UPC to estimate demand.
       Department of Ecology. Engineers should consult any specific water-demand
        estimates Ecology prepared to see if they reflect adjustments for the proposed

3.6.2       Commercial, Industrial and Public Facility Demand
Water demands for commercial, industrial, and public facility categories range widely
from less than, to significantly more than, a single-family residence. This is especially
true for large farm irrigation needs or commercial and industrial processes.

Engineers can base MDD and PHD estimates for industrial water systems on customer
contracted volumes (gpd or gpm), defined process needs, and/or analogous system
data. Existing industrial and commercial users may have data logging capacity on their
service meters, providing the design engineer with primary data on MDD and PHD that
would be useful in designing for expansion of the system. If data is available and verified
as accurate, it may be possible to develop a diurnal curve for each existing large
nonresidential customer. This curve could help quantify PHD and identify when PHD

occurs in relation to other large and small users. Using this approach, design engineers
could estimate a system-wide PHD based on a summation of individual large user PHD
plus various other class-wide PHD, taking into account the time of day when each peak
demand occurs.

Design engineers can estimate MDD and PHD for water systems serving general
commercial and business needs by appropriately applying analogous system data, Table
3-2, the UPC fixture method (see Appendix D.2), and/or other reference documents on
nonresidential water use. To estimate water demands, designers should use these
planning guides together with documented water-use records for existing facilities
within the water system, or comparable uses at other water systems.

The design engineer should identify the specific existing, known, and planned buildings
and building sites that comprise the current and future customers of a commercial,
industrial, or public facility water system. A table summarizing the MDD and PHD of
each building will assist us in summarizing the scope of our design approval. The design
engineer should also provide an estimate of the total maximum daily population served.

Chapter 4 discusses documenting physical capacity for water systems serving primarily
commercial, industrial, and/or public facilities.

3.6.3      Farming and Crop Irrigation Demand
Engineers should consult with the local Cooperative Extension office when determining
water-use estimates for farms. It may be possible to find water-use records for various
farm practices in the area. Table 3-2 provides some water-use references by type and
number of livestock. Irrigation needs can be extremely variable and may require
additional investigation. View an index of local extension offices at
http://extension.wsu.edu/locations.

Some variables that influence water demands for farming and crop irrigation are:
       Type of farm.
       Number and type of animals it produces.
       Type of crops it grows.
       Weather conditions.
       Geographic location.

3.6.4      Recreational Development Demand
“Recreational development” applies to facilities that individuals and families intend to use
for vacations or holidays away from their normal place of residence. There is a full spectrum
of recreational development types. Some are simple campsites suitable for tents or trailers
in a manner similar to a state campground, while others may be an elaborate community of
rustic housing equipped with most, if not all, the amenities of urban living. The design
engineer should identify in the design submittal the specific buildings (e.g., camp lodge,
bath/shower, and dining hall), designated locations (e.g., camp sites, RV sites), and the total
maximum daily population the system expects to serve.

Recreational developments may be eligible for reduced water system design criteria if they
meet certain conditions. Reduced design criteria will apply only to sites intended solely for
recreational occupancy. No permanent residential dwelling or structure, no matter how
small, how simple, or how rustic, is permitted on a site designated for recreational uses.
Engineers must design recreational development water systems that will serve residential
dwellings not otherwise restricted from full-time occupancy consistent with demand values
associated with permanent residences (WAC 246-290-221(2)).

We will consider reduced-design criteria if the project report and construction
documents for a recreational development can demonstrate all of the following:
   1. There are clearly defined sites for each occupant. Recreational developments can
      define sites by surveyed lot lines, permanent site markers, or surveyed-site
      centerlines drawn on a map that identifies the location of each site.
   2. The acknowledged purpose of the recreational development is to provide space
      for short-term, transient, or seasonal use only.
   3. Residential dwellings are restricted from full-time occupancy.
   4. We received satisfactory documentation of claims made with respect to items 1–3
      above. This may include a notation of the restrictions on the face of the plat, in
      covenants filed with the plat, or in individual deeds.

Ownership and operation of recreational developments vary along a wide spectrum.
Some recreational developments operate on a membership basis while others sell
facilities lot-by-lot, as in an ordinary residential plat. Recreational development water
system owners that receive approval for reduced design criteria must operate their
system within the approved design parameters. Ownership concentrated in a single
decision-maker will have greater flexibility and capacity to ensure consumer demands
do not exceed the design assumptions. Diffuse ownership (such as each lot owner in an
association) may limit the ability to restrict customer demands during operation. In
responding to designs submitted for a recreational development water system under
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     45
diffused ownership, we may request additional documentation on the owner’s authority
to enforce water use consistent with design assumptions and on the owner’s plans to
respond to water shortages.

Design engineers can use Table 3-2 and other design references such as the UPC fixture
method and Ecology’s wastewater flow tables (WSDOE 2008) to provide daily water use
estimates for typical recreational and other nonresidential facilities.

No matter the source of information, the design engineer should base the MDD for
recreational development water systems serving structures with internal plumbing
suitable for short-term occupancy (such as overnight transient accommodation RVs and
cabins) on all of the following:
      No less than 140 gpd per site or lot.
      Full (site) occupancy.
      All other water uses including swimming pools, irrigation, water features, and
       commercial buildings.

The maximum daily demand to peak hourly demand peaking factor values in Figure 3.1
apply to water systems serving recreational demands. We derived the two curves in
Figure 3.1 from Equation 3-1, applying 140 gpd and 300 gpd estimated maximum daily
demand per recreational unit. The graph reveals that differences in recreational unit
MDD have little bearing on the peaking factor.

After identifying the unit MDD and the number of units, the designer can estimate the
total estimated MDD. Using the graph and Eq. 3-2 below, designers can then estimate
the system-wide PHD.

Equation 3-2:

   PHD recreational = (MDD1440) x PF

  Where         PHD =        Peak hourly demand, total system (gallons per minute)
                MDD =        Maximum daily demand, including DSL, total system
                             (gallons per day)
                  PF =       MDD to PHD peaking factor, from Figure 3.1

3.6.5                                       Anticipating Changes in Demand: Systems with Mostly Nonresidential
                                            Demand
Water demand estimates for noncommunity systems should address anticipated
changes as a water system matures and business needs change. Changes in future water
demands likely will reflect changes nonresidential facilities make in the type and level of
business they do.

The analysis should address how future water-use may evolve without any change in the
number of structures or spaces. For example, a concert venue may become more
popular than anticipated, a place of work may add a second shift, the irrigation or
recreational water demands on the system may increase as the clientele of a facility
change, or a change in facility use may change water demand (e.g., a warehouse may
become a brewery and restaurant).

Adjustments to any established design criteria should reflect actual or anticipated
design conditions. These adjustments should provide a realistic margin of safety for
reasonably anticipated demand increases. For some projects, water system demand,
standby storage and/or fire suppression storage needs may exceed the engineer’s initial
Water System Design Manual

estimate. This could occur when a water system experiences higher-than-expected
growth or higher or lower service demand due to changing economic and demographic
influence. It also could occur when uses change among existing customers.


Part 3: General Considerations

3.7       Establishing Needed Fire Flow
The local fire protection authority or county fire marshal usually determines minimum
fire flow requirements (WAC 246-290-221(5)). Design engineers should always confirm
the fire suppression requirements associated with a given water system design with the
local fire protection authority or county fire marshal.



3.8       Factoring Distribution System Leakage (DSL) in Design
Water use efficiency (WUE) requirements apply to municipal water suppliers. In general,
municipal water suppliers are community water systems with 15 or more residential
service connections. Some noncommunity water systems that serve water in a
residential manner to 25 or more people at least 60 days per year (such as a second
home community) are municipal water suppliers. We make this determination on a case-
by-case basis. For more information on WUE requirements, see the Water Use Efficiency
Guidebook (DOH 331-375) or contact the appropriate regional planner.

Municipal water suppliers must meet certain leakage standards to minimize water lost
through distribution system leaks. Most municipal water suppliers that lose more than
10 percent of the water they produce through DSL must take action to reduce their
leakage (WAC 246-290-820).

Design engineers cannot use projections of water savings resulting from future leak
detection and repair, or from future implementation of planned WUE measures, when
establishing the design criteria for an expanding water system (WAC 246-290-221).

Design engineers must establish sizing criteria that account for water system demands
during the highest demand periods, including DSL (WAC 246-290-222). The design
information should be sufficient to estimate peak hourly demand (PHD) and MDD for
the built-out condition. Equation 3-3 is from WAC 246-290-820:

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                              48
 Equation 3-3:

  DSL = TP – AC

 Where:
  DSL = Distribution system leakage (gallons per day)
   TP = Total water produced and purchased over a full year, divided by 365
        (gallons per day)
   AC = Authorized consumption over a full year, divided by 365 (gallons per day).

Authorized consumption is the volume of metered and unmetered water that
consumers and other authorized users use. Authorized uses include, but aren’t limited
to, firefighting and training, flushing water mains and sewers, street cleaning, and
watering of parks and landscapes. These volumes may be billed or unbilled.

Water system production “lost” through DSL is no longer available for customer service.
As such, DSL reduces a water system’s ability to serve customers. A water system can
increase its ability to serve more customers by reducing DSL. Some DSL will occur, even
in very well maintained and managed water systems. For most water systems, it is
impractical to eliminate all DSL (AWWA 2006). DSL is a demand component of every
water system, and designers should include it with the water system capacity
assessment. See Chapter 4.

For water systems, several factors influence the real water losses that are part of DSL,
including:
      Number of service connections.
      Length of water mains.
      Average operating pressure.
      Infrastructure condition (Thornton 2002; AWWA 2006).

Because these factors are independent of demand, DSL is more likely to be consistent
on a volume basis than on a percentage basis throughout a given year. Engineers can
use the most recent three-year average annual volume of DSL and divide by 365 to
identify a daily DSL volume.

3.9       Water Resource Issues
Competition over the state’s water resources by a growing population, natural resource
interests, and a vibrant economy is steadily increasing. The Department of Ecology
manages the state’s water resources, implementing a regulatory program for allocation
of those resources, and enforcing its provisions.

For designs involving new or expanding sources, or increases in water system capacity,
engineers must address water rights as a part of a submittal to us (WAC 246-290-
100(4)(f), 105(4)(e), 110(4)(e), 120(7), 130(3), and 132(3)(b)). In these submittals, the
engineer must complete a Water Rights Self-Assessment Form as part of the water rights
analysis unless noted otherwise. Ecology uses the project information on this form to
assess whether the project and its associated water system demands match certain
limits specified on a water system’s water right permit, certificate, or claim.



3.10      Source Adequacy and Reliability
The water system design frames the operational expectations and establishes the
system’s adequacy and reliability to meet consumer demands. State rules require water
systems to maintain a minimum level of service during normal (nonemergency)
operating conditions (WAC 246-290-420). Consumers have a reasonable expectation to
an adequate supply of water not just during average conditions but also during high
demand periods. Design assumptions about source adequacy and reliability have a
significant effect on the ability of the water system to meet future regulatory obligations
and consumer expectations.

3.10.1    Design and Operating Requirements
Design engineers must design water systems to provide at least 30 psi throughout the
distribution system during peak hourly demand conditions (WAC 246-290-230). Water
systems must operate with pressure throughout the distribution system maintained at
or above the approved design pressure (WAC 246-290-420). A system affected by
periodic drought or administrative restriction on withdrawal may have to impose
restrictions on demand to maintain pressure.

3.10.2    Surface Water Source Reliability
The reliability of a surface water source depends on environmental factors such as
rainfall, snowpack, and runoff rates during drought conditions. Climate change may
amplify these factors, making it even more important for design engineers to consider
the need for resiliency in the face of changing conditions over the life of the water

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  50
system. Source reliability also may depend on legal restrictions to withdraw water, or on
the design and maintenance of the source infrastructure, such as a raw water
impoundment. We can express source reliability by how frequently a water system
expects normal demand to go unmet, such as a one-in-50 year or even a one-in-100
year drought.

We consider 98 percent source reliability an appropriate design standard for evaluating
a watershed’s capacity. This implies that consumers should expect water system-
imposed restrictions on water use to occur on average once every 50 years. The design
engineer should assess the duration of the once in 50-year water supply restriction
during the design and the water system’s water shortage response plan should address
it. Additional information on assessing the reliability of surface water supplies is in
Chapter 5.

If the design engineer adopts a lesser reliability standard, the system expects its
consumers to accept a greater frequency of insufficient supply and more frequent
mandatory demand curtailment. In this context, reliability becomes a balance between
consumer expectations and the cost of meeting such expectations. The design engineer
should document and provide engineering justification for the source reliability factor
selected. See Section 4.4.2.3.

3.10.3    Groundwater Source Reliability
Groundwater source reliability depends on environmental factors, such as rainfall and
hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer. Groundwater source reliability also may
depend on legal restrictions to withdraw water, such as a Department of Ecology
requirement to interrupt well withdrawal during low-flow periods in a nearby stream. As
with surface water, we can express groundwater source reliability by how frequently a
water system expects normal demand to go unmet, such as once-in-a-50 year, or even
once-in-a-100 year interval interruption.

For wells subject to interruption due to low stream flow, we recommend that designers
use a once-in-50-year interval as the basis for establishing reliance on the source to
meet normal water system demand. This implies that consumers should expect water
system-imposed restrictions on water use to occur on average once every 50 years.

The selected pump-test protocol (see Appendix E) should identify the aquifer safe yield.
Based on the pump test protocol and quality of data, the design engineer should apply
an appropriate factor of safety (e.g., multiply pump test results by 0.85) when calculating


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 51
safe yield to account for unknown hydrogeologic conditions and future climatic
conditions.

3.10.4      General Safety Factor and Contingency Planning
We recommend against designs based on pumping 24-hours per day to meet future
MDD. Designing or evaluating a system with some period of no pumping to satisfy
projected MDD, provides a factor of safety and an increased ability to meet unexpected
demands. We recommend assessing source capacity based on an assumption of
pumping a source no more than 20 hours per day.
Source adequacy and reliability are important long-range planning elements and water
systems must address them in water shortage response plans (WAC 246-290-100(4)(f)
and -415(2)(d)). Plans to ensure long-range water system adequacy and reliability
should address:
        Water-shortage response activities, such as accessing alternative water supplies
         and notifying us.
        Long-term adequacy of water rights for meeting the water system’s growth
         expectations.
        Conservation as a mitigating practice to reduce the frequency or degree of
         curtailment.
        Water resource trends (such as declining aquifer levels, declining dry period
         stream flows, establishing in-stream flow requirements, and increasing salt water
         intrusion).

3.10.5      Summary of Water Supply Reliability Recommendations
Recommendations for source and water system reliability appear in various chapters of
this manual. The following is a brief summary of our recommendations for water supply
reliability.
   1. Two or more supply sources are available.
   2. Permanent and seasonal sources are capable of replenishing depleted fire
      suppression storage within 72-hours (continuous, 24-hour source pumping may
      be assumed for replenishment), or sooner if the local fire authority requires it,
      while concurrently supplying the MDD for the water system.
   3. Permanent and seasonal source capacity is enough to supply MDD in a pumping
      period of 20 hours or less.
   4. With the largest source out of service, the remaining permanent and seasonal
      sources can provide a minimum of ADD for the water system.

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  52
   5. Source of supply pump stations have power connections to two independent
      primary public power sources, have in-place auxiliary power available (auto
      transfer capable), and/or maintain adequate gravity standby storage (see Chapter
      7).
   6. The firm watershed yield for surface water sources provides 98 percent reliability
      to meet normal, anticipated system demands.
   7. A factor of safety is applied to a well pumping test safe yield determination.

3.11       Factor of Safety
We support the design of robust and resilient water systems based on the best available
demand data. Without reliable and applicable demand information, we expect design
engineers to apply their professional judgment and to document their assumptions.
Despite using even the best available information, uncertainty about future conditions
and validity of assumptions will persist. That is why we recommend using a factor of
safety (FS) when designing water systems.

Using an appropriate FS is common in the engineering profession. Below we describe in
general terms the range of FS given the degree of confidence the design engineer has in
the data, and the scope of design assumptions.
        Mostly or entirely confident: FS = 1.10 to 1.15
        Somewhat confident: FS = 1.15 to 1.25
        Mostly uncertain: FS = 1.25 to 1.5



3.12       Example Exercises for Estimating Water System Demand
To illustrate the standards and concepts we describe in this chapter, we offer the
following examples. These examples are not a recipe for design engineers. All reference
to water rights assumes prior verification from the Department of Ecology.

3.12.1     New Community Water System
Known: Planned 100-lot subdivision with ½ to 1 acre lots. All lots will have single-family
residential homes expected to have at least 3,000 square feet of living space. The
subdivision is located in Benton County. Average annual rainfall for the project location
is 9 inches per year. The soil is sand.

Solution:
     1. Reference information in Appendix D.
     2. Mostly confident in Appendix D ADD information. Apply FS to ERUADD of 1.10
     3. ERUADD = [8,000 ÷ 9] + 200 = 1,090 gpd x 1.1 = 1,200 gpd
     4. Assume future DSL to be 10 percent of annual consumption. DSL = 1,200 x 100
        connections x 0.10 = 12,000 gpd
     5. Total system-wide ADD = annual consumption plus DSL. [1,200 gpd x 100] +
        12,000 gpd = 132,000 gpd. Use 130,000 gpd.
     6. Qa on the water right needs to provide at least 130,000 gpd x 365 days per year
        = 47.5 MG per year. (1 acre-foot = about 326,000 gallons. Therefore, 47.5 MG = 146 ac-ft.)
     7. Determine ERUMDD. Select an ERUMDD to ERUADD peaking factor of 2.0 as
        recommended in Appendix D.
     8. Mostly uncertain in Appendix D MDD to ADD peaking factor for Eastern
        Washington. Apply FS to peaking factor of 1.3.
     9. ERUMDD = 1,200 x 2 x 1.3 = 3,120 gpd
     10. Translate DSL into ERUs. 12,000 gpd  3,120 = 3.8 ERUs. Total number of ERUs,
         “N,” supplied by sources equals 100 + 3.8 = 104
     11. Total system-wide MDD = [3,120 x 100 connections] + 12,000 = 324,000 gpd
     12. Design source pumping capacity to meet MDD in 20 hours (Section 3.10.4):
         324,000 gpd 1,200 min per day = 270 gpm
     13. Qi on the water right needs to provide at least 325,000 gpd 1,440 = 225 gpm.
         Ideally, Qi is at least 270 gpm.
     14. Use Equation 3-1 to determine PHD
              PHD = [(3,120 1,440) x (2.5 x 104 +25)] +18 = 630 gpm.

3.12.2      Expanding (Existing) Community Water System
Known: An existing 100-lot subdivision has ¼-acre lots. All services are single-family
residential dwellings. The existing subdivision was fully built-out by the mid-1990s.
Proposal is to add 200 additional single-family residential ¼-acre lots. All homes are
primary residences, and occupied on a full-time basis. The existing system is in Klickitat
County.

DSL is indeterminable due to incomplete service metering.

Most water systems record monthly source production. The maximum monthly
production for the past 10 years is as follows (from oldest to most recent): 4.1 MG, 3.4
MG, 3.2 MG, 3.0 MG, 2.5 MG, 2.2 MG, 2.3 MG, 2.2 MG, 2.0 MG, and 2.5 MG. Further

investigation into oldest maximum monthly production data (4.1 MG) reveals two
anomalies: Undetected failure of the reservoir control system, resulting in significant
waste of water through a prolonged reservoir overflow; and a nearby wildfire that the
local fire authority suppressed by using the community water supply.

Annual production for the past 10 years is as follows (from oldest to most recent): 26
MG, 22 MG, 20 MG, 20 MG, 19 MG, 19 MG, 18 MG, 18 MG, 16 MG, 17 MG and 17 MG.
Average climatic conditions prevailed during this period, and there were no restrictions
imposed on water use.

Find: ADD, MDD, PHD, ERUADD, and ERUMDD for the proposed expanding water system
Solution:
     1. Discard first year data for monthly and annual source production volume.
     2. Apply a factor of safety of 1.10 to the annual and maximum monthly production
        data, based on a high degree of confidence in the remaining data set.
     3. Annual production data reflects a trend toward lower production with time. Use
        17 MG per year to determine future ERUADD. 17 MG x 1.10 = 18.7 MG.
     4. Assume DSL to be 10 percent of annual production. DSL = 1.9 MG/year
     5. Annual consumption = Production – DSL = 18.7 MG/yr. – 1.9 MG/yr. = 16.8
        MG/yr.
     6. ERUADD = [16.8 MG/yr.]  100  365 = 460 gpd
     7. Maximum monthly production for the past three years does not indicate any
        trend. Use high value = 2.5 MG/month to determine ERU MDD. 2.5 MG x 1.10 =
        2.75 MG
     8. Maximum monthly consumption = Max monthly production – DSL (monthly
        volume)
              2.75 MG – [1.9MG 12] = 2.6 MG
     9. ERUMDD = [2.6 MG x 1.65 peaking factor (see Section 3.4.1)]  100  32 days
        between measurements = 1,340 gpd
     10. Translate existing DSL into ERUs. [1.9 MG/yr.  365]  1340 = 3.9 ERUs. Use 4
     11. Future DSL will be proportional to the number of lots served because the
         distribution system is expanding proportionately.
     12. Future number of ERUs = 300 + 12 = 312
     13. Total future system-wide ADD = [300 x 460 gpd] + [(1.9 MG x 3)  365] =
         154,000 gpd. Use 155,000 gpd

     14. Qa on the water right needs to provide at least 155,000 gpd x 365 days per year
         = 56.5 MG per year (173 ac-ft./yr.).
     15. Total future system-wide MDD = [300 x 1,340 gpd] + [(1.9 MG x 3)  365] =
         418,000 gpd.
     16. Design source pumping capacity to meet MDD in 20 hours (Section 3.10.4):
         418,000 gpd ÷1200 min per day = 350 gpm
     17. Qi on the water right needs to provide at least 418,000 gpd ÷1440 = 290 gpm.
         Ideally, Qi is at least 350 gpm.
     18. Use Equation 3-1 to determine PHD
              PHD = [(1,340 ÷1,440) x (1.8 x 312 +125)] +18 = 660 gpm

3.12.3      New Mixed-Use Community Water System
Known: Proposed new planned unit development with 100 1-acre single-family home
lots, 2-acre community park, and a 100-unit RV park. The subdivision is in Benton
County. Average annual rainfall for the project location is 9 inches per year.

Find: ADD, MDD, PHD, ERUADD, and ERUMDD

Solution:
     1. Reference information in Appendix D.
     2. Mostly confident in Appendix D ADD information. Apply FS to ERUADD of 1.10
     3. ERUADD = [8,000 ÷ 9] + 200 = 1,090 gpd x 1.1 = 1,200 gpd
     4. Determine ERUMDD. Select an ERUMDD to ERUADD peaking factor of 2.0 as
        recommended in Appendix D.
     5. Mostly uncertain in Appendix D MDD to ADD peaking factor for Eastern
        Washington. Apply FS to peaking factor of 1.3.
     6. ERUMDD = 1,200 x 2 x 1.3 = 3,120 gpd
     7. Irrigation of the 2-acre community park: Use 180 gpd per 1,000 sf (Table 3-2)
        and assume 182 days of irrigation per year.
         a. 180 x (2 x 43,560) ÷ 1,000 = 15,681 gpd x 182 days = 2.85 MG (annual)
         b. MDD for park irrigation is 15,681. Use 16,000 gpd.
     8. 100-unit RV park consumptive demand estimated at 140 gpd/unit (see Table 3-
        2). Assume the RV park is 100% occupied during the spring, summer, and fall;
        closed during the winter months.
     9. Annual consumption.

         b. Community park irrigation = 2.85 MG
         c. RV park = 100 units x 140 gpd/unit x 100% occupancy x (365 x 0.75) = 3.8
            MG
         d. Total annual consumption = 50.6. Use 51 MG
     10. Average daily consumption = 51 MG ÷ 365 = 140,000 gpd
     11. Assume DSL to be 10 percent of annual consumption. DSL = 140,000 x 0.10 =
         14,000 gpd
     12. Total system-wide ADD = 140,000 + 14,000 = 154,000 gpd
     13. Qa on the water right needs to provide at least 154,000 gpd x 365 days per year
         = 56 MG per year (171 ac-ft./yr.)

          b. DSL = 4.4
          c. Community park = 16,000 ÷ 3,120 = 6.4
          d. RV park = 100 units x 140 gpd/unit = 14,000 ÷ 3,120 = 4.4
          e. Total number of ERUs, “N” = 115. System is predominantly residential.
     16. Total system-wide MDD = (100 x 3,120) + 16,000 + 14,000 + 14,000 (DSL) =

     17. Design source pumping capacity to meet MDD in 20 hours (Section 3.10.4):
         356,000 gpd 1,200 min per day = 297 gpm. Use 300 gpm
     18. Qi on the water right needs to provide at least 356,000 gpd ÷ 1,440 = 247 gpm.

acre community park, and a 100-unit RV park.

The three-year average DSL was calculated at 15 percent. Monthly source production is
recorded. Service meters are read every two months. Through a survey the water system

Solution:
     1. Mostly confident in the water system’s annual production and bimonthly
        consumption data. Apply a FS = 1.10.
     2. Annual production and consumption data does not reflect a trend toward lower

        does not reflect a trend toward lower peak bimonthly consumption over time.
        Use 9 MG x 1.10 = 10 MG
            a. ERUADD = 10 MG ÷ 60 homes ÷ 365 days = 457 gpd
     5. Use peak bimonthly consumption of 60 permanent homes to estimate ERU MDD.
        Data reflects a trend toward lower peak bimonthly consumption over time. Use
        2.5 MG and peaking factor of 1.65 (see Section 3.4.1).
            a. ERUMDD = 2.5 MG x 1.10 ÷ 60 homes ÷ 60 days = 763 x 1.65 = 1,260 gpd.
     6. Translate existing DSL into ERUs. [3 MG/yr. ÷ 365] ÷ 1,260 = 6.5 ERUs.
     7. Assume DSL is proportional to size of the distribution system. Future DSL will be
        1.6 times existing DSL because the distribution system is expanding by 60
        percent. Future DSL ERUs = 6.5 x 1.6 = 10 ERUs
     8. Future annual consumption:
            a. 100 existing single-family homes: 457 gpd/ERU x 100 x 365 = 16.7 MG
            b. 200 new homes: Use a 20% reduction in ERUADD because of smaller lot size
               supported by analogous system data (meeting the analogous system data
               standards in Section 3.2.3): 200 x 457 gpd/ERU x 0.8 x 365 = 26.7 MG

          c. Community park irrigation: Use 180 gpd per 1,000 sf (Table 3-2) and
             assume 100 days of irrigation.
                  i. 180 x (2 x 43,560) ÷ 1,000 = 15,681 gpd x 100 days = 1.57 MG
          d. RV park: 140 gpd/unit (see Table 3-2). Assume the RV park is 80%
             occupied during the spring, summer, and fall; closed during the winter
             months.
                  i. 100 units x 140 gpd/unit x 0.80 (occupancy) x 365 x 0.75 = 3 MG

          g. Future system-wide ADD = 53 MG  365 = 145,000 gpd
     9. Qa on the water right needs to provide at least 53 MG per year.
     10. Future maximum daily consumptive demands:
          a. 100 existing single-family homes: 1,260 gpd/ERU x 100 = 126,000 gpd
          b. 200 new homes: Use a 30% reduction in ERUMDD because of smaller lot
             size supported by analogous system data (meeting the analogous system
             data standards in Section 3.2.3): 200 x 1,260 gpd/ERU x 0.7 = 176,000 gpd
          c. Park irrigation MDD is 15,681. Use 16,000 gpd
          d. RV park: 140 gpd/unit x 100 units = 14,000 gpd
          e. DSL = 4.8 MG ÷ 365 = 13,000 gpd
          f. Future system-wide MDD = 345,000 gpd. The system is predominantly
             residential.
     11. Future number of ERUs:
          a. Existing homes = 100 ERUs
          b. New homes = 176,000 ÷ 1,260 = 140 ERUs
          c. Park = 16,000 ÷ 1,260 = 12.7 ERUs
          d. RV Park = 14,000 ÷ 1,260 = 11.1 ERUs
          e. DSL = [4.8 MG ÷ 365] ÷ 1,260 = 10.4 ERUs
          f. Total future ERUs = 274 ERUs
     12. Design source pumping capacity to meet MDD in 20 hours (Section 3.10.4):
         345,000 gpd/1,200 min per day = 288 gpm. Use 290 gpm
     13. Qi on the water right needs to provide at least 345,000 gpd ÷ 1,440 = 240 gpm.
         Ideally, Qi is at least 290 gpm.
     14. Use Equation 3-1 to determine PHD

3.12.5      Expanding Noncommunity Water System
Known: A single 120-gpm well (no storage) supplies an existing 200-unit RV park,
convenience store, service station, a water park, and about 1 acre of irrigated lawn and
garden. The existing facilities have been in service for the past two years. The park
owner states the park is closed November 1 through April 1 each year. The park is in
Spokane County. There are no residences. Average occupancy has been 80 percent
during the 7 months the park is open.

Year 1 and year 2 annual water production was 3.0 MG and 3.5 MG, respectively. The
well is metered and equipped with a variable speed drive submersible pump. The system
has only pressurized storage. There are no service meters.

Year 1 maximum monthly production was recorded as 0.6 MG, and year 2 was 0.7 MG.
Anecdotally, the owner indicated that the system has always maintained at least 30 psi
throughout the distribution system, even during extreme demand events.

The owner wants to add 150 additional RV spaces, each with water and sewer
connections, a laundromat, and another 1-acre of grassy area.

Find: ADD, MDD, PHD

Solution:
   1. Mostly uncertain about the water system’s annual production and bimonthly
      consumption data. Apply a FS = 1.4 due to the limited amount of data, and
      certain variables still untested over an extended timeframe.
   2. The existing system’s estimated ADD: [3.5 MG x 1.4] ÷ 213 days (7 months) =
      23,000 gpd.
   3. The existing system’s MDD can be estimated as follows:
            a. [0.7 MG x 1.4] ÷ 31 = 31,600 gpd x 1.7 MMADD to MDD peaking factor for
               the RV park (see Section 3.4.1) = 54,000 gpd
   4. The existing system’s PHD is estimated as (54,000 ÷1440) x 2.8 peaking factor
      (see Figure 3-1 and Equation 3-2) = 105 gpm
   5. Maximum daily demand of proposed new uses:
            a. MDD of each new RV space is estimated at 140 gpd (see Table 3-2) x 150
               = 21,000 gpd (full occupancy).
            b. MDD of laundromat based on an estimate that it will service 20% of RV
               occupants each day. MDD of the laundromat is 50 gals (See Table 3-2) x
               0.20 x 300 RV spaces = 3,000 gpd.

            c. Irrigation to 1-acre grassy park estimated at 180 gpd per 1,000 sf (See
               Table 3-2).
                   i. [180 x 43,560] ÷ 1,000 = 7,840 gpd. Use 8,000 gpd


   6. Future Annual Consumption:
            a. 23,000 x 213 days/yr. = 5.5 MG
            b. 21,000 x 0.8 occupancy x 213 days/yr. = 3.6 MG
            c. 3,000 x 0.8 occupancy x 213 days/yr. = 0.5 MG
            d. 8,000 x 180 days irrigation/yr. = 1.4 MG
            e. Total = 11 MG
   7. Future MDD:
            a. 54,000 + 21,000 + 3,000 + 8,000 = 86,000 gpd
   8. Future PHD is estimated as (86,000 ÷ 1,440) x 2.5 peaking factor (see Figure 3-1
      and Equation 3-2) = 150 gpm
   9. Since there is no storage, source production must meet PHD. Design source
      pumping capacity must be at least 150 gpm
   10. Qi on the water right needs to provide at least 150 gpm
   11. Qa on the water right needs to provide at least 11 MG

3.12.6      Assessing Full- and Part-Time Residential Use
Known: The 200-home built-out community is a mixed primary and secondary home
community. It is a summertime community, as indicated by comparing monthly source
production data over the past 5 years. The peak month for production is July or August.

Three wells supply the water system. The system has a single reservoir with an external
gauge indicating reservoir level. All three sources are metered, and source meters are
read every month. All homes have service meters, and service meters are read every two
months.

Fourth of July falls on a Saturday and Labor Day falls on September 7.

Find: (1) ERUMDD based on full-time occupancy.
         (2) ERUADD based on full-time occupancy.

Approach
Estimate ERU MDD
   1. Help the water system prepare a plan to read each source meter and the
      reservoir level on Friday, July 3 and on Friday, September 4 (preholiday
      condition).
   2. Help the water system prepare a plan to read each source meter and the reservoir
      level on Monday, July 6 and on Tuesday, September 8 (postholiday condition).
   3. Help the water system identify a cohort of representative homes to do a drive-by
      survey during one of the afternoons and evenings of each study period. The
      number of homes surveyed should equal at least 25 percent of all homes.
      Determine the occupancy level of the entire community based on these
      observations.
   4. Calculate the 3-day system demand over Fourth of July weekend and 4-day
      system demand over Labor Day weekend. Select the highest average daily
      demand for these periods and apply a factor of safety to account for peaking
      during the days subject to data collection.
   5. Calculate ERUMDD based on the source production (plus or minus reservoir level)
      and occupancy.
          a. Multiply the number of homes (200) by the percent occupancy determined
             from the survey.
          b. Divide the value determined in #4 above by the adjusted number of
             homes (reflecting occupancy). The calculated ERU MDD will reflect DSL since
             source production data was used.

Estimate ERU ADD:
   1. Review the bimonthly service meter records of each customer and select
      customers that have two or more two-month periods of consumption that is less
      than 100 gpd per residence. You can assume seasonal or intermittent occupancy
      for these homes.
   2. For all remaining homes, calculate the average daily consumption per residence.
      This is the ERUADD-FULLTIME value based on consumption of the homes considered
      likely to be occupied full time.
   3. Apply the ERUADD-FULLTIME to all homes to determine system ADD.

From these ERUADD and ERUMDD the design engineer can assess the capacity of the
system based on full-time occupancy.

Example Solution for MDD FULLTIME:
   1. The difference between source meter readings taken July 6 and July 3 was
      320,000 gallons. The difference in the reservoir level was 5,000 gallons less on
      July 6. Among the 200 homes, 70 were surveyed. Among the 70 surveyed, 63
      homes were observed to be occupied.
   2. The difference between September 8 and September 4 source meter readings
      was 460,000 gallons. The difference in the reservoir level was 10,000 gallons more
      on September 8. Among the 200 homes, 60 were surveyed. Among the 60
      surveyed, 48 homes were observed to be occupied.
   3. July’s 3-day period of use equates to:
            a. 325,000 gal (production plus storage withdrawal) ÷ [(6370 occupancy
               rate) x 200 homes x 3 days] = 600 gpd per occupied residence.
   4. September’s 4-day period of use equates to:
            a. 450,000 gal (production minus storage gain) ÷ [(4860 occupancy rate) x
               200 homes x 4 days] = 700 gpd per occupied residence.
   5. Select the higher calculated daily production per residence: 700 gpd per home
   6. Mostly confident in the methodology and accuracy of the occupancy survey,
      reservoir level measurement, and source meter data. Apply a FS = 1.15.
   7. 700 x 1.15 = 800 gpd per residence. This value includes DSL, since the primary
      data was source production.
   8. MDD based on full-time occupancy is 800 gpd x 200 = 160,000 gpd.

Example Solution for ADD FULLTIME:
        1. Total yearly production for 2011, 2012, and 2013 was 15 MG, 17 MG, and 20
           MG
        2. A review of 2011, 2012, and 2013 consumption data reveals the following:
 Year     Homes < 100 gpd      Homes ≥ 100       Total consumption   ERUADD for homes ≥
            consumption      gpd consumption    at homes ≥ 100 gpd   consuming 100 gpd
             4+ months         for at least 8       for at least 8      for at least 8
                                  months               months             months
 2011           115                  85                10.8 MG               349
 2012           105                  95                10.6 MG               307
 2013            90                 110                14.5 MG               362
        3. The results show no trend. Normal climatic conditions prevailed during this
           period. Select the higher calculated daily consumption per residence: 362 gpd
           per home
        4. Mostly confident in the assumptions on threshold for fulltime occupancy (100
           gpd per residence) and the accuracy of data collection. Apply a FS = 1.15.

      5. ADD FULLTIME = 362 x 1.15 = 416 gpd per residence. This value excludes DSL,
         since the primary data was metered consumption.
      6. Assume DSL at 10 percent of existing production. Therefore, DSL = 20 MG x
         0.1 = 2 MG.
      7. Estimate of total annual production requirement under fulltime occupancy =
         (416 x 365 x 200) + 2 MG = 32 MG

Chapter 4: Water System Capacity Analysis

4.0       Introduction
The goal of every water system design should be adequate service capacity that reliably
meets consumer demands with safe drinking water. This chapter presents concepts and
tools to help you determine the service capacity of a water system. It presents service
capacity analysis based on the physical limitations of the water system and legal and
contractual limitations, such as water rights and intertie agreements.

Design engineers must assess the capacity of each system component, such as source,
treatment, storage, transmission, or distribution, individually and in combination with
each other (WAC 246-290-222). The goal is to provide water of adequate quality,
quantity, and pressure during minimum supply and maximum demand scenarios.

Chapter 4 relies heavily on information and guidance presented in Chapter 3 where we
introduced the concept of the equivalent residential unit (ERU). Capacity evaluations
consider how much water the system can reliably produce and how many connections it
can reliably serve with a quantity of water usually expressed in ERUs. While engineers
evaluate water system capacity in ERUs, we record capacity as the total number of
approved connections on the Water Facilities Inventory form (WFI). See Attachment A at
the end of this chapter for assumptions made in the conversion between excess capacity
expressed as ERUs and approved connections.

Water systems should establish and maintain a water budget to monitor remaining
service capacity, expressed in either gallons per day or ERUs, so that the water system
does not exceed physical capacity limitations and legal water use restrictions. Design
engineers should be able to explain to the water system’s governing body and system
operator how they determined the system’s service capacity. They also should be able to
identify the limiting factor(s) and provide guidance on appropriate ways to track service
capacity as the type and number of connections change over time.

We divided this chapter into two parts to distinguish between predominantly residential
water systems and predominantly nonresidential systems. This is important because
equivalent residential units cannot be used to assess the physical capacity of
predominantly nonresidential systems.
   1. Capacity Analysis for Residential Systems: Focuses on systems where
      residential demands comprise a significant portion or all of the demand.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                               66
   2. Capacity Analysis for Nonresidential Systems: Focuses on systems where
      residential demands comprise an insignificant portion of total demand.

The Drinking Water Operating Permit Rule establishes criteria to determine water
system service adequacy, including the maximum number of allowed connections
(Chapter 246-294 WAC). If a water system exceeds its maximum number of allowed
connections, its operating permit status will change from green to “category blue.”
(WAC 246-294-040(2)(c)). You can find additional information on operating permits in
our fact sheet on this subject (DOH 331-168).

Part 1: Capacity Analysis for Residential Systems

4.1        General Expectations
Design engineers must analyze water system service capacity in planning documents
(WAC 246-290-100) and in certain project reports and engineering documents (WAC
246-290-110(4)(f)). The following examples illustrate when to complete an engineering
analysis of physical capacity.
       An existing water system does not have DOH approval, and seeks a green
        operating permit.
       An existing water system, without an approved planning document, seeks an
        increase in the number of approved connections without the need for new source
        or storage infrastructure.
       Project construction is complete, but the constructed project components differ
        from the design we approved.
       A non-expanding water system wishes to provide service to a type of connection
        not identified in its planning document, or any previous project approvals.



4.2        ERUs, Connections, and Population

4.2.1      ERUs
An ERU is a system-specific unit of measure used to express the amount of water
consumed by a typical full-time single-family residence (WAC 246-290-010). In Chapter 3,
we explain how to calculate this unit value of demand. The physical capacity analysis
must assess the water system’s ability to supply the maximum day demand (MDD) for
the entire water system and verify that the water system can maintain adequate
distribution system pressure under peak hourly demand (PHD) and under MDD plus fire


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                               67
flow conditions where it provides fire flow (WAC 246-290-230). Physical capacity
determinations for residential systems must be reported in ERUs (WAC 246-290-222(2)).

Many water systems serve a mixture of single and multifamily dwellings, commercial and
industrial customers, and other users. The ERU is a tool to translate non-single-family
residential demand into an equivalent value of demand on the system’s infrastructure.

Although it is important to establish an appropriate ERU value, and we express water
system service capacity in ERUs, water system owners and operators think in terms of
“number of connections.” And, they report connections on their Water Facilities
Inventory form.

4.2.2     Connections Served
Each single-family home, each dwelling unit in a multifamily building, and each
nonresidential building the water system serves is a connection.

This manual considers an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) a separate connection if the
ADU is physically separate from the main residence. If the ADU is physically within the
main residence, the ADU is not a separate connection.

The following examples illustrate application of “connection”:
      A system serving eight duplexes and two single-family homes serves 18 dwelling
       units. Each dwelling unit is a connection.
      A system serving eight single-family homes, each with an accessory dwelling unit
       incorporated into the main structure of the home, serves a total of eight dwelling
       units, and therefore eight connections.
      A system serving eight single-family homes, each with an accessory dwelling unit
       built as a separate structure on the same parcel, serves a total of 16 dwelling
       units, and therefore 16 connections.
      For noncommunity water systems: Each recreational campsite, RV site, and
       overnight unit in a hotel or motel is a connection. For institutional facilities,
       commercial businesses, industrial properties, schools and other nonresidential
       service connections, each building with water service is a connection.
      For community water systems: Each direct service connection to nonresidential
       users such as campgrounds, RV parks, hotels, motels, businesses, and industrial
       parks is a connection.

The number of connections is important. We use it to:
       Determine the system classification (Group A or Group B) and type (community
        or noncommunity)
       Calculate the annual operating permit fee for Group A community systems.
       Describe excess service capacity (see Chapter 4 Attachment A).

The number of ERUs is important. We us it to calculate service capacity.

4.2.3      Population Served
When designing water systems, engineers need to consider the number of people that
have access to piped water for human consumption. The population served is either the
residential (people living in a residence) or nonresidential (tourists, customers,
employees) customers entering the premises and given the opportunity to access tap
water.

For design purposes, assign at least 2.5 residents to each dwelling unit. If a proposed
system serves 10 or more dwelling units, we will review the design under the approval
standards for Group A public water systems (see WAC 246-291-200). For design
purposes, each residence must be considered a full-time residence unless there are
formal restrictions established that prevent full-time use (WAC 246-290-221 (2)).



4.3        Applying the Concept of Equivalent Residential Units in
           Design
Most small water systems serve at least some and often only single-family residences.
Single-family residential customers have a typical demand pattern. Nonresidential
customers (such as an industry or business) may have demand patterns significantly
different than single-family homes. See Section 3.6 for more information on estimating
nonresidential demands.

Engineers must evaluate and design a water system by first translating nonresidential
and multifamily consumer demands into an equivalent number of single-family
residences that system serves or will serve (WAC 246-290-222). We created a few simple
examples that illustrate how to apply the concept of ERUs in service capacity analyses.

        Example 1: Basic ERU Conversion
        A water system serves 100 single-family homes, a school, and a small business.
        After analyzing metered consumptive data for full-time occupied single-family

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                69
       homes, the engineer determines that the ERUMDD value for this system is 800 gpd.
       The estimated MDD of the school during the same high-demand period is 8,000
       gpd, and the estimated MDD for the business is 1,600 gpd.

       As summarized below, the 102 service connections this system supplies represent
       112 ERUs.
             100 homes = 100 ERUs
             School = 8,000 gpd ÷ 800 gpd per ERU = 10 ERUs
             Business = 1,600 gpd ÷ 800 gpd per ERU = 2 ERUs

       Example 2: ERUs Associated with Multifamily Residences
       A water system serves 200 single-family homes and 500 multifamily dwellings.
       After analyzing metered consumptive data for full-time occupied single-family
       homes, the engineer determines that the ERUMDD value for this system is 700 gpd.
       This water system also serves 50 apartment buildings serving 500 multifamily
       dwellings. The engineer estimates that the MDD of the 50 apartment buildings
       during the same high-demand period is 210,000 gpd.

       As summarized below, the 250 service connections this system supplies represent
       500 ERUs.
             200 homes = 200 ERUs
             Multifamily dwellings = 210,000 gpd ÷ 700 gpd per ERU = 300 ERUs

       Example 3: ERUs Associated with Nonresidential Customers
       A water system serves 1,000 single-family homes, 50 small commercial
       businesses, and a food processing plant. After analyzing metered consumptive
       data for full-time occupied single-family homes, the engineer determines that the
       ERUMDD value for this system is 600 gpd.

       The estimated collective MDD of the 50 commercial businesses is 60,000 gpd,
       and the estimated MDD of the food processing plant is 360,000 gpd during the
       same high-demand period.

       As summarized below, the 1,051 service connections this system supplies
       represent 1,700 ERUs.
             1,000 homes = 1,000 ERUs
             Commercial Businesses = 60,000 gpd ÷ 600 gpd per ERU = 100 ERUs
             Food Processor = 360,000 gpd ÷ 600 gpd per ERU = 600 ERUs

associated with distribution system leakage (DSL). See Section 3.1 about the importance
of factoring DSL into service capacity assessment.



4.4       Determining Water System Capacity
The following steps represent an approach for determining the physical capacity of a
predominantly residential water system. Engineers may propose another approach
supported by system-specific information and engineering justification. Engineers may
summarize their capacity analysis information on Worksheet 4-1 (at the end of this
chapter), or a similar form.

4.4.1      Step 1: Water Demands
Design engineers must estimate water demands (WAC 246-290-221). For systems
serving different customer classes, you should create separate estimates for residential
and nonresidential customers. For existing systems, design engineers should quantify
MDD, ADD, ERUMDD and ERUADD by using actual water consumption records. In
designing a new water system, you may use water use from an analogous water system
or the approach described in Appendix D. You should use Equation 3-1 to estimate
PHD.

4.4.2     Step 2: Source Capacity
All water systems must have sufficient source capacity to meet MDD (WAC 246-290-
222(4)). If total permanent and seasonal source capacity cannot satisfy total
consumptive demands plus DSL, do not use the equations shown later in this chapter.
Instead, the design engineer will need to perform an alternate analysis. Design
engineers proposing to use storage to meet MDD should consult with the regional
engineer on specific requirements before pursuing such a design.

In general, the total daily source capacity must be able to reliably provide sufficient
water to meet the MDD for the water system (WAC 246-290-222(4)). If sources cannot
meet or exceed PHD, then equalizing storage must be provided to meet diurnal
demands that exceed source capacity (WAC 246-290-235(2)). See Chapter 7 for
equalizing storage requirements. Sources must also meet minimum reliability
requirements (WAC 246-290-420). See Chapter 5 for design guidance for sources.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                71
Base total system source capacity on the capacity of permanent and seasonal sources
(WAC 246-290-222). Design engineers cannot include emergency sources, including
emergency interties, in the total source capacity calculations (WAC 246-290-222(3)).

Design engineers should document the approach used to assess source-based service
capacity into the physical capacity analysis and all related assumptions: data acquired to
determine full- and part-time residential, nonresidential, and non-revenue water
demands; identifying DSL; and the source adequacy and reliability issues described in
Section 3.10.

Design engineers should refer to the following information to determine source
capacity. The most limiting element establishes the source-based service capacity.
      Water rights
      Pumping tests and groundwater reliability
      Surface water (watershed) reliability
      Installed pump capacity
      Intertie capacity (if used regularly to meet demands)
      Treatment capacity

We describe each of these source capacity-limiting factors below.

4.4.2.1   Water Rights
This section recognizes that water rights have a legal bearing on water system capacity
determinations. Engineers must consider this limitation because water rights may limit
the annual withdrawal (Qa) and instantaneous withdrawal (Qi) of water that a water
system can legally withdraw from drinking water sources (WAC 246-290-110 and -130).
Use ADD in assessing water right limitations associated with Qa. Use MDD in assessing
water right limitations associated with Qi.

Although water rights place a regulatory/legal limit rather than a physical limit on the
amount of water legally available for service, design engineers must address this
important issue. Engineers must complete a Water Rights Self-Assessment Form for all
new sources and projects that increase water system physical capacity or the approved
number of connections (WAC 246-290-110(4)(e) and 130(4)(a)).

We do not have the authority to evaluate water right documents. Design engineers
should contact the Department of Ecology about issues related to water rights before

submitting a capacity analysis to us. See contact information for Ecology’s Water
Resources Program in Appendix C.

4.4.2.2   Pumping Tests and Groundwater Reliability
A pumping test analysis determines the capacity of the well(s) to provide a reliable
supply of the water needed to meet service demands. When evaluating well capacity,
the design engineer should consider each of the following:
      Historical pumping records.
      Water quality issues.
      Pumping Test Procedures (Appendix E). If wells are close in proximity then it may
       be necessary to analyze the collective withdrawal capacity with multiple wells
       operating at once, to understand the level of interference between operating wells.
      Seawater Intrusion (Section 5.5.4).

Engineers must provide their analysis of pump-test results to us (WAC 246-290-130).

4.4.2.3 Surface Water (Watershed) Reliability
Design engineers must analyze the reliability of a new surface water supply as part of
source approval (WAC 246-290-130(3)(c)). They often use hydrologic models for this
purpose. The determined “safe yield” identifies the volume of water expected during
critical dry periods. In planning for drinking water supplies, consider the safe yield as the
1-in-50 year or 1-in-100 year low flow, or a 98 or 99 percent level of annual water
supply reliability (Prasifka 1988, Connecticut DPH 2006). Design engineers should define
the expected inadequacy of supply during the return low-flow period, and address the
expected water supply deficiency in a water shortage response plan. See Section 3.10.

A hydrologic assessment is an involved process described in more detail in several
professional publications (AWWA 2007, Chow et al. 1988, Maidment 1993). In general,
the safe yield analysis consists of many elements including:
      Developing a record of the spring or river flow. This usually requires multiple
       years of daily flow records.
      Diversions for other uses.
      Mandatory minimum flows for natural resource protection or other purposes.
      Available reservoir storage given other competing demands, such as flood
       control and hydroelectric power generation.
      Precipitation patterns.
      Evaporation and evapotranspiration rates.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   73
Over time, changes in land use patterns, vegetation coverage, climate, and precipitation
patterns may require a water system to reevaluate the safe yield to ensure a reliable and
adequate water supply in the future. Water systems also must identify how to manage
their customer demand as part of an overall water shortage response plan (WAC 246-
290-100(4)(f); WAC 246-290-420).

4.4.2.4   Installed Pump Capacity
Unless we provide advanced approval to use finished water storage to meet MDD,
source-pumping capacity must be sufficient to meet MDD (WAC 246-290-222(4)).
Design engineers should consider each of the following when evaluating installed pump
capacity:
      Metered source production and water system demand records.
      System head conditions when pumping to storage or distribution, and when
       pumping from wells with significant seasonal changes in dynamic (pumping)
       water levels.
      Pump curve(s).
      Pump controls and logic.
      An engineering analysis that verifies pump performance under actual system
       head conditions.

4.4.2.5   Interties
Nonemergency interties with neighboring approved water systems can provide
additional source capacity for evaluating source-based service capacity. The engineer
should evaluate each nonemergency intertie to determine its limitations. It is important
to consider elements such as hydraulic limitations, water quality, and legal restrictions
associated with water rights, or conditions on the purchase contract that define service
restrictions. Section 5.9 provides further discussion and guidance on interties.

4.4.2.6   Treatment Capacity
A treatment capacity analysis determines whether any installed treatment processes
limit the water system’s source production capacity. When applying water treatment,
such as filtration or blending to one or more sources, the net treatment plant
production in combination with other untreated sources must be able to reliably supply
at least the MDD while meeting all water quality performance requirements (WAC 246-
290-222(5)).

Design engineers must translate nominal treatment plant capacity to net treatment
plant capacity by deducting water volume and the time devoted to backwash and filter

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 74
to waste (filtration), and other required limitations on production necessary to maintain
treatment efficacy (blending) (WAC 246-290-222(5)).

4.4.2.7    Determining ERUs based on Source Capacity
The engineer needs to evaluate the capacity of each individual source a water system
uses. The overall water system source-capacity is the sum of the reliable production
capability from each source, excluding emergency sources.

The amount of water that any source may provide is the product of its delivery rate and
the amount of time it is used for service.

  Equation 4-1:     Individual Source Capacity

                Vj  Qj t j 

  Where:

   Vj = Total volume for source “j” over a 24-hour period (excluding emergency
        sources)
   Qj = Delivery rate of source (gallons per unit time)

    tj = Time that source “j” delivered flow (Qj) over a 24-hour period. We
         recommend assessing daily source capacity based on 20 hours of pumping
         per day (1,200 minutes per day). See Section 3.10.

Engineers should base the design flow-rate (Qj) for each source on any limiting factor
that might restrict the peak-flow rate during maximum demand periods (such as well,
stream, or aquifer capacity; installed pumping capacity; intertie capacity; treatment
limitations and net treatment production; and/ or legal limitations such as water right
limits).

Engineers should base the time (tj) for each individual source on the period it can be, or
is, used over a 24-hour period during maximum demand periods. For example, a pump
may be restricted to operate for only a designated amount of time each day, or a
treatment plant may produce water for only certain periods each day.

To determine maximum source-production capacity, it is clear that pumping for the full
1,440 minutes a day will provide the highest estimate for water system capacity,
expressed in ERUs. However, it may not be practical or advisable to operate source
pumps continually for 24 hours, even during peak-demand periods. We recommend

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 75
assessing daily source capacity based on 20 hours (1,200 minutes) of pumping in a 24-
hour period, to provide a factor of safety to the assessment.

When engineers know the specific delivery-rate and operation-time of delivery for each
source, they can use Equation 4-2 to determine total source capacity (the total quantity
of water available over a specified period from all sources except emergency sources).

 Equation 4-2:      Total Source Capacity
               VT    Qj  tj    Vj

 Where:
   ∑ = Summation

    j = Individual source designation, excluding emergency sources

  VT = Total volume of water delivered from all nonemergency sources over a 24-
       hour period.

Engineers can use Equation 4-3 to determine ERUs based on source capacity, and
Equations 4-4a and 4-4b to determine the service capacity based on water right
limitations.

                    [ERUADD x 365]

Where:
 N = Number of ERUs based on the ERUADD value

Engineers may summarize their source capacity analysis information on Worksheet 4-1
(at the end of this chapter), or a similar form. Alternately, design engineers may estimate
the average daily demand of each demand component separately (single-family
residential, multifamily, commercial, and so forth) plus DSL.

4.4.3      Step 3: Capacity Based on Storage
The design engineer must consider each of the following storage elements when
determining the total storage volume requirement (WAC 236-290-235), whether the
element relates directly to system capacity or not:
       Operational storage (OS). Adequate OS is important for efficient and reliable
        operation of sources. The design engineer must identify and provide adequate
        OS (WAC 246-290-222), but OS is not directly related to system capacity.
       Equalizing storage (ES). ES volume is based on PHD demand requirements. See
        Equation 4-6. To calculate ES volume, multiply the differential between
        operational source capacity and PHD times 150 minutes (2.5 hours). ES relates
        directly to system capacity.
       Standby storage (SB). SB allows a water system to maintain adequate pressure
        in the event of a mechanical, electrical or water quality issue with a source of
        supply, pumping or treatment system. See Equation 4-7. Detailed
        recommendations are in Section 7.1.1.3. SB volume is based on consumer
        expectations. ES and SB storage design calculations are exclusive of one another.
        SB relates directly to system capacity.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 77
      Fire suppression storage (FSS), if applicable. The local fire authority establishes
       FSS and fire-flow rate and duration, generally based on land use. Engineers can
       partially address FSS volume by developing multiple sources (or multiple pumps
       in a single source, if applicable. See Section 5.11.2); emergency interties (see
       Section 5.9.2) and back-up power generation (see Section 5.11.1); and “nesting”
       SB and FSS (see Section 7.1.1.4). FSS does not relate directly to system capacity.
      Dead storage (DS). DS is the volume of stored water not available to all
       consumers at the minimum design pressure (WAC 246-290-230(5) and (6)). DS
       does not relate directly to system capacity.

The water system design must satisfy the minimum storage requirements of WAC 246-
290-235. Elements to consider when determining minimum storage requirements
include:
      The number of sources.
      Source capacity.
      ERUADD, ERUMDD, and peak-hourly demands.
      Local fire-suppression requirements.
      The level of service and manner used to achieve reliability requirements
       described in (WAC 246-290-420).
      Adequacy of storage in specific pressure zones.
      Power grid reliability.
      Pressure requirements in the distribution system.

4.4.3.1   ERUs Based on Equalizing Storage
Equalizing storage must be available when determined necessary based on available, or
designed source pumping capacity (WAC 246-290-235(2)). Equation 4-5 is the result of
combining Equation 3-1 with Equation 7-1, allowing a solution for needed ES given a
number of ERUs (N value). Key concepts associated with the use of Equations 4-5 and 4-
6:
      Applies to water systems with significant residential demand.
      N is the number of ERUs supplied by all sources. DSL has an associated number
       of ERUs (see examples in Section 3.12 and Worksheet 4-1). Therefore, N includes
       DSL. “N” is the number of connections only if there is no distribution system
       leakage and all connections are single-family homes.
      Check to be sure that ERUMDD times “N” equals total maximum daily source
       production.
      The ERU value is ERUMDD. It is not appropriate to apply the ERU ADD value.

              PHD = (ERU MDD /1440) [(C)(N) + F] + 18

                                             day)
            Determine ES (see Section 7.1.1.2)
                   ES = (PHD - Qs)(150 minutes)
              Where:

                 ES    =   Equalizing storage component, in gallons
               PHD     =   Peak hourly demand, in gpm
                 QS    =   Sum of all installed and active supply source capacities except
                           emergency supply, in gpm.


If the calculated ES volume is greater than the available ES volume, then there is not
sufficient ES for the number of ERUs.

Equation 4-6 allows design engineers to solve for the number of ERUs (N) that a given
volume of ES can supply. This approach applies to the most common method for
controlling reservoir level, known as a “call-on-demand” system, which calls on the
source(s) at a preset reservoir level(s).

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                       79
Restating Equation 4-5 to solve for N, one can solve for N given available ES:

  Equation 4-6:
  N = 1/C[(1440)/(ERUMDD)(ES/150 + Qs – 18) – F]


Procedure for solving for N based on available ES (using Equation 4-6):
   1. Calculate available ES. The water system must maintain a 30-psi pressure in the
      distribution system under PHD when ES is depleted (WAC 246-290-230(5)).
   2. Determine the ERUMDD and Qs.
   3. Select the lowest N value calculated from among Equation 4-3 (source capacity)
      and Equation 4-4 (water rights).
   4. From Table 3-1 select the appropriate values for both C and F for the N value
      determined in Step 3.
   5. Use Equation 4-6 and solve for N.
   6. If the resulting value of N lies outside the range associated with the C and F
      values selected in Step 4, repeat the calculation using Equation 4-6 by using a
      different set of values for C and F. Continue until the value for N lies within the
      range of ERUs associated with the values for C and F selected. After completing
      these iterative calculations, the final value for N equals ERUs that a given
      equalizing storage volume can supply.

4.4.3.2   ERUs Based on Standby Storage
Standby storage is a volume of finished water a water system reserves to maintain a
certain level of service if one or more permanent or seasonal source of supply becomes
partially or completely unavailable for use.

Water systems must provide standby storage in an amount necessary to maintain
reliable water service (WAC 246-290-235(3) and WAC 246-290-420). We recommend SB
volume equal to the MDD for the pressure zone(s) served (i.e., Td =1 day) and adjust SB
volume based on redundant sources and other factors (see Section 7.1.1.3). To satisfy
WAC 246-290-235 and -420, we recommend that water systems provide a minimum
standby storage volume of 200 gpd per ERU regardless of such factors.

At times, design engineers may consider SB nested within FSS. See Chapter 7 for detail
on recommended sizing of the SB storage component, particularly when a water system
has multiple sources (or multiple pumps in a single source. See Section 5.11.2), an

emergency intertie (see Section 5.9.2), and/or back-up power generation (see Section
5.11.1).

  Equation 4-7:
                         SB
                 N
                      SBi t d 
  Where:

    N = Number of ERUs based on the ERUMDD value

  SB = Total volume of water in standby storage component (gallons). See Section
        7.1.1.3.
  SBi = Selected volume of standby storage to meet water system-determined
        standard of reliability in gallons per day per ERU (number of ERUs based on
        the ERUMDD value)
    td = Number of days selected to meet water system-determined standard of
         reliability.
Manipulate Equation 4-7 to solve for SB when you design new or expand water systems
and you know the number of ERUs (N).

Engineers may enter tabulated results for Equations 4-6 and 4-7 on Worksheet 4-1, or a
similar form.

4.4.4      Step 4: Capacity Based on Distribution Facilities
Design engineers must use a hydraulic analysis when evaluating distribution system
capacity (WAC 246-290-230(1)). In most cases, DOH will require a well-documented
hydraulic model. For some small, simple systems, DOH may accept manual calculations.
Chapter 6 discusses transmission and distribution system design in detail.
Design engineers typically evaluate distribution systems under two conditions:
       Peak hour demand (PHD) (WAC 246-290-230(5))
       Maximum day demand (MDD) plus fire flow, if applicable (WAC 246-290-230(6))

Use a hydraulic analysis to determine whether the size of distribution system
components are adequate to provide residual pressure at the customer meter or
property line according to the water system’s adopted standards, or the following
minimum residual pressures, whichever is greater:


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 81
      At least 30 psi for new water systems or additions to existing water systems
       under PHD conditions (WAC 246-290-230(5)).
      At the approved design pressure, but not less than 20 psi, under PHD for existing
       systems (WAC 246-290-420(2)).
      At least 20 psi under demands that include MDD and fire flow (WAC 246-290-
       230(6).

4.4.4.1   ERUs Based on Maintaining Adequate Residual Pressure under PHD
          Conditions
A water system must be able to provide PHD and (if applicable) maximum day demand
plus needed fire flow while maintaining compliance with certain minimum pressure
requirements throughout the distribution system (WAC 246-290-230(5)).

Engineers determine distribution adequacy on a pressure zone basis. The physical
capacity of the distribution system is based solely on the ability of the water
system to deliver the PHD while maintaining 30 psi or the approved design
pressure throughout the system. When physical capacity limitations exist within a
specific part of the distribution system, and until a solution is in place, design engineers
should:
      Identify and report hydraulic deficiencies in PHD capacity to the water system
       and local planning and building department.
      Prioritize capital improvements to address deficiencies in delivering PHD within a
       reasonable timeframe.
      Help the water system identify and document operational steps that mitigate
       hydraulic deficiencies, so that distribution system pressure will not be less than 20
       psi at any service connection during PHD conditions.

4.4.4.2   Fire Flow Effects on Capacity
While design engineers usually size distribution system facilities to meet fire flow demands,
the number of connections that a water system can serve is independent of fire flow
demands. Therefore, inadequate fire flow capacity does not limit the number of approved
ERUs or connections. It is up to the local fire authority to decide whether to restrict
development based on fire flow capacity. As part of the design analysis, you should:
      Identify and report hydraulic deficiencies in fire flow capacity to the local fire
       authority, the water system, and local planning and building department. .
      Prioritize capital improvements to meet potential fire flow demands within a
       reasonable period, and coordinate these improvements with the local fire
       authority.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      82
       Help the water system and local fire authority to prepare operational plans that
        reflect hydraulic deficiencies in providing fire flow.

You must design distribution systems so that at least 20 psi can be maintained
throughout the distribution system under fire flow conditions during maximum day
demand (WAC 246-290-230(6)).

4.4.5      Step 5: Factoring DSL into Capacity Analysis
Distribution system leakage (see Section 3.8) exerts as real a demand on sources,
storage, and distribution systems as actual customers. Evaluating water system capacity
without considering the productive and distributive requirements associated with DSL
will overstate water system capacity.
There are several ways to apply DSL to a water system capacity analysis:
       Express DSL as a separate demand on the water system, and express DSL in terms
        of ERUs based on ERUMDD (see Section 3.12 examples and Chapter 4 Attachment
        A). We recommend this option. It offers the advantage of making clear the
        number of ERUs unavailable to the water system because of DSL, and so
        provides the basis to compare the cost and effort involved in increasing service
        capacity by (1) increasing infrastructure capacity; (2) decreasing consumer
        demands (ERUMDD and ERUADD); and (3) reducing DSL.
       Spread out DSL equally among all customers on an ERU basis. Design engineers
        may take this approach if the existing system serves only (or almost only) full-
        time single-family homes. This approach inserts DSL into the derived ERU MDD and
        ERUADD values.

4.4.6      Step 6: Determine Limiting Criteria and Water System Service
           Capacity in ERUs
Attachment A provides an example of determining system capacity for a mixed use,
predominantly residential water system. The example presumes defined values for
ERUADD, ERUMDD, system-wide ADD and MDD, and PHD. Refer to Chapter 3 for guidance
on determining water system demand values.

We recommend that design engineers summarize the element(s) that limit water system
capacity as well as the capacity of each system element (e.g., source production, water
rights, storage, pumping). This information would inform water system managers when
and which water system element to address to maintain water system capacity in
support of their growing communities.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 83
Part 2: Capacity Analysis for Nonresidential Systems

Nonresidential water systems do not lend themselves to analysis using ERUs as a
common measure of demand. We recommend that design engineers analyze
nonresidential water systems by identifying the composite ADD, MDD, and PHD for
each customer or customer class. Section 3.6 provides guidance on determining water
demand for nonresidential systems.



4.5       Methodology to Determine Water System Capacity
The following steps represent an approach for determining a predominantly
nonresidential water system’s physical capacity. Engineers may propose another
approach supported by system-specific information and engineering justification.

4.5.1     Step 1: Water Demands
Design engineers must estimate water demands (WAC 246-290-221). For systems
serving different customer classes, you should create separate estimates for residential
and nonresidential connections. For existing systems, design engineers should quantify
MDD and ADD using actual water consumption records. In designing a new water
system, water use from an analogous water system or the approach described in
Appendix D may be used. Engineers should use Equation 3-1 to estimate PHD for the
residential portion of demand. For the nonresidential PHD, refer to Sections 3.5.2, 3.6,
and 3.6.2.

4.5.2     Step 2: Source Capacity
All water systems must have sufficient source capacity to meet MDD (WAC 246-290-
222(4)). If total permanent and seasonal source capacity cannot satisfy total
consumptive demands plus DSL, do not use the equations shown later in this chapter. In
that case, the design engineer must perform an alternate analysis. Design engineers
proposing to use storage to meet MDD should consult with the regional engineer on
specific requirements before pursuing such a design.

In general, the total daily source capacity must be able to reliably provide sufficient
water to meet the MDD for the water system (WAC 246-290-222(4)). If sources cannot
meet or exceed PHD, then equalizing storage must be provided to meet diurnal
demands that exceed source capacity (WAC 246-290-235(2)). See Chapter 7 for
equalizing storage requirements. Sources also must meet minimum reliability
requirements (WAC 246-290-420). See Chapter 5 for design guidance for sources.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                84
Base total system source capacity on the capacity of permanent and seasonal sources
(WAC 246-290-222). Design engineers cannot include emergency sources, including
emergency interties, in the total source capacity calculations (WAC 246-290-222(3)).

Design engineers should document the approach they use to assess source-based
service capacity into the physical capacity analysis and all related assumptions: data
acquired to determine full- and part-time residential, nonresidential, and nonrevenue
water demands; identifying DSL; and the source adequacy and reliability issues
described in Section 3.10.

Design engineers should refer to the following information to determine source
capacity. The most limiting element establishes the source-based service capacity.
      Water rights
      Pumping tests and groundwater reliability
      Surface water (watershed) reliability
      Installed pump capacity
      Intertie capacity (if used regularly to meet demands)
      Treatment capacity

We describe each of these source capacity-limiting factors below.

4.5.2.1   Water Rights
This section recognizes that water rights have a legal bearing on water system capacity
determinations. Engineers must consider this limitation because water rights may limit
the legal annual withdrawal (Qa) and instantaneous withdrawal (Qi) a water system can
make from drinking water sources. Use ADD in assessing water right limitations
associated with Qa. Use MDD in assessing water right limitations associated with Qi.

Although water rights place a regulatory/legal limit rather than a physical limit on the
amount of water legally available for service, design engineers must address this
important issue. Engineers must complete a Water Rights Self-Assessment Form for all
new sources and projects that increase water system physical capacity or the approved
number of connections (WAC 246-290-110(4)(e) and 130(4)(a)).

We do not have the authority to evaluate water right documents. Design engineers
should contact the Department of Ecology about issues related to water rights before
submitting a capacity analysis to us.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   85
4.5.2.2   Pumping Tests and Groundwater Reliability
A pumping test analysis determines the capacity of the well(s) to reliably supply the
water needed to meet service demands. When evaluating well capacity, the design
engineer should consider each of the following:
      Historical pumping records.
      Water quality issues.
      Pumping Test Procedures (Appendix E). If wells are close in proximity then it may
       be necessary to analyze the collective withdrawal capacity with multiple wells
       operating at once, to understand the level of interference between operating
       wells
      Seawater Intrusion (Section 5.5.4)

Engineers must provide their analysis of pump-test results to us (WAC 246-290-130).

4.5.2.3   Surface Water (Watershed) Reliability
Design engineers must analyze the reliability of a new surface water supply as part of
source approval (WAC 246-290-130(3)(c)). They often use hydrologic models for this
purpose. The determined “safe yield” identifies the volume of water expected during
critical dry periods. In planning for drinking water supplies, the safe yield is the 1-in-50
year or 1-in-100 year low flow, or a 98 or 99 percent level of annual water supply
reliability (Prasifka 1988, Connecticut DPH 2006). Design engineers should define the
expected inadequacy of supply during the return low-flow period, and address the
expected water supply deficiency in a water shortage response plan. See Section 3.10.2.

A hydrologic assessment is an involved process described in more detail in several
professional publications (AWWA 2007, Chow et al. 1988, Maidment 1992). In general,
the safe yield analysis consists of many elements, including:
      A record of the spring or river flow. Multiple years of daily flow records are
       usually necessary.
      Diversions for other uses.
      Mandatory minimum flows for natural resource protection or other purposes.
      Reservoir storage that can be used given other competing demands such as
       flood control and hydroelectric power generation.
      Precipitation patterns.
      Evaporation and evapotranspiration rates.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   86
Over time, changes in land use patterns, vegetation coverage, climate, and precipitation
patterns may necessitate the reevaluation of the safe yield to ensure a reliable and
adequate water supply in the future. Water systems must also identify how to manage
their customer demand as part of an overall water shortage response plan (WAC 246-
290-100(4)(f); WAC 246-290-420).

4.5.2.4   Installed Pump Capacity
Unless we provide advanced approval to use finished water storage to meet MDD,
source-pumping capacity must be sufficient to meet MDD. Design engineers should
consider each of the following when evaluating installed pump capacity:
      Metered source production and water system demand records.
      System head conditions when pumping to storage or distribution, and when
       pumping from wells with significant seasonal changes in dynamic (pumping)
       water levels.
      Pump curve(s).
      Pump controls and logic.
      An engineering analysis that verifies pump performance under actual system
       head conditions.

4.5.2.5 Interties
Nonemergency interties with neighboring approved water systems can provide
additional source capacity for evaluating source-based service capacity. The engineer
should evaluate each nonemergency intertie to determine its limitations. It is important
to consider elements such as hydraulic limitations, water quality, and legal restrictions
associated with water rights, or conditions on the purchase contract that define service
restrictions. Section 5.9 provides further discussion and guidance on interties.

4.5.2.6   Treatment Capacity
A treatment capacity analysis determines whether any installed treatment processes
limit the water system’s source production capacity. When applying water treatment
such as filtration or blending to one or more sources, the net treatment plant
production in combination with other untreated sources must be able to reliably supply
at least the MDD while meeting all water quality performance requirements (WAC 246-
290-222(5)).

Design engineers must translate nominal treatment plant capacity to net treatment
plant capacity by deducting water volume and the time devoted to backwash and filter


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 87
to waste (filtration), and other required limitations on production necessary to maintain
treatment efficacy (blending) (WAC 246-290-222(5)).

4.5.2.7    Determining Capacity based on Source of Supply
The engineer needs to evaluate the capacity of each individual source a water system
uses. The overall water system source-capacity is the sum of the reliable production
capability from each source, excluding emergency sources.

The amount of water that any source may provide is the product of its delivery rate and
the amount of time it is used for service.

  Equation 4-1:       Individual Source Capacity

                Vj  Qj t j 

  Where:

   Vj = Total volume for source “j” over a 24-hour period (excluding emergency

           sources)

   Qj = Delivery rate of source (gallons per unit time)

    tj = Time that source “j” delivered flow (Qj) over a 24-hour period. We
         recommend assessing daily source capacity based on 20 hours of pumping
         per day (1,200 minutes per day). See Section 3.10.

Engineers should base the design flow-rate (Qj) for each source on any limiting factor
that might restrict the peak-flow rate during maximum demand periods (such as well,
stream, or aquifer capacity; installed pumping capacity; intertie capacity; treatment
limitations and net treatment production; and legal limitations such as water right
limits).

Engineers should base the time (tj) for each individual source on the period it can be, or
is, used over a 24-hour period during maximum demand periods. For example, a pump
may be restricted to operate for only a designated amount of time each day, or a
treatment plant may produce water for only certain periods each day.

To determine maximum source-production capacity, it is clear that pumping for the full
1,440 minutes a day will provide the highest estimate for water system capacity.
However, it may not be practical or advisable to operate source pumps continually for
24 hours, even during peak-demand periods. We recommend assessing daily source
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 88
capacity based on 20 hours (1,200 minutes) of pumping in a 24-hour period, to provide
a factor of safety to the assessment.

When engineers know the specific delivery-rate and operation-time of delivery for each
source, they can use Equation 4-2 to determine total source capacity (the total quantity of
water available over a specified time period from all sources except emergency sources).

 Equation 4-2:        Total Source Capacity
                 VT    Qj  tj    Vj

 Where:
   ∑ = Summation

       j = Individual source designation, excluding emergency sources

  VT = Total volume of water delivered from all nonemergency sources over a 24-
       hour period.

4.5.3       Step 3: Capacity Based on Storage
The design engineer must consider each of the following storage elements when
determining the total storage volume requirement (WAC 236-290-235), even when the
element does not relate directly to system capacity:
        Operational storage (OS). Adequate OS is important for efficient and reliable
         operation of sources. The design engineer must identify and provide adequate
         OS (WAC 246-290-222), but OS is not directly related to system capacity.
        Equalizing storage (ES). ES volume is based on PHD demand requirements. See
         Equation 4-6. To calculate ES volume, multiply the differential between
         operational source capacity and PHD times 150 minutes (2.5 hours). ES relates
         directly to system capacity.
        Standby storage (SB). SB allows a water system to maintain adequate pressure
         in the event of a mechanical, electrical or water quality issue with a source of
         supply, pumping, or treatment system. See Equation 4-7. Detailed
         recommendations are in Section 7.1.1.3. SB volume is based on consumer
         expectations. ES and SB storage design calculations are exclusive of one another.
         SB relates directly to system capacity.
        Fire suppression storage (FSS), if applicable. The local fire authority establishes
         FSS and fire flow rate and duration, generally based on land use. Engineers can
         partially address FSS volume by developing multiple sources (or multiple pumps
         in a single source, if applicable; see Section 5.11.2); emergency interties (see
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  89
       Section 5.9.2), and back-up power generation (see Section 5.11.1); and “nesting”
       SB and FSS (see Section 7.1.1.4). FSS does not relate directly to system capacity.
      Dead storage (DS). DS is the volume of stored water not available to all
       consumers at the minimum design pressure (WAC 246-290-230(5) and (6)). DS
       does not relate directly to system capacity.

The water system design must satisfy the minimum storage requirements of WAC 246-
290-235. Elements that define minimum storage requirements include:
      The number of sources.
      Source capacity.
      MDD, ADD, and PHD.
      Local fire-suppression requirements.
      The level of service and manner used to achieve reliability requirements
       described in WAC 246-290-420.
      Adequacy of storage in specific pressure zones.
      Power grid reliability.
      Pressure requirements in the distribution system.

4.5.3.1   Equalizing Storage
Equalizing storage must be available when determined necessary based on available, or
designed, source pumping capacity (WAC 246-290-235(2)).

4.5.3.2   Standby Storage
Standby storage is a volume of finished water a water system reserves to maintain a
certain level of service if one or more permanent or seasonal source of supply becomes
partially or completely unavailable for use. See Section 7.1.1.3 for recommendations on
SB for some types of nonresidential water systems.

4.5.4     Step 4: Capacity Based on Distribution Facilities
Design engineers must use a hydraulic analysis when evaluating distribution system
capacity (WAC 246-290-230(1)). In most cases, DOH will require a well-documented
hydraulic model. We may accept manual calculations for some small, simple systems.
Chapter 6 discusses transmission and distribution system design in detail.

Design engineers typically evaluate distribution systems under two conditions:
      Peak hour demand (PHD) (WAC 246-290-230(5))

Use a hydraulic analysis to determine whether the size of distribution system
components can adequately provide residual pressure at the customer meter or
property line according to the water system’s adopted standards, or the following
minimum residual pressures, whichever is greater:
      At least 30 psi for new water systems or additions to existing water systems
       under PHD conditions (WAC 246-290-230(5))
      At the approved design pressure, but not less than 20 psi, under PHD for existing
       systems (WAC 246-290-420(2))
      At least 20 psi under demands that include MDD and fire flow (WAC 246-290-
       230(6).

4.5.4.1   PHD Conditions
A water system must be able to provide PHD and (if applicable) maximum day demand
plus needed fire flow while maintaining compliance with certain minimum pressure
requirements throughout the distribution system (WAC 246-290-230(5)).

Engineers determine distribution adequacy on a pressure zone basis. The physical
capacity of the distribution system is based solely on the ability of the water
system to deliver the PHD while maintaining 30 psi or the approved design
pressure throughout the system. When physical capacity limitations exist within a
specific part of the distribution system, and until a solution is in place, design engineers
should:
      Identify and report hydraulic deficiencies in PHD capacity to the water system
       and local planning and building department.
      Prioritize capital improvements to address deficiencies in delivering PHD within a
       reasonable timeframe.
      Help the water system identify and document operational steps that mitigate
       hydraulic deficiencies, so that distribution system pressure will not be less than 20
       psi at any service connection during PHD conditions.

4.5.4.2   Fire Flow Conditions
Design engineers must consider fire conditions, if applicable (WAC 246-290-230). The
local fire authority decides whether to restrict development based on fire flow capacity.
As part of the design analysis, you should:
      Identify and report hydraulic deficiencies in fire flow capacity to the local fire
       authority, the water system, and local planning and building department.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      91
       Prioritize capital improvements to meet potential fire flow demands within a
        reasonable period, and coordinate these improvements with the local fire
        authority.
       Help the water system and local fire authority to prepare operational plans that
        reflect hydraulic deficiencies in providing fire flow.

You must design the distribution system so that at least 20 psi can be maintained
throughout the distribution system under fire flow conditions during maximum day
demand (WAC 246-290-230(6)).

4.5.5      Step 5: Factoring DSL into Capacity Analysis
Distribution system leakage (see Section 3.8) exerts as real a demand on sources,
storage, and distribution systems as actual customers. Evaluating water system capacity
without considering the productive and distributive requirements associated with DSL
will overstate water system capacity. Engineers must include DSL when estimating
system-wide ADD and MDD (WAC 246-290-820).



4.6        Documenting Nonresidential Water System Capacity
The capacity of nonresidential systems should reflect existing customer demands and
assumptions about future customers and their demand pattern. Express capacity as the
nonresidential system’s ability to supply MDD and PHD reliably to a specific set of
existing or planned buildings and population. We will hold the nonresidential water
system owner accountable for operating within the approved capacity of the system as
documented in the approved design documents.



4.7        Examples of Nonresidential Water System Capacity Analysis
The following examples illustrate the concepts presented in this chapter. They do not
represent a recipe for completing a capacity assessment of a new, expanding, or existing
nonexpanding nonresidential water system.

Example 1: Port District (expanding)

Given:
A port district owns an existing water system that serves one industrial and four
commercial customers. DOH approved the system is to serve five nonresidential
connections. Currently, we consider this system “built-out.”

A single deep well turbine pump supplies the system. The total source capacity is 6.0
MGD, based on 20 hours of pumping and a pumping capacity of 5,000 gpm. A variable
frequency drive modulates flow from the deep well turbine pump to match system
demand. The port’s water right allows groundwater withdrawal of 5,000 gpm and 4,500
ac-ft. per year. The system has no storage and no treatment. Distribution system piping
is looped 12- and 16-inch ductile iron pipe. The system supplies one industrial
connection and four commercial connections. See water demand information below:
       User    ADD     MDD     PHD                        Source of information
                                      ADD and MDD taken from source meter readings.

                                      Therefore, it includes DSL. Includes factor of safety.

 Commercial
 Implied DSL   0.2    0.2     150     DSL estimated.


The port district receives notice from the industrial customer. Proposed process changes
will increase the facility’s ADD by 0.2 MGD, MDD by 0.5 MGD, and PHD by 500 gpm. The
port agrees to amend its contract with the industrial customer.

At the same time, the port commissioners decide to subdivide unused port land to increase
the number of customers. The port is willing to construct storage to improve reliability and
provide fire suppression, but it is not willing to construct a new source of supply. The
district’s budget for water system improvements is $2.5 million. The undeveloped land may
support a maximum of 10 industrial and commercial building sites.

The district intends to market the new industrial and commercial sites based on the
availability of “an abundant water supply.” The commissioners want to maximize the
number of new sites, and to promise prospective leasees a minimum MDD and PHD for
each new site in keeping with the “abundance” marketing theme.

The local fire marshal determined fire flow requirements are 3,000 gpm for 3 hours, and
that fire suppression storage may be nested with standby storage.

Find:
The number of sites the port can develop and the volume/flow of water should be
marketed and reserved for each new site.

Solution:
   1. Revised ADD, MDD, and PHD of existing system after industrial customer
      changes:
        a. System ADD = 2.3 + 0.2 = 2.5 MGD
        b. System MDD = 3.8 + 0.5 = 4.3 MGD
        c. System PHD = 3,500 + 450 + 150 + 500 = 4,600 gpm
   2. Remaining available water rights, ADD, and MDD:
        a. 5,000 – 4,600 = 400 gpm (Qi)
        b. [4,500 af/yr. x 326,000 gallons per af] – 2.5 MGD x 365 = 555 MG per year (Qa)
        c. Remaining available ADD: 555 MG ÷ 365 = 1.5 MGD
        d. Remaining available MDD (20 hours pumping): 6.0 – 4.3 = 1.7 MGD
        e. Remaining available MDD (24 hours pumping): 7.2 – 4.3 = 3.9 MGD
   3. Preliminary design and engineering cost estimate indicate a 1.0 MG elevated
      reservoir is the maximum size an engineer can design and construct for less than
      $2.5 million.
   4. The following table explores options for new building site use and water supply
      allocation based on proposed commercial and industrial water supply contracts:

         Option                     Commercial               Industrial                Total

10 Commercial sites           1.0      1.5    1,000     0        0        0      1.0    1.5    1,000
1 Industrial & 8 Comm         0.8      1.2     800     0.7      1.2     2,000    1.5    2.4    2,800

   5. Operational storage requirements are minimal, given the variable frequency drive
      on the source pump. Allocate 0.05 MG to OS. The remaining storage is available
      for equalizing, standby, and fire suppression storage.
   6. The following table summarizes the capacity evaluation for each option:

                                                    Storage needed: 0.68 MG

                                                    SB = Not promised in service contracts
                                                    Storage needed: 0.95 MG
 2 Industrial & 3   Adequate to       Qa and Qi     OS = 0.05 MG
 Comm               supply MDD if     adequate      Fire flow = 0.54 MG
                    pumped 24 hours                 ES = [(4,600 + 4,300) – 5,000] x 150 = 0.58
                    per day                         MG
                                                    SB = Not promised in service contracts
                                                    Storage needed: 1.18 MG


   7. For each option, the existing 12- and 16-inch looped distribution system is not a
      limiting factor. Hydraulic modeling indicates: (1) At the bottom of ES during PHD,
      pressure at all points along the distribution system should be greater than 30 psi;
      (2) At the bottom of fire suppression storage during MDD plus needed fire flow,
      pressure at all points along the distribution system should be greater than 20 psi.

   8. Conclusions: The port commissioners may:
        a. Select the first option (10 new commercial connections), which leaves a supply
           and storage cushion if customers exceed their allotted MDD and PHD water
           supply.
        b. Select the second option (1 new industrial and 8 new commercial
           connections), but this leaves no supply or storage cushion, and assumes a
           22+-hour per day pumping duty to meet MDD.
        c. Not select the third option (2 industrial and 3 commercial connections)
           without changing the assumptions about contracted MDD and PHD for each
           customer, or increasing the budget to construct a larger reservoir.
   9. To illustrate, assume the port selects the second option. In that case, our approval
      letter will specifically reference the following information:
        a. Approved for 14 nonresidential connections.
        b. The port district needs to operate within the approved design parameters.

Example 2 – Youth Camp (expanding and increasing use)

Given:
An existing youth camp supplied by:
      A single well producing 18 gpm with greensand filtration for iron/manganese
       removal that is 90 percent efficient.
      A 20,000-gallon ground level storage tank.
      A booster pump station consisting of two 40-gpm pumps that can in parallel
       deliver about 70 gpm to the distribution system. Under peak demand, the pumps
       and distribution system can deliver only at 25 psi at the recreation center (north
       end of system) and camp director’s home (south end of system).

The camp water system:
      Originally approved in 1969 for 15 cabins and the dining hall, based on providing
       20 psi during PHD. There have been no approvals since 1969.
      Currently has a “Blue” operating permit, since it is operating outside its design
       approval.
      Consists of 2- and 3-inch PVC water mains and no service meters.
      Is not required to provide fire suppression (per the local fire authority).
      Serves a dining hall, recreation center, lakeside bathhouse, individual homes for
       the camp director and the chief maintenance superintendent, common toilet and
       shower building, and 34 primitive cabins without water service, for a total of 40
       structures.
      Irrigates a ball field.

The camp:
      Has a local permit approving maximum occupancy of 220 persons.
      Operates from late May until early September.
      Holds a water right for 4 ac ft. per year (Qa) and 20 gpm (Qi).

Existing water system demand information:
      Estimated MDD is 15,000 gpd, including DSL and a factor of safety, based on the
       last 3 years of source production information.
      Estimated PHD is 40-50 gpm.
      Annual source production is 0.75 MG, including a factor of safety, based on the
       last 3 years of source production information.

Find:
The board of directors want to expand the period of operation, from early April until late
October, to cater to other visitor groups on weekends during non-summer months. The
camp also wants to increase the approved occupancy to 300, to include campers,
administrators, and camp counselors.

Determine whether the existing water system has the capacity to support the directors’
vision and, if not, identify the improvements needed to do so.

Solution:
   1. Source treatment capacity is 18 gpm x 20 hours per day x 0.9 = 19,000 gpd
   2. Remaining available water rights, MDD, and PHD:
        a. Remaining available Qa: [4 af x 326,000 gallons per af] – 0.75 MG = 0.55 MG
        b. Remaining available Qi: 20 gpm – 18 gpm = 2 gpm
        c. Remaining available MDD: 19,000 – 15,000 = 4,000 gpd
        d. Remaining available PHD: 70 gpm – 50 gpm = 20 gpm
   3. Each additional overnight camper or counselor: 50 gpd per camper (Table 3.2)
   4. 4,000 gpd excess MDD ÷ 50 gpd per camper = 80 new campers
   5. 80 new campers will require construction of 10 new rustic cabins, conversion of
      the recreation center into a dual use dining and recreation facility, and
      construction of a second toilet and shower building, comprising a total 40
      (existing) + 10 + 1 = 51 structures – 49 nonresidential and 2 residential.
   6. PHD estimated at (19,000 ÷ 1,440) x 4.5 = 59 gpm (eq. 3-2). Use 60 gpm.
        a. Existing booster pump capacity (in gpm) is considered sufficient
   7. Storage analysis of expanded systems:
        a. OS = 20 minutes of source off to allow for filter backwash and well pump “off”
           cycle for pump protection = 20 minutes x 60 gpm = 1,200 gallons
        b. ES required = [60 gpm – (18 x 0.9)] x 150 = 6,600 gallons
        c. DS = 12 inches of tank bottom = 2,000 gallons
        d. Remaining SB available: 20,000 – 1,200 – 6,600 – 2,000 = 10,200 gallons. This
           provides for 35 gallons per camp occupant if the well pump or treatment
           process is removed temporarily from of service.
   8. Annual withdrawal will increase by:
        a. 80 additional summer occupants x [(50 gpd per occupant) ÷ 0.9)] x 100 days
           = 0.44 MG

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                97
       b. 0.55 – 0.44 = 0.11 MG remains available for group weekend retreats in the
          spring and fall. Assume 16 weekends annually = 35 days per year total.
       c. 110,000 gallons = X occupants x [(50 gpd per occupant) ÷ 0.9)] x 35 days; X =
          60 occupants, or about 1 to 2 occupants per cabin.
   9. The camp must replace the two booster pumps to deliver a PHD of at least 60
      gpm and maintain at least 30 psi throughout the distribution system.
   10. Our approval letter will specifically reference:
       a. Approval to serve 49 nonresidential and 2 residential structures, with a
          maximum occupancy of 300 persons
       b. The camp must operate within the approved design parameters: Not to
          exceed 300 occupants during the summer camping season; not to exceed 50
          occupants during the spring and fall; and manage supply requirements so it
          does not exceed 19,000 gpd during any time of year.


Example 3 – Concert and Catering Venue (expanding and increasing use)


Given:
A winery with a food service permit. The winery gets potable water from:
      A permit-exempt well with a rated capacity of 15 gpm at 100 ft total dynamic
       head (no water right and no source meter).
      A 5,000-gallon ground level storage tank.
      A variable frequency drive booster pump with a rated maximum capacity of 40
       gpm at 30 psi (no meter on booster pump).

The winery’s potable water system supplies:
      A single-family home.
      A combined retail sales building and tasting room with approved occupancy up
       to 40 people.
      Three production buildings with drinking fountains and wash sinks for 8
       employees.
      Picnic area (irrigated by nonpotable irrigation system) with restroom, covered
       seating, and food-prep sink facilities for up to 20 guests.
      A total of 6 nonresidential connections and 1 residential connection.

Existing water system demand information:
      No measured production or consumption data available.

      Estimating MDD: Including the single-family home, sales and tasting room based
       on maximum occupancy and two groups per day, employees, the picnic area
       restroom, and food prep results in an estimated MDD = 2,000 gpd. See Table 3.2.

The winery owner seeks to expand operations by developing an outdoor concert venue,
a full-service RV park, and expanding food preparation from only prepackaged items to
include hot and cold hors d’oeuvres.

Find:
    The number of RV sites the system can develop.
      The total occupancy the existing water system facilities accommodate at the new
       concert venue.

Solution:
   1. Remaining available maximum daily well withdrawal: 5,000 – 2,000 = 3,000
      gallons
   2. Using the fixture method, current PHD is estimated at 24 gpm
   3. Remaining booster pumping capacity = 40-24 = 16 gpm
   4. Storage analysis:
       a. OS is minimal. Use 400 gallons.
       b. DS is bottom 9 inches of reservoir = 600 gallons
       c. Remaining volume (4,000 gallons) allocated to ES. Maximum PHD supported
          by 4,000 gallons of ES. ES = 4,000 = (PHD – 15) x 150. PHD = 41 gpm.
       d. The owner decides no SB is necessary. The winery and concert venue will shut
          down if the well or booster pump fails.
   5. Demand of proposed new uses:
       a. Assume each RV site consumes 140 gpd.
       b. Assume each concert goer/food patron consumes 10 gpd.
   6. Remaining MDD = 3,000 = (RV x 140) + (Patron x 10). Possible solutions:
       a. 10 RVs and 150 patrons
       b. 15 RVs and 90 patrons
   7. PHD, assuming the owner selects 10 RV sites and up to 160 additional patrons for
      concerts.
       a. Using Figure 3.1, Equation 3.2, and Table 3.2, the PHD for the 10 RV sites is
          estimated at 15 gpm. Total PHD = 24 + 15 = 39 gpm

In this example, the water system demonstrates an excess capacity of 46 ERUs (496 –
450 = 46). We assume each future connection will use water consistent with an ERU. The
example assumes that the addition of new connections will not result in an increase in
the system’s current DSL (i.e., build-out rather than expansion of the distribution
system).

Following these two assumptions, we will translate and record the reported capacity as
an approved number of connections, consistent with WAC 246-290-222.
Using the above example, we would record capacity information on the water system’s
WFI as shown in the table below. The “DOH Calc” service connection total (bottom line)
includes single-family residential connections, multifamily residential units, recreational
service connections, and other types of connections. Total service connections do not
include the multifamily buildings themselves (the calculation includes only each dwelling
unit within such buildings).
The excess service capacity is reflected as the difference of the two numbers on the
“total service connection” line (156 + 46 = 202).

Our approval letter will include a statement such as:

We based the number of approved connections on an assumption that each future
connection will use water consistent with an average single-family residence your water
system supplies. Other types of new connections, such as apartments, businesses, or
parks may use more or less water than an average single-family residence.
You must permit additional new connections in a manner that recognizes all new
connections added and the water demands associated with each new connection. Your
process must ensure an accurate assessment of the remaining service capacity available,

If the Department of Ecology, a local planning agency, or other authority
responsible for determining water rights and water system adequacy determines
that you have use of less water than you represented, we may reduce the number
of approved connections commensurate with the actual amount of water and your
legal right to use it.

Chapter 5: Source of Supply

5.0       Introduction
Safe and reliable drinking water begins with the source of supply. Each public water
system has an obligation to secure drinking water from the highest quality source
feasible (WAC 246-290-130(1)) with sufficient capacity to meet customer demands (WAC
246-290-222(4) and WAC 246-290-420). Meeting this obligation is challenging given our
state’s limited water resources and the variety of potential contaminant sources in our
environment.

Water resources in Washington present a significant challenge to drinking water
systems seeking to develop new or expanding supplies. We urge design engineers to
consult with Ecology before investing significant time and resources into water supply
planning and design. Some water right limitations may preclude the development of a
new drinking water source. See Section 5.12 for guidance on water resource issues
related to new or expanding sources of supply.

Our natural and man-made environments pose significant risks of source water
contamination. Technology makes it possible to provide treatment to virtually any water
source and produce high quality drinking water. However, we believe complex
technology in ill-equipped hands creates an unacceptable level of public health risk.
When evaluating a new source of supply—especially one that needs treatment—design
engineers should consider the long-term technical, managerial, and financial capacity of
the water system to maintain and operate the facility to protect the health of their
customers.

This chapter offers guidance on evaluating different drinking water supplies and
presents topics that design engineers must consider when designing a new or modified
drinking water source.



5.1       Drinking Water Contaminants
All sources used as a public drinking water supply must meet water quality standards,
known as maximum contaminant levels (MCLs), set by EPA or the state (WAC 246-290-
310). If despite a thorough alternatives analysis the selected source water requires
treatment, then the source design must include the appropriate treatment needed to
reliably meet applicable water quality standards (WAC 246-290-130(5), 250, and Part 6).
See Chapter 10 for guidance on treatment plant design.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                               106
Primary drinking water contaminants can affect human health. Acute contaminants such
as viruses, E. coli, Giardia, Cryptosporidium (microbial), and nitrate and nitrite (chemical)
may cause illness with short-term exposure. Depending on the concentration, longer-
term exposure to organic and most inorganic contaminants, and radionuclides may
cause illness. Each regulated chemical and radiological contaminant has a drinking water
MCL. Microbial drinking water contaminants have an assigned drinking water treatment
technique requirement (disinfection or disinfection and filtration) instead of a MCL.

Regulations for secondary contaminants address aesthetic concerns, such as imparting
an unwanted taste, odor, or appearance to the water. They are not currently based on a
risk to human health. There is on-going research into human health effects associated
with certain secondary contaminants, such as manganese, which may someday lead to
establishing a new enforceable primary drinking water standard (Kondakis et al. 1989;
Ljung 2007).

5.1.1      Initial Sampling Requirements for New Sources
New drinking water sources must meet the applicable water quality standards for acute
and chronic contaminants prior to entry to the distribution system (WAC 246-290-
130(3)(g)). The minimum initial water quality testing varies by:
       Type of water system.
       Location within the state.
       Type of source (groundwater or surface water).
       Susceptibility of the source to contamination.

Engineers should collect initial water quality samples from new groundwater sources at
the end of the pump test (see Section 5.5.3), so that samples reflect the water quality in
the aquifer, and are not an artifact of well construction. You may need to sample other
water quality parameters during the pump test; for example, you may need to monitor
chloride levels during the pump test when a well is at risk for seawater intrusion (see
Section 5.5.4).

The minimum initial required source water quality testing described under WAC 246-
290-130(3)(g) includes the following.
       Bacteriological: All new source approval requires collection of a coliform sample.
        We may require additional bacteriological sampling for some groundwater
        sources and all surface water sources prior to source approval (WAC 246-290-
        300(a); 300(e); -630(16)(b); -640).

      Inorganic chemicals (IOCs) and physical parameters: All new source approval
       requires collection of a complete IOC sample.
      Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs): All new source approval requires collection
       of a complete VOC sample.
      Radionuclides: New source approval for community systems requires collection
       of a gross alpha and radium 228 sample. Depending on the initial results of that
       test, we may require additional radionuclide testing for radium 226 and uranium.
      Synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) and soil fumigants: New source approval
       for community and nontransient noncommunity systems may require collection
       of SOCs depending on the vulnerability of sources in certain parts of the state.
       These are usually in agricultural areas, where SOCs and soil fumigants are or were
       used. We will inform the water system if source approval requires SOC or soil
       fumigant sampling.
      When we published this manual, we considered adding a new contaminant
       standard called a state action level (SAL). If DOH adopts a SAL for a previously
       unregulated contaminant, we will require some or all new sources to sample for
       that contaminant at the time of source approval.

In addition, we strongly recommend the following water quality testing to develop a
more complete understanding of the source water quality and minimize the risk for
unpleasant surprises that can lead to expensive treatment steps or decrease consumer
confidence in the water supply.
      Alkalinity: Alkalinity, together with pH, enables calculation of dissolved inorganic
       carbon and provides valuable information about the corrosivity of a source.
      Ammonia: Ammonia combines with chlorine to form chloramines, which can
       make the water taste and smell—and affect the corrosivity of the treated water.
       Knowing the ammonia concentration of the new source will be useful if the water
       system treats the new source with chlorine.
      Bromide: High concentrations of bromide can lead to higher concentration of
       disinfection byproducts. Knowing the bromide concentration of the new source
       will be useful if the new source undergoes disinfection treatment, or if the new
       source of supply combines with a residual disinfectant currently maintained in the
       distribution system.
      pH: An accurate measurement is essential to understanding the corrosivity of a
       source. Collecting an accurate measurement of pH can be challenging because
       the pH of water can change rapidly when exposed to air. Accuracy requires that
       the pH sample be analyzed in the field with a properly calibrated amperiometric
       probe.

       Phosphate: The level of phosphate in the water supply may be of interest to
        municipal wastewater managers if the wastewater treatment discharge permit
        includes phosphate limits, and can affect the removal of other contaminants.
       Silica: High levels of silica can cause etching and staining of glassware and
        consumer complaints, and can affect the removal of other contaminants.
       Sulfide: Hydrogen sulfide can impart an objectionable odor at very low
        concentrations, which will affect consumer acceptance of the water.
       Total organic carbon: TOC combines with chemical disinfectants to increase
        disinfection byproducts. It can also decrease the effectiveness of treatment
        processes. Knowing the TOC concentration of the new source will be useful if the
        new source undergoes disinfection treatment, or if the new source of supply
        combines with a residual disinfectant currently maintained in the distribution
        system. Higher concentrations can color the water and decrease consumer
        acceptance.

5.1.2      Detecting Primary Drinking Water Contaminants
Initial sampling may reveal concentrations of one or more primary contaminants close
to, but not exceeding the contaminant MCL. Based on decades of observing water
quality trends in existing groundwater sources, we know that water quality can change
over time due to natural and man-made influences (declining aquifer, farming and
fertilizer practices, development). Two of our state’s most common primary
contaminants, nitrate and arsenic, vary seasonally or over multiple years for some
sources.

For that reason, when a primary contaminant is measured at 75 percent or more of the
MCL, the design engineer should describe in the new source project report (see Chapter
2) how the water system will handle exceeding a primary drinking water standard. The
project report should carefully consider the following:
       Space for treatment facilities.
       Disposal of treatment waste.
       Construction and operational costs.
       Operating requirements, including level of operator certification.



5.1.3      Exceeding the Primary Drinking Water MCL
If an initial sample from a new source indicates a primary chemical or radiological
contaminant above the MCL, we usually require resampling of the source until follow-up
results are definitive with respect to compliance with the MCL. Because of the potential
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  109
for seasonal changes, the required follow-up sampling may occur over a period of
months.

If test results confirm an MCL exceedance and the water system intends to develop the
source, the new source design submittal must include physical treatment, blending, or
other mitigation to ensure that the water entering the distribution system meets the
MCL except as noted below:
For contaminants that have MCLs based on chronic health risks, such as arsenic, we will
not require treatment for transient noncommunity water systems unless we determine
that the level of the contaminant poses an unacceptable risk to those the water system
serves.

See Appendix F for recommended raw water sampling of elements, compounds, or
physical characteristics that may affect treatment efficacy. The design engineer should
review the water quality characteristics of other drinking water sources in the vicinity
and develop a sampling plan to ensure that this information can be collected while the
appropriate equipment is on-site. See Chapter 10 for treatment guidance.

Coliform contamination detected at a groundwater source will trigger a source
treatment requirement. Microbial contaminants may be introduced while developing a
new groundwater source or modifying an existing one. To ensure representative source
sampling, design engineers should specify best practices in well development, well
completion, and in the handling and disinfection of drilling equipment. In addition,
water systems must ensure proper disinfection and testing is performed before the well
is put into service (WAC 246-290-451). New or modified sources should be purged,
disinfected, flushed, and sampled according to the latest AWWA C654 specification for
well disinfection.

5.1.4     Secondary Contaminants
We regulate secondary contaminants, such as iron and manganese, for aesthetic
reasons. We consider it a best practice for all new sources to meet secondary drinking
water standards. If an initial sample from a new source indicates a secondary
contaminant above the secondary MCL, we may require resampling of the source until
follow-up results are definitive with respect to compliance with the secondary MCL.
Because of the potential for seasonality, required follow-up sampling may occur over a
period of months.

If test results confirm a secondary MCL exceedance, the system intends to develop the
source, and the source supplies a new community or nontransient noncommunity water

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                110
system, the new source design submittal must include physical treatment, blending, or
other actions to ensure that the water entering the distribution system meets the MCL
(WAC 246-290-320(3)(d)). See Chapter 10 for treatment guidance.

Existing water systems may avoid treatment for exceeding a secondary MCL if they
document that consumers accept the water quality effects and reject the cost of
meeting the secondary standard. The design engineer must document construction and
operating costs and document consumer acceptance in order to avoid the requirement
for treatment. See Appendix F for additional guidance on secondary contaminants.

5.1.5      Groundwater Source Construction-Related Contaminants
Inadequate well development and flushing following construction may result in high
turbidity or detection of chemical residuals used in the well drilling process. Collecting
initial water quality samples at the end of the pump test will help ensure that sample
results reflect the water quality in the aquifer, and are not the result of well construction.

The design engineer should be aware of the risk certain construction materials and
practices pose to detection of organic chemicals. Low-level detection of organic
contaminants may be the result of residuals associated with well development and
construction. It is possible to introduce organic contaminants such as tetrahydrofuran
and 2-butanone (components in PVC glue) and toluene (component in lubricants)
during well construction. Such construction-related contamination, even in very small
concentrations, can result in a significant increase in organic chemical monitoring
requirements.

High turbidity in a new well or spring is often an indicator of one or more consequential
issues, including:
       Poor source development. Inadequate well cleaning following construction may
        result in high turbidity, and indicate the need to redevelop the source. Collect
        initial water quality samples at the end of the pump test, so that samples reflect
        the water quality in the aquifer, and are not a result of well construction.
       Iron or manganese. These common inorganic contaminants will cause turbidity
        and, in most cases, require treatment to remove them from newly developed
        sources if they exceed the secondary MCL.
       Groundwater under the direct influence of surface water. High turbidity
        measured in wells developed close to lakes, rivers, and springs may indicate
        direct surface water influence. Conduct additional testing of these types of
        sources to determine whether there is significant microbial risk from surface
        water contaminants. See Section 5.7 for additional requirements.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     111
5.1.6      Source Sample Taps
For successful operations, and the ability to demonstrate compliance with drinking
water quality standards, engineers must put sample taps in proper locations. Among the
attributes of a good sample tap:
       The sample tap outlet faces downward.
       It is in a clean, secure, accessible location.
       It is at least 12 inches above the floor or ground level. When taps are lower than
        that, water containing coliform bacteria can backsplash into the sample bottle.
       It is where the volume of water flushing from the tap for 5 minutes can easily
        drain away.
       It is smooth-nosed, without internal or external threads (Ten State Standards
        2012).

For more information on good sample tap design and location, see DOH 331-436.

All drinking water sources must have sample taps to meet the water quality monitoring
requirements of WAC 246-290-300. Sample taps must be:
       At the source, prior to any treatment. Install the sample tap as close to the source
        as practical.
     After treatment, before entering the distribution system. If there are multiple
      treatment processes, install sample taps after each unit process. You should
      install sample taps to allow for adequate mixing between any chemical addition
      and the sampling location.
See sampling requirements for reservoirs and distribution systems in chapters 6 and 7
and WAC 246-290-300.



5.2        Source Protection
Location is a key factor in securing the highest quality source feasible. In analyzing a
source location, design engineers should consider the measures necessary to establish
and maintain sanitary or watershed control, physical protection, and barriers to
contamination (e.g., surface intake depth, completed well and annular seal depth).
Careful consideration of alternatives will reduce, and often eliminate current and future
treatment requirements. See DOH 331-106.

The design engineer must describe and document the adequacy of source water
protection in each source approval submittal. These requirements protect against

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   112
existing or potential sources of contamination (WAC 246-290-135(2)). Required
documentation includes:
      Sanitary control area. The submittal must include dimension, a description of
       existing land use and natural features, and documentation of legal control
       around each proposed source. The design engineer must provide the rationale
       and a description of factors considered in establishing the sanitary control area.
       Such factors should include but not be limited to the unique source design,
       hydrogeologic setting, and land use.
      Wellhead Protection Program (WHPP). Water systems must determine the
       location of all potential contaminant sources or activities, and then notify those
       property owners of the potential to affect the drinking water source (WAC 246-
       290-135(3).
      Susceptibility assessment. A completed source susceptibility assessment as part
       of a wellhead protection program (WAC 246-290-135(3)).
      Covenants. Water systems must exercise legal control over the SCA, through
       either fee-simple ownership or other legal means such as restrictive covenants.
       The source approval packet must include signed and recorded copies bearing
       the auditor’s file number. (WAC 246-290-135(2(e) and (f).
      Watershed control program. Surface water sources and confirmed GWI sources
       must develop and implement a watershed control program (WAC 246-290-
       135(4)).

We created several guidance publications on source water protection, including:
      Covenants for Public Water Supply Protection (DOH 331-048).
      Source WaterProtection Requirements (DOH 331-106).
      Sanitary Control Area Protection (DOH 331-453).

For a more complete list of groundwater submittal requirements, see Appendix A.3.2.
For watershed protection requirements for new surface water supplies, see Chapter 11.



5.3       Distribution Water Quality Effects from New or Modified
          Sources
Water systems must include in the project report how proposed projects could
potentially affect water quality in the distribution system (WAC 246-290-110(4)(d)).
Blending a new source with existing sources, constructing an intertie, installing
treatment, or replacing an existing source with a new one can create water quality

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  113
problems in the distribution system. These distribution system water quality effects may
include:
      Accumulated inorganic contaminants released from pipe walls.
      Increased metal corrosion.
      Increased disinfection byproduct formation.
      Effects on the ability to maintain a disinfection residual (Taylor et al. 2005; Kippin
       et al. 2001).

For example, iron or manganese can precipitate after introducing water from a new or
modified source with higher dissolved oxygen levels. An increase in hardness and silica
levels can lead to water quality issues in the distribution system, such as staining and
etching. Changes in flow direction and water age can release scales and accumulated
sediments from pipes in the distribution system (Friedman et al. 2010; Hill et al. 2010).
These mobilized scales and sediments can contain metals such as arsenic, chromium,
and lead (Peng et al. 2012). Design engineers should identify how the water system will
address such issues. Common approaches include:
      Bench scale studies.
      Pipe loop studies with new or existing distribution system materials.
      Enhanced monitoring and flushing programs.

Decreasing water’s oxidation-reduction potential increases instability of pipe scales,
making them more prone to release into the distribution system. Factors that contribute
to this problem include:
      Decreased disinfectant residual.
      Decreased dissolved oxygen.
      Decreased alkalinity.
      Decreased pH.

Design engineers must evaluate how a change in treatment or introduction of a new
permanent or seasonal source may affect compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (40
CFR 141.81(b)(3)(iii); 141.86(d)(4); and 141.90(a)(3)). This evaluation is especially
important for water systems assigned optimum water quality parameters under the Lead
and Copper Rule and proposing to develop a new source. The design engineer should
review the water quality characteristics of other drinking water sources near the
proposed source, and develop a sampling plan to ensure that new source water quality
information can be obtained while the appropriate equipment is on-site as the well is



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    114
being developed. Examples of new source characteristics that could increase corrosivity,
lead, and copper solubility, and cause other distribution system issues include:
      Change in pH, alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon.
      Increase in the chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio from sources with elevated
       concentrations of chloride ions.

We may require water systems that introduce a new source of supply to restart lead and
copper distribution system monitoring (40 CFR 141.86(d)(4)(vii)). See Section 10.1.3 for
information on addressing changes in treatment to an existing source.

Lastly, introducing a new source can affect the way that water flows in a distribution
system. Changes in the direction of flow and velocities can mobilize particles in the
distribution system leading to customer complaints, and changes in disinfectant
demand. As a result, the design engineer and water system should assess the potential
for changes in distribution system hydraulics and take steps to mitigate



5.4       Source Water Quantity and Reliability
The source or sources for a water system must be able to meet the water system’s
maximum day demand (MDD) (WAC 246-290-222(4)). For reliability purposes, supply
sources should be able to replenish depleted fire suppression storage within 72 hours
(or sooner if required by the local fire authority) while concurrently supplying the MDD
of the water system. For wells and other pumped sources, we recommend establishing
source water quantity based on pumping no more than 20 hours per day. See Sections
3.10 and 4.4.2 for additional guidance.

After deciding the new source’s capacity, design engineers should check that the
reservoir overflow capacity is sufficient to discharge the combined sources of supply
available to the reservoir without damage to property or surcharging the reservoir
structure. These source of supply to a reservoir include discharges from all wells,
interties, pressure reducing valves, and booster pump stations that serve the pressure
zone in which the reservoir is located.

5.5       Wells
Most of the source development projects in our state are drilled wells and well fields
(see the Well Field Designation Guideline in Appendix B.1). See Chapter 2 and Appendix
A for guidance on preparing a project report and the construction documents for a new


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                115
well. See Appendix E for well pumping test standards. See Policy M.01 for requirements
on pitless units and well caps.

The design engineer should use a pump test or hydrogeologic analysis to determine
how reliable groundwater or aquifers will be over time. We expect pumping tests to run
at a flow-rate greater than or equal to the maximum design pumping rate (WAC 246-
290-130(3)(c)(iii)).

Design engineers may reference well source development data from nearby sources as
supplemental evidence that water quantity is adequate to meet design criteria. If the
aquifer setting is well characterized and quantified, and hydrogeologic information is
adequate to establish a sustainable pumping rate, then the engineer may submit a
hydrogeologic report to justify the proposed pumping rate. A licensed hydrogeologist
should prepare the report. It should include a detailed analysis of the well, aquifer, and
local conditions including effects on nearby sources of supply.

5.5.1      Steps to Take Before Drilling a Well
Taking these steps before drilling the well will help you develop the highest quality
source feasible and facilitate a quick and efficient design review process.

Before drilling a well, you must:
       Obtain a notice of intent to construct a well from the Department of Ecology
        (WAC 173-160-151).
       Ensure that a licensed well driller will drill the well and that well construction is
        done according to chapter 173-160 WAC.
       Obtain a well site inspection by state or local health jurisdiction staff (WAC 173-
        160-171(3)(c)).

Before drilling a well, you should:
       Prepare and submit for DOH review and endorsement the well pumping test
        plan. While developing the pump-testing plan, refer to Appendix E.
       Evaluate the possibility of obtaining alternate sources of supply through interties
        with neighboring water systems or already developed wells.
       Conduct a preliminary hydrogeologic assessment, which includes preparing a
        Wellhead Protection Potential Contaminant Source Inventory.
       Contact DOH to learn the parameters used to delineate groundwater under the
        direct influence of surface water (GWI). You must have a determination of the
        GWI status prior to source approval (WAC 246-290-130(3)(d)). If a well meets our

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                          116
       criteria for a potential GWI (for example, less than 50 feet deep and within 200
       feet of a surface water body), you will need data to determine whether the source
       connects hydraulically to surface water, and to what extent. See Section 5.7 for
       additional information used to evaluate potential GWI sources.
      Obtain a legal right through an ownership option or recorded covenant to
       prevent potential sources of contamination from locating within the standard
       sanitary control area (normally a 100-foot radius around the well).

Before drilling, you should make sure that the water system can control land use within
the sanitary control area (SCA) (100-foot radius around the well) through fee-simple
ownership, a protective covenant, or other mechanism—and have DOH or the local
health jurisdiction conduct a well site inspection. During the well site inspection, you
should identify any limits on controlling the entire SCA and give the state or local health
representative a map of the SCA. With these items, you should talk to the representative
about evaluating the site conditions. Be sure to allow time to identify possible mitigation
measures, such as a deeper surface seal during well construction.

5.5.2       Documenting Wellhead Protection
The SCA must have a radius of 100 feet, unless justification demonstrates that a smaller
area can provide an equivalent level of source water protection (WAC 246-290-135). The
justification should address geological and hydrological data, well construction details,
mitigation measures, and other relevant factors necessary to ensure adequate
protection of source water quality. Major factors influencing a decision to allow a
smaller than standard SCA include depth of the screened interval and “confinedness” of
the water-bearing zone. We may require a larger SCA, additional mitigation measures,
or both if land use, or geological or hydrological data support such a decision.

Before we can approve the proposed source, the water system must be able to provide
the dimensions, location, and legal documentation of the SCA (WAC 246-290-135(2)).
We require the water system to “control” the SCA to prevent any potential source of
contamination from being constructed, stored, disposed of, or applied within the
sanitary control area. To ensure the water system can control the SCA, we require it to
own the SCA outright, or to have the right to exercise complete sanitary control of the
land through other legal provisions restricting the use of the land, such as a duly
recorded declaration of covenant.

To evaluate the appropriateness of a proposed drilling location, you should conduct a
preliminary susceptibility assessment, complete a preliminary WHPA delineation and
initial contaminant inventory, and map the findings.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 117
A preliminary susceptibility assessment will give design engineers and DOH information
to evaluate the suitability of the proposed well site before drilling a well and before
expending significant resources. It may be helpful to ask DOH for guidance on
conducting a preliminary susceptibility assessment before selecting a potential well site.
The assessment should help you understand the influence variables, such as length of
well screen or open hole, have on WHPA delineation. The assessment can identify the
benefit of developing the well in a confined versus unconfined aquifer.

The minimum standard for delineating the wellhead protection area is the “Calculated
Fixed Radius” method. We encourage you to use more sophisticated and accurate
methods of delineation, such as analytical or numerical modeling to ensure a higher
level of source protection. See our Wellhead Protection Program Guidance Document
(DOH 331-018) for further explanation of these methods. The WHPA delineation should
identify the 6-month, and the 1-, 5- and 10-year time of travel boundaries. Conduct a
survey for potential sources of groundwater and source water contaminant in the WHPA
area. More information is on our Source Water Protection webpage.

5.5.3     Groundwater Pumping Tests
Design engineers can use pump tests to assess how reliably groundwater can meet the
demands of a projected population over time. See Appendix E for detailed guidance on
pumping tests. The design engineer must ensure the pumping test provides sufficient
data to achieve its objectives (WAC 246-290-130(3).

The objective of the pumping test is to acquire data identifying the source’s safe yield
and maximum design pumping rate, to establish well pump-depth setting, and to size
and select the well pump. Factors that could influence reliability include low-flow
conditions, fracture-flow conditions, aquifer of limited areal extent, seawater intrusion,
effects of concurrently pumping multiple wells, and seasonal variability.

The timing of a pump test may be more or less important to determining safe yield,
depending on the aquifer setting. Seasonal and annual climate conditions have less
influence on groundwater than surface water, except in sensitive settings such as
shallow alluvium aquifers and in some areas where localized recharge “lenses” occur.
The design engineer should determine whether a proposed groundwater source is in a
sensitive setting and design the pump test accordingly.

After the pumping test, design engineers must compile the following data into a project
report, and submit it to us as part of the source approval documentation (WAC 246-
290-130(3)(c)):

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   118
      All items for source approval, if applicable.
      A time-drawdown graph (on standard and semi-log paper).
      An analysis and discussion of applicable hydraulic parameters (such as
       transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, storativity), as appropriate, to support the
       objectives of the pumping test.
      A map and description (1/4, 1/4, section, township, range) accurately indicating
       the well location and the land surface elevation to the nearest foot. Locate
       observation wells with distances to the nearest foot.
      A well report.

The end of the aquifer pump test is a good time to collect the water quality samples
required for source approval.

5.5.4       Seawater Intrusion
Wells or well fields developed close to seawater may be vulnerable to seawater
intrusion. Seawater intrusion caused by over-pumping the basal (freshwater) lens
degrades groundwater quality by drawing chloride (from seawater) into the remaining
fresh groundwater. Department of Ecology rules prohibit degradation of the state’s
groundwater. We recommend that water systems have a hydrogeologist or qualified
engineer assess the potential for seawater intrusion and oversee well testing. See
Appendix E for guidance on developing sources vulnerable to seawater intrusion. Wells
at risk for intrusion include wells located:
      Within ½ mile of the shoreline and pump water from a depth below sea level.
      Within ½ mile of a groundwater source with chloride concentrations over 100
       mg/L.

The design engineer should avoid supply sources at risk for seawater intrusion. Ecology
may condition water right permits to provide for reduced pumping rates or may even
require a water system to abandon sources if seawater intrusion threatens senior water
right permits. In addition, several counties have policies or ordinances affecting water
systems in areas vulnerable to seawater intrusion. We recommend that the design
engineer contact Ecology and the local health jurisdiction for current policies or rules on
developing wells where seawater intrusion may be a concern.



5.6       Spring Sources
A design engineer submitting a spring source for approval must identify (WAC 246-290-
130(3) and -135):
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    119
       The safe yield of the spring.
       Water quality meets all applicable drinking water standards.
       Measures to protect the sanitary control area and water quality of the spring
        supply from contamination at all times.

5.6.1      Spring Source Safe Yield
It may be difficult to determine the safe yield of flow from a spring. Pumping test
procedures usually do not apply to springs because the recharge is unidirectional and
associated only with the flow delivered at the ground-surface interface. Therefore, to
measure spring-flow quantity, design engineers should use actual flow records (with
weirs or other mechanisms capable of measuring surface flows) during high- and low-
flow conditions over a variety of seasonal conditions. At minimum, we recommend
measuring spring flows at least monthly for at least 12 months (Meuli & Wehrle, 2001).

Because drought conditions often influence spring flows, it is appropriate to estimate
the flows that would prevail during drought. You should collect precipitation data along
with measured spring flows. Compare spring-flow data with precipitation data from
previous years to estimate the safe yield and minimum flows from the spring. Appendix
C includes climatological organizations (NOAA, Office of State Climatologist, Western
Regional Climate Center) with data that may help you determine how current-year
precipitation compares with historic weather patterns.

In evaluating the safe yield of a spring source, we recommend that the design engineer
use the 50-year low-rainfall year. Spring flows are inherently uncertain and subject to
significant changes in precipitation patterns. To the extent possible, correlate spring
discharge (or daily capacity if pumped) to the 50-year drought and establish the design
yield on that basis. If accurate rainfall and spring discharge data are not available, apply
a safety factor to the “usual” or “average” known capacity of the spring to estimate yield
during very dry periods.

5.6.2      Spring Source Water Quality
Because springs are potential GWI sources (see Section 5.7), the design engineer must
establish whether the spring source is GWI (WAC 246-290-130(3) and -640). The content
of the project report for a spring must address groundwater or surface water source-
approval, depending on the outcome of the GWI determination.

Spring sources are at significant risk of surface contamination. Springs that have a
greater degree of seasonal fluctuation in flow have a higher the risk of contamination
(Meuli & Wehrle, 2001). Engineers must design the spring catchment and conveyance
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   120
systems to minimize the risk of direct surface water infiltration; otherwise, we will
consider the spring source a surface water supply subject to all applicable sections of
WAC 246-290 Part 6.

In many cases, we will require springs not otherwise subject to the requirements of the
surface water treatment rule to provide CT6 disinfection treatment (4-log virus
inactivation) before the first connection (WAC 246-290-451(4)) and WAC 246-290-
640(4)). We also may require sanitary protection of the source beyond the minimum 200
feet required in WAC 246-290-135.

In general, unique geological conditions will dictate the steps design engineers will
follow when developing a spring source. Design engineers should tailor their design and
construction activities to protect the spring, and the areas above the spring, from
surface contamination.
      Construction materials must not create an opportunity for water quality
       problems (WAC 246-290-220).
      The design should provide surface water runoff diversions.
      Designs for spring collectors and catchment facilities must prevent infiltration of
       contamination (WAC 246-290-130(3)).
      Designs must provide protection from vandalism (fencing, lockable hatches, and
       other security measures) (WAC 246-290-130(3)).
      Requirements for screening vents or other openings appropriate to the spring are
       similar to those for distribution reservoirs (see WAC 246-290-235).

The design engineer can get guidance and specific details on spring development,
sanitary protection, and water quality considerations from the references listed at the
end of this chapter (AWWA 1999; USEPA 1991; Meuli & Wehrle, 2001).



5.7       Groundwater under the Direct Influence of Surface Water
Groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWI) is any water beneath the
surface of the ground with one of the following:
   1. Significant occurrence of insects or other macro organisms, algae or large
      diameter pathogens such as Giardia lamblia.
   2. Significant and relatively rapid shifts in water characteristics such as turbidity,
      temperature, conductivity, or pH, which closely correlate to climatological or

Water systems with sources confirmed to be GWI must comply with the filtration and
disinfection requirements for surface water sources (WAC 246-290, Part 6).

Water systems must evaluate all potential GWI sources to determine whether additional
treatment is necessary (WAC 246-290-640). Potential GWI sources include (WAC 246-
290-010):
      Wells with a first open interval less than 50 feet below the ground surface and are
       located within 200 feet of surface water.
      Springs.
      Infiltration galleries.
      Ranney wells.

While reviewing source approval information, we may determine that a source other
than those listed above is potentially GWI, and subject to the GWI evaluation process.
An example of such a source is a well located on a bluff above a nearby stream. The
depth to the first open interval may be greater than 50 feet as measured from the top of
the casing, but be less than 50 feet as measured from the stream’s high water elevation.
We may add additional criteria to evaluate potential GWI sources based on recent
research (Stokdyk et al. 2019)

We will not approve a new potential GWI source before a proper evaluation. Figure 5-1
at the end of this chapter outlines the evaluation process for potential GWI sources. The
project report must document the details of the GWI evaluation, including how you will
simulate anticipated source withdrawal conditions for new (not yet in service) potential
GWI sources (WAC 246-290-130(3) and -640). For planning purposes, design engineers
should schedule at least 18 months to complete the GWI evaluation process.

We do not require potential GWI sources determined not to be GWI to meet the
treatment requirements for surface water sources. However, potential GWI sources
determined to be in hydraulic connection with surface water must provide minimum
CT6 disinfection before entering the distribution system (WAC 246-290-451(4), WAC
246-290-640(4), and Policy F.12)). For additional guidance on evaluating potential GWI
sources, see the references at the end of this chapter (WSDOH 2003a; WSDOH 2003b).



5.8       New Surface Water Supplies
Because it may be difficult to secure necessary permits from natural resource agencies
and other involved parties, it can take many years to develop a new surface water

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                122
supply. For example, new surface water sources trigger a detailed environmental review
requirement under the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA).

In addition to treatment, the design engineer should consider the unique features of
surface sources when evaluating them for the drinking water supply. Often, several
competing beneficial uses (agriculture, fisheries, and other resource demands) affect the
long-term reliability of surface sources. Water rights may be very difficult to secure. A
secured water right may be so restricted during some periods, that little or no portion of
the source can be used to supply drinking water (see Interruptible Water Rights, Section
5.12.2). The reliability of a surface source is more uncertain than groundwater because it
relies so heavily on precipitation levels (rain and snow), and is vulnerable to reduction in
withdrawal due to low stream flow.

Surface water sources also are more vulnerable to contamination than protected
groundwater supplies. Design engineers should thoroughly assess the vulnerability of
the source to natural disasters (floods, wildfires, and landslides) and human activities
(waste disposal, spills, and runoff from agricultural activities). New surface sources must
conduct detailed source water monitoring to assess the degree of microbial risk. High-
risk sources require a higher level surface water treatment (WAC 246-290-630(16)(b); 40
CFR 141.702(f)).

Surface water supplies normally require conventional, direct, slow sand, diatomaceous
earth filtration, or an approved alternative treatment technology and must comply with
the Surface Water Treatment Rule and WAC 246-290, Part 6. See detailed design criteria
in WAC 246-290, Chapter 10 of this manual, and the Recommended Standards for Water
Works (Ten State Standards 2012). Introducing a new surface water supply may cause
water quality changes in the distribution system. Engineers must evaluate the potential
for such changes in a project report (See Section 5.3).

Design engineers planning to submit new or modified surface water treatment designs
must first perform a pilot study to evaluate alternatives (WAC 246-290-250; WAC 246-
290-676(3)). Section 10.3 provides detailed guidance on treatment predesign and pilot
studies. In some cases, design engineers may need DOH and natural resource agencies
to approve the intake facilities before initiating the pilot study.

Design engineers can help to ensure an efficient and orderly review of their surface
water treatment proposals by meeting with our regional office staff to establish specific
design requirements.

Water systems should develop surface sources with full knowledge that some reductions
in service capacity may result over time as low rainfall years, low snowpack years, or
drought conditions occur. Water systems will need to compare historic hydrological
data against customer service expectations to gauge the adequacy of the source.

5.8.1     Surface Water Safe Yield
Yield from a surface water source depends on climatic influences from year to year.
Design engineers can use flow measurements and hydrologic assessments with an
appropriate factor of safety to measure the “safe yield” of a surface water source.
However, when defining expectations for long-term service, engineers should base the
reliability of flow from these sources on years with the lowest precipitation levels.

In general, the safe yield of a surface water reservoir is the reliable withdrawal rate a
watershed provides through the critical drought period. We recommend using a 98
percent level of reliability, equivalent to a 50-year drought, for surface supplies. We used
various references to develop this recommendation (Prasifka 1988; HDR 2001; City of
Seattle, 2013). Engineers should address instream flow reservations and other natural
resource effects when assessing the safe yield of the water resource during drought.

Appendix C includes climatological organizations with data that may help engineers
determine how current-year precipitation compares with historic weather patterns.
Appendix C also includes a link to Department of Ecology’s stream flow database.

5.9       Purchased Water and Emergency Interties
Interconnections (interties) between water systems are an alternative to developing new
supply sources. Interties can help provide a level of reliability difficult to secure
otherwise.

A design engineer considering an intertie to augment supply sources must satisfy the
requirements of WAC 246-290-100 and -132. These requirements exist to ensure the
wholesaling and consecutive systems have the physical and legal capacity to sell and
purchase the expected volume and flow of water. Planning and engineering documents
submitted to support constructing a new or expanding consecutive system must include
the intertie agreement. There are different standards for emergency interties and
purchased water (nonemergency interties).

Designs should include provisions for verifying water meter accuracy, and collecting
water quality samples by staff from both water systems at the intertie. You should
consider provisions for continuous online instrumentation. See Section 10.4.2.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  124
5.9.1      Reliability of Purchased Water (Nonemergency Interties)
New and existing public water systems may purchase their water supply in whole or in
part from another water system. The design engineer must assess the reliability of a
purchased water agreement, and demonstrate how the intertie improves overall system
reliability (WAC 246-290-132 (3)(a)(v)). Water systems must satisfy the requirement to
provide an adequate quantity and quality of water in a reliable manner (WAC 246-290-
420 (1)).
A design engineer submitting a new or renewed wholesale water agreement that raises
reliability concerns (see list below) must submit a viable plan identifying an alternative
water supply. That supply must satisfy the requirement to provide an adequate quantity
and quality of water in a reliable manner (WAC 246-290-420 (1)) if an intertie agreement
is terminated. When submitting the agreement, the design engineer must also submit
evidence that the wholesaler’s service capacity assessment reflects its full allocation of
water, storage, and/or booster-pumping capacity to the consecutive system (WAC 246-
290-222).
Terminating the water supply according to provisions written into a purchased
wholesale water agreement is not an abnormal operating condition. To improve
reliability, we believe wholesale water agreements should not be subject to termination
except for customary reasons (e.g. failure to pay). The criteria below reflect this principle.

Recommended attributes of a wholesale water agreement:
       How and when charges are calculated and billed.
       When payment is due, and what happens if payment is past-due.
       Description of whether or how much standby storage and/or fire suppression
        storage is available to the consecutive system.
       Adherence to cross connection control requirements at the point of service.
       How the water rate(s) is adjusted over time.
       Absolute and seasonal limits on instantaneous flow and annual volume.
       Limits on type and place of use.
       Impact of a declared emergency or natural disasters.

Attributes of a wholesale water agreement that raises reliability concerns:
       Date-based termination clause (e.g., “this agreement is valid for 10 years”).
       Needs-based termination clause (e.g., “this agreement may be terminated at any
        time due to unforeseen circumstances that result in a limited water supply that
        will be allocated to in-city customers”).
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    125
       Short-term unilateral termination clause (e.g., “this agreement may be terminated
        after 30 days’ notice by either party”).

A consecutive system purchasing water through an intertie may need to treat the
purchased water to maintain compliance with drinking water standards (e.g.,
maintaining a free chlorine residual in the consecutive system’s distribution system) or
to avoid distribution system water quality effects such as those described in Section 5.3.
A consecutive system also may incur additional sampling requirements, such as for
disinfection byproducts and Ground Water Rule triggered sampling.

We may approve planning and engineering documents based on the following types of
purchased water agreements. These agreements fall into a spectrum of risk to
interruption, from practically no risk of interruption to near certain risk of termination.

   Regional Water Supply Agreement (very reliable). A consortium of water systems
    receives its water supply from commonly held and proportionally owned source and
    transmission infrastructure. Member systems operate and maintain this shared
    infrastructure. In these cases, there is little to no increased risk of interruption in
    supply to any individual member.

   Bought-In Wholesale Capacity Agreement (very reliable). A single utility
    wholesaler permits one or more other water systems to buy-in to the wholesaler’s
    supply and transmission infrastructure, similar to a retail water customer paying a
    system development charge to a water system for the privilege of receiving water
    service. This investment ensures the participating water systems receive a
    proportional or fixed share of the supply, but does not give them a say in the
    operation or maintenance of those supplies. In these cases, there is little to no
    increased risk of interruption in supply to any of the participating water systems.

   Purchased Wholesale Water Supply Agreement (Poor reliability). A single utility
    wholesaler agrees to sell water to one or more consecutive water systems. There is
    no ownership stake held by any of the consecutive systems. The wholesale
    agreement may not be renewable and/or may be terminated at the option of the
    wholesaler (such contracts are common). As a result, there is a greater risk of supply
    interruption.

   Reserve Infrastructure Agreement (Variable reliability). A wholesaler makes a
    portion of its capacity (source water, stored water) available to a consecutive system
    for use as a reserve source, thus saving the consecutive system from the full cost of
    investing in its own standby infrastructure. The wholesaler should account for the
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    126
   transfer of standby capacity in its own planning. The intertie valve should be
   automatic. The risk of interruption in standby reserve capacity (e.g., providing fire
   suppression flow or storage, or providing standby storage) depends on the content
   of each agreement.

5.9.2      Emergency Interties
An emergency intertie can often be a cost-effective way to reduce the risk of supply
interruption. Because of the difference in design approval requirements, it is important
to establish the difference between an emergency intertie and a nonemergency intertie.

If the intertie satisfies all of the following criteria, it is an emergency intertie:
       The consecutive system’s own source(s) of supply, booster pumps, and reservoirs
        can meet the maximum daily demand (MDD) and peak hourly demand (PHD)
        while maintaining the design standards of WAC 246-290-230 without
        supplemental supply delivered through the intertie.
       The challenges the two parties intended to address with the emergency intertie,
        and documented in the intertie agreement, are limited to one or more of the
        following:
        o Temporary failure of one or more nonemergency source where the remaining
          sources of supply cannot maintain 20 pounds per square inch (psi) during
          PHD throughout the consecutive system’s distribution system.
        o Fire where the consecutive system’s own system cannot meet the fire
          suppression requirement (flow rate and duration) combined with MDD while
          maintaining 20 psi throughout the distribution system.
        o Water quality emergency.

The original circumstances and associated design intent of the intertie may change with
time. In the transition from an “emergency use intertie” to a “nonemergency intertie,”
the design engineer should make sure that the water system meets all the applicable
requirements of WAC 246-290-132.

RCW 90.03.383 addresses intertie approvals intended to resolve emergent public health
concerns, short-term emergencies, and drought emergencies. RCW 90.03.383 (2) states
an “emergency-use intertie” does not trigger a requirement to change the upstream
water system’s water right, and does not require a place-of-use change. As stated in
Section 4.4.2, designers cannot include emergency sources, including emergency
interties, in the total source capacity calculations (WAC 246-290-222(3)).

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  127
5.10      Unconventional Sources
Many watersheds are limited in their capacity to supply water for growth and
development while maintaining sufficient stream flow. Consequently, design engineers
may look to unconventional sources such as rainwater collection and seawater
desalination to develop into drinking water supplies. Before approving an
unconventional source, the design engineer must complete a thorough alternatives
analysis to determine the highest quality source feasible for the water system (WAC
246-290-130).

5.10.1    Rainwater Collection
For DOH, rainwater is surface water, subject to all the requirements of the Surface Water
Treatment Rule. Collected rainwater often has significant fecal contamination and other
contaminants (Ahmed et al. 2012; Birks et al. 2004; Lye 2002; Osterholt et al. 2007;
Hoque et al. 2003). Any public drinking water system that uses collected rainwater must
provide treatment, including filtration and disinfection in compliance with the Surface
Water Treatment Rule. Surface water treatment design requirements, ongoing
operations and maintenance requirements, and daily monitoring and monthly reporting
requirements are in WAC 246-290 Part 6. Design submittal requirements for rainfall
catchment are significant. See Appendix F.7.

Rainwater is slightly acidic and low in dissolved minerals. These qualities make it
corrosive to metals and other materials. The rooftop collection material and coating
systems must meet ANSI/NSF Standard 61 or NSF Standard Protocol P151 to reduce the
risk of chemical contaminants (WAC 246-290-220). In addition, the water system may
have to install corrosion control treatment to overcome rainwater’s natural corrosivity.

Rainwater collection systems intended for nonpotable uses are a cross-connection
control hazard, especially if the system delivers rainwater through dedicated internal
plumbing. Therefore, any water system providing service to a building with a rainwater
collection system must protect the water distribution system from contamination by
cross connections (WAC 246-290-490).

Reliance on rainwater is problematic due to drought and extended dry periods that
occur even in the wettest parts of this state. Washington has less rainfall during the
summer, which is the period of greatest water demand for most water systems. The
design engineer for a rainfall collection system must evaluate rainfall, usage patterns,
and water storage thoroughly to ensure a reliable supply (WAC 246-290-130(3)). See
Appendix F.8 for guidance on assessing adequacy of rainfall collection as a drinking
water supply.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     128
As with any surface water supply, the safe yield of a rainfall catchment system is the
sustainable rate of water withdrawal from the cistern through the critical drought
period. We recommend using a 98 percent level of reliability, equivalent to a 50-year
drought, for rainfall catchment systems. Rainfall varies in Washington on an annual,
seasonal, and regional basis. This supply variability makes reliance on rainwater
collection as the sole source of potable water supply impractical for nearly all public
water systems.

5.10.2    Trucked and Hauled Water
We will not approve trucked or hauled water as a permanent drinking water supply to
new or existing public water systems. We do not recognize trucked water as a reliable
permanent source of supply. Trucked water in unpressurized conditions poses an
increased health risk. We acknowledge the need to use trucked or hauled water as a
temporary, last-resort measure to meet basic public health requirements in response to
an emergency, but only for the period a public water system lacks access to an adequate
and safe drinking water supply. See DOH 331-063.

5.10.3    Desalination
Desalinating seawater or brackish groundwater is technically feasible and may be the
only option available in some situations. Design engineers should consult with us before
initiating a desalination project, and should contact other county, state, and federal
agencies early in the design process to identify potential permitting issues. See Chapter
10 and Appendix F.6 for design guidance associated with brackish water and seawater
desalination.

5.10.4       Aquifer Storage and Recovery
Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) increases existing groundwater supplies by
artificially recharging and storing groundwater. ASR is a water resource strategy
designed to take water when it is available and store it in an aquifer deemed
appropriate for later withdrawal and beneficial use. Several water systems in Washington
implement ASR, including the Sammamish Plateau Water and Sewer District and the
cities of Walla Walla, Yakima, and Kennewick.

We do not have primary responsibility to oversee or approve ASR projects. The
Department of Ecology implements the ASR permitting process (Chapter 90.03 RCW)
with standards for review established in Chapter 173-157 WAC. The permitting process
is challenging, and requires applicants to provide documentation, including
demonstration through actual and/or modeled hydrogeologic conditions:


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    129
        The recoverable percentage of water pumped into the aquifer. For the
         applicant, the economic feasibility of the project usually depends on the
         adequate recoverable volume of water. Successful ASR applicants own the right
         to use the recoverable portion of the water they store underground.
        ASR must not degrade groundwater quality. There could be negative effects
         associated with pumping treated surface water or reclaimed water into an
         aquifer; and ASR projects must comply with state water quality standards
         (Chapter 173-200 WAC).

In addition to meeting Ecology’s permitting requirements, ASR projects developed to
augment an aquifer’s capacity to supply drinking water, must eventually satisfy public
drinking water source requirements. Design engineers pursuing a drinking water-related
ASR project should concurrently satisfy all applicable sections of Chapter 246-290 WAC.



5.11        General Source Design Considerations
We consider several other design elements associated with new or existing drinking
water sources when reviewing design documents and subsequent reports.

5.11.1      Power Supply Reliability
To avoid the attendant risk of backflow contamination when some or all of the
distribution system depressurizes, design engineers must consider the reliability of the
power supply grid if the proposed system has no provision to maintain pressure during
a power outage (WAC 246-290-001, -200).

The supply source(s) for a water system must be able to meet the water system’s MDD
(WAC 246-290-221). See our water supply reliability recommendations in Sections 3.10,
5.4, and 5.8. We consider a reliable power supply as defined below:
        Frequency: On average, three or fewer power outages occur per year based on
         data for the three previous years, and no more than six outages occur in a single
         year. Power loss for 30 minutes or more qualifies as an outage.
        Duration: On average, outages last less than four hours based on data for the
         three previous years, and no more than one outage exceeded eight hours during
         the same timeframe.

If a power supply to a source, pump station, or treatment plant cannot meet the
minimum standards described above, then we consider the power supply unreliable and
the water system must take further reliability measures (WAC 246-290-420(4)). Section

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 130
3.2 of the Recommended Standards for Water Works contains additional design
guidelines on this issue.

If the water system power supply is unreliable, the design engineer should consider one
or more of the following measures:
      Make in-place auxiliary power available (auto transfer capable)
      If there are two or more sources, connect each to a different electrical substation
      Construct and maintain adequate gravity standby storage (see Chapter 7)
      Connect to two independent primary public power sources

5.11.2    Criteria for Multiple Sources or Multiple Pumps per Source
We encourage water systems to have multiple supply sources. Multiple sources help to
ensure operational reliability if a mechanical, electrical, treatment, or structural problem
causes a source to fail. Multiple sources may offset recommended standby storage (SB)
volumes.

We recognize that multiple pumps for a single source may be more reliable than a
single-pump. However, we do not consider a single source with multiple-pumps to be as
reliable as multiple sources. Design engineers should address the following criteria when
seeking approval to consider multiple pumps in a single well as equivalent to multiple
sources for evaluating a reduction in SB volume (see Section 7.1.1.3).
      It is possible to take each pump out of service without depressurizing the water
       system. Water systems should consider establishing an emergency on-call service
       contract with a qualified repair or service entity to minimize down time.
      The well design includes an alarm to signal a pump failure.
      The submittal includes an operational plan to address repairs and minimize
       downtime (WAC 246-290-415).
      The well(s) should be easy to access for repairs and pump removal.

For further consideration, bear in mind the risk of contaminating a single well with
multiple pumps. A second pump in the well addresses mechanical failure of a single
pump, but two pumps cannot overcome contamination of the source. Consider the
need for an expanded, more robust sanitary control area for a multiple pump source.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   131
5.12        Water Resource Analysis and Water Rights
As part of the source approval process, the engineer must do a water resource analysis
to study and address water rights issues (WAC 246-290-130(3)). A water resource
analysis must evaluate opportunities to obtain or optimize the use of sources already
developed, or other ways to meet water needs (WAC 246-290-100 (4)(f) and 110(4)(c)).

Water supplies for Group A water systems must conform to state water right laws (WAC
246-290-130(3)(b) and (4)(a)). Water systems that submit new source development or
other growth-related projects for our review and approval (WAC 246-290-100(4) or
110(4)(e)) must include a Water Rights Self-Assessment Form (WAC 246-290-130(4)(a)).
We review the information provided on this form to ensure the water system has
adequate water rights to meet the projected increased ability to provide service.

5.12.1      Temporary Water Rights
The Department of Ecology issues temporary water rights for two reasons:
        Short-term use with an associated expiration date.
        Water use while an application for a traditional water right is pending review and
         final decision.

We will not increase an existing water system’s service capacity solely because it secures
a temporary water right. We may approve a new public water system based on a source
of supply with a temporary water right under the following conditions:
   1. Water service is prohibited to any permanent structure or permanent use.
   2. The financial planning section of the design submittal or project report reflects
      the expiration date and the inability to renew the temporary water right, and the
      local government land-use decision reflects and supports the temporary use.
   3. The title of the property the temporary water right serves reflects the limitations
      and attributes of the temporary water right, and includes a DOH-approved
      disclaimer.

5.12.2      Interruptible Water Rights
Design engineers considering a new or expanding public water system dependent on
interruptible water rights must demonstrate the water system has access to an
uninterruptible instantaneous supply sufficient to meet basic maximum daily demand
requirements, and an uninterruptible volumetric supply sufficient to satisfy the system’s
nondiscretionary average daily water demands (WAC 246-290-230). We consider access
to an adequate uninterruptible supply to include:


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  132
        An uninterruptible instantaneous supply equal to at least 350 gallons per day
         (gpd) per ERU (WAC 246-290-221 (4)) (See Baseline Residential Water Demand in
         Appendix D).
        A volumetric supply sufficient to serve at least 200 gpd per ERU during the entire
         period of interruption.

During the entire period of interruption, the water system must remain capable of
providing the fire flow the local fire control authority determined necessary (WAC 246-
290-221(5)).

The water system must submit a plan for temporary demand curtailment during the
design period of interruption (WAC 246-290-420 (1)). If the temporary demand
curtailment plan does not describe a credible and enforceable plan to limit demand, we
may seek in the design an increase in the maximum daily demand (MDD) and/or an
increase in average daily demand (ADD).

We recommend planning to mitigate the maximum duration of an interruption based
on a 50- year low-flow for the supply source(s). Design engineers should ask Ecology for
the estimated duration of interruption based on a 50-year low flow in the source(s) of
supply

5.12.3      Leased Water Rights
A water lease from a federal agency, such as Bureau of Reclamation, is irrevocable and
renewable in perpetuity. Consequently, we consider federal leases reliable and
appropriate for approval of a new or expanding water system.

However, we do not recognize other leased water right contracts as a reliable source of
supply. These arrangements risk a permanent water supply interruption if the owner
revokes or does not renew the lease, or the water system cannot obtain a permanent
water right before the lease contract expires.

In most circumstances, the design engineer must demonstrate service capacity based
on the ability to supply 350 gallons per day per ERU under a non-leased water right(s)
(WAC 246-290-221 (4) and 246-290-420 (1)). In addition, the water system must submit
a plan for permanent demand curtailment (WAC 246-290-420 (1)). If the permanent
demand curtailment plan does not describe a credible plan to limit demand, we may
require the engineer to use a greater maximum daily demand (MDD) and/or a greater
average daily demand (ADD) in the water system design.

5.13      Placing a New or Modified Source into Service
Before a new or modified source can be placed into service, it must be properly
inspected, disinfected, and tested (WAC 246-290-120(4) and -451(1)). Design engineers
usually use the WSDOT/APWA standard specifications (Division 7) and AWWA C651–
Standard for Disinfecting Water Mains to define pressure, leakage, and disinfection
standard practices (WSDOT/APWA 2016; AWWA 2014) for pipelines installed as part of a
new or modified source. AWWA C654–Standard for Disinfection of Wells is the
disinfection and testing standard for new or modified wells (WAC 246-290-451(1))
(AWWA 2013). The specific standards used for the project should clearly identify:
      Inspection and flushing requirements.
      Pressure and leakage testing methods.
      Disinfection and bacteriological testing methods.

The new or modified source may be placed into service only after the water system
properly disinfects it according to industry standards, testing results show the water
from it is safe to drink, and the engineer in charge of the project submits a Construction
Completion Form to DOH (WAC 246-290-120(5); WAC 246-290-125(2)(b)).

Chapter 6: Transmission and Distribution Main Design

6.0       Introduction
The proper design is vitally important to ensure that transmission and distribution mains
reliably and efficiently convey safe drinking water to consumers. The essential design
objectives for transmission and distribution systems are assessing hydraulic capacity
under various flow conditions, facilitating best management practices in the operation
of the piping system, and providing for the buried infrastructure’s long-term physical
resiliency.

Good design begins with good planning. Chapter 3 provides the basis for assessing
water demands, and Chapter 4 describes the relationship between water infrastructure,
water supply requirements, and water system capacity. Design engineers should
integrate the transmission and distribution system design into the water system’s overall
design.

The design engineer’s responsibility does not end with ensuring that the system will
deliver the design flow to consumers at a useful pressure immediately after completing
construction. Water systems will count on the continuous use of these new pipes for
many decades. To promote such longevity, the design engineer should carefully
consider selection of pipe material, size, location, and bedding; and evaluate the need
for measures such as:
      Cathodic protection and polyethylene encasement to protect against corrosion.
      Vacuum relief and surge mitigation to protect against destructive surge forces.
      Restrained flexible joint pipe to provide resiliency against ground movement.
      Cross-connection control at point of service to high health hazard premises (see
       WAC 246-290-490).

Operators naturally seek to apply best management practices in the operation and
maintenance of their distribution systems. That means pipeline design should facilitate
operators’ efforts, and include provisions for:
      Sampling stations at representative locations in the distribution system.
      Isolation valves and looped pipe to facilitate maintenance while minimizing
       service disruption.
      Flushing facilities and looped pipe needed to minimize water age and enable
       clearing the distribution system of settled particulates.

This chapter provides guidance on the size, materials, facility location, and other design
factors required to achieve the design objectives listed above. The following definitions
apply to this chapter:

Transmission mains convey water from the source, treatment, or storage facilities to
the distribution system.

Distribution mains deliver water to individual customer service lines and provide water
for fire protection through fire hydrants, if applicable.

6.1       Hydraulic Analysis
Design engineers must use a hydraulic analysis to size and evaluate a new or expanding
distribution system (WAC 246-290-230(1)). All but the simplest distribution systems
require a computer model for an accurate assessment. Hydraulic analyses take four
steps (Cesario 1995; AWWA 2017):
   1. Collect data. Hydraulic analysis data include physical data on pipes, pumps,
      reservoirs and valves, and operational data on flows and facility operations.
   2. Develop the model. Use the data collected to develop a hydraulic model.
   3. Calibrate the model. Calibration involves comparing model results with field
      observations. It is an essential step in developing a useful model (Walski 2000).
   4. Analyze the distribution system. Use the calibrated model to analyze the
      distribution system to determine whether the existing system can meet minimum
      pressure requirements; if not, modify the pipe network to determine the
      improvements needed to meet minimum requirements. You should analyze
      distinct pressure zones separately.

Besides assessing a pipe network’s capacity to deliver required flow-rates while meeting
minimum and maximum pressure standards, use a hydraulic model to assess:
      Unidirectional flushing.
      Water quality in the distribution system.
      Water age.
      Water velocity.
      Hydraulic transients (water hammer).
      Reservoir siting and optimal geometry.

We require a detailed hydraulic analysis as part of a system’s water system plan (WAC
246-290-100). We also may ask a water system for an analysis on an “as needed” basis

(to resolve an operating problem for example) (WAC 246-290-110(2) and (4)(f)). In all
cases, systems must maintain minimum pressures (Chapter 246-290 WAC, Part 3).

6.1.1      Data Collection
Collect the following information to construct an initial model:
       Actual diameter and length of each pipe used in the model. See discussion of
        “skeletonization” below.
       Pipe type and age (to determine “C” roughness coefficient).
       Parameters that vary with time (pump rates, reservoir levels, discharge pressures,
        and demand patterns).
       Reservoir geometry and design levels (operating, equalizing, standby, fire
        suppression, and dead storage elevations) and whether a pressure zone is “open”
        or “closed” as defined in Chapter 8.
       Schematic of key distribution system elements, such as reservoirs and booster
        pump stations, to identify the operational scenarios that should be analyzed.
       Pump curves used in hydraulic simulations should represent the actual pump
        characteristics of the unit. Over time, pump impellers wear and can change the
        pump characteristics. Design engineers should determine whether the pump
        curves are still representative of the installed pumps or whether the curves need
        to be redrawn based on in-service pump flow and pressure testing.
       Operational rules for all major water system components. For example, get
        answers to the following questions. The answers are especially critical when
        running extended-period simulations:
           o Under what conditions do operators turn on a pump, open or close a
             control valve, or adjust a pressure-regulating valve?
           o Do reservoir level probes or pressure sensors control the pumps?
           o What are the corresponding on-off levels or pressures? Do pumping
             schedules change to minimize power costs?
           o Are all facilities available, or are some off-line for maintenance or repair?
       Node elevations taken from the best source possible (topographic survey, Google
        Earth). Use ground level elevations at nodes, rather than pipe elevations, because
        pressure measurements usually are taken close to ground level. In steep terrain,
        accurately locating the node is critical to an accurate elevation, and therefore to
        the hydraulic model results. A 10-foot variance from actual elevation will result in
        a 4-psi inaccuracy before any other modeling inaccuracies come into effect.

“Skeletonization” is the deliberate exclusion of distribution piping from the model. It
simplifies model construction and speeds up the analysis. With increased computational
power, skeletonized models are rarely developed (Speight et al. 2010). See detailed
information on skeletonized model criteria in other guidelines (AWWA 2017, USEPA
2006). Design engineers should state whether they skeletonized the computer model,
and if so provide justification and assessment of the skeletonized model in relation to
the needed level of accuracy.

6.1.2      Hydraulic Model Development
Hydraulic model development involves both:
   1. Defining the physical attributes that comprise the distribution system (sources,
      pipes, reservoirs, valves, and pump stations). See Section 6.1.1.
   2. Identifying and allocating customer demand.

Allocating customer demand probably is the most important and difficult part of
modeling (Speight et al. 2010). Typical data sources used to estimate current and future
demand allocation include customer usage records, especially for large customers;
distribution system leakage estimates; zoning information; projected land use; and fire
flow requirements. From this information, it is possible to estimate maximum day
demands, peak hour demands, and fire flow demands, and to allocate those demands to
nodes within the model. When creating extended period simulation models, develop
diurnal demand curves for each pressure zone.

6.1.3      Hydraulic Model Calibration
Calibration is an essential part of developing a useful hydraulic model. The calibration
process involves comparing modeled or predicted results with field measurements. This
process is necessary for the computer model to provide accurate and reliable results.
Calibration often involves a trial and error process of adjusting the physical attributes
and other information until there is satisfactory agreement between the field data and
modeled results. Among reasons for discrepancies between field data and modeled
results are:
       Erroneous model parameters (pipe roughness values and node demand
        distribution).
       Erroneous network data (pipe diameters and lengths).
       Incorrect network geometry (pipes connected to the wrong nodes).
       Errors in boundary conditions (incorrect pressure-regulating valve settings,
        unknown closed valves, tank water levels, and pump curves).

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 143
      Errors in historical operating records (pumps starting and stopping at incorrect
       times).
      Equipment measurement errors (improperly calibrated pressure gauges).
      Measurement error (reading the wrong values from measurement instruments).
      Field data collection error (moving too quickly from one field point to another
       without allowing the water system to stabilize between readings).

The level of effort needed to calibrate the model varies depending on the end use. The
design engineer should identify the end use of the computer model’s output and
confirm that calibration and/or accuracy is sufficient for that use. A poorly calibrated
model may result in inadequate fire flow, pressure problems, incorrect pipe sizing, or
other issues with significant repercussions.

Design engineers may use various criteria to evaluate model accuracy. The most
common are:
      Absolute pressure difference. Measured in psi.
      Relative pressure difference. Measured as the ratio of the absolute-pressure
       difference to the average-pressure difference across the water system.

Relative pressure difference is the preferred criterion. Simulations over extended periods
involve comparing predicted to observed flow rates, pressures, and tank water levels.

It often takes a repetitive process to eliminate errors, especially when modeling larger
water systems. It is most difficult to calibrate very old and corroded distribution systems,
and water systems with little or no information.

There are no standard national or industry-adopted criteria for calibrating a hydraulic
network model. Engineers can use the references and guidelines in Table 6-1 while
calibrating hydraulic models. See the end of this chapter for recommended references
on calibrating network distribution models (AWWA 2017; Bhave 1988; Cesario, 1995;
Ormsbee and Lingireddy 1997; Speight et al. 2010; Walski 2000).

When calibrating extended-period simulation (EPS) models, the engineer should start
with a steady-state hydraulic analysis for pipe roughness, elevations, and demand
distribution (Walski et al. 2003). As part of developing an EPS model, engineers will need
to develop a diurnal demand curve for the water system or pressure zone(s) they are
analyzing. See Section 6.1.5 for information on EPS modeling.

       peak demands, such as fire flows
       Note: 2.31 feet of head is equal to 1 psi.


Here are some data issues design engineers (“modelers”) should consider in calibrating
hydraulic models:
       1. Water systems that use a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
          system should confirm the calibration of devices used to measure tank levels,
          pressures, and flows for selected locations.
       2. Without a SCADA system, water systems should manually track reservoir
          levels during flow and pressure tests, paying particular attention to the time
          they take each level reading.
       3. Re-set demand allocation. For small water systems, it may be possible to
          gather source and individual meter readings before and after flow tests, and
          estimate the volume used during the tests. A reasonable way to check the
          model is to impose actual water system demand and flow-test data in a
          simulation, and then compare predicted residual pressures to those actually
          measured.
       4. Because there may be uncertainty about pipe-roughness values in older
          distribution systems, we recommend that engineers adjust operational,
          consumption, and network data before they adjust pipe-roughness values.
          Adjust pipe roughness values for whole classes of pipe (e.g., change C for all
          cast iron pipe 40 years and older to 75). If known, use the effective pipe
          diameter (as opposed to the nominal diameter) in very tuberculated pipe.
          Pipe diameter can vary significantly in older pipe, even within the same pipe,
          and may be irregular and random due to build-up (tuberculation) or
          corrosion.

        5. Pipe-roughness values significantly affect water system flows and pressures
           during peak hour demands and fire flows. Procedures for hydrant flow tests
           are in Installation, Testing and Maintenance of Fire Hydrants (AWWA 2006a).
           Criteria to identify deficiencies in pipe segments are in Computer Modeling of
           Water Distribution Systems (AWWA 2017). They include:
                 Velocities greater than 5 fps
                 Head losses greater than 10 feet per 1,000 feet
                 Large-diameter pipes (16 inches or more) with head losses greater than
                  3 feet per 1,000 feet

The accuracy of the calibrated model declines as changes occur in the actual water
distribution network. The engineer should recalibrate the model when adding major
new facilities to the network system, when peak hour demand or maximum daily
demand exceeds that used in the model, or when operational procedures change
significantly.

6.1.4      Hydraulic Model Analysis
Engineers can use the calibrated model to analyze the existing distribution system and
various scenarios of proposed improvements to arrive at the most cost efficient,
effective solution. The hydraulic analysis should clearly identify how the engineer
developed and calibrated the model, and summarize the output. The following items
should be in the hydraulic model discussion. These items also are in the hydraulic
analysis checklist in Appendix A.3.4.
   1. Develop a diagram showing all nodes (junctions) used and a corresponding
      written summary of assumed supply and demand flows for each condition that
      will be evaluated. Larger scale diagram sheets may be necessary to accurately
      show proper location and functions of all control valves and pump station
      facilities.
   2. Explain all assumptions used for the model, including friction factors for the pipes
      and operating conditions of sources, storage reservoirs, booster pumps, and
      valves. For additions to existing water systems, compare computer model results
      to actual field measurements, and document that the model was calibrated
      accordingly.
   3. Using a system contour map, identify the minimum pressure results found at the
      highest elevations and other critical areas in each pressure zone of the system
      under flow conditions found in item 5 (below).
   4. Enter pump curves for the proposed source and booster pumps into the program
      to indicate how the system will respond to varying flow conditions.

   5. Steady-state flow conditions must include each of the following (see WAC 246-
      290-230(5) and (6)):
       a. PHD in each pressure zone and throughout the water system, under
          conditions that deplete all equalizing storage volume and assume all sources
          are operating. The resulting pressures must meet the requirements listed in
          Section 6.2.2.
       b. Highest demand fire-suppression flows, such as commercial zones or
          industrial complexes (>1,000 gpm fire flows, for example), during MDD. The
          design engineer must evaluate the water system and each pressure zone
          under conditions that deplete designed fire-suppression volume and
          equalizing storage. The resulting pressures must conform to Section 6.2.2 with
          respect to values and locations. Design engineers must evaluate water
          systems subject to the Water System Coordination Act assuming the largest
          capacity pump used to supply fire flow is out of service (WAC 246-293-640;
          WAC 246-293-660).
          The distribution system design must provide adequate capacity under a
          variety of flow conditions (WAC 246-290-230). Water systems must operate
          their distribution systems so that 20 psi is available at the flowing hydrant(s)
          and positive pressure is maintained at all times under fire-flow conditions
          (WAC 246-290-420). That means design engineers should assess the flow
          available from a hydrant operating down to 20 psi on residual pressure
          elsewhere in the distribution system—even if that flow exceeds the local fire
          authority requirements..
          A fire department may not know the effect it can have at distant points from
          the flowing hydrant when drafting it down to 20 psi. Design engineers should
          evaluate the potential that firefighting equipment may cause very low water
          system pressure at sites distant from the hydrant(s) in use. These low
          pressures may present a public health concern due to an increased risk for
          contamination from cross connections and pathogen intrusion. Options may
          include discussing water system constraints with fire protection authorities,
          color-coding fire hydrants to indicate limitations, placing orifice plates or
          other devices that restrict flow rates, following stringent disinfection O&M
          procedures after similar events, and informing users of precautions they can
          take to provide additional protection after a fire flow event.
   6. Provide an explanatory narrative to accompany graphic figures. The narrative and
      figures should address:
       a. Low and high-pressure areas in each pressure zone.

        b. Identify whether each zone has adequate equalizing and fire suppression
           storage.
        c. Identify capacity limitations within pressure zones. See Sections 4.4.4.1 and
           4.5.4.1.
        d. Corrective measures and demonstration that corrective measures resolve
           deficiencies identified in the analysis.

6.1.5      Extended Period Simulation
Larger, more complex water systems should consider doing extended period simulation
(EPS) (typically a multiple of 24 hours), using model conditions such as ADD, MDD, and a
worst-case fire flow event with appropriate hourly peaking factors during the day. EPS
also may apply to water systems with limited source capacity and greater reliance on
storage facilities to meet demand. Water systems need EPS to understand the effects of
changing water usage over time, cycles of draining and filling reservoirs, or the way
pumps or valves respond to changes in demand.

As part of developing an EPS model, it is necessary to develop a diurnal demand curve
for the water system or pressure zone being analyzed (Cesario 1995). The shape of the
diurnal demand curve will vary between water systems and even between pressure
zones within a water system. It isn’t appropriate to take a diurnal demand curve from a
textbook and apply it to an EPS model. Several publications explain how to develop a
diurnal demand curve (AWWA 2017; Walski 2003).

6.1.6      Hydraulic Transients (Water Hammer)
Before completing the design or hydraulic assessment, the design engineer should be
confident that the water system is safe from excessive water hammer conditions.
Furthermore, transmission mains designed to operate at velocities greater than 10 feet
per second (10 fps) must have a hydraulic transient analysis in conjunction with the
hydraulic analysis described above (WAC 246-290-230(9)). Factors that make
distribution systems vulnerable to hydraulic transients include:
       Long dead-end pipe segments.
       High velocity (greater than 5 ft./sec).
       Pipeline profiles with sharp changes in slope that create high points (AWWA
        2017).
       Closed systems (Chapter 8 defines a closed system).

There are various computer programs available to the design engineer. Many programs
designed to perform hydraulic analysis also do transient analyses. It is important to
Water System Design Manual

select a model that matches the complexity of the facility. During facility start-up, the
engineer should verify modeled results by gradually generating more and more severe
conditions. This approach can show the water system works, as predicted, prior to
generating the worst-case design conditions.



6.2        Sizing Pipelines
When sizing water system mains, engineers should consider many factors including
pumping costs, future water system demands, land use, friction losses, flow velocities,
and water quality. These factors interrelate, so designers should recognize the influence
of each when selecting optimum piping arrangements. Engineers must design
transmission lines, distribution facilities, water sources, pumping facilities and storage
facilities so that, together, they meet minimum demand—including needed fire flow if
applicable—and pressure requirements described in WAC 246-290-230.

6.2.1      Sizing Procedures
Many engineering textbooks, reference books, and design manuals include procedures
for sizing water system distribution and transmission lines. There also are many common
computer programs available to aid in the design of complex water systems.

6.2.2      Minimum Size
Engineers must use a hydraulic analysis to determine the minimum size of a
transmission or distribution main (WAC 246-290-230(1) and (9)). The hydraulic analysis
must address the parameters outlined in Section 6.1. In general, the main sizes need to
provide the flow rates required to serve the anticipated land use near the water system
as characterized in the water system plan and the local land use plan. All new and
replaced distribution mains must be at least 6 inches in diameter, unless a hydraulic
analysis justifies another size (WAC 246-290-230(2)).

Any pipeline designed to provide fire flow must be at least 6 inches in diameter (WAC
246-290-230(3)). Design engineers must consider at least two demand scenarios when
using a hydraulic analysis to size water mains and other water system facilities (WAC
246-290-230(5) and (6)).
       First, the water system must be able to deliver the peak hourly demand at the
        required pressure of 30 psi at every existing and proposed service connection.
       Second, if the water system provides fire flow, the distribution pipelines must be
        able to deliver the maximum day demand (MDD) rate, in addition to the needed
        fire flow, at the required pressure of 20 psi throughout the distribution system.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   149
Design of transmission mains must provide a minimum of 5 psi at the ground surface
above the pipeline under maximum design flow conditions, except when the
transmission main is located adjacent to a reservoir and the normal operation of the
reservoir provides less than 5 psi (WAC 246-290-230(9)).

6.2.3      Peak Hourly Demand
Distribution pipelines must be able to deliver enough water to meet peak hourly
demand (PHD) at 30 psi at every existing and proposed service (WAC 246-290-230(5)).
PHD is the maximum rate of water use expected to occur in a defined service area,
excluding fire flow. Unless there are accurate water demand records identifying PHD, the
designer should use the equations in Chapter 3 to estimate PHD. If there is more than
one pressure zone, the engineer must estimate PHD separately for each zone (WAC
246-290-235(5)).

6.2.4      Fire “Suppression” Flow
The local fire protection authority or county fire marshal usually determines minimum
fire flow requirements (WAC 246-290-221(5)). The design engineer should always
confirm the fire suppression requirements associated with a given water system design
with the local fire protection authority. Where fire suppression is required, fire
suppression flow plus maximum daily demand usually controls the size and layout of
distribution systems. That is why it is so important to confirm the fire flow requirements.

Typically, the fire protection authority is the town or city fire chief, or county fire marshal
in unincorporated areas. Some incorporated areas may contract for fire protection
services with a district or the county. Local fire protection agencies may reference
standards the Insurance Service Office (ISO) established to determine needed fire flow.
As an example of these standards, ISO’s 2014 Guide for Determination of Needed Fire
Flow standards for 1- and 2-family dwellings not exceeding 2 stories in height for a
duration of 1 hour:

         Distance Between Buildings                           Needed Fire Flow
              More than 30 feet                                   500 gpm
                21 to 30 feet                                     750 gpm
                11 to 20 feet                                    1,000 gpm
                0 to 10 feet                                     1,500 gpm

The design engineer should discuss optimal fire hydrant spacing with the water system
and local fire officials. See Appendix C to get contact information for the Office of the
State Fire Marshall and Washington Surveying and Rating Bureau.

In designing a new water system, or expansion of service from an existing system,
design engineers may wish to consult with the local fire protection authority and
coordinate with local building officials on ways to minimize needed fire flow to
accommodate any physical capacity constraints of the water system.

6.2.5      Minimum Distribution System Pressure
New water systems and additions to existing water systems must be able to provide
PHD at no less than 30 psi at all service connections throughout the distribution system
when all equalizing storage is depleted (WAC 246-290-230(5)). The water system must
meet this minimum pressure at all existing and proposed service meters or along
property lines adjacent to mains if no meters exist.

Many water systems recognize that the 30-psi standard is not optimal for modern
appliances and sprinkler systems. Design engineers should check performance
standards with the local water system, as local standards might be more stringent. At 10
gallons per minute, the friction loss through a typical 5/8-inch meter and ¾-inch service
line from water main to a home (assuming the total distance is 60 feet) is over 10 psi.
Assuming 5 to 10 feet of elevation gain from the water main to the first floor of the
home, only about half of the 30 psi at the water main is available for use inside the
home.

During fire suppression events, the water system must be able to provide 20-psi
minimum pressure at ground level at all points throughout the distribution system. The
water system must be able to provide this minimum pressure under fire-flow conditions
plus the MDD rate when all equalizing and fire-flow storage is depleted (WAC 246-290-
230(6)).

We may approve water systems supplying existing customers, or designs for additions
to existing water systems, to use individual-service booster pumps to provide minimum
design pressure required under WAC 246-290-230 if the individual pumps are:
       Intended for interim use only.
       Managed and controlled by the water system, not the customer.

See Chapter 8 for specific design guidelines on individual-service booster pump
stations.

6.2.6      Maximum Velocity
We recommend a maximum velocity of no more than 8-feet per second (fps) under PHD
conditions, unless the pipe manufacturer specifies otherwise. Maximum velocities
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                151
greater than 8 fps may occur under fire-flow conditions, for short main sections, or
piping in pump and valve station facilities. Excessive velocities may reduce pipe service
life, cause excessive energy consumption, and increase the risk of damaging hydraulic
transients. In addition, unplanned high velocity flow may scour interior pipe surfaces and
cause water quality problems for consumers.

Engineers should conduct a hydraulic transient (water hammer) analysis for distribution
piping designed to exceed 5 fps during PHD or fire-flow conditions (AWWA 2017), and
must do so when a transmission main is designed to operate at 10 fps or more (WAC
246-290-230(9)). See Section 6.1.6 for a discussion on modeling transient conditions and
Section 6.2.8 for surge control.

6.2.7      Excess Pressure
When designing a water main, it is important to consider the type of pipe used and the
pressure needs of the water system. Excessive water system pressure can increase the
risk of pipe failure and result in increased distribution system leakage. Working pressure
in the distribution system should be limited to 80 psi unless the design engineer can
justify the need for higher pressure (to reduce capital and/or pumping costs, increase
fire flow reliability, or for other reasons), and verify that the pipe material is appropriate
for the design working pressure. See Section 6.4.8 for recommendations on individual
pressure-reducing valves.

6.2.8      Surge and Transient Control
Many factors influence hydraulic surges and transient conditions (water hammer),
including main size, length, profile and construction materials. See Section 6.1.6 for an
analysis of transient conditions. Engineers should base pipe pressure tests and thrust
restraint on the maximum transient conditions, including an appropriate safety factor.

We recommend that water systems consider installing facilities that enable real-time
monitoring of distribution system pressures to understand the occurrence of hydraulic
transients and the associated risk of contamination through backsiphonage. Consider
designing continuous pressure monitoring and SCADA reporting in booster pump
stations, reservoir vaults, and PRV vaults.

There are many ways to provide surge control, including:
       Open surge tanks and pressurized surge tanks.
       Surge anticipator valves, vacuum relief valves, and regulated air release valves.
       Optimize the main size and alignment.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      152
       Electric soft-start or -stop and variable speed drives for pumps.
       Electric interlocks to prevent more than one pump from starting at the same
        time.
       Slow opening and closing valves.
       Increase the polar moment of inertia of the rotating pump or motor assembly.
       Reduce flow velocity.

It may be necessary to combine methods. Engineers should take care to avoid a
hydraulic-prevention strategy from causing a secondary water hammer equal to or
worse than the original design.

Reliability of the surge protection facility is important. If appropriate, the design should
provide redundancy for essential equipment such as vacuum relief valves. Surge tanks
and similar components should have early warning alarms to notify operators. The
design should not allow the pumping system to operate if the surge protection facilities
are not operable.

6.2.9      Assessing Water Quality Effects on the Existing Distribution System
Changes in the physical or chemical environment in a distribution system may
destabilize tubercles and introduce their chemical and biological communities into the
water column. In Chapter 5 (Section 5.3) and Chapter 10 (Section 10.13) we describe the
need to assess the effect of adding a new source or treatment process on distribution
system water quality. The assessment should address concerns that chemical changes to
the water in the distribution system (pH, dissolved oxygen, oxidation/reduction
potential) may destabilize the tubercles, thus suspending corrosion byproducts,
adsorbed metal ions, and biofilm or microbial contaminants.

For the same reasons, design engineers should assess the effect associated with
replacement or addition of distribution system water mains on flow direction and
velocity. These physical changes can shear tubercles from pipeline inner walls, resulting
in suspension of chemical and biological contaminants into the distribution system.
Water systems should clean existing pipe segments found to be vulnerable to
tuberculation shearing before activating the new pipeline(s).



6.3        General Design Considerations for Mains
Design engineers should consider the location, depth, pipe material, and bedding from
the perspective of future access, resiliency, and physical protection of the pipeline. These

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   153
basic design elements are especially important because buried pipelines are out of sight
for their entire service life.

6.3.1      Installation
Design pipelines within a public corridor or established easement. Specify installation
according to established standards such as Washington State Department of
Transportation (WSDOT/APWA Division 7) and AWWA. Use the information in and
reference the latest edition of AWWA Standards such as C651 (Disinfection), C600 (DI
pipe installation), C605 (PVC pipe installation), and ASTM standards such as F2620
(HDPE joining).

You also may find the following AWWA Manuals of Practice useful in preparing
construction documents for the installation of transmission and distribution mains:
       AWWA M9: Concrete Pressure Pipe (AWWA 2008).
       AWWA M11: Steel Water Pipe – A Guide for Design and Installation (AWWA
        2004).
       AWWA M23: PVC Pipe Design and Installation (AWWA 2002, AWWA 2005a).
       AWWA M41: Ductile-Iron Pipe and Fittings (AWWA 2009a, AWWA 2010).
       AWWA M55: PE Pipe Design and Installation (AWWA 2006b).

6.3.2      Depth of Pipe Burial
Design pipelines below the frost line measured in the most severe winters; otherwise,
design freeze protection. When determining proper depth, engineers should evaluate
temperature variations in the area, especially in Eastern Washington and mountainous
areas. The minimum fill depth over the top of the pipe is usually 36 inches. The design
engineer may justify another depth (for example, to avoid underground obstructions or
rocky conditions).

If providing less than 36 inches of cover, engineers should consider and document the
following in the project report:
       Pipe load and pipe strength.
       Freeze protection.
       Vulnerability to damage from future excavation.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                154
6.3.3      Special Design Considerations
The design should protect pipes above ground from freezing (such as bridge crossings)
and secure pipes at river crossings or subject to tidal action. The engineer should
consider:
       Pipe thrust restraints whenever pipelines leave the soil.
       Underground thrust blocking whenever a pipe changes direction (such as a
        bend) or unbalanced thrust forces exist (pressure and momentum).

6.3.4      Separation from Nonpotable Conveyance Systems
Appropriate separation between potable and nonpotable pipelines protects public
health and safety. Pipeline failure or leaks can result in pipeline contamination that
jeopardize public health and safety. Nonpotable conveyance systems include piping that
carries:
       Sanitary or industrial sewage
       Reclaimed water
       Irrigation supply from nonpotable sources
       Storm drains
       Petroleum products (oil, refined products)
       Natural gas

We do not consider a driveway culvert a nonpotable pipeline requiring special
consideration.

Backflow of leaked content from a nonpotable conveyance system, or complete pipe
failure of nonpotable piping can contaminate the potable water system. Pipeline
designers can increase potable pipeline reliability by selecting proper pipe materials,
wall thickness, pipe joint and thrust restraint systems, pipe bedding, and internal and
external corrosion control, and adequate separation between pipelines.

Adequate separation minimizes incidental damage during the repair or replacement of
potable water lines and pipelines. Adequate separation also ensures sufficient room to
repair leaks and replace broken sections. Finally, separation reduces the potential for
pipeline failure that a leak or failure of its neighboring pipeline could cause.

The following recommendations apply to pipelines of 24-inch diameter or less. Larger
pipelines create more concerns and, therefore, require additional consideration.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    155
Standard industry guidance calls for a minimum of 10-foot horizontal separation
between the outer walls of potable and nonpotable pipelines in parallel installations,
and a minimum of 18-inch vertical separation (potable water line above) between the
invert of the potable water line and the crown of the nonpotable line at pipeline
crossings (Ten State Standards, WAC 246-290-200).

We recognize that actual conditions can make it impossible to comply with these
standards. If the design of a new or replacement water main cannot provide the
standard 10-foot horizontal separation, design engineers should consult Pipeline
Separation Design and Installation Reference Guide (WSDOE and DOH 2006). Provisions
allow for parallel potable and nonpotable installations to be as close as 4-feet
horizontally if they meet certain conditions. Design engineers should provide
justification, and demonstrate that the conditions for a pipe separation less than 10-feet
are met in the project report.

If the potable line is closer than 18 vertical inches from the nonpotable line at the point
of crossing, or the potable line must cross under the nonpotable line, the potable line
should be encased with ductile iron or steel pipe designed to withstand a minimum
static pressure of 150 psi extending at least 10 feet to either side of the crossing.
Additional measures may be necessary to mitigate the risk posed by crossing an existing
nonpotable line, especially when it is located above the new water line.

If the water system receives permission to do so, mitigation of close parallel or crossing
installations may be applied to the nonpotable line. This may include encasing the
nonpotable pipe with pressure grouting, concrete, or controlled density fill.
Surrounding nonpotable or potable pipes in concrete makes future repair or access
extremely difficult. For this reason, we recommend the use of casing pipes instead.
Designers should include project-specific information and justification, permission to
work with the nonpotable pipe, and appropriate direction in the water system’s pipe
repair SOPs in the project report.

6.3.5     Separation from Other Potential Sources of Contamination
Design engineers should thoroughly evaluate water main installations on a case-by-case
basis if they are near other potential sources of contamination. This may include a
facility if a failure at the facility would subject the water in the main to toxic or
pathogenic contamination. Other potential sources of contamination include storage
ponds, land disposal sites for wastewater or industrial process water containing toxic
materials or pathogenic organisms, and solid waste disposal sites.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   156
Designers should not install water mains closer than 10 feet from a septic tank, drain
field, or any other on-site wastewater treatment or disposal component. The
measurement should be from the outer wall of the water main to the outer boundary of
the drain field bed or exterior face of any other on-site component.

Design engineers and water systems should take precautions before selecting materials
for a pipeline in an area with soils known or suspected to be contaminated with lower-
molecular-weight organic solvents or petroleum products. Certain pipe materials,
especially polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE and HDPE), and polybutylene (PB),
are susceptible to permeation by such contaminants (Holsen et al. 1991; Ong et al. 2008,
Cheng et al. 2012). Elastomeric gaskets made of ethylene propylene diene monomer
(EPDM) used to join ductile iron pipe are susceptible to permeation as well. However,
nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) is resistant to permeation by organic solvents and
petroleum products, so ductile iron pipe with these types of gaskets should be used if
potential permeation is an issue (Cheng et al. 2012).

Designers and water systems should ask the pipe manufacturer about the risk of
permeation of pipe walls and jointing material in such areas.

6.3.6     Pipe Materials
Various materials are available for distribution and transmission pipes. Engineers base
their material selection on factors such as life-cycle cost (capital and maintenance),
reliability, special design considerations, water system preference or familiarity,
conformance with existing materials, and certification under ANSI/NSF Standard 61. The
design engineer must use established standards, such as AWWA or the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), when justifying the class of pipe selected
(WAC 246-290-200(1)).

Any selected material that will have substantial contact with drinking water supplies
must be certified to meet ANSI/NSF Standard 61 (WAC 246-290-220(1)). This applies to
coatings, liners, or any joining materials used. “Substantial contact” means the potential
for contaminants to enter the drinking water. Factors to consider are the total area of
exposure, volume, length of time water is in contact with material, and level of public
health risk.

6.3.7     External Corrosion Control
Engineers should consider protection from external corrosion in areas where corrosive
soils are prevalent or when pipelines are exposed. This protection is especially true for


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  157
bridge crossings in salt-water (coastal) environments or other harsh environments. This
protection also may be necessary in colder locations where salt is used to de-ice roads.

Engineers should also evaluate and, if appropriate, protect metal pipes from corrosion
due to stray electrical currents in the soil. This usually occurs when metal pipes are near
or cross:
       Major oil or natural gas pipelines protected by impressed current
       Light rail guideway

The AWWA Manual of Practice M27 on external corrosion control has detailed
information on:
       Assessing the potential for corrosion of buried and exposed water mains.
       Protecting buried water mains.
       Selecting coating material for exposed pipes (AWWA 2014a).

6.3.8      Location of Pipes in Geologically Vulnerable Areas
Earthquakes and landslides have caused water mains to fail, leading to depressurization
of distribution systems, boil water advisories, and significant service disruptions (Tanaka
1995; Ballantyne et al. 2009; WMD-EMD 2014). Although transitory seismic waves and
strong ground shaking can cause some buried pipelines to fail, buried pipelines are at
most risk when they are subjected to permanent ground displacements. The most
common causes of permanent ground displacement are
       Liquefaction and lateral spread.
       Landslide.
       Settlement.
       Fault rupture.
       Subsidence or uplift.

To meet state and local requirements, engineers must address geologic risk (seismic
and unstable slopes) when designing water systems (WAC 246-290-200), assessing
existing water mains, and installing new water mains.

Engineers should prioritize making transmission and distribution systems that serve
water for essential services earthquake-resilient, so that these pipelines remain
functional after seismic events. Essential services include medical facilities; power plants;
fuel refining, storage, and distribution facilities; food production, storage, and


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    158
distribution facilities; emergency response command and communication centers; and
emergency shelters.

Engineers can reduce or mitigate seismic risk by:
       Identifying where pipeline alignments cross through regions of potential
        permanent ground displacement or strong ground shaking intensity.
       Using seismic-resistant pipe systems that can accommodate expected permanent
        ground displacements and strong ground shaking.
       Using flexible couplings that permit differential movement when pipelines
        attached to structures, such as tanks and vaults, move differentially with respect
        to the ground.
       Providing adequate support and bracing to structures that support above-ground
        pipelines.
       Installing redundant facilities and/or looped piping.
       Using appropriate valving to isolate vulnerable areas.
       Installing pipe within a reinforced pipe tunnel.
       Encasing with polyethylene.

The Washington State Department of Natural Resources has geologic hazard maps
designers can use to identify seismic and other geologic hazards. Some pipes, such as
butt-fused HDPE (AWWA 2015a), molecularly oriented PVC (AWWA 2009b), and seismic
joint ductile iron pipe, are much less prone to failure in earthquakes and landslides
(Water Supply Forum 2015). You also can consider using specialized, flexible expansion
joints that can accommodate significant ground motion, especially near where water
mains enter structures such as reservoirs and booster pump stations.

Design guidelines available from the American Lifelines Alliance can be useful in
selecting and designing water mains in areas with significant geologic risk (ALA 2001;
ALA 2005). In areas with the potential for permanent ground displacement or strong
ground shaking, you may need to seek the services of a qualified geotechnical engineer
or other professional qualified to assist in selecting materials and other design aspects.

6.3.9      Layout of Mains
Engineers should plan and design water mains in segmented grids and loops located in
the established right-of-way or utility easement. Distribution mains should be looped, if
possible, to avoid as many dead ends as possible. Looping may not always be practical
due to topography, geology, pressure-zone boundaries, unavailable easements, or


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  159
locations of users. If water systems cannot avoid dead ends, they should provide blow-
offs to allow adequate flushing of those mains. See Section 6.4.3.

6.3.10      Protection Against Cross-Connection
Water systems must protect their distribution systems from contamination through
cross connections with any source of nonpotable liquid, solid, or gas that could
contaminate the potable water supply by backflow (WAC 246-290-490). Design engineers
should incorporate provisions that enable their water system clients to meet their
regulatory obligations and to follow best management practices upon project
completion. Backflow assemblies should be installed so that they can be readily tested,
inspected, and maintained. Reduced pressure assemblies should not be installed in
places that are vulnerable to flooding such as underground vaults. The following
manuals provide detailed definitions, descriptions, and best practices for cross-
connection control (CCC):
        Manual of Cross-Connection Control (USC FCCCHR 2009). See Appendix C for USC
         Foundation for CCC contact information.
        Cross Connection Control: Accepted Procedure and Practice Manual (PNWS-
         AWWA, 1996).
        Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems (WSDOH 2004).
        Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control
         (AWWA 2015b).

It is important to determine CCC requirements during the planning phase of any water
system project to avoid the expense and difficulty of retrofitting an existing facility or
device to accept backflow protection. Engineers should consult with the water system’s
cross-connection control specialist (CCS) to be sure the design addresses the system’s CCC
requirements.

Basic CCC design considerations include:
   1. Increased head loss. Backflow prevention assemblies increase head loss. Look for
      the head loss curve for a backflow prevention assembly in the manufacturers’
      assembly specifications.
   2. Premises with high health-hazard cross connections listed in Table 9 of WAC 246-
      290-490(4). The design engineer should consult with the water system to
      determine whether it will connect a new water main to any existing Table 9
      premises and, if so, consult with the CCS on the appropriate CCC strategy for
      each such prospective service connection.
   3. Cross connection requirements within water treatment facilities (see Section 10.9).

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                160
   4. Premises served by rainwater collection systems, private wells, reclaimed water, or
      any other nonpotable supply (see Section 5.10.1).
   5. Overflow and drain pipes from storage tanks (see Section 7.4.3 and 7.4.4).
   6. Pump-to-waste and air-vacuum relief valve discharge. Pump to waste must be
      fitted with an appropriate air gap (WAC 246-290-490).
   7. Individual booster pumps. Design engineers must ensure that the facility design
      prevents individual booster pumps from negatively affecting distribution system
      water quality (see Section 8.4.1).

All backflow assemblies used to protect the public water system must be on the
approved assemblies list developed by the USC Foundation for Cross-Connection
Control and Hydraulic Research (WAC 246-290-490).



6.4       Appurtenant Design Considerations
The selection and location of pipeline appurtenances such as valves, instrumentation,
flushing and sampling stations enable operators to optimally manage the distribution
system and maximize consumer value. Engineers should consider the following as part
of the overall distribution and transmission main appurtenant design.

The State Building Code Council (SBCC) administers our state’s code adoption process.
Contact information for SBCC is in Appendix C.

6.4.1     Valves
Designers should place enough valves to minimize the number of customers out of
service when the water system needs to isolate a location for maintenance, repair,
replacement, or additions. Spacing of distribution system isolation valves should be 800
feet or less (AWWA 2008) unless the grid geometry or low housing density justify
greater spacing.

6.4.2     Vacuum Relief and Air Release Valves
The engineer must ensure the distribution system is protected from backflow
contamination as a result of the intended operation of the vacuum relief or combination
vacuum/air relief valve (WAC 246-290-490). The design should not provide a pathway
for distribution system contamination; for example, through backsiphonage from an air-
vacuum relief valve with a vent located inside an undrained pit or a pump-house drain
line. The vent on these valves should be equipped with an appropriate air gap above the


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                               161
highest possible water level. The design must not create pathways that could introduce
contaminated water through backsiphonage.

High points of distribution or transmission lines where air can accumulate should have a
way to vent the air. Venting options include an automatic air release valve, combination
vacuum relief/air release valve, or manually operated devices. We recommend using a
manual air relief valve or other manual means of venting air (fire hydrant, flushing
hydrant, some types of service connections) wherever possible in lieu of an automatic
valve (See Ten-State Standards).

Vacuum relief may be necessary at any point along a water pipeline where column
separation could occur due to a negative pipeline transient pressure wave. See Sections
6.1.6 and 6.2.8. A sudden increase or decrease in flow may cause such events. The
location where a vacuum relief valve is needed may be near or far from the cause of the
transient wave (e.g., sudden booster pump station or source pump failure, rapidly closed
valve, large and sudden pipeline break).

Vacuum relief may be necessary near a reservoir. To isolate the only reservoir serving a
system or pressure zone, the water system may need a vacuum relief valve on the
system side of the reservoir isolation valve (see Chapter 7). Water systems also may
need vacuum relief to support vertical turbine pump operations. When a vertical turbine
pump shuts down, water falls out of the pump column, and air is introduced on the
pump side of the pump check valve to allow the pump column to return to atmospheric
pressure.

If a valve is installed in a vault, the vault should be rated for appropriate vehicular
loading whenever there is any possibility of traffic around the vault. The interior of the
vault should provide at least a 2-foot clearance around the valve. The air inlet and
discharge vents should be located outside the valve vault at least 18 inches above
finished grade.

Weep holes located below grade in the vent discharge line should be avoided. Design
options include locating both the valve and the discharge vent above grade in an
insulated secure box. Extreme freezing installations may require vent inflow preventers
to protect against backflow from flooded vaults.

Each vent should have a screened downward-facing vent opening (some valves may
have multiple vents). Proper drainage away from the vent outlets is necessary. During
valve operation some water discharge will occur through the vent. If the internal valve
does not seat properly, there will be continuous water discharge.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   162
6.4.3      Flushing Valves, Blow-offs and Hydrants
To allow sufficient flushing and proper disinfection of distribution mains, engineers
should install blow-offs, automatic flushing stations, or hydrants at low points and dead-
ends in the distribution system. They should be designed to achieve a minimum velocity
of 3.0 fps in the main for scouring purposes. To meet these criteria, small water systems
with larger pipes may need to consider design allowances that enable them to add
temporary pumping or storage facilities.

6.4.4      Fire Hydrants
You should check with the local fire protection authority to make sure that the make
and model of any proposed fire hydrant is acceptable; there are multiple types of dry
barrel fire hydrants (AWWA 2005b; AWWA 2006a). The Water System Coordination Act
defines standard fire hydrants (WAC 246-293-650(3)):

        “All fire hydrants shall conform to American Water Works Association
        specifications for dry barrel fire hydrants. Each hydrant shall have at
        least two hose connections of 2½ inches diameter each and one
        pumper connection.”

New hydrants must be installed off mains at least 6-inches in diameter. The local fire
protection authority must approve existing hydrants connected to a water main less
than 6 inches, and the hydraulic analysis must demonstrate that the flow available at the
hydrant meets the fire protection authority’s standards (WAC 246-290-230(4)). Residual
pressure requirements described in WAC 246-290-230 (6) apply to hydrants installed on
undersized water mains.

Other types of “hydrants” not designed to provide fire flows, such as flush valves,
standpipes, blow-offs, or nonstandard, smaller volume hydrants without pumper ports
may be placed on smaller mains (less than 6 inches in diameter).

Designers should provide all fire hydrants with their own auxiliary gate valve. Auxiliary
gate valves are a safety item on hydrants, and most, if not all, water systems require them.

6.4.5      Sampling Stations
Every water system must develop and follow a coliform monitoring plan (WAC 246-290-
300(3)(b)). See coliform monitoring plan guidance: DOH 331-036 and DOH 331-240.
Design engineers should put sampling stations in locations where water systems can
collect representative water quality samples from the distribution systems. We
recommend the following sampling station features:
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  163
   1. Use distribution piping, not household plumbing.
   2. The sampling location should be in an active part of the distribution system.
   3. The water system should have control (ownership) of the location or sample
      station.
   4. The sample tap should be in a lockable enclosure and be otherwise protected
      from the weather and tampering.
   5. A dedicated standpipe with a smooth-nosed sample tap is preferable.

To protect samples from potential contamination and false positives, engineers should
not use stop-to-waste designs without first considering operations and maintenance,
drainage, and security. Designs should provide adequate protection from freezing, such
as using connections for a hand evacuation pump or using continuous flow sampling
stations. See Section 5.2.6 for more information on desired sample tap attributes.

6.4.6     Yard Hydrants
Water systems may not install yard hydrants that drain the riser into the ground for any
purpose without installing appropriate cross-connection control to protect the
distribution system from contamination. The riser weep hole drain presents a risk of
contamination to the distribution system through a cross connection with contaminated
groundwater. If you choose to use a yard hydrant without cross-connection control
protection, the Uniform Plumbing Code requires you to use a model that does not drain
into the ground. We accept yard hydrants that conform to American Society of Sanitary
Engineering Standard 1057 (ASSE 2012) because they do not drain into the ground.

6.4.7     Angle, Curb or Meter Stops
Water systems should install separate angle, curb, or meter stops for each individual
service connection. They allow water systems to close individual customer connections
temporarily without interrupting service to other customers. We do not recommend
supplying multiple water service connections from a single tap.

6.4.8     Individual Pressure-Reducing Valves
When a water system anticipates that pressure at the customers’ point of use will exceed
80 psi, it should recommend that those customers install and maintain an individual
pressure-reducing valve (PRV) as described in the Uniform Plumbing Code (IAPMO
2015). A water system should not install a PRV for an individual customer unless it has a
written agreement with the customer showing who is responsible for required PRV
maintenance, repair, or replacement. The design engineer should check for local
ordinances or service agreements on PRV use.

6.4.9      Automatic Control Valves
The most common type of automatic control valve used in a distribution system is a
pressure reducing valve. Other types include altitude valves (usually associated with an
atmospheric reservoir) and combined pressure reducing or pressure sustaining valves
(used when maintaining a predetermined minimum upstream pressure is more
important than delivering all the flow needed downstream of the valve).

Engineers usually install these valves in undrained underground vaults. Therefore, they
may be subject to flooding from high groundwater or storm water infiltration. Designers
should be sure to protect installations that include any atmospheric vents installed as
part of the valve’s hydraulic control system from backsiphonage. See Section 6.4.2 for
vent, vault, and drain standards.



6.5        Construction Documents for Pipelines
Design engineers must submit most construction documents—construction drawings
and specifications intended for construction of water system infrastructure—to us for
review and approval before construction begins (WAC 246-290-120). See Chapter 2.
Construction documents include all the information the contractor needs to construct
the improvements. Nothing of consequence should be left out of construction
documents or left to the contractor’s assumptions. We will not approve construction
documents unless they provide enough detail to inform the contractor of his
requirements with respect to:
       Approved materials.
       Sequence, location, and orientation of construction.
       Testing requirements.
       Submittal requirements for owner’s approval.

The checklists in Appendix A.3.3 include specific guidance on information design
engineers should provide in construction documents for pipelines

To ensure the finished pipeline operates successfully, it is important for the water
system’s representative to observe construction, including pipe and appurtenance
handling; trench excavation, preparation, and backfilling; separation from other utilities;
thrust restraint; disinfection; and testing. When the project is complete, a licensed
professional engineer (usually the design engineer) must certify that construction
conformed to approved construction documents, and the water system must submit the
certification to DOH (see Section 6.6).

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 165
6.5.1      Construction Specifications for Pipelines
Construction specifications must meet commonly accepted technical standards, such as
AWWA, WSDOT/APWA, or equivalent (WAC 246-290-200(1)(d)). Attention to detail is
important to ensure the identified specifications include all required information. The
referenced specifications may require some case-by-case determinations. Specifications
must thoroughly describe the materials, means, and methods for satisfying the
requirements and conditions of the project (WAC 246-290-120(1)).

Water systems may include standard construction specifications in their water system
plan or make them available as a separate document. The standard specifications should
include materials, and construction or installation details the water system considers
standard for construction and maintenance.



6.6        Placing a Water Main into Service
Before placing a new transmission or distribution main into service, the contractor must
properly inspect, disinfect, and test it (WAC 246-290-120(4)). Engineers often use the
WSDOT/APWA standard specifications (Division 7) and AWWA C651 - Standard for
Disinfecting Water Mains to define pressure, leakage, and disinfection standard practices
(WSDOT/APWA 2016; AWWA 2014b). The specific standards used for the project should
clearly identify:
       Inspection and flushing requirements.
       Pressure and leakage testing methods.
       Disinfection and bacteriological testing methods.

A water main cannot be placed into service until it is flushed and properly disinfected,
test results show that the water from it is safe to drink, and the engineer in charge of the
project submits a Construction Completion Form to DOH (WAC 246-290-120(5); WAC
246-290-125(2)(b)). To ensure meaningful bacteriological results, collect coliform
samples after you flush the water main and chlorine residuals return to background
levels. For water systems with current, approved water system plans that include
standard construction specifications for distribution mains, design engineers can use the
Construction Completion Form for Distribution Main Projects (DOH 331-147) and keep it
on file. For all other projects, design engineers must submit a complete Construction
Completion Form (DOH 331-121) to DOH.

Chapter 7: Reservoir Design and Storage Volume

7.0       Introduction
Adequate finished water storage provides multiple advantages to a water system.
Storage can reduce excessive pump cycling; reduce sizing requirements for supply
sources, treatment works, and transmission or distribution piping; and provide a reserve
for fire-fighting and continued system pressure despite a temporary loss of supply. This
chapter discusses water reservoirs that operate at atmospheric pressure. See Chapter 9
for guidance on pressurized storage.

The objective of reservoir design is to provide the water system with adequate and
resilient water storage facilities that protect the quality of stored water. Public health
protection requires thorough consideration of each reservoir design element, adhering
to appropriate construction standards, and implementing best reservoir management
and operating practices.

Historically, Washington’s sanitary surveys revealed defects in reservoir design,
construction, or maintenance that threaten the safety of the drinking water supply.
Similar observations occurred throughout the country. In 2015, EPA indicated that it
might amend the Revised Total Coliform Rule with specific inspection requirements for
finished water storage facilities (USEPA 2015). At this time, the issue of regulating
storage reservoir maintenance remains undecided, but the driving force behind it is
clear: Poorly designed, constructed, and maintained reservoirs present a significant risk
for distribution system contamination.

This chapter provides guidance for:
      Reservoir Sizing (Section 7.1).
      Geometry, elevation, and integration with existing and future facilities (Section
       7.2).
      Location and site considerations (Section 7.3).
      Construction materials and design elements (Section 7.4).
      Operational constraints and considerations (Section 7.5).
      Reservoir water quality and sampling access (Section 7.6).
      Placing a reservoir into service (Section 7.7).

We do not intend to establish any particular reservoir design approach. See the
references at the end of the chapter for more information on reservoir design (AWWA

2000).



7.1       Reservoir Sizing
To ensure the reservoir under design provides the level of service that the community
expects over the lifetime of the facility, water systems must plan for population and land
use changes (WAC 246-290-. Engineers design storage facilities to serve the needs of
the community for a planned number of years, or to accommodate full water system
build-out (for a particular subdivision, planned development, or as a condition of plat
approval). The design life for a properly maintained concrete and steel reservoir is at
least 50 years.

The following design guidance applies to the specific area(s) the reservoir under design
will serve. This area may be the entire water system, where the designer intends to use
one reservoir to serve all customers, or it may be a discrete pressure zone. For the
purpose of this section, see Section 7.1.3 for definitions of “supply pumps,” “supply,” and
“source.”

7.1.1     Storage Components
The design engineer must consider the five storage components discussed in Section
4.4.3 and listed below (WAC 246-290-235(3)):
   1. Operational storage (OS).
   2. Equalizing storage (ES).
   3. Standby storage (SB).
   4. Fire suppression storage (FSS), if applicable.
   5. Dead storage (DS), if applicable.

Figure 7-1 illustrates and Table 7-1 describes a typical cross section of reservoir storage
components.

7.1.1.1   Operational Storage
Operational storage (OS) supplies the water system while the pumps supplying the
reservoir are in “off” status (WAC 246-290-010). This volume will vary according to the:
   1. Sensitivity of the water level sensors controlling the supply pumps.
   2. Geometry of the reservoir between the designated pump-off and pump-on water
      level set points.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   172
Designers can use various water level sensors to signal pump-off and pump-on levels,
including float switches, ultrasonic sensors, and pressure switches. Some level sensing
devices can detect water level changes as small as a fraction of an inch. Others require
more than a foot. Tank designers should account for the type of level sensor when
determining the vertical dimension needed for proper operation of the device, reservoir,
and supply pumps.

The OS volume should be sufficient to avoid source of supply pump cycling in excess of
the pump motor manufacturer's recommendation. In general, design engineers should
limit the supply pump motors to no more than six starts per hour unless the pump
motor manufacturer permits more frequent cycling. To limit pump starts to no more
than six per hour, OS volume can be conservatively calculated as the pump supply
capacity (in gpm) times 2.5 minutes. Typically OS is substantially smaller than the
remaining volume of the tank.

Operational storage volume does not apply to:
      Service capacity analysis (see Chapter 3).
      Water systems operating under a continuous supply mode (see Section 7.1.1.2).

When considering total storage volume needed, the design engineer should allow for
seasonal changes in reservoir operational levels intended to reduce:
      Disinfection byproduct formation or to address other effects of extended water
       age. It may be necessary to adjust pump-on and pump-off levels and/or expand
       OS as a percentage of total reservoir operational volume.
      The potential for ice formation. It may be necessary to increase OS to improve
       circulation. An ice cap inside a reservoir can cause significant structural damage,
       damage to the internal coating system, and destruction of the level control
       system.

7.1.1.2     Equalizing Storage
The water system must provide equalizing storage (ES) when source pumping capacity
cannot meet the peak hourly demand (WAC 246-290-235(4)). New water systems and
additions to existing water systems must be able to provide PHD at no less than 30 psi
at all service connections throughout the distribution system when all equalizing storage
is depleted (WAC 246-290-230(5)). The water system must meet this minimum pressure
at all existing and proposed service meters or along property lines adjacent to mains if
no meters exist.

Many water systems recognize that the 30-psi standard is not optimal for modern
appliances and sprinkler systems. Design engineers should check performance
standards with the local water system, because local standards may be more stringent.

Several factors influence ES volume, including demand, source capacity, and the mode
of supply. Two modes of supply operation are.
   1. Call-on-Demand (common): Engineers often use this mode of operation to
      estimate ES. Call-on-demand operations use ES to supply the daily peak period of
      demand. Engineers should use Equation 7-1 to estimate minimum ES
      requirements unless actual water use records indicate a more applicable volume.
      Water systems with multiple sources may need to provide ES in excess of
      Equation 7-1 depending on the mode of operation.


          Equation 7-1:
                      ES = (PHD - QS )(150 minutes), but in no case less than zero

          Where:
                      ES =       Equalizing storage component, in gallons
                    PHD =        Peak hourly demand, in gpm, as defined in Chapter 3
                                 of this manual
                      QS =
                                 Sum of all installed and active supply source capacities
                                 except emergency supply, in gpm. See Section 7.1.3 for
                                 definition of sources as it applies to this equation.
   2. Continuous Supply (unusual): Engineers apply this approach to situations
      where reservoirs fill continuously over a period of time that does not necessarily
      coincide with the peak demand period, such as filling a reservoir during the night
      when the cost of energy can be lower. The volume of ES using this mode of
      operation can be significant because water systems use it to meet longer periods
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 176
       of demand. ES sizing with continuous source pumping will require developing a
       maximum day demand (MDD) diurnal curve for the pressure zone(s) the reservoir
       supplies. Diurnal demand varies due to the pressure zone size, season, and type
       of demand (residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational). After developing
       the MDD diurnal curve, the design engineer can calculate the required ES by
       determining the difference between supply and demand. As a general guideline,
       the volume of ES needed using constant pumping is about 10 to 25 percent of
       the MDD (Walski 2000).

The engineer may eliminate ES only if the combined capacity of the supply sources
meets or exceeds the PHD for the water system, or pressure zone, while providing 30-
psi pressure at each existing and proposed service connection.

7.1.1.3    Standby Storage
Water systems intend SB volume to provide continued water supply during abnormal
operating conditions, such as structural, electrical, mechanical, or treatment process
failure; or source contamination (WAC 246-290-420). Engineers should use these
standby storage guidelines for community water systems and noncommunity water
systems, such as schools and health care facilities, where service disruptions would have
significant effects on those served.

The degree to which engineers incorporate standby storage into reservoir design is a
direct reflection of the consumers’ expectations of water service during abnormal
operating conditions. The water system governing body, representing the interests of
the community, is in a position to determine the cost and benefit associated with
providing a given level of reliability. Engineers should size SB volume based on locally
adopted standards for water supply under emergency or abnormal operating conditions
as outlined in Equation 7-2.


  Equation 7-2:

                SB = (N)(SBi)(Td)

  Where:

    SB =        Total standby storage component, or its equivalent, in gallons.

     N =        Number of ERUs based on the ERUMDD value.

    SBi =       Locally adopted unit SB volume in gallons per day per ERU (number of
                ERUs based on the ERUMDD value).

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 177
     Td =       Number of days selected to meet water system-determined standard of
                reliability.

The lower elevation of the SB component should produce no less than 20 psi at all
existing and proposed service connections throughout the distribution system during
PHD conditions.

We recommend SB volume equal the MDD for the pressure zone(s) served (i.e., Td =1
day) and adjust SB volume based on factors listed below.

Water systems with a single source
Engineers should pay special attention to SB volume for water systems with only one
source. Temporary loss of a water system’s single source leaves only storage as a back-
up supply. Design engineers should consider SB volume greater than MDD if the
system’s only source is vulnerable to flooding or other extreme weather events,
extended power failures, or source treatment process failure; or if the transmission main
from source to distribution is vulnerable to natural hazards (see Section 7.3.1). Design
engineers considering the storage needs of water systems with only one source of
supply should perform an all-hazards assessment. This assessment should evaluate the
probability and duration of events that may lead to temporary loss of the system’s only
source of supply.

Water systems with multiple sources
It may be appropriate for design engineers to consider SB volume less than MDD if
multiple sources provide mechanical, electrical, treatment, and transmission redundancy
and resilience to a single contamination event. Section 7.1.3 lists what we consider to be
continuously available sources of supply for reservoir design purposes.

Design engineers may justify a reduction of SB volume based on one or more of the
following:
   1. The water system and the local fire authority allow for nesting SB and FSS
      volumes, where the FSS volume is greater than the SB volume. See Section
      7.1.1.4.
   2. Two or more sources have permanent on-site auxiliary power that starts
      automatically when the primary power feed is disrupted. With the largest of these
      sources out of service, the remaining sources plus SB volume can maintain at
      least 20 psi throughout the distribution system under PHD conditions.
   3. Two or more sources receive power from two electrical substations, so that failure
      of one substation will not interrupt the power supply to the source as

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 178
       documented in writing by the power utility. With the largest of these sources out
       of service, the remaining sources plus SB volume can maintain at least 20 psi
       throughout the distribution system under PHD conditions.
   4. Sources are located in different watersheds, wellhead protection areas, or
      aquifers.
   5. Converting dead storage to standby storage by providing mechanically
      redundant booster pumping capacity with permanent on-site auxiliary power that
      starts automatically when the primary power feed is disrupted.

Even for pressure zones with multiple sources of supply and with other reliability
measures as outlined above, we recommend SB volume of at least 200 gallons per ERU.

Water systems serving non-critical uses
If a loss of water-supply event occurs, certain types of noncommunity water systems
could shut down without affecting public health and welfare. See Section 7.1.5 for
additional design guidance for such systems.

7.1.1.4    Fire Suppression Storage
The local fire protection authority or county fire marshal determines a fire flow
requirement for water systems. This fire suppression storage (FSS) level depends on the
maximum flow rate and duration. Water systems the local fire authority require to
provide fire flow must build and maintain facilities, including storage reservoirs, capable
of meeting fire flow requirements while maintaining 20 psi pressure throughout the
distribution system (WAC 246-290-221(5)).
For water systems supplied through gravity storage, the bottom of the FSS component
must be at an elevation that produces no less than 20 psi at all points throughout the
distribution system under the MDD rate plus fire flow conditions (WAC 246-290-230(6)).

Water systems with a single source
The minimum FSS volume for water systems served by a single source of supply is the
product of the required flow rate (expressed in gpm) multiplied by the flow duration
(expressed in minutes). See Equation 7-3.

  Equation 7-3:

                FSS = (FF)( tm )
  Where:



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  179
   FF = Required fire flow rate, expressed in gpm, as specified by fire protection
        authority
   tm = Duration of FF rate, expressed in minutes, as specified by fire protection
        authority

Water systems with multiple sources
Design engineers may justify a reduction of FSS volume based on meeting all of the
following conditions:
   1. Exclude the capacity of the largest producing supply source from the calculations.
   2. Each source of supply (excluding the largest source) is:
       a. Supplied by permanent on-site auxiliary power that starts automatically when
          the primary power feed is disrupted.
       b. Capable of operating for the full duration of the maximum fire at the source’s
          designated flow rate.
   3. Maintain at least 20 psi under needed fire flow plus MDD conditions throughout
      the distribution system for the full duration of the maximum fire.
   4. The engineer obtains the local fire protection authority’s written consent for the
      design approach taken.

Consolidating Standby and Fire Suppression Storage (nesting)
Design engineers may consolidate or nest SB and FSS volumes with the larger of the two
volumes being the minimum available, if the local fire protection authority does not
require them to be additive (see WAC 246-290-235(4)). The reservoir project report must
include the written consent of the local fire protection authority.

Stand Alone Fire Suppression Storage
Supply to a dedicated, stand-alone fire suppression storage tank must be fitted with an
approved air gap (WAC 246-290-490). The rule considers all components downstream of
the air gap nonpotable. Design engineers may not interconnect them with the potable
water system without appropriate cross-connection control. Design engineers should
consult a certified cross-connection control specialist. See Section 6.3.10.

7.1.1.5   Dead Storage
Dead storage (DS) is the volume of stored water not available to all consumers at the
minimum design pressure (WAC 246-290-230(5) and (6)). The reservoir and water
system capacity analysis should clearly identify the DS volume. Dead storage is never
included in a capacity analysis. DS is always below the top of the outlet pipe silt stop. DS
in pumped-storage reservoirs includes the volume below the top of the pump suction
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  180
pipe or the net positive suction head requirement of the withdrawal pumps, whichever is
higher in elevation.

7.1.2      Storage Used for Treatment Purposes
Occasionally, water systems use storage near or adjacent to a source of supply for public
health protection and treatment efficacy including:
       Disinfection contact time.
       Filter backwashing.
       Other treatment purposes.

As a result, water systems may need to maintain certain minimum water volumes in the
reservoir for treatment to be effective. Engineers cannot use the minimum volumes
required for treatment purposes in capacity determinations. These volumes are, in effect,
dead storage. We recommend that treatment reservoirs (clearwells) operate
independent of distribution storage.

When a design uses a reservoir for both distribution storage and disinfection contact
time, engineers cannot use the OS and ES volumes to determine contact time because
water systems routinely use those volumes on a daily basis. Design engineers should
consider the risk that SB and FSS volumes will not be available for contact time. When a
reservoir will provide both storage and disinfection contact time, the design should
clearly identify and justify the basis for the volume of water used for disinfection contact
time, and any associated operational or control requirements and constraints (e.g., level
control and alarms).

7.1.3      Source Definition Used in Sizing New Reservoirs
Engineers may consider any source classified as “permanent” or “seasonal” when
designing new reservoir facilities if the source is continuously available to the water
system and meets, at a minimum, all primary drinking water standards (WAC 246-290-
010, 222(3), and 420(2) and (5)).

“Continuously available to the system” means all of the following:
   1. The source is equipped with functional pumping equipment (and treatment
      equipment, if required).
   2. The system exercises the equipment regularly to ensure its integrity.
   3. Water is available from the source year round.
   4. The source activates automatically based on preset parameters (reservoir level,
      water system pressure, or other conditions).
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   181
For designing new reservoir facilities, we consider the following as sources:
   1. Each pump in a booster pump station (pumps installed in parallel, not series)
      pumping into the zone that particular reservoir serves.
   2. Each independent, parallel treatment train in a water treatment facility.
   3. Each well, or well field comprised of wells, constructed according to the Minimum
      Standards for Construction and Maintenance of Wells (chapter 173-160 WAC)
      and capable of pumping concurrently as justified by actual pump test records.
   4. Each pump installed in a large capacity, large diameter well if the water system
      can take each pump out of service without interrupting the operation of any
      other pump.
   5. An emergency intertie, if it meets all the following conditions:
           It is equipped with an automatic valve.
           There is an intertie agreement that specifically includes provision of SB, FSS, or
            both.
           The supplying and receiving distribution systems have sufficient hydraulic
            capacity to deliver the allocated flow at no less than the minimum pressure
            required by WAC 246-290-230. If the intertie requires booster-pumping
            facilities, then each pump installed in parallel constitutes a source.
   6. A pressure reducing valve between pressure zones within the same water system
      if both of the following is affirmed:
           Adequate volume is available in the upper zone’s storage facilities.
           The distribution system (from the upper zone through the PRV to the end use
            in the lower zone) has the hydraulic capacity to deliver the allocated flows to
            meet or augment peak hour flows or fire flows, at no less than the minimum
            pressure required by WAC 246-290-230.

Design engineers should use the actual installed capacity of the facilities and equipment
when determining physical capacity based on storage requirements.

7.1.4       Storage for Consecutive Water Systems
A “consecutive water system” purchases some or all of its water supply from another
regulated water system (see Section 5.9). A consecutive water system may use the
storage available from the supplying water system to satisfy the requirements of
Chapter 7 if it meets these conditions:




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    182
   1. The wholesale water agreement between the supplying water system and the
      consecutive water system defines the quantity of ES, SB, and FSS the supplying water
      system specifically reserved for the consecutive water system. See Section 5.9.1.
   2. The engineer can demonstrate that both the supplying and consecutive water
      systems can satisfy the hydraulic design criteria described in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.5.
   3. The local fire protection authority approves the amount of FSS allocated for each
      system.

7.1.5      Storage for Noncommunity Water Systems
The storage volumes certain kinds of noncommunity water systems need may be
significantly less than those for community water systems. These types of systems
include:
       RV parks
       Campgrounds
       Fairgrounds
       Outdoor concert grounds
       Restaurants
       Noncritical commercial and institutional uses

For equalizing storage (ES), engineers should follow the approaches outlined in Section
7.1.1.2 to provide 30 psi during PHD under normal operating conditions. They should
follow the guidance in Section 7.1.1 to provide operational storage (OS), fire
suppression storage (FSS), and dead storage (DS).

If a source failure, power failure, or similar loss of water-supply event occurs,
noncommunity water systems could shut down without affecting public health and
welfare. As a result, we have no specific design guidelines for standby storage.

The source capacity for a public water system should be able to satisfy the maximum
day demand (MDD) with no more than 20 hours of pumping. We strongly recommend
against constructing and reserving finished water storage to compensate for supply
capacity less than MDD. However, in rare cases applicable to transient noncommunity
water systems with relatively few days of demand in excess of source capacity, it may be
appropriate to use storage to meet MDD.

Design engineers should consider the effects of a relatively large storage volume held
for a long period to compensate for supply capacity less than MDD. Such large volumes
may lead to water quality issues associated with stagnant water including the loss of

chlorine residual, biological growth in the reservoir, and the formation of disinfection
byproducts. See Section 7.6.



7.2       Geometry, Elevation, and Integration with Existing and
          Future Facilities
The operation of a finished water storage reservoir should be compatible with the
unique features of the water system’s sources, booster pumps, transmission and
distribution piping, and service area topography. Incorrectly siting a reservoir may result
in the full reservoir capacity being unavailable to the system (e.g., operating elevation
too high so it doesn’t fill, or too low and requiring an altitude valve to hydraulically
isolate the tank from the water system).

Selecting tank geometry is also important to maintaining water quality. Improper tank
geometry may prevent adequate mixing or promote thermal stratification (e.g., tanks
that are much taller than they are wide with a single inlet or outlet demonstrate
significant stratification. See Section 7.6.

7.2.1     Establishing Overflow Elevations
When establishing overflow elevations for reservoirs designed to provide gravity water
service, consider:
   1. Consistency with other facilities and plans
      The tank overflow elevation should be consistent with other storage facilities the
      water system uses or plans to use. The design engineer should consider the
      overflow elevation of existing or proposed facilities at other nearby water systems
      if there are or might be gravity interties.
   2. Consistency with pressure requirements and limits
      The tank overflow elevation should be consistent with pressure requirements and
      pressure limitations within the existing and future water-service area. The design
      engineer should consult elevation data in addition to information received from
      the water system hydraulic analysis described in Section 6.1.
   3. Consistency with source capacity
      Design engineers should evaluate tank elevation and tank geometry with source
      equipment discharge-head characteristics to ensure sources meet our source
      capacity requirements.
   4. Maintaining levels
      Use altitude valves to prevent over-filling reservoirs constructed with different
      overflow elevations within the same pressure zone.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     184
The overflow elevation should be far enough above the pump-off control level to
remove any risk of regular overflow occurring during routine reservoir operations.
Similarly, there should be sufficient “freeboard” space between the maximum water
surface elevation during the design peak overflow and the wall-to-roof joint.

In very cold climates, ice formation may threaten reservoirs. The overflow should be far
enough above the pump-off level so that ice cannot block its function, especially
because ice formation might affect the pump-reservoir level control system. See Section
7.4.4 for additional overflow design guidance.



7.3       Location and Site Considerations
Deciding where to construct a new reservoir can be a difficult design consideration.
Many competing factors and interests may come into play, with each influencing cost,
operability, and maintainability. Some may even influence project feasibility. The project
report should adequately discuss site considerations, including:
   1. Parcel size sufficient to build and maintain the facility, and to construct future
      storage to meet projected growth, if needed.
   2. Zoning compliance, building code compliance, and community acceptance.
   3. Distance to the existing distribution and transmission system.
   4. Integration or connectivity with existing SCADA system.
   5. SEPA analysis (if over 0.5 million gallons).
   6. Need for new distribution and transmission pipelines to meet pressure standards.
   7. Existing ground-surface elevation and site drainage.
   8. Site vehicle access.
   9. Disposal of reservoir overflow.
   10. Geotechnical engineering field investigations including:
       a. Site drainage.
       b. Foundation design requirements.
       c. Soil type and soil-bearing strength.
       d. Groundwater table elevation.
       e. Soil stability, liquefaction, or slope failure analysis.
   11. Availability of Power.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     185
7.3.1      Natural Hazard Considerations
Natural hazards and disasters could damage reservoirs and may even cause catastrophic
failure. Engineers should site reservoirs to minimize vulnerability to damage from natural
disasters, such as:
       Avalanche
       Earthquake
       Flood
       Landslide
       Tree fall
       Tsunami
       Windstorm

To meet state and local requirements, engineers must address geologic risk (seismic
and unstable slopes) when designing reservoirs (WAC 246-290-200). Engineers can use
the Washington State Department of Natural Resources’ (DNR) geologic hazard maps to
identify seismic and other natural hazards. DNR contact information is in Appendix C.

Engineers should prioritize making reservoirs that serve water for essential services
earthquake-resilient, so that they continue to serve water after seismic events. Engineers
should follow the guidance in ASCE 7 while designing reservoirs for medical facilities;
power plants; fuel refining, storage, and distribution facilities; food production, storage,
and distribution facilities; emergency response command and communication centers;
and emergency shelters.

Engineers can reduce or mitigate seismic risk by:
       Being aware of permanent ground displacement or intense ground shaking
        intensity (e.g., in fault zones) that may affect the reservoir and designing the
        reservoir to accommodate these hazards
       Installing valves water systems can use to prevent tanks and reservoirs from
        completely draining if there is excessive pipeline damage. You should coordinate
        isolation strategies that may limit or prevent water conveyance with the fire
        department.
       Using flexible couplings on pipelines connected between elements that may
        move differentially (such as buried piping connected to a tank or reservoir).

Various design guidelines highlight the multiple seismic vulnerabilities of reservoirs (ALA
2001; AWWA 2011b). In areas with the potential for significant ground motion, design

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     186
engineers may need to seek the services of a qualified geotechnical engineer or other
professional qualified to assist in the design.



7.4        Construction Materials and Design Elements
The basic design concept (standpipe versus in-ground; vendor-purchased plastic
product versus constructed in-place) and the materials the design engineer chooses to
construct the reservoir directly affects the function, reliability, operability, and integrity
of the facility. Engineers construct the vast majority of reservoirs are with reinforced
concrete or steel. AWWA offers detailed standards for steel and reinforced concrete
reservoirs:
      D-100: Welded Carbon Steel Tanks for Water Storage (AWWA 2011b)
      D-103: Factory-Coated Carbon Steel Tanks for Water Storage (AWWA 2009a)
      D-110: Wire- and Strand-Wound Circular Prestressed Concrete Water Tanks
       (AWWA 2004)
      D-115: Tendon-Prestressed Concrete Water Tanks (AWWA 2006)

A new reservoir is expensive to build and, depending on the type of reservoir, can be
expensive to maintain. Water systems will count on the reservoir for reliable service for
decades. Design engineers must identify operations and maintenance requirements and
their associated cost over the life of the reservoir when evaluating design alternatives
(WAC 246-290-110(4)). The least expensive alternative to construct may require a
significant level of maintenance and a short asset life, resulting in the costliest
alternative on a life-cycle cost basis.

The design engineer must evaluate the water system’s technical, managerial, and
financial capacity to properly operate and maintain the new reservoir (WAC 246-290-
110(4)), and ensure the new reservoir continuously functions to provide safe and reliable
drinking water to the public.

Certain reservoir design concepts, such as those listed below, pose specific contaminant
risks including lack of resilience, construction gaps, bird and animal infestation,
contamination by chemical wood preservatives, joint and seal failure, cracking, and
embrittlement (e.g., ultraviolet light, heat or cold, or chemical degradation). In addition,
these designs may not lend themselves to installing all the proper appurtenances
necessary for effective reservoir operation and maintenance (see Section 7.4.2). We
recommend against pursuing any of the following concepts for new reservoir designs.
      Wood stave tanks.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      187
      Corrugated or other thin wall metal silos commonly used for grain storage.
      Concrete basin – wood truss roof tanks.
      Floating roof or covers.
      Precast panels used as finished storage roofing.
      Plastic or polyethylene tanks.
      Retrofitting existing reservoirs with plastic, interior liners.

Regardless of the construction material and design concept, all reservoir submittals
must include the site-specific design information required in chapter 246-290 WAC, Part
3. Some circumstances justify the design engineer calling for the vendor or contractor to
submit shop drawings for various construction and/or appurtenant details. If so,
engineers must submit the vendor’s or contractor’s shop drawings to DOH for review
and approval before the engineer and the water system approve them (WAC 246-290-
120). Additional guidance on site-specific design requirements appears throughout this
chapter.

7.4.1     Partially Buried and Underground Reservoirs
Special design considerations for partially buried and below-grade reservoirs improve
water system reliability and prevent contamination of stored water. Engineers should
consider backup power supplies, grading surrounding soils, and other design aspects
described in the following sections.

The following recommendations apply to partially buried and underground reservoirs:
   1. Locate outside the 100-year flood plain.
   2. Water systems should grade the area to a distance of at least 50 feet surrounding
      a partially buried or below-grade reservoir to prevent standing water near the
      reservoir.
   3. When the reservoir bottom is below the normal ground surface, it should be
      above the groundwater table. If this is not possible, special design considerations
      should include providing perimeter foundation drains to daylight and exterior
      tank sealants. These are necessary to keep groundwater from entering the tank
      and to protect the reservoir from potential flotation forces when the tank is
      empty.
   4. Partially buried or underground reservoirs should be at least 50 feet from sanitary
      sewers, drains, standing water, and similar sources of possible contamination. If
      gravity sewers are within 50 feet of the reservoir, engineers should use the same

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                188
        type of pipe used for water mains. These pipelines should be pressure tested
        according to AWWA or WSDOT/APWA standards for water mains.
   5. Engineers should remove nearby trees and large vegetation to a distance of at
      least 50 feet for buried or partially buried concrete reservoirs to prevent root
      penetration. They also should secure easements to allow grounds maintenance
      and periodic tree removal.
   6. The top of the reservoir should be at least 2 feet above normal ground surface,
      unless special design considerations address maintenance issues and prevent
      surface contamination.

7.4.2      Piping and Appurtenances - General
Engineers should design all reservoir appurtenances to be water tight and safe from
freezing and ice damage, which will interfere with proper functioning (such as tank level
controls, riser pipes, overflows, and atmospheric vents). Engineers must design these
appurtenances to prevent entry by birds, animals, insects, excessive dust, and other
potential sources of external contamination (WAC 246-290-235(1)).

Engineers should use seismically appropriate pipe materials and pipe joints for all pipes
located within the reservoir, directly below the reservoir, and within 20 feet outside of
the reservoir foundation. Engineers should evaluate these pipelines for corrosion
potential and install corrosion mitigation, as appropriate. These pipelines will be difficult
and expensive to repair or replace after the reservoir is in place. The location of the inlet
and outlet pipes can also affect the quality of the stored water (See Section 7.6).

Design engineers should provide design information for the following reservoir
appurtenances. See Appendix A.3.5 for reservoir design submittal checklist.

7.4.3      Reservoir Drains
Reservoir designs must include drain facilities that drain to daylight or an approved
alternative that is adequate to prevent cross-connection contamination (WAC 246-290-
235(1)). The facility should be able to drain the full contents of the tank without water
entering the distribution system or causing erosion at the drainage outlet. Any
connection to storm sewers or sanitary sewers must have a properly designed air gap or
other feature to prevent cross contamination. Drain lines may discharge directly to a
dedicated dry well if the drywell design and construction protect against backflow into
the reservoir or distribution system.

Other design considerations:
       Drainage discharge should not threaten the integrity of the reservoir foundation.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    189
       If the topography makes a drain to daylight unrealistic, the reservoir design
        should include another way to empty the reservoir completely, such as a sump
        pump.
       The reservoir drain should be separate from the outlet pipe to minimize the risk
        of a cross connection and prevent sediment from entering the distribution
        system.
       Establish an easement for drainage path (if applicable).

7.4.4      Reservoir Overflows
The reservoir overflow must be capable of discharging the full inlet supply potential
without surcharging the reservoir roof (see Section 7.2.1). The following factors will
determine the height that water reaches above the overflow invert or weir elevation:
       The design overflow rate.
       Size, location, and configuration of the reservoir overflow inlet.
       Overflow pipe diameter, length, and slope.
       Overflow outlet facilities.

Every reservoir design must include an overflow pipe with atmospheric discharge and
suitable means to prevent cross-connection contamination (WAC 246-290-235(1)).
Poorly protected and maintained overflow pipes are often a route for contamination of
reservoirs (AWWA and EES, Inc. 2002; NRC 2005). Key design features to minimize the
risk that birds, insects, and other sources of contaminants enter reservoirs through
overflow pipes:
   Properly screened or otherwise secured. To prevent the entry of insects, birds, and
   other sources of contamination, the overflow discharge outlet must have a
   corrosion-resistant 24-mesh screen or a securely closing mechanical device, such as
   a duckbill valve, or both (WAC 246-290-235(1)). In addition, the overflow design
   needs to protect against vandalism, hydraulic restrictions on mechanical devices such
   as duckbill valves, clogging by debris and ice, and the force of hydraulic loads on the
   screening or mechanical device an overflow event might cause. To provide structural
   strength to the 24-mesh screen, we recommend that a 4-mesh screen be used as
   support. The 4-mesh screen should be made of stainless steel wire at least 0.047
   inches in diameter. The overflow outlet may need to be oversized to account for flow
   restrictions caused by the 24-mesh screen.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   190
   Easy to observe and maintain. Overflow lines should extend downward to an
   elevation of 12 to 24 inches above ground level and discharge into a splash plate,
   rocked area, or suitably above the grate of a catch basin.
   Protected against cross connections. Any connection to a storm drain or sanitary
   sewer must include an air gap or other feature to prevent cross contamination (WAC
   246-290-235(1)).

Other design considerations:
       Overflow discharge should not threaten the integrity of the reservoir foundation.
       The overflow and reservoir drain may share a single discharge.
       Establish an easement for overflow drainage path (if applicable).

7.4.5      Reservoir Atmospheric Vents
Every reservoir design must include an atmospheric vent (WAC 246-290-235(1)). An
overflow may not serve as an atmospheric vent. Poorly designed and maintained vents
and screens are often a route for contamination of reservoirs (AWWA and EES, Inc. 2002;
NRC 2005). Key design features for reservoir vents include:
   1. Proper screening to prevent entry of contaminants.
   2. Properly secured and sealed to the structure to prevent entry of contaminants.
   3. Properly hooded to prevent entry of contaminants.
   4. Easy to observe and maintain.
   5. Maintain acceptable internal tank pressure under all possible operating conditions.

Properly screened
Acceptable design approaches include covering the screened area with a 4-mesh
corrosion-resistant screen backed with a 24-mesh corrosion-resistant insect screen, or
approved equal. To provide structural strength to the screen, we recommend the 4-
mesh screen material be at least 0.047 inches in diameter and constructed of stainless
steel or other noncorrodible metal.

Properly secured
The vent-roof connection and the vent structure itself should be strong enough to
withstand the design wind speed for which the overall reservoir structure was designed.
We recommend connecting the vent to the roof with a bolted pipe flange or welded
saddle. Vent openings should never be used to facilitate water level measurement or be
installed as an integral part of the roof hatch access structure.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  191
Properly hooded
Vent design must prevent the entry of precipitation that contacts any surface that may
be contaminated (e.g., bird feces) (WAC 246-290-235). Examples of unacceptable vent
designs include those with the potential for allowing:
      Animals to nest directly on the vent screen.
      Rain splatter off the roof to enter the reservoir vent (e.g., roof vent with screened
       opening only a few inches above the roof without an adequate “hood” over the
       vented area).
      Roof run-off to enter the vent (e.g., screened opening at the roofline).
      Rain falling through the vent opening (e.g., turbine roof ventilators).

Eliminating the risk of precipitation entering the reservoir may provide some basic
protection against vandalism. Certain reservoir vent designs provide strong barriers
against vandalism, such as those with extensive and resilient hoods, multiple screens,
and rigid structural design.

Easy to observe, access, and maintain
Screened openings should be observable, to confirm the integrity of the screen fully
protecting the reservoir from contamination. To reduce maintenance, all vent
components should be constructed of corrosion-resistant materials.

Maintain acceptable internal tank pressure
In addition to preventing contamination, the screened vent opening should be high
enough above the roof to prevent blockage by accumulated ice and snow. We
recommend every part of the screened vent opening be at least 24 inches above the
roof (or covering earth) for partially buried and underground reservoirs, and at least 12
inches above the roof for an elevated tank with controlled access.

The design engineer should ensure enough vent capacity to limit the pressure drop
(during tank draw) and pressure increase (during tank fill) under all operating conditions
so that internal tank pressure remains within the manufacturer’s design limits. Large
welded steel tanks are most vulnerable to structural damage from inadequate venting.
But the design engineer must ensure all tank types, including rigid bolted steel,
fiberglass, and concrete tanks have adequate ventilation under fill and draw conditions
to avoid the risk of drawing in groundwater or stagnant roof water (WAC 246-290-
235(1)).

The design engineer should obtain from the vent manufacturer a flow rate versus
pressure drop (in inches of water) curve. This curve should be used to estimate the
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   192
pressure drop at the worst case outflow condition (e.g., broken transmission main). The
resulting drop in internal pressure should be within the design limits for the tank. If the
tank manufacturer did not specify design limits (e.g., cast-in-place concrete reservoir),
we recommend a design pressure drop of no more than one inch of water (0.033 psi or
about 5 psf).

Designers should provide a pressure-vacuum-screened vent or a separate pressure-
vacuum-relief mechanism on tanks vulnerable to structural damage (e.g., steel tanks) in
case snow, ice, frost, or another substance blocks the screen (AWWA, 2011b).

See Sanitary Protection of Reservoirs - Vents DOH 331-250 for guidance on reservoir
vents.

7.4.6     Access Hatches
All reservoirs must be equipped with a weather-tight hatch sized for human entry (WAC
246-290-235(1)(c)). Except for reservoirs that can be isolated from the distribution
system without disrupting consumer service, the access hatch should be installed on the
roof, thus allowing access while the tank remains in service. A roof hatch should be
framed at least four inches above the surface of the roof at the opening, fitted with a
solid weather-tight cover that overlaps the frame opening and extends down around
the frame at least two inches, hinged on one side, and lockable from the side (not top)
of the cover. There should be a durable gasket at the point of contact between the
hatch cover and hatch frame.

For partially buried and underground reservoirs, the roof access hatch should be
constructed at least 24 inches above the top of the roof or covering earth, whichever is
higher. See Ten State Standards, WAC 246-290-200.

We caution design engineers on the use of “gutter” style hatches. Typically constructed
on a raised concrete curb, these hatches have an internal gutter beneath the cover that
drains to an external outlet. The cover system itself is not waterproof. A noncorrodible
screen should cover the drain outlet, to prevent animals or insects from entering the
internal gutter. The gutter and screen should be cleaned on a regular basis; otherwise
drainage may back up into the internal gutter and spill over into the reservoir. These
types of hatches must be well constructed and maintained (i.e., include maintenance in
reservoir standard operating procedures) to minimize the risk of contamination (WAC
46-290-235(1)).




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   193
See Sanitary Protection of Reservoirs - Hatches DOH 331-249 for guidance on reservoir
hatches.

7.4.7     Roof Drainage
The reservoir roof should be well drained. The reservoir roof should slope at least 2
percent (¼-vertical-inch per horizontal foot). To avoid possible contamination,
downspout pipes must not enter or pass through the reservoir (WAC 246-290-490).

7.4.8     Reservoir Security
Design engineers should apply a multilayered strategy to protect reservoirs and other
water system facilities:
   1. Deter: Perimeter fencing is a common means of deterrence. If the reservoir site
      looks hard to break into, most trespassers will move on to a more easily
      accessible site.
   2. Detect: Video surveillance, intrusion monitors, and other sensors signal
      unauthorized access to a facility.
   3. Delay: Layers of gates, locks, and perimeter fencing make it more difficult for an
      unauthorized person to gain entrance.
   4. Respond: Detection and delay technologies should communicate with each
      other, and the responders. Security guards and local law enforcement often
      respond to unauthorized intrusions. It can help to have a solid relationship with
      responders, so they understand the importance of water system facilities.

Detailed guidelines on specific physical security features are available (ASCE 2004; ASCE
2006; Oregon Health Authority 2009). These guidance documents provide design
recommendations to improve security at reservoirs and other water system facilities.



7.5       Operational Constraints and Considerations
Every new reservoir design should meet all applicable Occupational Safety and Health
Act (OSHA) and Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA) requirements,
especially fall protection issues such as ladders, guardrails, and safety devices. Engineers
also should consider the following reservoir construction and operational issues:
   1. Disposal of chlorinated water after construction and disinfection.
   2. Disposal of tank drain-line outflow and tank overflow stream.
   3. Effect on water system operation when the new reservoir is taken off-line for
      maintenance or cleaning.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   194
The Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) is the state agency that implements
WISHA workplace safety standards. L&I contact information is in Appendix C.
7.5.1    Reservoir Valves
The reservoir design must include a way to isolate the tank for maintenance (WAC 246-
290-235(1)). Engineers can meet this requirement by providing an isolation valve(s) on
the reservoir inlet and outlet piping. In addition, there must be a combination air-
release/vacuum-relief valve on the distribution side of the outlet piping isolation valve if
there is no other atmospheric reservoir in the pressure zone to keep negative pressure
from building in the distribution system (WAC 246-290-490) when the outlet valve is
closed.

7.5.2     Reservoir Level Control
All new reservoirs should have a control system to maintain reservoir water levels within
a preset operating range (OS). Design engineers should include the normal high- and
low-water surface elevations that define this operating range in the design. The water
system should install a high- and low-level alarm system to notify operation personnel
directly.

Cable-supported float switches are vulnerable to ice damage, which can render them
inoperable. Where potential freezing conditions exist, design engineers should evaluate
alternate ways to control and monitor the tank level.

7.5.3     Backup Power Facilities
We recommend that water systems operating pumped storage reservoirs (reservoirs
that can only supply a distribution system in whole or in part through a booster pump
station) have onsite backup power facilities. See Chapter 8 for booster-pump design
guidelines. We recommend backup power facilities that start through an automatic
transfer switch if a power supply interruption occurs. A manual transfer may be sufficient
if it can occur within a reasonable time according to established operating procedures.
Maintaining pressurized conditions in the distribution system during a power outage
minimizes the risk of backflow or cross connection contamination.

7.6       Reservoir Water Quality and Sampling Access
Long detention times and inadequate mixing can degrade water quality in reservoirs.
Stagnant conditions provide an opportunity for chemical and microbial contamination
of the stored water. Therefore, engineers must design distribution reservoirs to maintain
water circulation, prevent stagnation and, in some cases, provide disinfection contact
time (WAC 246-290-235(1)).
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   195
For reservoirs with a nominal residence time of 3 to 5 days during the summer, design
engineers should conduct a mixing and water age analysis of the proposed reservoir
design, such as computational fluid dynamic modeling. Such modeling will guide on the
design of inlet-outlet piping and valves, as well as setting operational levels. Chemical
contamination also can occur in newly constructed reservoirs and those with protective
coatings. See Appendix G.

Reservoirs must include access for water quality monitoring (WAC 246-290-235(1)(c)).
At a minimum, this access should include a smooth-nosed sample tap on the reservoir
side of the reservoir isolation valve(s). This valve will facilitate sample collection after
construction and maintenance, and as part of a system assessment after detecting
contaminants or vandalism. In addition, design engineers should consider providing the
means to conduct water quality monitoring at the inlet and within the reservoir,
including on-line measurement of chlorine residual, pH, and temperature, where
feasible. Temperature probes and piping to collect samples at various reservoir depths
provide operational capacity to monitor reservoir water quality (Friedman et al. 2005).

We recommend installing a sample tap in the valve vault on the tank side of the
isolation valve.

7.6.1      Water Circulation and Stagnation
Poor water circulation and long detention times in reservoirs can lead to loss of
disinfectant residual, microbial growth, sediment accumulation, formation of disinfection
byproducts, taste and odor problems, and other water quality issues (AWWA and EES
2002; NRC 2005). A properly designed reservoir can minimize the potential for these
problems.

Engineers should evaluate the following design features to improve reservoir water
quality:
   1. Orient inlet and outlet to promote mixing. Poorly mixed reservoirs can lead to
      stagnant zones where the water age exceeds the average water age in the facility.
      A properly designed inlet promotes mixing. Water entering the reservoir can
      create a jet that entrains ambient water effectively mixing the reservoir (Grayman
      and Kirmeyer 2000). For effective mixing, the inlet flow must be turbulent and
      have a long enough path for mixing to develop. You should consider the ability
      to provide long fill and draw cycles, and thus promote reservoir mixing, as part of
      the design process.
        Reservoirs that float on the water system, especially those with single inlet-outlet
        designs, probably won’t have sufficient inflow to mix the reservoir adequately.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   196
        Special valve arrangements, using one or more check valves on a single inlet-
        outlet pipe, can be used to promote mixing. Some reservoirs may need specialty
        mixers to prevent stagnation.
   2. Minimize temperature differences in the reservoir. Temperature differences as
      small as 1°C can cause thermal stratification, especially in tall tanks with large
      diameter inlets located near the bottom. To decrease the potential for thermal
      stratification, locate the inlet off the bottom of the reservoir and increase the inlet
      momentum (defined as velocity times flow rate). To increase inlet momentum,
      decrease the diameter of the inlet pipe. Longer fill cycles also promote mixing by
      increasing the time for circulation patterns to develop.
   3. Increase the frequency of reservoir turnover. Although not an absolute
      standard for stored water, there is a high risk for water quality problems to
      develop when reservoir turnover time exceeds five days, especially in warmer
      months. As a starting point, complete turnover of reservoir water should occur at
      least every three to five days (Kirmeyer et al. 1999).
   4. Site reservoir to promote turnover. Reservoirs located at the edge of a
      pressure zone, or beyond, have longer detention times than those within the
      pressure zone (Edwards and Maher 2008). Distribution system models that
      evaluate water age and water system hydraulics can be useful in evaluating
      reservoir sites.
   5. Evaluate other engineering considerations. Temperature gradients in the
      stored water cause thermal stratification. For this reason, some water systems
      apply light or reflective protective coatings to the tops of their reservoirs. Tall,
      narrow standpipes are more prone to thermal stratification than reservoirs with
      roughly equal height and diameter (Grayman and Kirmeyer 2000).

7.6.2      Tank Materials in Contact with Potable Water
All additives, coatings and compounds that will substantially contact drinking water,
such as those listed below, must have ANSI/NSF Standard 61 certification (WAC 246-
290-220). Contractors should apply these materials carefully, according the
manufacturer’s recommendations. To avoid unnecessary public health concerns and
consumer complaints on aesthetic qualities, the design engineer should address the
following concerns:
   1. For concrete tanks, use appropriate form-release agents, concrete surface
      sealants, and admixtures. See Appendix G for guidance on water quality concerns
      associated with concrete in contact with potable water.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   197
   2. For steel tanks, consider the materials used to prepare the surface of the tank,
      and the painting or coating water systems used to protect against corrosion.
      Engineers should provide cathodic protection as necessary (especially for
      underground or partially buried tank installations).
   3. Reservoir membrane liners, plastic tanks, fiberglass tanks, or other materials that
      substantially contact drinking water must be ANSI/NSF Standard 61 certified
      (WAC 246-290-220).
   4. It is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when applying protective
      coatings. Temperature, ventilation, and the thickness of the applied layers affect
      the time required to cure coatings and the potential for contaminants to leach
      into the water. If there is any concern over the curing of the coatings and
      materials, or leaching from the reservoir liner, we may require additional water
      quality monitoring from the reservoir before it goes into service. Appendix G
      includes additional guidance on testing materials that leach.



7.7       Placing a Reservoir into Service
Before placing a reservoir into service, it must be properly tested, inspected, and
disinfected (WAC 246-290-120(4)). The specifications for the reservoir design should
clearly identify:
   1. Curing of coatings. All coatings in contact with potable water must be certified
      under ANSI/NSF Standard 61 (WAC 246-290-220). A plural component coating,
      or a 100 percent solids coating, may be able to be disinfected and placed back
      into service within 48 hours. Other coating systems typically need at least 7 days
      and likely more time to cure, depending on temperature, humidity, and air
      movement within the reservoir prior to disinfection. You will need to verify that
      the requirements for drying time listed on the manufacturer’s product data sheet
      that are needed to achieve curing are met (ANSI/AWWA D102-17). Following
      disinfection, you should conduct additional water quality testing (AWWA 2011a;
      Ten State Standards 2012). This water quality testing includes analyses for taste,
      odors, VOCs, pH, and conductivity to make sure water is palatable and meets
      drinking water standards before serving it to customers.
   2. Disinfection and bacteriological testing requirements. There are a few
      different standard approaches for disinfecting a reservoir, such as filling the
      reservoir with chlorinated water so that, at the end of the soak period, the system
      can maintain a chlorine residual of at least 10 mg/L. Another approach is to spray
      all surfaces with a solution containing at least 200 mg/L of available chlorine as
      described in AWWA C652 Standard for Disinfection of Water Storage Facilities

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   198
       (AWWA 2011a). At the end of the disinfection period and after chlorine residuals
       return to acceptable concentrations for distribution, the water system must
       collect and analyze a coliform sample (WAC 246-290-120(4)). If coliform are
       present, additional disinfection and bacteriological testing will be necessary.
   3. Leakage testing. Standards for leak testing reservoirs and reservoir roofs vary
      depending on the type of material used to construct the reservoir (AWWA 2004;
      AWWA 2006; AWWA 2009a; AWWA 2011b). Regardless of the materials used in
      construction, engineers should identify specific methods for testing and criteria
      for passing.

Only after the reservoir has been cleaned, tested, and disinfected, and testing results
shows that the water quality from it is acceptable may it be placed into service. Water
systems must submit a Construction Completion Report Form (DOH 331-121) to DOH
within 60 days after they complete a reservoir project and before they place the
reservoir into service (WAC 246-290-120(5)).

Chapter 8: Booster Pump Station Design

8.0       Introduction
Many water systems need booster pumping facilities to maintain adequate pressure due
to treatment, topography, or high design flows. In these water systems, booster pumps
are an integral part of the distribution system—like the water mains—that must be
adequate and reliable. Inadequate or unreliable booster pumping facilities leave a water
system vulnerable to inadequate pressure, customer complaints, and a distribution
system at risk of contamination.

Booster pumps work with pressure tanks, reservoirs, variable frequency drives, and
control valves to maintain a consistent pressure range in the distribution system. This
chapter describes requirements for minimal design pressures and reliability standards
(WAC 246-290-230 and 420) and offers design guidance on booster pump station:
      Pumping system capacity.
      Location and site considerations.
      Material selection, piping, and appurtenances.

The objective of booster pump station design is to provide the water system with
adequate and resilient water pumping facilities that protect the quality of water in the
distribution system while delivering needed supply to consumers over a wide range of
operating conditions. To protect public health, it is important to consider each booster
pump design element thoroughly, follow appropriate construction standards, and
implement best management and operating practices.



8.1       Booster Pump Station Capacity
In general, the booster pump station, and any other supplies to the zone—wells, other
pressure zones, and storage reservoirs—must be able to meet minimum demand and
pressure requirements (WAC 246-290-230(5) and (6)). The demand conditions include
the maximum daily demand (MDD), peak hourly demand (PHD), and fire flow for the
area the pump station serves, and the supplying pressure zone(s). See Chapter 3 for
guidance on estimating demand.

One of the key factors in sizing a booster pump station is the storage available in the
pressure zone the booster pump station serves. If there is gravity storage in the pressure
zone, this manual calls the zone an open system because there is a water surface open
to the atmosphere. If there is no finished water reservoir in the pressure zone, this

manual calls that part of the distribution system a closed system. The process of sizing
booster pump stations for open and closed systems varies slightly as described in the
following subsections.

We recommend that engineers design booster-pumping facilities to accommodate at
least the next 10 years of water system development, and preferably, the period
associated with full water system build-out for its service area. Variable frequency drive
pumps are particularly well suited to accommodate growth (see Appendix B.3).

Each reservoir overflow should be able to discharge the combined pumping capacity of
all sources without damage to the reservoir or downstream property. An open system
booster-pump station is a source of supply to a reservoir. Design engineers should
ensure existing reservoir overflow capacity could safely discharge the added supply from
the new or expanded pump station.



8.1.1         Open System Booster Pump Station Sizing Guidelines
For open systems with adequate equalizing storage, the minimum discharge capacity of
the booster pump station(s)—plus the supply from other sources—is at least the MDD
of the pressure zone and any sequential zones served (WAC 246-290-230). In addition, a
booster pump station must not create low pressure in any supplying zone during peak
demand periods such as when fighting fires (WAC 246-290-420). Table 8-1 summarizes
specific design requirements.

If an open booster pump station is the sole supply to a pressure zone, the pump station
design must supply the MDD of the pressure zone(s) with all pumps in service (WAC
246-290-230), and should be able to supply the average day demand (ADD) with the
largest pump out of service. If multiple sources supply a pressure zone, consider all of
them when assessing the size and number of pumps needed to satisfy the MDD and
ADD standard described above. If the booster pump station is a critical part of the water
system, the engineer should consider designing additional mechanical redundancy and
hydraulic capacity into the pump station.

8.1.2      Closed System Booster Pump Station Sizing Guidelines
The pumps in a closed system booster pump station supply the entire flow and pressure
the service area requires. Because state rules require the water system to provide PHD at
no less than 30 psi at all service connections throughout the distribution system, the
engineer must design a closed system pump station to meet this requirement (WAC
246-290-230(5)).

For reliability purposes, the booster pump station should be able to meet the PHD when
the largest capacity booster pump is out of service. Because the service area of a closed
system pump station depends entirely on the continuing operation of the pump station,
the engineer must consider standby power facilities (WAC 246-290-420). In addition, a
closed system pump station must be able to meet the fire flow requirements the local
fire marshal defined. Where fire flow is required, the pumping system must be able to
maintain a minimum of 20 psi at ground level at all points in the distribution system
while supplying MDD plus needed fire flow (WAC 246-290-230(6)). Table 8-2
summarizes these design requirements.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                                            204
8.1.3     Fire Flow Requirements for Pump Stations in Coordination Act Areas
New booster pump stations in an area governed by the Public Water System
Coordination Act (Chapter 246-293 WAC), must be able to meet fire flow with the
largest capacity booster pump out of service (WAC 246-293-660(1)). Open-system
booster pump stations can use reservoir storage in the pressure zone supplied to meet
fire flow requirements. The remaining pumps, in conjunction with supply from the
reservoir, must be able to maintain a minimum of 20 psi at ground level at all points in
the distribution system while supplying MDD plus needed fire flow (WAC 246-290-
230(6)).

In general, you should be cautious using a closed booster pump station if fire flow is
required because a closed booster pump station is less reliable than gravity storage. A
new booster pump station serving a closed system should be designed with back-up
power operated by an automatic transfer switch if power outages exceed the threshold
standards in WAC 246-293-660(1).

8.1.4     Flow Control for Booster Pump Stations
There are often wide variations in diurnal demand in the pressure zone(s) served by a
pump station. There are several ways to meet these demand fluctuations, including:

Constant speed pumps with pressure tanks. This design approach is most often used
for small, closed pressure zones. In these pump stations, pressure switches start and
stop the pumps as demand increases and decreases. Pressure tanks maintain system
pressure within a fixed range and limit pump cycling. Additional information on sizing
pressure tanks with constant speed pumps is in Chapter 9.

Variable frequency drives (VFDs). This design approach offers many advantages,
including energy savings, improved pressure and flow control, and elimination of
pressure transients associated with abrupt start/stop of single-speed pumps. Flow
control is provided through a feedback loop from a pressure sensor on the pump
discharge to the VFD controller governing pump motor rotational speed (and therefore
flow). See Appendix B.3 for more information on VFDs. For closed booster pump
stations, a pressure tank still is necessary to minimize pump cycling under very low flow
conditions.

A jockey pump for low flow conditions. Designers can use a small pump, commonly
called a “jockey pump,” to meet demand during low flow conditions. Water systems use
a jockey pump with larger pumps to meet peak demands. For closed booster pump
stations, a pressure tank still is necessary to minimize pump cycling.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  205
Cycle control valves with a pressure tank. These specialized pressure regulating valves
keep a constant downstream pressure over a wide range of flows. A pressure tank still is
required for closed pressure zones served by pumps stations that use these valves to
accommodate the need for pump cycling control under very low flow conditions.
Additional information on cycle control valves is in Appendix B.2.



8.2       General Booster Pump Station Site Considerations
Booster pump station designs must comply with state or locally adopted building,
mechanical, electrical, and land use codes (WAC 246-290-200(b)). The contents of these
codes, not to mention local ordinances, exceed the scope of this manual. Overall, you
should review locally adopted codes and ordinances that could affect the siting and
design of a booster pump station in a project report. These considerations include, but
are not limited to:
      Zoning compliance, building code compliance, and community acceptance.
       Noise can be an issue for pump stations located near parks or residences. The
       maximum permitted sound level can be as low as 45 dBA in residential areas at
       night (WAC 173-60-040).
      Operator access, equipment maintenance, and safety. The pumps and other
       mechanical equipment need periodic maintenance. As such, the pump station
       design should make it easy to inspect, operate, and maintain the equipment:
       o Beware of creating permit-required confined spaces. Booster pump stations in
         below grade vaults or other permit-required confined spaces (defined in
         Chapter 296-809 WAC) can create operations and maintenance issues. See
         Appendix C for Department of Labor and Industries contact information.
       o Provide adequate space around mechanical equipment and electrical
         equipment. We recommend at least 36 inches clearance between piping,
         pumps, and other mechanical equipment. Electrical codes govern the
         minimum clearance in front of electrical panels; these clearances are at least
         36 inches and can be 60 inches or more for high voltage panels (Sanks et al.
         1998; AWWA/ASCE 2012).
       o Facilitate removing and installing heavy valves and equipment. Any piece of
         equipment that weighs more than 100 pounds should be accessible by crane
         or other lifting assistance. Other means of access include large doorways or
         roof hatches to facilitate removing heavy equipment directly into a truck.
         Areas where the operator will walk or perform maintenance should be clear of
         overhead obstructions to a height of at least 7 feet (Sanks et al.1998).

       o Hearing protection and other measures to protect people in the pump station
         is required when the noise exceeds 85 dBA (Chapter 296-817 WAC).
      Geotechnical engineering field investigations, including:
       o Site drainage
       o Soil type and soil-bearing strength
       o Groundwater table elevation
       o Soil stability, liquefaction, and/or slope failure analysis
      Electrical power supply
       o Reliability: Engineers should assess the reliability of the power supply and the
         need for standby generators. See Section 5.11.1.
       o Sizing: While deciding where to site very large pump stations and pump
         stations in rural areas, engineers should consider the capacity of the electrical
         grid and the need for required upgrades in the local electrical service.

Engineers should address many other items as part of pump station design. See
additional items highlighted in Checklist A.3.6 in Appendix A.

8.2.1     Natural Hazard Considerations
Natural disasters could damage pump stations to the point that they fail to operate.
Engineers should design and locate pump stations to minimize vulnerability to damage
from:
      Avalanches
      Earthquakes
      Floods
      Landslides
      Tree falls
      Tsunamis
      Windstorms
      Wildfire

To meet state and local requirements, engineers must address geologic risk (seismic
and unstable slopes) when designing pump stations (WAC 246-290-200). The state
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has geologic hazard maps that identify seismic
and other natural hazards. DNR contact information is in Appendix C.
Engineers should prioritize making booster-pump stations that serve water for essential
services earthquake resilient, so that the booster pumps remain functional after seismic

events. Essential services include medical facilities; power plants; fuel refining, storage,
and distribution facilities; food production, storage, and distribution facilities;
emergency response command and communication centers; and emergency shelters.
You should follow the requirements in ASCE 7 to design earthquake resilient pump
stations. And, the water system should have an onsite emergency power source or be
able to operate with a portable emergency power source (ASCE 7).

You can reduce or mitigate seismic risk by:
      Being aware of permanent ground displacement or intense ground shaking (in
       fault zones) that could affect the pump station and designing the pump station
       to accommodate these hazards.
      Bracing and/or anchoring pump station piping, motor control centers, cranes and
       other equipment needed for pump station operation.
      Using flexible couplings on pipelines connected between elements that may
       move differentially.

Various design guidelines highlight the multiple seismic vulnerabilities of piping and large
mechanical equipment in some pump stations (ALA 2002; ALA 2004). In areas with potential
for significant ground motion, you may need to seek the services of a professional qualified
to assist in the design of pipe bracing, equipment support, and other aspects of design.



8.3       Booster Pump Station Design Details
The design of a booster pump station must comply with state and locally adopted
national model codes (WAC 246-290-200(b)). The details of these building, electrical,
and mechanical codes are beyond the scope of this manual. The design of all but the
simplest pump stations may require the involvement of licensed professionals with
detailed knowledge and experience with the codes (WAC 197-27A-020(2)). This section
and Checklist A.3.6 in Appendix A provide further guidance on basic pump station
design elements.

Meters and gauges
To help ensure that pumps perform as designed, each pump should have:
      A pressure gauge between the pump and the discharge check valve
      A compound gauge on its suction side; and
    A way to meter the discharge.
Each booster pump station should have a meter capable of measuring the total water
pumped and pumping rate.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     208
Valves
Each pump should have valves adequate to permit satisfactory operation, maintenance,
and equipment repair. There should be an isolation valve on the suction and discharge
side of each booster pump. Other appurtenances should include:
      A check valve on the discharge side of each booster pump.
      End connections for booster pumps, pressure vessels, and large equipment
       should have flexible flanged coupling adapters, or dismantling joints for larger
       units and threaded unions for smaller units. They will simplify maintenance and
       provide flexibility in installation.
      Pump control valves and surge anticipation valves, as needed, to prevent
       destructive hydraulic transients during normal and emergency pump starts or
       stops.
      Air relief valves at any high points in the piping.

Controls and Alarms
The pump station design should include an alert to the operator if a pump failure or
abnormally high or low pressure occurs. One approach is to have a visible external alarm
light (with a battery backup). If practical, the pump-station alarm system should connect
to an auto-dialer to notify the operator, water system owner, and other key personnel of
any unusual conditions or unauthorized entry.

Piping Material
The strength, stiffness, ductility, and resistance to water hammer or pump cycling make
steel and ductile iron the most suitable choices for exposed piping in pump stations
(Sanks et al. 1998). Plastic pipe such as PVC and HDPE are prone to fatigue failure from
pump cycling, become brittle at low temperatures, or lose strength at temperatures that
can occur normally in pump stations. For those reasons, if considering the use of PVC or
HDPE pipe inside a booster pump station, approach with caution and proceed only with
approval from the water system owner. The design should also address special
anchoring or support requirements for equipment and piping.

Piping Connections
Engineers should use seismically appropriate pipe materials and connections for all
pipes located within the pump station, directly below it, and within 20 feet of the pump
station foundation. It will be difficult and expensive to repair or replace these pipes if
they fail after the pump station is in place. Therefore, engineers should evaluate these
pipes for corrosion potential and include appropriate corrosion mitigation.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  209
Taps on the discharge piping
Booster pump stations are convenient places to provide water quality monitoring and, if
necessary, provide booster chlorination or other water quality adjustments. You should
consider installing at least two taps on the common discharge line:
      A sample tap to allow for monitoring water quality.
      A tap to allow for booster disinfection in an emergency.

Access for pipe cleaning and condition assessment tools
As distribution pipes age, they gradually accumulate solids and suffer from corrosion. As
a result, it may be useful to install a pig-launch or other access point on the pump
station discharge piping.



8.4       Individual Booster Pumps
An individual booster pump station may not be installed to serve a property on a new
water system or an addition to an existing water system (WAC 246-290-230(5)).

Existing water systems may need to install individual service booster pumps to meet
minimum pressure requirements for specific connections. Engineers must submit such
designs to DOH for approval (WAC 246-290-125). The water system, not the consumer
is responsible for individual booster pumps installed because the minimum 30 psi
standard in WAC 246-290-230(5) cannot be met. Water systems may only use individual
booster pumps on an interim basis, typically less than 10 years, and they must manage
and control any individual booster pumps (WAC 246-290-230(8)). The water system
should evaluate vulnerabilities in the distribution system until it can make upgrades that
eliminate such low-pressure areas and the associated need for individual booster
pumps.

If the pressure in the distribution pipeline meets the minimum requirements of WAC
246-290-230(5), a water system may allow installation of individual booster pumps to
serve customers who want additional pressure. For example, developers may install
booster pumps to serve structures built at significant elevations above the service
meters. The water system should approve the design, installation, and operation of such
individual booster pumps. Moreover, the water system must ensure the booster pumps
do not adversely affect pressure in the rest of the distribution system (WAC 246-290-
230 and 420), and address all cross-connection control concerns (WAC 246-290-490).
Building owners are responsible for booster pumps installed where water systems meet
the minimum 30 psi standard in WAC 246-290-230(5). Systems may allow them on a
permanent basis.

8.4.1     Cross-Connection Control for Individual Booster Pumps
When designing or installing an individual service booster pump, the engineer should
recognize that the location the individual booster pump will serve is a cross-connection
hazard. Under normal circumstances, pressure on the downstream side of the individual
service booster pump is higher than system pressure. However, the check valve could
fail or leak, causing water from the premises to backflow through the pump and into the
distribution main. Therefore, a cross-connection control specialist must assess the
degree of hazard for facilities that use booster pumps and approve the installation of an
acceptable backflow assembly (WAC 246-290-490(4)(e)(iii)).

Special consideration should be given for booster pumps within multistory buildings
given the higher pressures in these structures relative to the distribution system, internal
storage in some cases, and greater potential for a multitude of uses, including high
health cross connection hazards that require premises isolation (PNWS-AWWA 1996).

Water that enters the consumer’s premises is “used water.” Therefore, any piping
arrangement that allows pressure relief must not be directed back into the distribution
system (WAC 246-290-490(2)(k)).



8.5       Placing a Booster Pump Station into Service
Engineers should consider field-testing pumps to ensure they are installed properly and
able to deliver their rated performance. A field pump test consists of measuring the
pump discharge, pressure or head, power input, and speed. Engineers then use this
information to determine whether there are operational issues with the pumps as
outlined in AWWA E103- Standard for Horizontal and Vertical Line-Shaft Pumps (AWWA
2007).

Before a booster pump station can be placed into service, it must be properly tested,
inspected, and disinfected (WAC 246-290-120(4)). The specifications for the pump
station should clearly identify the disinfection and bacteriological testing requirements.
The WSDOT/APWA standard specifications (Division 7) and AWWA C651 - Standard for
Disinfecting Water Mains can be used for this purpose (WSDOT/APWA 2016; AWWA
2014). Water systems must submit a Construction Completion Report Form (DOH 331-
121) to DOH within 60 days after they complete a pump station project and before they
place the pump station into service (WAC 246-290-120(5)).

Chapter 9: Pressure Tanks

9.0       Introduction
A pressure tank contains pressurized air and water. The compressed air acts as a cushion
to exert or absorb pressure as needed. There are two types of pressure tanks. Bladder
tanks have some type of membrane separating the air from the water.
Hydropneumatic tanks allow air-water contact.

Pressure tanks work with pumps in closed systems (see Chapter 8) to maintain pressure
within a selected range without requiring continuous pump operation. This chapter
offers design guidance on:
      Pressure tank sizing
      Department of Labor and Industries standards
      Pressure tank type selection and appurtenances

The objectives of pressure tank design are to avoid premature pump failure due to
excessive cycling and to protect the quality of water in the distribution system by
reliably maintaining distribution system pressure within the design operating range. The
needed number and size of pressure tanks depends on how the pump discharge rate is
controlled. Control options include:
      Variable frequency drives
      Single-speed pumps with on-off pressure switches
      Cycle control valve with downstream pressure set point

Pressure tanks are not appropriate for providing equalizing, standby, or fire-protection
storage. If such storage is required, design engineers should select ground or elevated
storage as described in Chapter 7.



9.1       Pressure Tank Sizing
The portion of pressure-tank volume that can be usefully withdrawn between pumping
cycles while maintaining 30 psi pressure throughout the distribution system under peak
hour demand (PHD) conditions (WAC 246-290-230(5)) is referred herein as withdrawal
capacity. The procedure for selecting or sizing bladder tanks differs from that used for
hydropneumatic tanks.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                213
9.1.1        Bladder Tank Sizing
Bladder tank sizing depends on the number of “selected-size” tanks needed to provide
pump protection. Bladder tanks are assumed to be pre-charged with air to a pressure of
about 5 psi below the low operating (pump-on) pressure for the system. Design
engineers need to call out this stipulation in the design specifications.

Design engineers may use Equation 9-1 to determine the number of bladder tanks of a
certain gross volume, based on the pump-on and pump-off pressure settings for single-
speed pumps controlled by a pressure switch. See Section 9.1.5 for an alternative
pressure tank design approach based on use of a cycle control valve or variable
frequency drive pumping system.

 Equation 9-1: T >      (R)(Qp)
                        (Nc )(VB)

 Where:

  R      =      15(P1 + 14.7)(P2 + 14.7) (or refer to Table 9.1)
                (P1 - P2)(P2 + 9.7)
 VB          = The gross volume of an individual bladder tank in gallons (“86-gallon
               tank,” for example).
 Ts          = The number of bladder tanks of gross volume VB
 P1,P2       = Pressures selected for water system operation in psig (gauge pressures). P1
               corresponds to the pump-off pressure and P2 to the pump-on pressure
 Nc          = Number of pump operating cycles per hour. This should be the maximum
               number of pump motor starts per hour as recommended and documented
               by the pump or motor manufacturer. Without such information, design
               engineers should use no more than six cycles per hour.
 Qp          = Pump delivery capacity in gallons per minute at a midpoint of the selected
               pressure range. Determine this by examining pump curves or tables. If this
               value is not used, the designer should use the Qp that occurs at P2 (pump-
               on).



9.1.2        Bladder Tank Design Procedures
The following is a step-by-step procedure for designing bladder-tank pressurized
storage systems used in connection with single-speed pumps with on-off pressure
switches. See application of these procedures in Example 9-1 in Section 9.6.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 214
   1. Based on water system hydraulic requirements, select the operating range of
      pressure, P1 (pump-off) and P2 (pump-on). P2 pressure must satisfy minimum
      system pressure requirements (WAC 246-290-230).
   2. Select the operating cycles per hour, Nc. The value for Nc should not exceed six
      cycles per hour unless the pump manufacturer justifies a larger value. For
      multiple pump installations, Nc may be increased if an automatic pump
      switchover system is installed to automatically alternate pumps.
   3. Determine the delivery capacity, Qp, for the midpoint of the operating pressure
      range [(P1 + P2)/2]. The pump capacity at P2 pressure must meet system
      demand and pressure requirements (WAC 246-290-230 and 420).
   4. Select an appropriate gross volume, VB , for each bladder tank (bladder tank size).
      This volume should be available from bladder tank manufacturers. We
      recommend limiting individual bladder tank sizes to no more than 220 gallons
      gross volume.
   5. Calculate the value of R. For convenience, Table 9.1 gives R-values for several
      commonly used pressure ranges.
   6. Use Equation 9-1 (see above).
   7. Round up the value determined in Step 6 to the nearest whole number. This is
      the number of tanks, each with the selected volume, V B , to be used for pump
      protection.
   8. See Appendix A.3.7 for further design recommendations.

9.1.3       Hydropneumatic Tank Sizing Equations (bottom outlet)

Horizontally-Oriented Tanks
Design engineers may use Equation 9-2 to determine the gross volume of a
hydropneumatic tank they will install horizontally, based on the pump-on and pump-off
pressure settings for single speed pumps controlled by a pressure switch.

See Section 9.1.5 for an alternative pressure tank design approach based on use of a
cycle control valve or variable frequency drive pumping system.


  Equation 9-2:
                        P1 + 14.7 15 Qp (MF)
                 Vt             x
                         P1 - P2      Nc

Vertically-Oriented Tanks
Design engineers may use Equation 9-3 to determine the gross volume of a
hydropneumatic tank they will install vertically, based on the pump-on and pump-off
pressure settings for single-speed pumps controlled by a pressure switch.

  Equation 9-3:
                      P1 + 14.7 15 Qp (MF)
               Vt             x           + 0.0204 D2
                       P1 - P2      Nc

  Where:

      Vt = Total tank volume in gallons.
   P1, P2 = Pressures selected for water system operation in psig (not absolute
            pressures). P1 corresponds to the pump-off pressure and P2 to the pump-on
            pressure.
     Nc = Number of pump operating cycles per hour. This should be the maximum
          number of pump-motor starts per hour as recommended and documented
          by the pump or motor manufacturer. Without such information, design
          engineers should use no more than six cycles per hour.
      Qp = Pump delivery capacity in gallons per minute at the midpoint of the selected
           pressure range. Determine this by examining pump curves or tables. If this
           value is not used, the Qp that occurs at P2 (pump-on) should be used.
       D = Tank diameter in inches.
     MF = A multiplying factor related to tank diameter to include the volume needed
          to maintain a six-inch water seal above the tank inlet-outlet installed at the
          bottom of the tank. See Table 9-3. Use this factor only for sizing a horizontal
          tank. MF for vertically-oriented tanks equals 1.

9.1.4     Hydropneumatic Tank Design Procedures
The following is a step-by-step procedure for designing horizontally or vertically
oriented hydropneumatic pressurized storage systems used in connection with single-
speed pumps with on-off pressure switches. See application of these procedures in
Example 9-2 in Section 9.6.
   1. Based on water system hydraulic requirements, select the operating range of
      pressure, P1 (pump-off) and P2 (pump-on). P2 pressure must satisfy minimum
      system pressure requirements (WAC 246-290-230).
   2. Select the operating cycles per hour, Nc. The value for Nc should not exceed six
      cycles per hour unless the pump manufacturer justifies a larger value. For
      multiple pump installations, Nc may be increased if an automatic pump
      switchover system is installed to automatically alternate pumps.
   3. Determine the delivery capacity, Qp, for the midpoint of the operating pressure
      range [(P1 + P2)/2]. The pump capacity at P2 pressure must meet system
      demand and pressure requirements (WAC 246-290-230 and 420).

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                               217
       When multiple pumps will be pumping through a pressure tank, the Qp can be
       based on the largest pump.
   4. For either vertical or horizontal tanks, select a tank diameter (in inches) that suits
      the space available in the pump house.
   5. For a horizontal tank, refer to Table 9-3 for the multiplying factor, MF, needed to
      accommodate the required water seal. The MF in this table is calculated to
      provide a 6-inch water seal above the tank inlet-outlet installed at the bottom of
      the tank. If a vertical tank is to be used, the additive value for the water seal
      volume can be calculated directly and is already included in Equation 9-3.
   6. Calculate the necessary tank volume by incorporating the parameters above into
      the appropriate sizing equation. The tank is subject to the American Society of
      Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code construction requirements identified in
      Section 9.2.
   7. Check the calculated volume requirement with any commercial tank size table
      (see Table 9-2) to see if a tank that meets the necessary volume at the selected
      diameter is available. If a tank that provides the necessary volume at the diameter
      selected is not available, or cannot be fabricated, select another tank diameter
      and repeat the sizing calculations until the design is satisfied. This may also be
      necessary if the pump house layout will not accommodate the length needed.
   8. See Appendix A.3.7 for further design recommendations.

9.1.5     Reduced Pressure Tank Sizing
Designs using variable frequency drive (VFD) pumping systems or pump cycle-control
valves (CCV) will reduce the pressurized storage needed to protect pumps from over-
cycling while maintaining adequate pressure in the distribution system. The criteria used
to size pressure tanks serving a closed pumping system employing a VFD or CCV differs
from the approach described in Sections 9.1.1 through 9.1.4.

CCVs and VFDs deliver water within the controlled pressure range at much lower flow
rates than a standard design approach. Therefore, the size and/or number of pressure
tanks required for water systems using a CCV or VFD will be lower than those required
for single-speed pumps with on-off pressure switches (see sections 9.1.1 through 9.1.4).
For more information on CCVs and VFDs, see appendices B.2 and B.3.

Cycle Control Valves
Engineers may use a pump cycle-control valve (CCV) to control the pressure in a
distribution system. The CCV is intended to extend run time with minimal pressurized
storage. It will maintain constant downstream pressure (i.e., the valve’s set point) until
demand downstream of the valve falls below the valve’s prescribed low-flow level. At
that point, the pressure will rise to the pressure switch pump-off set point. The valve is
mechanically prevented from restricting flow past its preset minimum.

Depending on the model used, the control valve will stop pump operation at a preset
threshold flow of as little as 1 or 2 gpm. At flows higher than that threshold, the valve
will open or close in response to water system demands while the pump operates
continuously. Design engineers who choose to use a CCV should include the head loss
through the valve when determining the friction loss within the pump house.

The CCV is designed to keep the pump operating nearly all the time. For most water
systems water demand will be very low during nighttime hours, resulting in prolonged
pump operation at the upper end of its pump curve. If the manufacturer did not design
the pump and motor for prolonged operation at that point on the pump curve, the
pump will operate at low energy efficiency and at risk of premature failure. We
recommend design engineers consult directly with the pump vendor or manufacturer to
make sure the pump and motor are compatible with the intended operating conditions.
Refer to Appendix B.2 for additional design information.

Variable Frequency Drives
A VFD is an electronic controller that adjusts the pump motor speed by modulating
frequency and voltage. VFDs match motor speed and therefore pump output to specific
water demand through a pressure control feedback loop to the variable frequency
controller. Refer to Appendix B.3 for additional design information.



9.2       Labor and Industries Standards for Pressure Tanks
Pressure vessels, including bladder tanks greater than 37.5 gallons in gross volume,
must be constructed according to ASME standards (RCW 70.79.080 (5)). The ASME
standard is intended to promote a safe environment and protect against property
damage, injury, and death caused by an abrupt failure of the tank.

General Agreement
In 2011, Washington Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) added to a list of
proposed changes to RCW 70.79.080 an exemption for non-ASME bladder tanks used in
public water systems. When legislation is in conflict with practices that meet the intent
of the rule (in this case, safe operation of bladder tanks used in public water systems),
L&I can enter into a general agreement with another agency until such time as the
legislation is changed. Design engineers are responsible for addressing all applicable
L&I requirements at the time of pressure tank design. Refer to current L&I rules and
legislation.

An agreement between L&I and DOH requires that design of non-ASME bladder tank
systems conform to the standards shown in DOH 331-429. The agreement does not
apply to hydropneumatic tanks. All hydropneumatic tanks must be constructed
according to the latest ASME specification code (RCW 70.79.080), regardless of size.

All pressure tanks greater than 37.5 gallons gross volume must have a properly sized
and installed ASME Section VIII pressure relief valve (WAC 296-104-316). Pressure tanks
smaller than 37.5 gallons gross volume must have a properly sized and installed
pressure relief device manufactured according to a recognized national standard, and
design engineers must provide the specifications and certification to DOH. We strongly
recommend the use of an ASME Section VIII PRV for pressure tanks smaller than 37.5
gallons gross volume. Pressure relief valves protect a pressure vessel from over-
pressurization due to a failure in the pump control system, or intense heating of the
water (e.g., during a fire), and pressure surge.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 222
No isolation valves should be located between the pressure relief valve and the pressure
tank. The potential for closure of the isolation valve during normal operations would
negate the intended function of the pressure relief valve. For other design requirements
and guidance, see Pressure Relief Valves on Pressure Tanks (DOH 331-429).

The maximum allowable working pressure for a tank is on the nameplate attached to
the tank. For nonstandard pressure vessels, engineers can determine the maximum
allowable working pressure with the L&I formula in WAC 296-104-405. A properly sized
ASME PRV should have a relieving capacity sufficient to prevent pressure in the vessel
from rising more than 10 percent or 3 psi above the maximum design set pressure of
the pressure relief valve, whichever is greater.

L&I contact information is in Appendix C.



9.3       Locating Pressure Tanks
Pressure tanks should be located above normal ground surface and be completely
housed. Buried pressure tanks are subject to floatation due to high groundwater, and
could allow external corrosion to go undetected. L&I standards require at least 18
inches of clearance around the tanks for proper inspection, maintenance, and repair
access (WAC 296-104-260). It may not always be practical to provide this much
clearance all the way around a pressure tank. Therefore, L&I developed a Boiler/Pressure
Vessel Clearance Variance Request form (F620-041-000). It is available from the L&I
Boiler/Pressure Vessel website (http://www.lni.wa.gov/forms/pdf/F620-041-000.pdf).



9.4       Piping
Pressure tanks should have bypass piping to permit the water system to operate while it
is being repaired or painted. Process control elements such as a pressure switch or
hydraulic valves should not be located such that they are isolated during bypassed
operations. Sampling taps should be provided before and after the pressure tank(s).



9.5       Hydropneumatic Pressure Tank Appurtenances
Good engineering design includes the following appurtenances:
      An automatic pressure relief valve safely discharging to a building drain (with
       installed air gap) or outside of the building.
      No valves may be between the PRV and the pressure tank.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   223
      Float switch controlling water surface elevation (needed to avoid water logging
       the tank).
      Air compressor and air filter. If the compressor is oil lubricated, only food-grade
       oil may be used as a lubricant. The air compressor should be located and air filter
       should be specified to ensure capture and compression of healthy air quality and
       ease of air filter inspection, maintenance, and replacement.
      Sight glass or other tank level indicator.
      Tank drain, pressure gauge, and pressure switch.
      Vertical and lateral support appropriate for soil conditions and seismic risk.
      Access hatch 24 inches in diameter allowing inspection of the interior, with clearance
       of at least 5 feet between hatch and adjacent structures (WAC 296-104-260).



9.6       Pressure Tank Sizing - Examples
Below, two examples illustrate design guidance provided in Sections 9.1.1 through 9.1.4.

Example 9-1: Bladder Tank Sizing
For a mid-pressure range pumping rate, Qp , of 40 gpm, a selected cycling of 6 cycles per
hour, a bladder tank gross volume of 86 gallons, and a selected pressure range of 60/80,
determine the required number of 86-gallon tanks as follows:
   Qp = 40; N = 6; VB = 86
   Using Table 9-1 for P2/P1 = 60/80, R = 76.1
   Using Equation 9-1:
        Ts >      (R)(Qp )
                 (Nc )(VB )
        Ts >    (76.1)(40)
                              = 5.9
                  (6)(86)
Select six 86-gallon bladder tanks for pump protection, pre-charged to 55 psi (5 psi
below pump-on pressure).

Example 9-2: Horizontal Hydropneumatic Tank Sizing
   1. Assume a small water system with the following:
       a. 50 connections.
       b. Peak hourly demand (from water system meter information) = 103 gpm.
       c. Well capacity is 60 gpm.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   224
       d. Booster pump draws from ground level atmospheric storage and pumps into
          horizontal pressure tank with bottom outlet.
       e. Desired pressure range is 40/60 psig (minimum/maximum).
       f. Booster pump capacity is 110 gpm at 40 psig and 55 gpm at 60 psig.
       g. Booster pump capacity is 96 gpm at 50 psig [(P 1 + P2)/2] as determined from
          the manufacturer’s pump curve.
   2. The pump cycling will be limited to no more than six cycles per hour.
   3. Minimum water seal of 6 inches is required.
   4. Pertinent data summarized:
         P1 = 60                 P2 = 40          Qp = 96              Nc = 6
   5. Select a trial tank diameter of 42 inches. Using Table 9-3, the multiplying factor,
      MF, is 1.10 (by interpolation between the 36-inch and 48-inch tank sizes).
   6. Substituting these values in the horizontal tank equation, Equation 9-2,
               P1 + 14.7 15 Qp (MF)
        Vt             x
                P1 - P2      Nc


               60 + 14.7 15 (96) (1.10)
        Vt             x
                  20           6
         Vt = 986 Gallons
       This is the minimum volume that will satisfy the 6-inch seal-depth requirement
       for a 42-inch diameter vessel. The tank selected from commercial charts will need
       to be equal to or greater than this volume.
   7. A commercial tank table (see Table 9-2) shows there is a 42-inch tank with a
      volume of 965 gallons. This volume is close to the required 986 gallons, but it will
      not give a 6-inch water seal under the operating conditions stipulated. Therefore,
      if a tank with a 42-inch diameter is to be used, the next larger tank of 1,037
      gallons is the one to select.

If a 48-inch diameter tank had been selected, a minimum volume of 968 gallons would
be calculated. For this example, Table 9-2 shows a 994-gallon tank is available and
acceptable. Note that the 48-inch tank would be about four feet shorter than the 42-
inch tank. That may be an important consideration when placing a tank in limited space.

Chapter 10: General Water Treatment

10.0      Introduction
Effective and reliable water treatment is essential to protect public health and promotes
consumers’ confidence in the water they receive. This chapter includes general
information on treating groundwater, seawater, and surface water. Because there are
many unique aspects and regulatory requirements associated with the design of surface
water treatment facilities, we provide detailed guidance on surface water treatment in
Chapter 11.

Regulation describes enforceable drinking water standards as treatment techniques,
action levels, or maximum contaminant levels (MCL). These standards form the
minimum treatment objectives for any water treatment design. Consumer and water
system expectations may exceed minimum regulatory requirements. As such, we
encourage design engineers to develop designs that focus on providing a greater level
of public health protection than just meeting regulatory standards. Providing this higher
level of public health protection is called optimization. Voluntary programs that focus on
optimized treatment include the AWWA Partnership for Safe Water and EPA Area Wide
Optimization Program. These and similar programs adopted in Washington state have
developed water quality optimization goals related to arsenic, disinfection, and surface
water treatment.

Public notification that explains potential health risks to consumers may be required
when treatment disruptions occur (WAC 246-290-71001). When evaluating water
treatment alternatives, design engineers should consider the full range of source water
characteristics, availability of skilled operators, capital and operational costs, and water
system acceptance of the treatment technology.

Considering these factors, alternatives such as consolidating with a nearby system,
improving source water protection, or abandoning and replacing the contaminated
source, often are better long-term approaches to protect public health than
constructing a treatment facility. If treatment is the best long-term solution, we
structured this chapter to help design engineers select and design a treatment process
that is appropriate for the community’s needs and resources, protects public health, and
supports consumer confidence in the water system.

The overall structure of the chapter is as follows:
      Alternatives Analysis (Section 10.1)
      Treatment Technologies (Section 10.2) including:
       o Disinfection
       o Fluoridation
       o Corrosion Control
       o pH Adjustment
       o Chemical and Radiological Contaminants
      Predesign Studies (Section 10.3) including pilot studies
      Project Reports (Section 10.4) including identifying
       o Design Criteria
       o Process Control -Monitoring, Instrumentation, and Alarms
       o Start-up, Testing Procedures and Operations
      Construction Documents (Section 10.5)
      Treatment Chemicals (Section 10.6)
      Cross-Connection Control for Water Treatment Facilities (Section 10.7)
      Water Treatment Plant Wastewater Disposal (Section 10.8)
      Placing a Water Treatment Plant into Service (Section 10.9)

The water-treatment design process usually involves more steps than designing
reservoirs, pump stations, and other types of projects. Figure 2-3 outlines the general
design and review process for water treatment projects. In most cases, the design
process begins with an assessment of treatment alternatives.



10.1      Alternatives Analysis
A water treatment facility is a major capital investment with high life-cycle costs and a
potential risk to the public if the treatment processes fail to operate as intended.
Therefore, the engineer must evaluate all appropriate and applicable alternatives, and
justify the selected option in reports submitted to DOH for approval (WAC 246-290-
110(4)(c)).

This chapter includes information design engineers can use to screen potential
treatment alternatives prior to undertaking an in-depth analysis. The engineer should
cover the following items in the analysis of alternatives and consult detailed guidance in
professional references (AWWA/ASCE 2012a; Kawamura 2000b):

        Current and future capacity needs.
        Source water quality.
        Secondary impacts of treatment.
        Operations and maintenance considerations.
        Waste disposal and management.
        Life cycle costs.
        Site considerations.

Point-of-use (POU) and point-of-entry (POE) treatment is not a viable option to comply
with drinking water standards in Washington. We limit the use of POU and POE
treatment because their application is incompatible with existing regulatory
requirements (WSDOH 2007). A limited exception to this restriction applies to
noncommunity water systems that use a POE treatment device to treat all the water
entering a single-building water system.

10.1.1      Source Water Quantity
The finished water quantity objectives are tied closely to the water system’s expectations
of future capacity requirements. See Chapter 4 for details on estimating future water
system capacity needs. Design engineers should clearly define future water supply
expectations before beginning preliminary evaluation of water supply and treatment
alternatives.

The safe yield of any potential water source is the quantity of water—annual, seasonal,
and daily—reliably available to the treatment facility. Water rights are another limiting
factor. See Chapter 5 for recommendations on establishing an appropriate value for a
supply’s safe yield.
The design engineer should carefully consider the efficiency of any proposed treatment
process against supply limitations and expected supply needs. Some water treatment
processes, especially adsorption and filtration processes, need to be backwashed
periodically or otherwise regenerated. Engineers need to consider the amount of water
the treatment process requires to backwash, regenerate, rinse, and/or filter to waste
when determining the maximum daily treatment capacity and raw water supply
requirements.

10.1.2      Source Water Quality
Water systems must use the highest quality sources feasible (WAC 246-290-130(1)).
Source water and finished water quality objectives form the basis for selecting treatment
process alternatives for evaluation. The extent and availability of source water data may

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 228
affect preliminary screening of alternatives and the duration of the predesign study. We
recommend that the design engineer contact one of our regional offices to discuss
source water monitoring needs in light of available source-water quality data. The
design engineer should collect the data necessary to evaluate the efficacy of viable
treatment technologies.

Engineers can use a limited source water sampling program to characterize groundwater
wells. However, we caution against relying on a single source-water sample because
doing so may fail to reveal important changes in water quality over the course of a year.
For example:
        Nitrate in groundwater may fluctuate seasonally due to rainfall, irrigation
         practices, and other land use practices.
        Arsenic concentration in groundwater supplies may vary due to seasonal changes
         in aquifer level.
        Determining the potential for disinfection byproducts associated with addition of
         chlorine in coastal groundwater may require analysis over a period of months
         due to seasonality. An extended suite of unregulated water quality parameters
         such as ammonia, bromide, total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and
         chloride could cause byproducts.

Design engineers should consider an extended source water-sampling program to
characterize surface water. Surface water quality is highly variable due to changing
weather conditions, primarily rainfall patterns and snowmelt conditions. Chapter 11
(Section 11.1.3) provides guidance on source water sampling in support of evaluating
surface water. Appendix F provides guidance on groundwater treatment-process
alternatives.

10.1.3      Secondary Effects of Water Treatment
Water systems must review how proposed projects could potentially affect water quality
in the distribution system (WAC 246-290-110(4)(d)). Source changes, or a new or
significantly modified treatment process can affect distribution system water quality.
These water quality effects could:
        Release accumulated organic and inorganic contaminants from pipe walls.
        Increase corrosion of metals.
        Influence the ability to maintain a disinfection residual (Taylor et al. 2005; Kippin
         et al. 2001).




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      229
Design engineers should identify how the water system will address such issues.
Common approaches include:
        Bench scale studies.
        Pipe loop studies with new or existing distribution system materials.
        Enhanced monitoring and flushing programs.

Design engineers must specifically address how a change in treatment may affect
compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (40 CFR 141.81(b)(3)(iii); 141.86(d)(4); and
141.90(a)(3)). Some treatment changes that could increase corrosivity, make lead and
copper more soluble, and cause other distribution system issues include:
        Introducing a disinfectant. Disinfectants can affect corrosivity, metal release, or
         both (Schock and Lytle 2011). For example, the initial introduction of chlorine can
         increase the release of copper (Stone et al. 1987). Corrosion rates of both mild
         steel and copper were found to be higher in the presence of free chlorine than in
         its absence (Pisigan and Singley 1987).
        Changing residual disinfectant. Changing the type of residual disinfectant can
         change the oxidation-reduction potential within the distribution system. This
         change can increase the risk of destabilizing pipe scales and the release of
         inorganic compounds. For example, switching from free chlorine to chloramine as
         a residual disinfectant can lead to significant lead release (Edwards and Dudi
         2004; Boyd et al. 2008).
        Switching coagulant chemicals. Changing coagulants can increase the chloride
         to sulfate mass ratio, causing an increase in lead release (Edwards and
         Triantafyllidou 2007; Nguyen et al. 2010).
        Installing additional treatment. For example, installing ion exchange can
         change the pH, alkalinity, and chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio increasing lead and
         copper release at the tap (Nguyen et al. 2010).

We may require water systems that change treatment or introduce a new source of
supply to complete additional rounds of lead and copper tap sampling (40 CFR
141.86(d)(4)(vii)).

10.1.4      Operations and Maintenance Considerations
While analyzing treatment alternatives, the design engineer should consider:
        Expected operational capability of the water system. This depends on the
         system’s size. Smaller water systems often can’t provide the same level of
         operational capability as large water systems. Engineers should select technology


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   230
         appropriate for the anticipated level of expertise, time, and resources the water
         system will devote to operating the treatment facility.
        Operator certification. Water systems must be able to meet certification
         requirements that apply to the proposed treatment technology (WAC 246-292-
         050). The design engineer should make a preliminary determination of the
         operator certification level for any proposed treatment facility using DOH’s
         Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet. Include operator staffing for multiple shift
         operations as appropriate.
        Plant staffing. The design engineer and public water system should work
         together with an experienced certified water treatment plant operator to estimate
         staffing needs. Staffing needs will vary depending on the size, complexity, and
         degree of treatment process automation. See Section 10.4.3 for additional
         information.
        Operator safety. Design engineers should minimize, to the extent practical, the
         use of hazardous materials (caustic soda, gaseous chlorine, and acid), confined
         spaces, and fall hazards.
        Reliability and ease of operation. Some treatment processes are simpler and
         inherently more reliable than others and require less work from operators.
         Engineers should consider treatment process stability and complexity, especially
         for smaller systems with part-time or contract operators.

10.1.5      Treatment Plant Waste Disposal
Water treatment plants that remove contaminants will have backwash water that needs
to be disposed of properly. The Department of Ecology is the lead permitting agency for
all water treatment plant wastewater discharges such as sludge, backwash water
discharged to waste, ion exchange waste streams, and membrane reject water. Most
water treatment plant waste discharges are permitted under either a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (general or individual), or a state waste
discharge permit.

Water systems developing water treatment proposals should evaluate waste-product
issues early because they could significantly affect the cost or feasibility of a proposed
approach or technology. See Section 10.8 for detailed information on waste disposal
considerations.

10.1.6      Life Cycle Cost Analysis
Designers must include estimated capital and annual operating costs in the project
report for any proposed treatment project (WAC 246-290-110). Preliminary cost
estimates should have the detail and accuracy water systems need to make decisions
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    231
about treatment system alternatives. Preliminary construction cost estimates should
approach an accuracy of plus-or-minus 30 percent (AWWA 2012b).

Capital costs: Location, capacity, site constraints, water system hydraulics, and source
water quality all affect capital costs. They can vary significantly from facility to facility.
Engineers can sometimes use cost curves to develop preliminary construction costs for
specific treatment processes and then adjust them for inflation and local conditions.
Engineers can also use price quotes from equipment manufacturers, local construction
experience, and information from similar projects to develop preliminary construction
costs.

Operations and maintenance costs: A water treatment facility’s operations and
maintenance (O&M) costs include labor, power, maintenance, repair, supplies, and
services. Engineers can prepare preliminary O&M cost estimates with methods similar to
those used for construction costs. However, lack of published data may make detailed
component cost assessments necessary to evaluate alternative treatment methods for
small water systems.

10.1.7      General Water Treatment Plant Site Considerations
Water treatment plant designs must comply with state or locally adopted building,
mechanical, electrical, and land use codes (WAC 246-290-200(b)). The contents of these
codes, not to mention local ordinances, exceed the scope of this manual. Overall, you
should review locally adopted codes and ordinances that could affect the siting and
design of a treatment facility in a project report. These considerations include, but are
not limited to:
        Zoning compliance, building code compliance, and community acceptance.
         Noise can be an issue for treatment plants located near parks or residences. The
         maximum permitted sound level can be as low as 45 dBA in residential areas at
         night (WAC 173-60-040).
        Operator access, equipment maintenance, and safety. The pumps and other
         mechanical equipment need periodic maintenance. As such, the treatment plant
         design should make it easy to inspect, operate, and maintain the equipment:
         o Beware of creating permit-required confined spaces. Treatment plants in
           below grade vaults or other permit-required confined spaces (defined in
           Chapter 296-809 WAC) can create operations and maintenance issues.
         o Provide adequate space around mechanical equipment and electrical
           equipment. We recommend at least 36 inches of clearance between piping,
           pumps, and other mechanical equipment. Electrical codes govern the
           minimum clearance in front of electrical panels; these clearances are at least
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      232
          36 inches and can be 60 inches or more for high voltage panels (Sanks et al.
          1998; AWWA/ASCE 2012f).
       o Facilitate removing and installing heavy valves and equipment. Any piece of
         equipment that weighs more than 100 pounds should be accessible by crane
         or other lifting assistance. Other means of access include large doorways or
         roof hatches to facilitate removing heavy equipment directly into a truck.
         Areas where the operator will walk or perform maintenance should be clear of
         overhead obstructions to a height of at least 7 feet (Sanks et al. 1998).
       o Hearing protection and other measures to protect people in the treatment
         plant is required when the noise exceeds 85 dBA (Chapter 296-817 WAC).
      Geotechnical engineering field investigations including:
       o Site drainage
       o Soil type and soil-bearing strength
       o Groundwater table elevation
       o Soil stability, liquefaction, slope failure analysis
      Electrical power supply
       o Reliability: Engineers should assess the reliability of the power supply and the
         need for standby generators. See Section 5.11.1.
       o Sizing: While evaluating where to site water treatment facilities engineers
         should consider the capacity of the local electrical distribution system.

10.1.7.1 Natural Hazard Considerations
Natural disasters could damage treatment plants to the point they fail to operate.
Engineers should design and locate treatment plants to minimize vulnerability to
damage from:
      Avalanches
      Earthquakes
      Floods
      Landslides

To meet state and local requirements, engineers must address geologic risk (seismic
and unstable slopes) when designing treatment plants (WAC 246-290-200). The state

Department of Natural Resources has geologic hazard maps that identify seismic and
other natural hazards.

Engineers should prioritize making treatment plants that serve water for essential
services earthquake resilient, so that treatment plants remain functional after seismic
events. Essential services include medical facilities; power plants; fuel refining, storage,
and distribution facilities; food production, storage, and distribution facilities;
emergency response command and communication centers; and emergency shelters.
You should follow the requirements in ASCE 7 to design earthquake resilient treatment
plants. And, the water system should have an onsite emergency power source or be able
to operate with a portable emergency power source (ASCE 7).

You can reduce or mitigate seismic risk by:
        Being aware of permanent ground displacement or intense ground shaking (in
         fault zones) that could affect treatment plant facilities and design those facilities
         to accommodate those hazards.
        Bracing and/or anchoring treatment plant piping, motor control centers, cranes
         and other equipment needed for treatment operation.
        Anchoring chemical containers used for treatment and water quality testing, so
         they do not spill.
        Designing for seismically generated waves in treatment basins that may damage
         submerged or partially submerged equipment and baffles. Damaged equipment
         or baffles may sink to the bottom of the basin and jam automated sludge
         scraping equipment.
        Using flexible couplings on pipelines connected between elements that may
         move differentially.

Various design guidelines highlight the multiple seismic vulnerabilities of piping and
large mechanical equipment in some treatment plants (ALA 2002; ALA 2004). In areas
with the potential for significant ground motion, you may need to seek the services of a
professional qualified to assist in the design of pipe bracing, equipment support, and
other aspects of design.

10.1.8      Variances
Under a set of very specific criteria, a water system may qualify for a variance from
compliance with certain drinking water standards. A variance allows a water system
serving fewer than 10,000 people to install treatment and be considered in compliance
while at the same time exceeding a drinking water standard. DOH will not consider

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      234
variances for compliance with the coliform MCL, a treatment technique requirement, or
any surface water treatment requirement (WAC 246-290-060(2)).

To date, we haven’t granted a variance from a primary MCL or treatment technique. A
small system may receive a variance under a particular national primary drinking water
regulation only if:
   1. The contaminant wasn’t regulated prior to January 1, 1986 (See 40 CFR 142.304).
   2. EPA identified an applicable variance technology.
   3. The water system actually installs, operates, and maintains the specific
      technology in question.
   4. The water system provides extensive public notification as described in federal
      regulations (See 40 CFR 142.308).


10.2      Treatment Technologies
This section and the tables at the end of this chapter provide information about many of
the more common treatment technologies for:
      Disinfection (Section 10.2.1; Table 10-7)
      Disinfection byproducts control (Section 10.2.2; Table 10-11)
      Fluoridation (Section 10.2.3)
      Corrosion control (Section 10.2.4; Table 10-8)
      pH Adjustment (Section 10.2.5)
      Inorganic chemical (IOC) removal (Section 10.2.6; Table 10-9)
      Volatile organic chemical (VOC) and synthetic organic chemical (SOC) removal
       (Section 10.2.7; Table 10-10)
      Radionuclides removal (Section 10.2.8)
      Emerging contaminants (Section 10.2.9)

We discuss treatment technologies for surface water in Chapter 11.

Instead of removing a contaminant, it may be appropriate to blend sources to achieve
compliance with a drinking water standard. DOH considers blending a form of
treatment. We require a project report and construction documents for any blending
project. The engineering analysis for blending should include:
      An analysis of the water quality from the sources under consideration,
       including any seasonal water quality changes that could affect the blending
       strategy.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  235
      A description of the blending strategy, including calculations of flow and
       finished water quality, monitoring, controls, and alarm or shutdown conditions.
      A preliminary design and schematic that shows piping, control valves,
       monitoring points, and other important features.

Water systems usually use blending to address inorganic and organic contaminants. In
some cases, they use both blending and physical treatment to address contaminants of
concern. Water systems cannot use blending to address microbial risks.

Most of the treatment technologies in Tables 10-7 through 10-11 are widely used with
established control and monitoring strategies. For alternative technologies without such
extensive design and operating experience, we usually require more analysis and pilot
testing to establish the design parameters, process control, and technology-specific
monitoring strategies. Given the additional engineering and analysis that may be
required, design engineers should check with one of our regional offices before
proceeding with an alternative technology.

10.2.1     Disinfection
The design approach to disinfection treatment will differ depending on the intended
purpose of the application. In some cases, engineers use primary disinfection, which
addresses microbial risk in the source water. In other cases, engineers use secondary
disinfection, which addresses microbial risks in the distribution system. Some systems,
including all surface water systems, must provide both primary and secondary
disinfection treatment (Chapter 246-290 WAC, Part 6; WAC 246-290-250(4)); and WAC
246-290-451). Disinfection requirements for surface water sources are in Chapter 11.

Disinfection is the most common form of potable water treatment in Washington. Water
systems treat more than half of the state’s 8,000 Group A drinking water sources with a
disinfectant. Of those, more than 90 percent are treated with hypochlorite, commonly
called free chlorine. For that reason, this section focuses on free chlorine used as a
primary or secondary disinfectant. Water systems also use free chlorine as an oxidant in
processes that remove inorganic contaminants. See Section 10.2.1.4 for information on
the use of chlorine as an oxidant.

Adding or changing a chemical disinfectant will change water chemistry and could
generate secondary effects beyond DBP formation. These secondary effects may cause
significant water quality changes in the distribution system, such as release of corrosion
byproducts due to changes in oxidation-reduction potential. See Sections 5.3 and 10.1.3
for further details.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 236
Additional information on disinfectants is in Table 10-7. Performance criteria for
groundwater and seawater disinfection are in Chapter 246-290 WAC, Part 5. Information
specific to primary and secondary disinfection of surface water supplies is in Chapter 11.

10.2.1.1 Source Water Quality
Design engineers must evaluate source water quality in the design of any primary or
secondary disinfection system (WAC 246-290-110). Some water quality parameters, such
as iron, manganese, natural organic matter, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonia,
and sulfide exert a chlorine demand. If there is natural ammonia in the source water, it
can cause multiple challenges including difficulty maintaining a free chlorine residual
and taste and odor problems. Chemical disinfectants such as ozone, chlorine, chlorine
dioxide, and chloramines produce disinfectant byproducts (DBPs). Some source waters,
especially those with high concentrations of natural organic matter, can form DBPs at
levels of public health concern. In addition to understanding chlorine or other
disinfectant demands of the source water, design engineers should assess the potential
for disinfectant byproducts to form when adding or changing a chemical disinfectant.

When designing treatment that includes adding chlorine as a disinfectant or oxidant,
engineers should analyze the following source water-quality parameters:
      Ammonia: To assess the efficacy of chlorine as a disinfectant and oxidant.
      DOC: To assess the potential to form HAA and THM. We found values less than
       1.0 mg/l of DOC unlikely to result in exceedances of the TTHM MCL.
      Bromide and chloride (in coastal groundwater sources): To assess brominated
       HAA and THM formation. The highest proportions of brominated HAA and THM
       formation can be expected from sources with relatively low DOC concentrations
       and higher [Br -] levels (i.e., high [Br -]/[DOC] ratios).

We found that results from total formation-potential tests for THMs and HAA5 do not
correlate with regulatory TTHM and HAA5 test results in distribution systems studied at
length. Therefore, we recommend that design engineers use discrete DOC and bromide
test results when assessing future DBP formation.

For guidance on source water information useful in the design of a new chlorination
system, see Appendix F.1.

10.2.1.2 Primary Disinfection of Groundwater Sources
Unanticipated environmental conditions, or other factors beyond the water system’s
control, may adversely affect source water quality at any time. Engineers should account
for primary disinfection in the design of each groundwater source. Retrofitting an
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 237
operational source, pump house, or transmission facilities after-the-fact can be
expensive and disruptive to water system operations.

If we determine that a groundwater source is vulnerable to microbiological
contamination or water quality data confirms E. coli contamination, then a water system
must provide continuous primary disinfection of the source (WAC 246-290-451 or -453,
respectively).

The design of primary disinfection with free chlorine must provide a CT equal to or
greater than 6 without exceeding the total chlorine maximum residual disinfectant level
(MRDL) of 4 mg/L. Calculate the CT value by multiplying the free chlorine residual
concentration (“C,” in mg/l) by the chlorine contact time (“T”, in minutes). CT6 applies
where the treated water temperature is greater than or equal to 10°C and the pH is in
the 6 to 9 range. If the temperature is less than 10°C, the minimum required CT is 8. For
groundwater outside the range of 6 to 9, contact your regional office.

For primary disinfection with other disinfectants, see the CT requirements for 4-log virus
inactivation in Section 10.2.1.5 and Table 10-1.

Calculate contact time (T) at peak hourly flow between the point of chlorine injection
and the residual chlorine monitoring location. The residual disinfectant monitoring
location must be at or before the first customer (WAC 246-290-451(6)). Assessing the
contact time (“T,” in minutes) can be a challenging part of the design process because
contact time depends on the baffling efficiency of the tanks, pipes, and reservoirs
through which the water flows. Detailed information on estimating the baffling
efficiency of various structures and contact time is in Chapter 11. For additional
guidance on free chlorine disinfection, refer to Appendix F.1; on ozone disinfection, refer
to Appendix F.5; and on UV disinfection, refer to Appendix I.

10.2.1.3 Secondary Disinfection of Distribution Systems
Secondary disinfection means adding a chemical disinfectant at a source or pump
station to maintain a distribution system residual. Water systems use secondary
disinfection to establish microbiological control throughout the distribution system. If
the treatment is limited to secondary disinfection, design and operational monitoring
requirements for CT6 and 4-log don’t apply. However, engineers must include
considerations for disinfection residual monitoring in the distribution system in their
design, so the water system can demonstrate maintenance of a detectable residual in all
active parts of the distribution system (WAC 246-290-451(7)).



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 238
10.2.1.4 Monitoring Plans
Monitoring is a key part of any disinfection system design. Delivering water continuously
treated with free chlorine, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, or ozone triggers disinfection
residual monitoring requirements (WAC 246-290-300(6)(c); -451; -453). If the water
system will add a chemical disinfectant to a source, the design must include
pretreatment and posttreatment source sample taps for monitoring water quality (WAC
246-290-300(3)(h); -451(6)(c)). A DBP monitoring plan should accompany the new
disinfection system design.

Adding a disinfectant or changing a disinfection practice also can affect coliform
monitoring practices. A system adding a disinfectant must measure and record the
residual disinfectant concentration in samples collected at the same time and location
that it collects routine and repeat coliform samples (WAC 246-290-451(9)). Adding a
disinfectant may change a system’s contingency planning for detection of E. coli. For this
reason, every water system must update their coliform monitoring plan as part of any
change in disinfection practice (WAC 246-290-300(3)(b)). Refer to our coliform
monitoring plan guidance (DOH 331-036 and 331-240) for additional information.

Chlorine or another disinfectant used solely as an oxidant can affect the water quality
served to customers. Design engineers must still address issues such as:
      Disinfection byproducts monitoring.
      Monitoring and maintenance of chlorine residual in the distribution system (WAC
       246-290-451(7) and (9); -300(6)).

10.2.1.5 Disinfection of Seawater or Brackish Water Source
Open seawater sources must be treated to a minimum CT6 prior to the first connection.
(WAC 246-290-451(4)). This level of primary disinfection provides an additional barrier in
case the integrity of a membrane or another water system component is compromised.
Refer to our design checklist for desalination of seawater sources in Appendix F.6.

Design engineers should assess the requirement for primary disinfection of a saline well
treated with reverse osmosis the same as any other groundwater supply. Considerations
should include:
      Construction of the well.
      Degree of wellhead protection.
      Aquifer characteristics.
      Bacteriological history of the source.

10.2.1.6 Alternative Disinfectants
Water systems can use chlorine dioxide, chloramines, ozone, and ultraviolet (UV)
disinfection instead of, or along with, chlorine to address microbial risks, though each
disinfection approach has limitations. We strongly discourage the use of iodine; it has
very limited permitted use as a drinking water additive. See Policy F.01.

For primary disinfection of groundwater, free chlorine is usually a more practical choice
than alternative disinfectants based on the required CT values compiled in Table 10-1.
This table also includes the maximum residual disinfectant levels (MRDLs) for these
disinfectants. Initial design references for these alternative disinfectants are available
elsewhere (USEPA 1999; USEPA 2006; Ten State Standards 2012).

Notes:
    1.   Chemical disinfection requirements are from Appendix E of the Guidance Manual for Compliance with the
         Filtration and Disinfection Requirements for Public Water Systems Using Surface Sources (USEPA 1990).
    2.   UV disinfection requirements for viruses are in 40CFR 141.720(d).
    3.   If a violation of the MRDL for chlorine dioxide occurs, it is a Tier 1 violation requiring public notification as
         soon as possible, and no later than 24 hours after the violation occurs.


Ozone
Ozone is a very strong oxidant and highly reactive. In drinking water, it is used as an
oxidant and for primary disinfection of surface water sources. Because it is so reactive,
ozone is not feasible for secondary disinfection, and special materials and equipment
are required in the design of ozonation facilities. In addition to monitoring for THMs
and HAA5, water systems that use ozone must monitor for bromate at the entry point
to the distribution system (WAC 246-290-300(6)(b)(iii)). Any water system planning to
use ozone should carefully review fire code and worker safety requirements associated
with its use. For additional guidance, see Appendix F.5.

Chlorine Dioxide
Chlorine dioxide is a strong disinfectant that may be used for both primary and
secondary disinfection. To date, it has had limited use in Washington state. The use of
chlorine dioxide involves special monitoring and reporting requirements. The
monitoring requirements include daily measurements for chlorine dioxide and chlorite
at the entry point to the distribution system (WAC 246-290-300(6)(b)(ii)). There are also
special requirements for monitoring chlorine dioxide and chlorite in the distribution
system. If the concentration of chlorine dioxide in the distribution system exceeds 0.8
mg/L, consumers must be notified immediately (WAC 246-290-300(6)(b)(ii)). Water
systems also should notify some end users immediately, such as hospitals, kidney
dialysis centers, and customers with fish tanks because they can be especially sensitive
to chlorine dioxide and its byproducts.

Chloramines
Chloramines form when free chlorine reacts with ammonia. Monochloramine, the main
disinfecting agent, is a weak disinfectant so water systems usually use it solely as a
secondary disinfectant. Special concerns associated with using chloramines include the
sensitivity of some customers, such as hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, and customers
with fish tanks, and the potential for increased corrosion and damage to some materials
in the distribution system. See Section 10.1.3 and Table 10-7.

UV Disinfection
In surface water sources, a relatively low dose of UV disinfection effectively inactivates
Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium. The UV dose required to inactivate viruses is
significantly higher, which limits the use of UV as a primary disinfectant for groundwater.
UV reactors also do not provide a residual disinfectant. Appendix I includes additional
guidance on applying UV disinfection.

Dichlor and Trichlor
Dichloroisocyanuric acid (dichlor) and trichloroisocyanuric acid (trichlor) are strong
biocides and oxidizers produced in granular or tablet (solid) form. When dissolved in
water they produce hypochlorous acid (free chlorine) and chloroisocyanuiric acid
(Wahman 2018). Residual chloroisocyanuiric acid, interferes with standard methods for
analyzing free chlorine. This interference overstates the actual level of free chlorine. As a
result, we will not approve designs that use dichlor or trichlor as the source of free
chlorine for primary or secondary disinfection.

10.2.2    Disinfection Byproducts
Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) can form whenever a chemical disinfectant is added to
drinking water. Therefore, all community and nontransient noncommunity (NTNC) water
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    241
systems that distribute water to which a disinfectant has been added must monitor for
DBPs and have a DBP monitoring plan (WAC 246-290-300(6)). All affected water systems
must monitor for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) and the five currently regulated
haloacetic acids (HAA5) with special monitoring requirements for water systems that use
chlorine dioxide or ozone (WAC 246-290-300(6)(b)). If a DBP MCL violation occurs,
corrective action including removal of DBP precursors and/or operational changes
(treatment, storage, distribution) to limit DBP formation will be required (WAC 246-290-
320).

Certain unregulated water quality parameters can significantly influence the potential for
DBP formation following chlorination. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in source water is
the primary factor affecting DBP formation in chlorinated groundwater. Engineers
should measure the concentration of DOC in source water over multiple seasons to
assess the likelihood of excessive HAA and THM concentration in water treated with
chlorine. Ammonia exerts a strong demand for free chlorine. Engineers should measure
bromide and chloride in coastal groundwater sources when they consider adding
chlorine.

Water systems may be able to limit DBP formation by minimizing the contact between
chemical disinfectants and DBP precursors such as natural organic matter. If DBP results
are of concern, design engineers and water systems should initially consider simple
operational changes. These operational changes include:
      Modifying disinfection practices: Filtration removes DBP precursors. Therefore,
       adjusting pre- and post-filtration practices can reduce the formation of DBPs.
       Decreasing water age or stagnation: In most cases, DBPs gradually increase in
       the distribution system as water ages. To minimize water age and decrease
       stagnation, use manual and automatic flushing, employ reservoir mixing, and
       adjust storage volumes.
      In-reservoir aeration: Aeration processes, including in-reservoir aeration, can
       remove some THMs. In-reservoir aeration usually involves retrofitting the
       reservoir inlet with spray nozzles, and possibly other modifications. With aeration,
       there will likely be some loss of chlorine residual, so downstream adjustments
       may be needed.

Some of these changes may require the engineer to submit a project report and
construction documents. Please contact your regional office to determine whether a
submittal is required.

If operational changes are insufficient to address DBP issues, the engineer may need to
take other actions. Common treatment technologies used to minimize DBP formation
include:
      Alternative oxidants and disinfectants: If the system requires an oxidant,
       engineers can use oxidants such as permanganate, air, and oxidizing media that
       do not form DBPs instead of free chlorine. If disinfection is required, engineers
       can evaluate alternative disinfectants such as monochloramine, chlorine dioxide
       and UV disinfection. Some changes in disinfection practice can cause increased
       lead and copper release. See Section 10.1.3. We cover alternative disinfectants in
       detail in Section 10.2.1.6.
      Granular media filtration: Engineers can use some types of filtration to remove
       natural organic matter. These processes include rapid-rate filtration to treat
       surface water, and pressure filtration to remove arsenic, iron, and manganese. In
       these processes, the ability to remove DBP precursors depends on the dose of
       aluminum or iron-based coagulants (or amount of naturally occurring iron),
       polymer addition, and physical parameters, such as filtration rate, media type,
       and depth.
      Biological filtration: Slow sand filtration, which combines biological and physical
       or chemical processes, and biologically active-rapid rate filtration, which
       enhances the biological activity in rapid rate filters, can provide DBP precursor
       removal that may be greater than purely physical and/or chemical removal
       processes. Low temperatures reduce biological activity, so engineers may need
       more extensive pilot testing to assess the biological aspects of the filtration
       process and resulting effects on DBP removal.
      Membrane filtration: Low-pressure membrane filtration, such as microfiltration
       and ultrafiltration, alone cannot effectively remove DBP precursors. However,
       adding a coagulant such as aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) prior to filtration will
       enable the filters to effectively remove DBP precursors. You will need to perform
       pilot testing to determine the appropriate coagulant and dose. Too much
       coagulant can lead to excessive membrane fouling. Too little coagulant can result
       in poor DBP precursor removal and other operational issues.
      Granular activated carbon (GAC): GAC removes dissolved organic carbon
       (DOC), which is a precursor to the formation of DBPs. Engineers usually install
       GAC in a contactor before or after filtration, or as a cap on rapid-rate filters. You
       will need to perform pilot testing to determine how long the GAC media will be
       effective before exhaustion, and the associated operational costs. As long as GAC
       remains effective at removing DOC, few DBPs should form. If you use GAC to
       treat DBPs, plan weekly field tests to check UV 254 absorbance. Your UV 254

         going effectiveness of GAC to remove DOC. An increase in UV 254 absorbance
         means the carbon filter is exhausted and DBP levels will likely increase. If you use
         GAC as filtration media, you also need to perform pilot testing to evaluate its
         effectiveness in removing pathogens and other contaminants.
        Powdered activated carbon (PAC): PAC removes dissolved organic carbon
         (DOC), similar to GAC. Systems feed PAC prior to filtration and remove it in the
         filtration process. Key initial design parameters include the PAC characteristics,
         effective dose, and contact time. Engineers will usually need bench and pilot
         testing to determine appropriate design parameters.
        Anion exchange: To remove DBP precursors, engineers can consider fixed-bed
         anion exchange systems or recirculating ion-exchange systems, such as MIEX®.
         Fouling of the ion exchange resin over time, pH effects, and waste disposal of the
         salt brine used to regenerate the ion exchange resin are common design
         concerns.

For more information on these and other technologies, see Table 10-11 at the end of
this chapter. EPA also has several manuals on DBP removal and monitoring (USEPA
1999a; USEPA 1999b; USEPA 2001).

10.2.3      Fluoridation
DOH supports community water fluoridation as a sound, population-based public health
measure. However, local communities decide whether their public water system adds
fluoride.

The optimal treated water fluoride concentration is 0.7 mg/L. Water systems that
fluoridate must maintain a fluoride concentration between 0.5 mg/L and 0.9 mg/L in the
distribution system (WAC 246-290-460). This requirement ensures fluoridation is tightly
controlled, effective, and reliable.

Technologies used for fluoridating drinking water include liquid and dry feed systems.
This manual does not contain specific recommendations for fluoridation technologies.
You will find such recommendations in references, such as Water Fluoridation: A Manual
for Engineers and Technicians (Reeves 1986), the Recommended Standards for Water
Works (Ten State Standards 2012), and Water Fluoridation Principles and Practices
(AWWA 2016). Appendix F.2 includes a checklist for the design of sodium fluoride
saturators. We do not require pilot studies for fluoridation facilities.

Fluoride design recommendations:
        The maximum chemical feed rate attainable from the chemical metering pump(s)
         or feeder(s) should not exceed twice the recommended dose.
        There should be two interlocks on any fluoride feed equipment to ensure that it
         does not start until after water begins flowing past the fluoride feed point.
        For liquid fluoride chemical feeders, water systems should install antisiphon check
         valves in the solution line at two locations: 1) at the pump head, and 2) at the
         point of injection.
        Where applicable, the water system should clearly label the plugs or fill ports for
         fluoride liquid storage tanks. They should be a unique size or shape to reduce the
         risk of inadvertently adding any other chemical to a fluoride storage tank.
        The engineer must equip the potable water connection to any fluoride saturator
         with either an air gap or a properly installed and tested reduced pressure
         backflow assembly (WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)).
        The design engineer should verify the fluoride feed-rate design assumptions
         during the start-up, testing, and operation period.
        Prior to start-up, operators of fluoridated systems should receive at least six-
         hours of DOH-approved “fluoridation basics” training for water operators.

See Section 10.6 for additional information on safe chemical handling and storage.

10.2.4      Corrosion Control
Water systems exceeding the lead or copper action level and all large water systems
(serving more than 50,000 people) must implement optimal corrosion control treatment
(chapter 246-290 WAC and 40 CFR 141.80 through 141.90). Large systems must conduct
a corrosion control study (40 CFR 141.81(d)). Systems serving fewer than 50,000 people
can submit a corrosion-control recommendation report unless we directed them to
complete a corrosion control study. Engineers can use the Optimal Corrosion Control
Treatment Evaluation Technical Recommendations for Primacy Agencies and Public Water
Systems (USEPA 2016) to identify appropriate technologies for water systems that
exceed the lead or copper action level. Water systems that exceed an action level should
contact one of our regional offices. Table 10-8 cites commonly used corrosion control
technologies and identifies issues associated with them.

DOH recommends that design engineers use pipe-loop or other pilot-scale work to
evaluate actual corrosion or corrosion rates using a proposed treatment approach. We
also recommend that you use bench or pilot-scale testing for selected technologies
(aeration, calcite contactors, and pH adjustment) to verify that a proposed design dose-

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      245
rate will meet treatment objectives (target pH or alkalinity). These studies may be
oriented toward ensuring that target pH or alkalinity goals are met rather than
measuring resulting corrosion rates. Some water systems have had difficulty matching
full-scale results to bench scale data. Water systems proposing to use aeration or air
stripping should conduct a pilot test to confirm the ability of the process to increase the
treated water pH adequately.

Many corrosion control approaches include chemical feed facilities to make the treated
water less corrosive to distribution, plumbing, and service line materials. As such, the
design usually includes protection from treatment chemical overfeed to minimize the
risk to public health. See Section 10.6.1 and Table 10-3 for information on design
features to decrease the risk of chemical overfeed.

Lime and soda ash feed systems may be operator intensive because of the potential for
plugging feed equipment and piping. Engineers should size chemical metering pumps
to provide for potential differences in demand, and compare bench scale results to
theoretical water chemistry expectations. More detailed guidance on chemical feed
systems is in Section 10.6.

See Section 10.1.3 for information on other treatment process changes that can affect
corrosion control.

10.2.5    pH Adjustment
In addition to its role in corrosion control treatment, pH effects many other treatment
processes. For example, chlorine disinfection is more effective at lower pH. Removal
processes for many inorganic chemicals, such as arsenic, iron and manganese, work best
within specific pH ranges as discussed in Section 10.2.6. Likewise, performance of
coagulation chemicals used in surface water treatment can vary with pH.

EPA established a secondary (aesthetic) standard for pH of 6.5 to 8.5. Lower pH
conditions can cause water to have a bitter metallic taste and be corrosive to plumbing
materials. High pH can make water feel slippery, giving it an unpleasant taste or causing
deposits in plumbing systems.

Most approaches for adjusting pH involve chemical feed facilities to inject an acid or
base. Common chemicals used to lower pH are carbon dioxide (gas), citric acid, and
phosphoric acid. Common chemicals used to raise pH are lime, sodium carbonate (soda
ash) and sodium hydroxide (caustic). All chemicals must be used within their ANSI/NSF
60 approved doses (WAC 246-290-220(3)).

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  246
Changes in pH (and alkalinity) can affect distribution water quality. Secondary effects of
treatment must be considered as described in Sections 10.1.3 and 10.2.4.

Strong acids and bases require careful selection, storage, and handling to protect
worker safety. For example, a 50 percent caustic solution solidifies at 58⁰F, which can
plug piping and even cause injury if valves or piping fail as a result. For this reason, we
recommend using a more dilute solution of 25 percent or less. Section 10.6.2 has more
information on chemical storage and handling. When feeding concentrated acids and
bases, include design features to lower the risk of chemical overfeed. See Section 10.6.1
for more information.

Effective pH adjustment requires appropriate process control through monitoring,
instrumentation, and alarms. Continuous monitoring of pH should be provided
upstream of the chemical injection point and downstream after the chemical is
completely mixed. Section 10.4.2 has more information on process control.

10.2.6    Inorganic Chemicals
There are primary (health-based) or secondary (aesthetic) water quality standards for
more than a dozen inorganic chemicals (IOCs) (chapter 246-290 WAC). The IOCs most
frequently detected above their MCLs are arsenic (As), fluoride (F), nitrate (NO 3), iron
(Fe), and manganese (Mn). Table 10-9 summarizes treatment options for these
contaminants.

Chloride and conductivity are secondary contaminants that may indicate seawater
intrusion. Seawater intrusion itself indicates that a source water quantity issues exists.
DOH and local health departments may require additional action when seawater
intrusion threatens the reliability of the water supply. See Section 5.5.4 for more
information on seawater intrusion.

10.2.6.1 Arsenic
EPA established the arsenic MCL of 10 parts per billion (0.010 mg/L) based on chronic
health concerns, including carcinogenic and cardiovascular risks. Water systems
developing a new well with arsenic over the MCL, or operating an existing seasonal or
permanent source exceeding the arsenic MCL on a running annual average, must
design remedial measures to comply with the arsenic standard (WAC 246-290-310).

Measures may include physical removal, blending, or a nontreatment alternative, such as
drilling a new well or connecting to a nearby water system. Engineers should consider
nontreatment alternatives first, especially if arsenic in the source exceeds 0.050 mg/L.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                       247
Treating arsenic at that high of a concentration can be challenging and expensive. In
addition, when the arsenic concentration is that high, a treatment failure can present an
acute health risk. The simplicity of operations and availability of qualified operators are
key considerations when selecting a long-term solution to arsenic contamination.

It is important to consider raw water quality parameters, such as pH, iron, manganese,
ammonia, phosphate and silica when selecting any arsenic treatment technology.
Effective treatment depends on arsenic being present as arsenate or As(5), the oxidized
form of inorganic arsenic. Effective treatment depends on knowing and addressing how
other water quality parameters can affect the treatment outcome. Ammonia, if present,
can prevent effective oxidation of arsenic to As(5). Silica, especially in conjunction with
pH greater than 8.0, reduces the ability of treatment processes to remove arsenic.

Common arsenic treatment approaches:
      Adsorbents: Several iron oxide and other metal-based adsorbents can be used
       to bind arsenic. Eventually, all the binding sites in the adsorbent are used up and
       the adsorbent needs to be replaced. The replacement period for adsorbents can
       vary widely, and can be much shorter than estimates from suppliers because of
       interference by silica, phosphate and other compounds. Engineers should
       evaluate adsorbents for the specific source water quality before selecting an
       adsorbent or detailed design. If the pH of the water is adjusted to increase the
       effective life of the adsorbent, continuous pH monitoring and looped process
       control is necessary to prevent the arsenic from being released from the
       adsorbent. Inadequate evaluation of adsorbents has led to impractically short
       replacement periods and subsequent abandonment of the adsorbent treatment
       process.
      Anion exchange: Because arsenate (As(5)) is a negatively charged ion at the pH
       of most natural waters, anion exchange can be used to remove arsenic. Water
       systems use a salt brine periodically to regenerate the anion resin. One of the key
       design parameters is the volume of water the anion resin can treat before
       regenerating the system. Engineers should conduct a pilot test to confirm any
       estimated volume of water that can be treated before regeneration. Anion
       exchange treatment also initially decreases the pH and alkalinity of the water,
       which can make it more corrosive to lead, copper, and other metals. As a result,
       the design may require corrosion control treatment.
      Coagulation-Filtration: For source water with insufficient iron, water systems
       can add iron and aluminum-based coagulants to the raw water to bind with
       arsenic for subsequent removal by filtration. For effective treatment, they usually
       will need to add a preoxidant, such as free chlorine or permanganate, so that

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  248
       there is at least 20 seconds of contact time prior to coagulant addition. The
       filtration media, depth, loading rate, and backwash frequency and duration are
       other key design parameters.
      Oxidation-Filtration: For source water with sufficient iron, oxidizing the iron will
       bind arsenic and remove both iron and arsenic through filtration. The ratio of iron
       to arsenic necessary for effective treatment is usually at least 20:1 on a mass
       basis, and may need to be greater than 100:1 in some cases. As with coagulation
       filtration, the filtration media, depth, loading rate, and backwash frequency and
       duration are important design parameters.

Additional information about these treatment approaches is in Table 10-9 and
guidelines are in appendices F.3, F.4, and F.5.

EPA and the Water Research Foundation (formerly AWWARF) developed many guidance
documents that may help you evaluate arsenic treatment alternatives (USEPA 2003;
Hoffman 2006). In addition, EPA’s Arsenic Treatment Technology Demonstrations
website contains many reports and detailed case studies that can be useful in the design
of a treatment system.

10.2.6.2 Nitrate and Nitrite
Nitrate and nitrite are acute contaminants for susceptible individuals (primarily infants
less than 12 months old and pregnant women). A single exposure can negatively affect
the health of these susceptible individuals. The primary sources for nitrate and nitrite are
agricultural activities and septic tank effluent.

Design engineers should explore nontreatment alternatives to resolve nitrate
contamination of a groundwater supply, including abandonment of the source and
developing an alternate groundwater supply or intertie with an adjacent water system. If
there are no feasible nontreatment alternatives, consider the following:
      Blending: The mass-balance of nitrate from both sources is the basic design
       parameter. Because nitrate in groundwater varies over time, water systems should
       apply a significant factor of safety when determining the mixing rate of two or
       more sources.
      Anion exchange: Because nitrate is a negatively charged ion, anion exchange
       can be used to remove nitrate. Water systems use a salt brine periodically to
       regenerate the anion resin. One of the key design parameters is the volume of
       water the anion resin can treat before regenerating the system. Engineers should
       use a pilot test to confirm any estimated volume of water that can be treated
       before exhaustion. Another important design parameter is the concentration of

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  249
       other ions, which preferentially compete for exchange sites on the resin, such as
       sulfate. If the water system does not regenerate anion resin in time, preferred
       ions (i.e. sulfate) will displace less preferred ions (nitrate). This can result in an
       effect called chromatographic peaking, where the concentration of nitrate in the
       treated effluent exceeds that in the untreated water. Anion exchange treatment
       also initially decreases the pH and alkalinity of the water, which can make it more
       corrosive to lead, copper, and other metals. As a result, the design may require
       corrosion control treatment. For additional guidance, see Appendix F.11.
      Reverse osmosis: Water systems use this treatment process mainly for very small
       flow applications due to the high cost associated with larger RO treatment
       systems and the high proportion of reject water. RO treatment rejects most
       dissolved minerals, thereby changing the conductivity of the water. For that
       reason, water systems can consider continuous conductivity monitoring as an
       alternative to frequent nitrate monitoring.

For additional notes about these technologies, see Table 10-9 at the end of this chapter.

Information on nitrate occurrence in Washington and a discussion of treatment and
nontreatment alternatives for nitrate is in the DOH guidance document Nitrate
Treatment Alternatives for Small Water Systems (DOH 331-309). You can find more
information about ways to address nitrate contamination of groundwater in other
guidance manuals (Jensen et al. 2012; Seidel et al. 2011).

10.2.6.3 Iron and Manganese
Several contaminants have regulatory standards based on aesthetics, such as taste,
color, and staining of plumbing fixtures. Of the chemicals with secondary maximum
contaminant levels (SMCLs), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are the two most commonly
found in untreated water sources. We recommend that water systems treat each source
that exceeds the SMCL for Fe or Mn. Manganese can accumulate in the distribution
system and release later during a change in flow or water chemistry. Therefore, current
industry guidance recommends that water systems treat source water to avoid
exceeding 0.020 mg/L of Mn at entry to the distribution system (Kohl and Medlar 2006).

The requirement to comply with the SMCLs for Fe and Mn varies for new and existing
sources and water systems.
      An existing water system with other sources that do not exceed the SMCL for Fe
       and Mn, shall provide treatment for a new source that exceeds the SMCL for Fe
       or Mn (WAC 246-290-130 (3)(g)).


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    250
      An existing water system with one or more existing sources that exceed the
       SMCL for Fe and Mn, that does not want to treat the new well, should submit to
       DOH:
       o A resolution from its governing board or owner showing that its community
         accepts any current problems associated with iron, manganese, or both, and
         indicating that the proposed new source will not add to the existing water
         quality problems.
       o Life-cycle treatment cost information.
      A new community or new nontransient noncommunity water system without
       active consumers, shall provide treatment for a new source that exceeds the
       SMCL for Fe or Mn (WAC 246-290-320(3)(d)).

Water systems may use an existing emergency source that exceeds a secondary MCL
during an emergency without needing an engineering report. Water systems must meet
other conditions before safely placing an emergency source into service, including prior
sampling for acute drinking water contaminants and public notification (WAC 246-290-
131).

Iron and manganese frequently occur in groundwater at concentrations above their
SMCLs. Most water systems use oxidation combined with filtration as the treatment
process to remove iron and manganese from drinking water. Oxidants include air,
chlorine, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and ozone. Water systems that use ozone
or chlorine must monitor disinfection byproducts (WAC 246-290-300(6)). Because
aeration may not provide sufficient oxidation, KMnO4 is the oxidant of choice. It is
effective over a wide range of pH. The most effective Fe and Mn oxidation and filtration
removal occurs at pH 7.5 and above.

Water systems also can use ion exchange technologies to remove Fe and Mn. With
these methods, system should take care to ensure that the iron and manganese don’t
oxidize before application through the exchange media. Fouling of the exchange bed
can occur if the system doesn’t maintain the iron or manganese in a chemically reduced
state.

The design engineer should be aware of water quality characteristics, such as total
organic carbon, pH, and competing ions that can adversely affect treatment
performance. The limitations of treatment options for iron and manganese are in Table
10-9 and other texts (HDR 2001; Sommerfeld 1999; Faust and Aly 1998; AWWA/ASCE
1990). Additional guidance on iron and manganese treatment is in Appendix F.9 and
F.10.

10.2.6.4 Fluoride Removal
Fluoride can naturally occur in source waters at concentrations greater than its primary
MCL of 4.0 mg/L. Bone char and activated alumina are the two most common treatment
technologies used to remove excess naturally occurring fluoride from drinking water.
You can find detailed design guidance for fluoride removal elsewhere (Fawell et al. 2006;
AWWA/ASCE 2012b).

10.2.7    Volatile Organic Chemicals and Synthetic Organic Chemicals
A list of treatment technologies acceptable for removing volatile organic chemicals
(VOCs) and synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) is in Table 10-10. In addition to specific
technologies, this table identifies selected issues the engineer should consider. In most
cases, due to the complexity of treatment processes for specific organic contaminants,
the engineer will have to use predesign studies and pilot tests to determine whether a
treatment process is appropriate to a particular source.

10.2.8    Radionuclides
There are primary MCLs for radium 226 and radium 228 (5 picocuries/L combined),
gross alpha particle radioactivity (15 picocuries/L), beta particles, photon emitters, and
uranium (30 ug/L). Naturally occurring radionuclides are associated with granitic and
metasedimentary rock and younger sedimentary formations in northeastern
Washington.

Water systems must use predesign studies and pilot tests to determine treatment and
waste disposal options appropriate for their specific situations (WAC 246-290-110(4)).
Water systems can remove radium and uranium from drinking water by using properly
designed ion exchange treatment processes (Clifford 1999). Reviews of other treatment
processes and the waste disposal issues related to them are available elsewhere (USEPA
2006b).

10.2.9    Emerging and Unregulated Contaminants
Currently, there are more than 90 regulated contaminants in drinking water with some
contaminants serving as indicators for others. With increasing awareness and improving
laboratory detection limits, new water quality contaminants of concern continue to
emerge. EPA and other public health professionals are reviewing many of them. Some
contaminants have established health advisory limits and may be regulated in the
future. Recent examples include cyanotoxins, hexavalent chromium, perchlorate, and
perfluoroalkyl substances such as perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA).


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   252
While treatment for an unregulated contaminant may not currently be enforceable
under federal drinking water regulations, DOH may require a water system with an
unregulated contaminant exceeding an established health advisory level to issue public
notice and cooperate with us in educating consumers about the health risk. Detection of
unregulated contaminants may prompt local health officials, community leaders, and the
public to demand a treatment solution. Design engineers can refer to the EPA Drinking
Water Treatability Database and Health Advisory Tables (USEPA 2012) for information
and many other resources on emerging and unregulated contaminants. Please contact
your regional office early in the process if you are considering treatment for an
unregulated contaminant.



10.3      Predesign Studies
We require predesign studies, including pilot studies as appropriate, for proposed
treatment projects (WAC 246-290-250). The goal of the predesign study is to establish
the most effective treatment approach, considering life-cycle costs, to produce treated
water that meets all regulatory requirements. A predesign study should precede the
project report. As such, the information from the predesign study must be in the project
report (WAC 246-290-250). Predesign study options include desktop, bench, and pilot
studies.

Desktop studies involve reviewing detailed water quality data, guidance documents,
technical publications, and other information to select a treatment approach for further
evaluation or full-scale design. Desktop studies usually require significant amounts of
water quality data to guide the selection of an appropriate treatment alternative.
Desktop studies can be useful in evaluating distribution system effects (e.g., corrosion)
associated with any new or modified treatment process.

Bench-scale studies include jar testing to identify an initial coagulant dose, initial
chemical dosages for iron and manganese sequestering, and estimates of disinfection
demand and decay.

Pilot studies often follow desktop or bench-scale studies so engineers can identify
design parameters and decide how reliable a treatment process will be over the range of
source-water quality conditions.

10.3.1    Pilot Studies
Inadequate pilot testing may result in treatment-process performance inefficiencies or
outright failure, delayed implementation of effective treatment, and costly retrofitting or

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  253
replacement of treatment facilities. For these reasons, the rule requires pilot studies for
proposed treatment projects (WAC 246-290-250). Treatment approaches that may not
require a pilot study include:
      Simple disinfection for small groundwater sources. Large water systems should
       perform bench-scale tests on proposed disinfection methods to evaluate the
       potential for generating regulated disinfection byproducts. See Sections 10.2.1
       and 10.2.2.
      Simple in-reservoir aeration for pH adjustment, aesthetic reasons or removal of
       trihalomethanes.
      Fluoridation.
      When a corrosion control desktop study clearly points to a particular corrosion-
       control treatment approach consistent with source water quality, operator
       capacity, and distribution system conditions.
      Identical treatment processes applied to nearly identical source waters, such as
       reverse osmosis on well-circulated seawater.

Pilot studies attempt to replicate as closely as possible the operating conditions and
treatment results expected at full scale. Pilot plants are scaled-down versions of a
proposed process, and may be skid or trailer mounted. Engineers use pilot plant testing
to ensure treatment is effective, determine final design parameters, and estimate
construction and operation costs.

It is impractical to transfer pilot results from one proprietary design to another.
Equipment for proprietary processes is usually so specialized that pilot testing results
are unique to a specific equipment design (e.g., differences in low-pressure membrane
filtration).

Sections 10.3.2 through 10.3.4 discuss the recommended pilot study duration, content
of a pilot study plan, and final pilot study report. Section 10.3.5 includes a discussion of
full-scale pilot testing.

10.3.2      Pilot Study Duration
Pilot studies should be long enough to demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and
reliability of the proposed treatment system. The testing should include the period of
most challenging water quality for the piloted treatment technology. If the pilot study is
too short or misses important seasonal changes in source water quality, the process may
not work as designed or incur higher than expected operational costs. Pilot studies
often are shorter for groundwater than surface water treatment because groundwater
quality is usually more stable.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    254
The number of samples collected and the duration of the study can vary widely
depending on the type of source, amount of historical data, water quality, and the
proposed treatment technology (Logsdon et al. 1996; Ford et al. 2001; AWWA/ASCE
2012d). In some cases, engineers can use bench-scale testing to determine the initial
operational parameters for pilot testing and possibly decrease the duration of the pilot
study. See Table 10-2 for guidance on the duration and objectives of pilot studies for a
variety of treatment processes.

10.3.3      Pilot Study Plan (Protocol)
A pilot study plan is necessary to establish an implementation strategy for evaluating a
proposed treatment alternative, or alternatives. The pilot-study plan establishes pilot
study goals, the monitoring program, operational requirements, equipment needs,
layout, duration, and cost. Several of the elements discussed below are appropriate for
desktop or bench-scale studies. Engineers should address them in the protocol they
submit to DOH for approval.

Pilot Study Goals: Engineers should use the following goals to determine the scope of
a pilot study and for pilot study planning and operational decisions:
        Determine the operational feasibility of a selected technology.
        Establish full-scale water-treatment design criteria.
        Develop more refined cost estimates.
        Provide hands-on operator training for water system personnel.
        Determine projected hydraulic impacts on the water system.
        Select an appropriate treatment technology.
        Determine waste disposal requirements and constraints.

Monitoring Program: Pilot study monitoring programs vary significantly depending on
the treatment device, finished water requirements, and the specific contaminants in the
source water. Engineers can use Table 10-2 to develop monitoring programs for the
treatment technologies listed. For additional guidance, contact one of our regional
offices.

Most pilot study monitoring programs should include:
        Water quality parameters.
        Monitoring frequency for each parameter.
        Monitoring equipment and calibration standards.
        Personnel or outside laboratories responsible for monitoring activities.

Equipment Needs, Layout, and Calculations: The pilot study plan should include a
schematic of the process or processes under consideration and the detailed drawings
necessary to construct the pilot facilities. The schematic and the pilot facility design are
integral to the overall project design and should include unit processes, pipe sizes, pipe
connections, flow direction, chemicals and application points, monitoring points, flow-
control devices, monitoring equipment or gauges, and various process elements (such
as intakes, pumps and blowers).

Operational Requirements: Pilot study plans should identify the operational
requirements necessary to ensure water system personnel understand their role and
responsibility to provide routine O&M and data collection. We recommend that the
design engineer prepare a schedule to clarify routine pilot study activities for water
system personnel and others that may be involved with the study.

Pilot Study Costs: Engineers should develop equipment rental, testing, and operation
costs as part of the pilot study plan. Engineers can estimate these costs after they
develop the goals, duration, and monitoring program for the pilot study.

10.3.4      Pilot Study Report
A pilot study helps to define the design and operational parameters for a treatment
process. Therefore, when a pilot study is required, engineers must prepare a pilot study
report that evaluates pilot-study data and determines whether the treatment option is
feasible for full-scale implementation (WAC 246-290-250 and 676(3)).

General pilot-study evaluation criteria include:
        Tabular data for each measured parameter.
        Graphical data showing the relationships between measured parameters.
        Narrative on the relationships between measured parameters.
        Cost projections for full-scale operation (yearly, monthly, and per customer).
        Final design and operational parameters.
        Recommendations for full-scale implementation.
        Comparison of recommended design and operational parameters to design
         goals, water quality goals, and other performance benchmarks.

For pilot studies longer than 4 months, we recommend that the design engineer submit
an interim status report once every two months. These reports will serve as useful
checks on pilot study objectives, costs, progress, and findings. It also will help to
determine whether the engineer should continue the pilot study as planned, amend the
pilot study protocol, or end it and pursue a different treatment approach.



10.3.5      Full Scale Pilot Study
Some water systems are so small that the capacity of a common pilot plant is equal to
the capacity of the full-scale treatment unit. In such a case, the water system and
designer should approach the pilot facility design as if it will be a permanent facility in
the future. As such, the engineer must prepare a project report and construction
documents (See Sections 10.4 and 10.5).

Final DOH acceptance of the full-scale pilot facility depends on a successful
demonstration as determined by an approved pilot-study report (see Section 10.3.4).
The water system and engineer take on significant risk when designing a pilot to full-
scale because treatment efficiency or operation costs may not match predesign

expectations. They also may need to make major modifications or completely abandon
the approach. Submittals for full-scale pilot testing should identify actions the engineer
will take if it is necessary to make major modifications or abandon the project.

A water system may deliver water for public consumption produced from a full-scale
pilot plant if it meets all of the following conditions. See Section 10.9 for additional
information about placing a water treatment plant into service.
   1. DOH approves the plans and specifications (construction documents), start-up,
      testing, and operation procedures as part of a pilot-study plan before the full-
      scale pilot plant is constructed.
   2. Source capacity limitations on an existing water system do not provide adequate
      source capacity for the combined demand of the existing customers and the pilot
      study.
   3. The design engineer demonstrates to our satisfaction that the treatment process
      will not increase risk to consumers.
   4. Treatment plant facilities are pressure tested, flushed, disinfected, and tested for
      all applicable drinking water contaminants.
   5. A properly certified operator is available to operate the treatment equipment.
   6. The treatment system technology is:
       a. An approved alternative filtration technology (if a surface water application).
       b. Constructed of components listed under ANSI/NSF Standard 61.



10.4       Project Reports
The water system must obtain DOH approval of project reports before installing any
new or expanded treatment facilities (WAC 246-290-110). The engineer should submit a
final project report for treatment facilities before submitting construction documents.
Project reports for treatment facilities should reference all planning, design, and
applicable pilot study reports for the proposed facility. They must include:
      Detailed design criteria and calculations.
      Process control information.
      Proposed methods and schedules for start-up, testing, and operating the
       completed treatment facility.
      Operator training and certification requirements.
      Reliability.

See Chapter 2 for guidance on preparing project reports.

10.4.1      Design Criteria and Facility Design
Project reports must include design criteria for all major treatment-facility project
elements (WAC 246-290-110(4)(h)). Project design criteria and calculations should
include the following:
        Overall process design. The design engineer should create a detailed narrative
         of design concepts, design calculations, and supporting information for the
         treatment process(es), process piping and equipment, process control, and waste
         disposal.
        Other project design elements. The design engineer should outline the general
         design aspects, such as siting issues, ingress or egress access, roads, sidewalks,
         parking, earthwork, drainage facilities, building layout and design, special
         structural requirements or constraints, heating, ventilation, fire suppression
         features, general utilities, electrical supply, chemical storage and feed system(s),
         all-hazards assessment, and operator safety.
        Cost and financing. The engineer must include construction cost estimates,
         O&M cost estimates, and the proposed financing method(s) if not already
         covered in a current approved water system plan (WAC 246-290-110(4)(b)(vii)). At
         this stage, the accuracy of the projected cost depends on how well the
         construction documents are completed, but should be within 10 percent of the
         actual cost (AWWA/ASCE 2012g). The engineer should identify the cost-
         estimation method and compare the final cost estimates to the estimates in the
         financial program of the water system plan, if applicable.

10.4.2     Process Control—Monitoring, Instrumentation and Alarms
Overall process control is important to ensure that the treatment process can function
safely and reliably at all times, especially when unattended. Project reports for water
treatment facilities must address process control (WAC 246-290-110(4)(h)). The
description of process control can range from the simple interconnection of a chemical
feed pump with the well pump controls to detailing specific process monitoring and
control set points. For more complex treatment facilities, the description and analysis of
overall process control should include monitoring, instrumentation and alarms.

Monitoring
Water systems should monitor all treatment processes. Monitoring ensures that the
treatment plant meets applicable treatment technique or maximum contaminant levels.
This monitoring can include water quality measurements, like chlorine residual and pH,
and physical parameters such as flow, pressure, and tank level. The means, methods, and
frequency for monitoring water quality and physical parameters must be clearly
identified for each treatment process in the project report (WAC 246-290-110(4)(h)). For
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    259
treatment processes that remove regulated primary chemical contaminants, a certified
lab must analyze the treated water at least monthly (WAC 246-290-455). Additional
monitoring may be required based on the complexity or size of the treatment process.

Engineers should develop draft monitoring procedures and forms early in the design
process to support monitoring of the treatment process when it is completed. Some
treatment process monitoring forms are on the Drinking Water Forms website. If you
can’t find a standard form on the website, please contact your regional engineer to
identify the monitoring and reporting requirements needed to help ensure that the
system operates the treatment process as designed.

Engineers must provide sample taps before treatment to assess the source water
quality, and after treatment but before entering the distribution system (WAC 246-290-
300; WAC 246-290-320(2)(g); WAC 246-290-451). Engineers should provide additional
sample taps at intermittent points in more complex treatment plants to help in process
control, verify on-line analyzers, and assess specific treatment processes.

Engineers should locate source sample taps upstream far enough to avoid influence
from downstream chemical injection. Engineers should locate sample taps for treated
and partially treated water after added chemicals mix completely. Because turbulent
flow conditions can dislodge pipe scale or entrain air, avoid sample taps in turbulent
flow locations, such as near valves, ells, tees and flanges. Also, avoid tapping the bottom
or top of the pipe, which can introduce sediment or air. We recommend using a sample
probe or quill to sample from the center of the pipe.

Sample taps should be smooth nosed without any internal or external threads to reduce
the risk of microbial contamination or aeration of the sample. Aeration can change the
pH or result in loss of chlorine residual so that the sample is not representative of the
water in the pipe.

Instrumentation
On-line instrumentation is often required to ensure that a treatment process is working
well. Instrumentation can minimize the risk of customer complaints as well as improve
public health protection. The design engineer should identify the benchtop equipment
needed or other ways the operator can verify the readings from the on-line
instrumentation in the project report. This benchtop equipment will allow the operator
to check on-line instrumentation periodically as components age or become fouled with
time.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  260
Engineers should address several design considerations when locating and installing on-
line instrumentation:
     Operator safety and ease of access: Instrumentation should be in safe, non-
        corrosive environments where operators have easy access and ample clearance to
        service the device.
      Calibration, verification, and testing: All instrumentation requires periodic
       calibration. It also often requires frequent verification as the manufacturer or
       approved methods specify. Engineers also should consider the means for
       physically testing alarms associated with instrumentation, such as the ability to
       spike the sample upstream of the instrumentation (WSDOH 2013).
      Sample piping: Engineers should keep sample lines as short as possible and use
       small diameter non-translucent piping or tubing. In general, the sample delay
       should be less than 2 minutes between the pipe and instrumentation.
      Flow and pressure control: There should be a way to measure and control the
       pressure and flow to the instrument. Such control is necessary to ensure that the
       flow rate is within manufacturer specifications and pressure fluctuations do not
       affect the instrumentation.
      Power supply: Engineers should protect instruments with surge protectors and
       uninterruptible power supplies. Do not locate instruments near equipment with
       large electrical motors. Some instruments, such as pH analyzers, are especially
       sensitive to small changes in the power supply.

For additional guidance related to the proper installation of instrumentation see
Monitoring Surface Water Treatment Processes (DOH 331-620) (WSDOH 2018b).

Alarms
Engineers should identify alarm conditions, especially for critical process components
where very high or very low levels could lead to unsafe water delivered to customers.
Critical alarm conditions for water treatment facilities can include water quality and
physical parameters such as:
      Flow rate: The system should not exceed the maximum flow rate through a
       treatment process. Doing so may cause the process to fail or lead to a treatment
       technique violation.
      Water level: A clearwell or reservoir needs a minimum level of water to ensure
       adequate disinfection. There also may be a critical level of stored water needed to
       backwash filtration equipment.
      Pressure: Filtration often requires operators to closely monitor the differential
       pressure across the treatment process (head loss) to ensure that the equipment
       does not exceed regulatory or manufacturer acceptable thresholds.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     261
      Turbidity: While primarily used to monitor the effectiveness of surface water
       treatment processes, operators can use turbidity to monitor groundwater
       filtration processes and minimize the risk of failure and customer complaints.
      Disinfectant residual: Water systems commonly use chlorine residual analyzers
       to address microbial health concerns. Systems also could use these analyzers in
       other applications to minimize the risk of process failures.
      Inorganic chemicals: We recommend that water systems install continuous
       monitoring for a chemical contaminant if a treatment process failure could lead
       to an acute health risk. For example, between 2014 and 2016, there were 32
       nitrate treatment-plant failures reported in Washington. Nitrate is an acute
       contaminant. Each treatment plant failure resulted in a nitrate MCL violation and
       a bottled water advisory. While operators did do daily nitrate monitoring,
       continuous monitoring would have provided more timely notification and
       lowered public exposure to an acute drinking water contaminant.
      pH: A significant rise or drop pH, can make treatment ineffective, cause water
       quality effects in the distribution systems, lead to treatment technique violations,
       and, in extreme cases, place public health at risk.
      Conductivity: Water systems most often use conductivity to monitor high-
       pressure membranes, such as reverse osmosis and nanofiltration units, and to
       confirm that the membranes are intact.

You can find additional information on the design of alarms for water treatment plants
in Testing Critical Alarms (DOH 331-472) and the “Policy Statement on
Automated/Unattended Operation of Surface Water Treatment Plants” in the
Recommended Standards for Water Works (Ten State Standards, 2012). Although the
authors intended these references primarily for surface-water treatment plants, the
information applies to other situations, such as water systems with installed corrosion
control, pH adjustment, or continuous source disinfection.

Alarm conditions normally trigger audible or visual notification to the operator and
other personnel. If a water treatment facility will often be unattended, the engineer
should consider an alarm that will automatically dial the relevant water system staff and
shutdown the treatment plant—especially if a treatment process failure could result in
an acute health risk. After an alarm automatically shuts down a treatment plant, it
should not be able to restart until an operator is physically present at the treatment
plant. Some treatment plants that restarted automatically led to process failures putting
the health of consumers at risk.

10.4.3      Operations, Start-up, and Testing
The ongoing maintenance and operation of a water treatment facility is essential to
ensuring the long-term success of a project and protecting public health. Even the
smallest and simplest treatment facility should have a back-up operator identified, so
that public health does not suffer if the primary operator becomes ill, needs to attend to
family matters, takes leave, or participates in required training and professional
development opportunities.

Operations
Project reports for treatment facilities must address operation of the completed project
(WAC 246-290-110(4)(h)). The design engineer and public water system should work
together with an experienced certified water-treatment plant operator to develop a
staffing plan and include it in the project report they submit to DOH for review and
approval. The staffing plan should:
        Establish the water system’s legal obligation to remain fully staffed even on
         holidays and weekends, and to maintain the treatment plant facilities. It also
         should describe the corrective actions it will face if it fails to do either.
        Identify the organization or people responsible for operating the proposed
         facility, their required qualifications, and their responsibilities in the plant.
        Prepare a draft Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet and identify the correct
         treatment plant classification. The worksheet is on our Operator Certification
         webpage.
        Describe the training program for new operators.
        Describe the succession planning process for replacing operators who leave or
         retire.
        Describe back-up staffing if one or more existing operators are unable to perform
         tasks.
        Evaluate the number of staff required for safe and reliable operations,
         considering such factors as:
         o Treatment Technology: Complex treatment technologies and those with
           multiple treatment objectives require more operator oversight than simple
           treatment systems. Treatment for primary contaminants may have a higher
           consequence of failure and need more attention.
         o Location: It may be difficult for small plants to attract and retain highly
           certified operators, especially plants in remote locations. For those plants,
           simpler technologies less prone to failure are more appropriate than complex
           treatment processes requiring a higher level of operator certification. In-plant

          training programs are essential in these areas to ensure new operators are
          trained, qualified, and readily available.
       o Automation: A well-trained operator is essential to ensure public health
         protection. Automation can help to improve process control and ensure
         smooth operations when treatment plants are unattended, but cannot replace
         a well-trained professional to oversee operations and take action if an
         equipment or process failure occurs.
       o Water Quality: A source with multiple water quality issues may require more
         time for staff to make treatment adjustments to meet water quality goals. The
         project report should identify seasonal or other variations that could affect
         staffing needs.
       o Treatment Capacity: Larger treatment facilities have more equipment and
         instrumentation than smaller treatment facilities. Thus, they require more staff
         time just to keep the facility in good working condition, and the
         consequences of failure are more significant.
       o Plant or System Layout: A compact plant or system with centrally located
         controls requires a smaller staff than a facility spread over a larger area.

Section 11.4.4 has additional staffing considerations for surface-water treatment
facilities, and Chapter 11 covers operations and monitoring requirements at these
facilities.

Start-up and Testing
The start-up and testing of a treatment plant is a complex operation. Project reports
must include proposed methods and schedules for start-up and testing (WAC 246-290-
110(4)(h)). Engineers may revise these methods and schedules as needed prior to
completing construction. Schedules should include the anticipated start-up date and
proposed testing duration. Methods should identify specific standards and the persons
involved. Engineers may cite general methods and schedules in the project report and
refine them in the construction documents.

Final plans should identify the persons involved and their specific roles in the start-up
and testing. The plans also should identify the specific criteria the engineer will use to
determine whether it is safe to serve the treated water to consumers, test the treatment
equipment, prove reliable operations, and affirm water quality standards. The criteria is
project specific. It could range from simple grab samples for chemical addition
processes to detailed evaluation criteria for multiple processes in complex treatment
facilities.

Prior to start-up, meetings involving the design engineers, contractors, and others
should occur. They will help to ensure a smooth and successful start-up for the new
treatment plant. See Section 10.9 (Putting a Water Treatment Plant into Service) for
additional information on start-up requirements and recommendations. If the project
receives funding from our Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, you should
include provisions for these meetings in the project specifications and contract
documents.

For large or complex water-treatment plants, engineers should submit a start-up and
testing plan separate from the project report and construction documents.

See Section 10.9 for additional information the engineer must address before putting
any new or modified water treatment facility into service.

10.4.4      Treatment System Reliability
Treatment reliability means the failure of a single component will not result in delivery
of unsatisfactory drinking water to consumers. Engineers must design water treatment
facilities to meet minimum water quality standards at all times (WAC 246-290-200(2)
and 420(1)). Guidance on treatment-process reliability is in published design references
(AWWA/ASCE 2012e; Ten State Standards 2012).

Reliability is especially important to public health when a treatment process failure
presents an acute health risk. Examples include groundwater requiring 4-log virus
inactivation, nitrate removal, and surface water treatment. Drinking water standards and
rule codify the appropriate application of continuous on-line analyzers and alarms. For
example:
        4-log virus inactivation of groundwater: Water systems serving more than
         3,300 people and required to provide 4-log virus inactivation of groundwater
         must have continuous chlorine residual monitoring and alarms installed (WAC
         246-290-453 and -485).
        Nitrate: Treatment plants for nitrate removal should have an on-line finished
         water nitrate analyzer (Section 2.9 of Ten State Standards 2012). Design engineers
         that do not propose to install an on-line analyzer should provide an equivalent
         level of process monitoring and assurance of public health protection if a
         treatment process failure occurs.
        Surface water treatment: Surface water treatment plants must have monitoring
         and alarm devices that measure and warn of critical treatment process failures
         (WAC 246-290-678). See Chapter 11 for details on reliability for surface water
         treatment plants.

10.5      Construction Documents
Before installing new or expanded treatment facilities, water systems must obtain DOH
approval of the final construction documents (WAC 246-290-120). The construction
document submittal must include detailed drawings and specifications. Some small
projects may include relevant specifications on the construction drawings, if applicable.
Chapter 3 summarizes the information that must be in all construction document
submittals. Design engineers should review the checklists in Appendix A to confirm they
meet the minimum submittal requirements.



10.6      Treatment Chemicals
All treatment chemicals must be used within the maximum application dosages listed in
NSF/ANSI Standard 60 (WAC 246-290-220(3)). In water treatment facilities, the improper
storage and application of treatment chemicals may present a potential hazard, similar
to that at an industrial or chemical plant. Treatment plants and some distribution
treatment facilities store large quantities of chemicals, such as chlorine gas, hypochlorite
compounds, aluminum sulfate, caustic soda, fluoride compounds, potassium
permanganate, ammonia, and numerous proprietary organic polymers. Typical
treatment practices feed these products directly into treated potable water or water
being processed into potable water.

Chemical addition, when uncontrolled, can result in a dangerous overfeed due to
improper design, operation, or maintenance of feed equipment. Specific risks include
component failure, backflow, and backsiphonage. Design manuals provide information
and recommendations for preventing these types of failures (Recommended Standards
for Water Works (Ten State Standards 2012) or Water Fluoridation Principles and
Practices (AWWA 2016)). Important considerations when designing of the chemical feed
system include:
      Chemical overfeed prevention.
      Safe storage and handling.
      Cross-connection control.

10.6.1     Chemical Overfeed Prevention and Feed Systems
Injecting chemicals into the water supply always poses some potential of overfeed if
equipment is not designed, installed, operated, or maintained properly. Overfeeds of
ammonia, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and fluoride have been reported (Brender et al.
1998; AWWA 1993; AWWA 2016; Lee et al. 2002).


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  266
Operation and maintenance errors, design flaws, mechanical failure, installation errors,
or a combination of factors can cause these failures. Documented failures include:
      Ammonia Overfeed. A water system moved an ammonia injection point
       downstream in the process to increase free chlorine contact time prior to
       chloramine formation; and, the hydraulic head on the bulk storage tank was
       sufficient to allow ammonia to flow into the main without pumping. The
       antisiphon valve designed to prevent overfeed failed, allowing the full bulk
       storage tank to empty into the water system. Operators failed to recognize the
       problem despite unusually high pH values and unusually low chlorine residuals.
      Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) Overfeed. To control corrosion, the water
       system treated a well supply with sodium hydroxide. When operators closed the
       distribution system valves to complete a main repair, the pressure at the well
       increased significantly, reducing well production from 450 gpm to less than 85
       gpm. The caustic feed system was not flow paced. As a result, the pH of the water
       eventually reached 13. Two people who drank water from a nearby public
       fountain received mouth and throat burns. The pressure and pH build-up
       occurred over a two-day period; daily inspection of the well and treatment
       system would have caught the problem sooner.
      Fluoride Overfeed. In 1992, an incident in Hooper Bay, Alaska, caused 1 death
       and about 262 illnesses. An incorrectly wired circuit for the fluoride feed pump (in
       parallel instead of in series) allowed fluoride solution to pump into the water
       system even though the source wasn’t operating. This “slug” of fluoride (up to
       150 mg/L) was delivered to customers.
      Chlorine Overfeed. A computer controller card on a rate-of-flow controller
       malfunctioned, failing to shut down the chlorination circuit when the well sources
       (controlled by reservoir levels) shut off. Nearby customers noticed the continued
       injection of chlorinated water when the well sources were called on again, and
       the water was delivered to the distribution system.

Design elements and appropriate standard operating procedures (SOPs) can minimize
the potential for overfeed. Below are some design items engineers should consider to
minimize the risk of overfeeds. See Appendix F.2 for design elements to reduce the
potential for fluoride overfeed.
   1. Include day tanks when the system needs to use large bulk volumes of treatment
      chemicals. Size the day tanks to store no more than 30 hours of supply and have
      an operator fill the tanks in a controlled manner (Ten State Standards, 2012).
      These tanks promote daily inspection of the feed systems, and reduce the
      magnitude of an overfeed.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 267
   2. Evaluate the failure modes of the equipment, and add redundant safeguards if
      needed. In the chlorine and fluoride overfeed examples cited above, a redundant
      flow switch wired in series with the feed pumps would have stopped the chemical
      injection system after it detected a lack of treated water flow. Alternately,
      engineers should consider the feasibility of installing flow-based chemical feed
      control.
   3. Select chemical injection points to minimize the potential for siphoning or
      hydraulically draining chemical storage tanks, even if their design includes
      antisiphon features.
   4. Include continuous monitoring equipment with integrated alarms (pH, chlorine,
      fluoride). In some cases, you should provide redundant monitoring equipment. It
      is appropriate for these alarms to shut down the equipment automatically (see
      Section 10.4.2).
   5. Consider the capacity of the operator(s) to operate, control, and maintain the
      water-treatment plant facilities properly. Operator error, or operator inattention,
      caused or aggravated several of the overfeed incidents described above. SOPs
      should tell operators how to react to unexpected changes in water quality
      parameters (increasing or decreasing pH, values outside “normal” ranges, and
      other issues).
   6. Focus SOPs on routine equipment maintenance. For example, water systems
      should inspect their antisiphon valves periodically and replace them as needed.
   7. Provide appropriate cross-connection control (see Section 10.7).

10.6.2      Safe Chemical Storage and Handling
Engineers should carefully consider chemical delivery and storage when designing water
treatment plants. Improper delivery, storage, or use may result in a toxic or explosive
environment. For example, sodium hypochlorite mixed with ferric chloride or aluminum
sulfate (alum) releases chlorine gas. Calcium hypochlorite mixed with acids or brought
into contact with combustible materials (oil, grease, kerosene, gasoline, paint products)
may cause a fire or explosion.

The design engineer should discuss the safe use and storage of treatment chemicals
with the local fire marshal, building code officials, and other authorities responsible for
implementing regulations as part of the design process. General design considerations
should include:
        Make eyewash and shower stations with tempered water accessible to operators
         and delivery personnel.
        Provide containment around chemical storage and feed facilities.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   268
      Use seismic bracing, supports, and pipe design to prevent damage to chemical
       storage and handling facilities in an earthquake.
      Separate delivery, storage, and feed facilities for strong oxidants, such as gaseous
       chlorine or calcium hypochlorite.
      Clearly label chemical fill ports, piping, and storage tanks with the chemical used.
      Put locks on every chemical fill port to prevent access when the operator isn’t
       present.
      Install covered spill containment around chemical fill ports.
      Provide equipment to contain and scrub chlorine gas.
      Meet egress and ingress requirements for rooms or areas with chemical storage
       and feed facilities.
      Comply with all applicable OSHA and WISHA standards, such as signage, safety
       gear, training, atmospheric monitoring devices, ventilation, and eyewash and
       safety shower location.
      Put EPA requirements in the Risk Management Program if the system stores large
       volumes of chemicals, such as 2,500 pounds or more of chlorine gas.

Water systems often use hypochlorite for disinfection and other water treatment
purposes, so you may find the following information useful.

Sodium Hypochlorite. Concentrated sodium hypochlorite solution (5.25% to 12.5%) is
a corrosive liquid with a pH of greater than 11. Therefore, the operator should use
precautions typical for handling corrosive materials, such as avoiding contact with
metals, including stainless steel. The design should provide spill containment for the
sodium hypochlorite storage tanks. Typical spill containment structures have separate
containment areas for each incompatible chemical and no uncontrolled floor drains.
They are large enough to contain the entire contents of the largest tank plus rain or
water from fire sprinklers. Bulk sodium hypochlorite should be stored at a concentration
of no more than 3 percent chlorine by weight.

Calcium Hypochlorite. Calcium hypochlorite is an oxidant. As such, systems should
store it separately from organic materials that could readily oxidize. It also should be
stored away from sources of heat. Improperly stored calcium hypochlorite has caused
spontaneous combustion fires.
Other: Chemicals commonly used in water treatment plants that may require special
design and handling considerations include:
      Primary coagulants, such as alum and ferric chloride.

        Strong oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, and
         ozone.
        Strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide,
        Strong acids, such as citric, fluorosilicic, and phosphoric acids,

and use of common water treatment chemicals in sources, such as:

         2012e)



10.7        Cross-Connection Control for Water Treatment Facilities
Protecting drinking water from contamination starts at the source and continues
through treatment facilities designed to improve water quality. In water treatment
facilities, this protection requires engineers to incorporate safeguards into their designs.

In water treatment facilities, the improper storage and application of chemicals presents
a potential cross-connection hazard similar to that found in an industrial or chemical
plant. Treatment plants and some distribution treatment facilities store large quantities
of hazardous materials, such as chlorine, hypochlorite compounds, aluminum sulfate,
caustic soda, potassium permanganate, and numerous proprietary organic polymers. In
typical treatment practice, these products feed directly into treated potable water or
into water being processed into potable water. Most treatment works also contain
significant quantities of raw, or incompletely treated water.

Potable water in a treatment facility is often at atmospheric pressure. This increases the
potential for cross contamination, particularly due to backflow or backsiphonage, which
could involve treatment chemicals, and raw or partially treated water.

10.7.1      Premises Isolation
Premises isolation involves protecting the water supply by installing backflow prevention
assemblies, usually at or near the point where water enters a building or facility. Because
the chemical hazards in a waterworks facility can be identical to those in industrial
facilities, engineers must equip the potable water service line(s) to a water treatment
plant with an air gap or reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPBA) (WAC 246-290-
490).

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   270
Because premises isolation does not protect against backflow within the plant, the
treatment facility should provide separate “potable” and “process” supply systems within
the building(s). Many water treatment facilities require a separate potable water supply
system to supply lavatory or kitchen sinks, eyewash and shower facilities, drinking
fountains, and other human consumptive uses. Process water uses in a water treatment
plant may include diluting treatment chemicals, carrying concentrated feed solutions,
driving eductors, mixing, and supplying surface washers.

10.7.2     Cross-Connection Control inside the Water Treatment Plant
To protect the quality and safety of the plant’s potable water supply, engineers must
equip each potable water connection to the plant process-water supply system with an
approved air gap, a reduce pressure backflow assembly, or both (WAC 246-290-490).
Design engineers should limit potable water to supply unit treatment processes from no
more than two discrete points. See Table 4-4 of Cross Connection Control: Accepted
Procedures and Practice Manual (PNWS-AWWA, 1996). In addition, wherever the plant
process water supply system supplies multiple processes, engineers should protect each
process (“fixture”) against backflow to protect the integrity of the process water system.

For example, the engineer should equip the process water supply to an upflow fluoride
saturator (see Appendix F.2) with a reduced pressure backflow assembly or approved air
gap to prevent fluoride backflow into the process supply to the gas chlorine eductor.
This approach is called “fixture” protection. In water-treatment plant design, cross-
connection control should incorporate premise isolation and fixture protection
principles. Table 10-3 lists backflow prevention assemblies for water treatment plant
equipment and processes.

To identify piping more easily, we recommend that design engineers use a piping color
code to identify potable and process water lines. See description in Ten State Standards
2012.

Some common backflow situations and their associated requirements:
   1. Discharge to waste: There must be an approved air gap between all process
      water and waste path, and all finished water and waste path.
   2. Gaseous chlorinators and ammonia feed: There must be a reduced pressure
      backflow assembly (RPBA) between the potable water supply and the gas
      chlorine or gas ammonia-water mixing point (“eductor”). There must be no
      branching of solution lines downstream of a gas eductor to water at different


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 271
       stages of treatment (e.g., raw water, prefilter, and post-filter). These branch lines
       are potential cross connections between inferior and superior quality water.
   3. Sample lines to process monitoring instruments: There must be no branching
      of sample lines to water at different stages of treatment (e.g., raw water, prefilter,
      and post-filter). These branch lines are potential cross connections between
      inferior and superior quality water.
   4. Upflow saturators (for all chemical compounds, including sodium fluoride):
      There must be an RPBA between the potable water supply and the upflow
      saturation tank.
   5. Down-flow saturators and other hard-plumbed piping to chemical feed
      solution tanks: There must be an air gap or RPBA between the potable water
      supply and the chemical solution tank.
   6. Erosion feed systems: When used in combination with a secondary tank, there
      must be an RPBA or air gap to protect the potable water supply from any holding
      tank. Evaluate erosion feeders on a case-by-case basis to ensure you install
      adequate backflow prevention.
   7. Solution tanks without approved air gaps (i.e., filled by a hose): There must
      be an RPBA between the drinking water supply and the hose bib(s) used to fill the
      solution tank(s). All hose bibs should have a hose bib vacuum breaker.
   8. Membrane filtration clean-in-place systems. Water systems need to mitigate
      cross-connection control risks to prevent chemicals used in the membrane
      cleaning process from contaminating the feed or filtrate streams during both the
      clean-in-place (CIP) process and under normal operation. This situation presents
      a unique challenge because pipe-flow directions change during membrane plant
      cleaning, precluding the use of normal cross-connection control devices. Water
      systems need two key design elements working in unison to minimize the risk
      that chemicals used in the membrane cleaning process enter the treated water:
       a. At least two valves working together to isolate the cleaning chemicals, so that
          failure of a single valve does not place consumers at risk.
       b. An observable vent to atmosphere, so an operator can see the leakage when
          a valve fails.
       The most common approach used to achieve this risk isolation is to place
       double-block and bleed valves in three locations: 1) on the feed line to each bank
       or skid; 2) on the filtrate line leaving each bank or skid; and 3) on the CIP feed
       line. See EPA’s Membrane Filtration Guidance Manual for further details (USEPA
       2005).



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    272
Engineers usually equip treatment heads on ion exchange reactors that rely on brine
regeneration with a common line for filling and withdrawing water. These installations
create, use, and regenerate the brine solution and do not require backflow protection.
The treatment head design precludes the possibility of backflow conditions during
normal operation.

10.7.3      Other Design Considerations
There should be backsiphonage control at the point of chemical injection into the public
drinking water supply to protect against overfeed . We recommend applying the
following standards.
   1. All liquid chemical feed systems: Install one diaphragm-type antisiphon device
      at the head of the metering pump (spring-loaded diaphragm in the closed
      position). If feeding fluoride, hydroxide, or an acid, install a second antisiphon
      device at the injection point.
   2. Potable water as transport carrier solution (e.g., gas chlorine, ammonia):
      Install one diaphragm-type antisiphon device at the injection point into the
      potable water carrier pipe (diaphragm spring-loaded in the closed position).

Other ways the design can minimize the risk of chemical overfeed are in Part 5 of the
Recommended Standards for Water Works (Ten State Standards, 2012).

10.7.4      Common Wall Construction in Treatment Facilities
Engineers must avoid the cross-connection contamination risk associated with failure of
a common wall between untreated or partially treated (nonpotable) and finished water
(filtered). Common walls may be structural or piping.
        Structural walls: Although this is a greater concern for package-filtration
         treatment plants, it could apply to any treatment process designed with adjacent
         walls between various unit processes. In surface water treatment applications,
         engineers should design double-wall separation (an air space) between unfiltered
         water (flocculation and sedimentation basins) and filtered water (underdrains and
         clearwell). This will allow operators to check for fractures in either wall (the air
         space will fill with water). See Chapter 11 for further details.
        Piping through filter media: There must be no air supply or other piping
         installed vertically through filter media. The pipe represents a direct conduit
         between unfiltered and filtered water.

10.8         Water Treatment Plant Wastewater Disposal
Design engineers should evaluate waste-product issues early because they could
significantly affect the cost or feasibility of a proposed treatment approach or
technology. Water treatment processes can generate a variety of liquid-waste streams:
       Backwash waste from filtration processes.
       Brine waste from ion exchange treatment.
       Concentrate high in dissolved solids from reverse osmosis and nanofiltration
        processes.
       Filter-to-waste streams from filtration processes.
       Waste chemicals from membrane cleaning processes (clean-in-place waste).
       Discharge from on-line instrumentation, such as chlorine residual analyzers, pH
        analyzers, and turbidimeters.
       Other concentrate streams from clarification and sedimentation processes,
        usually only found in plants that treat surface water.

There is detailed guidance on treating, processing, and otherwise managing these liquid
waste streams in a number of professional references (AWWA/ASCE 2012c; Kawamura
2000a; AWWA 1999; Ten State Standards 2012).

Some design engineers may consider recycling water from the backwash process.
However, the recycled water may contain higher levels of turbidity, pathogens, or
treatment chemicals than the source water. Therefore, to recycle water from backwash,
engineers should consider:
       Backwash holding tank sanitary integrity: If designing a system to use
        backwash recycling for groundwater sources, the engineer should design the
        backwash holding-tank similar to a treated water reservoir. This will minimize the
        risk of any pathogen entering the recycle stream.
       Determining required settling time: Settling time is a key design parameter
        when sizing a backwash holding-tank. Engineers can use settling columns to
        estimate the time required to separate the supernatant from the solids.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                                        275
      Reintroducing the backwash supernatant: Recycle the supernatant back into
       the treatment process at a point prior to the addition of any chemical. Limit the
       supernatant recycle flow-rate to no more than 10 percent of the plant influent
       flow-rate to minimize the risk of process upset. Recycled supernatant in surface
       water treatment plants must enter the main flow stream at a point prior to
       addition of the primary coagulant (WAC 246-290-660(4)). Check to be sure
       recycling does not hydraulically overload any part of the treatment process.
      Monitoring the supernatant backwash: In addition to monitoring and
       controlling the flow rate on the supernatant, the system should continuously
       monitor the turbidity of the supernatant stream. Turbidity is not a regulated
       parameter for groundwater sources, but it is a useful parameter for surface water
       and groundwater treatment plants to use when measuring the quantity of solids
       in the supernatant and minimizing the risk of overloading the filters with recycled
       solids.
      Discarding solids from the backwash recycle process: Sometimes the settled
       material concentrates. It is more challenging to discard the waste into a sanitary
       sewer when the concentrate is naturally occurring metals, such as arsenic, iron,
       and manganese. Engineers should consider other means of disposal, such as
       drying solids for disposal at the landfill or using geotextile tubes to capture the
       solids.
      Emergency disposal of backwash water: The engineer’s design should include
       a way to dispose of backwash water if a treatment process upset overwhelms the
       recycle process. Emergency disposal could include disposal to land, a drainage
       ditch or a sanitary sewer so that the treatment process can function properly and
       public health is protected.

The Department of Ecology manages the permitting process for wastewater discharges
from water treatment plants (WTPs). Ecology considers WTPs that discharge wastewater
as industrial dischargers, whether they discharge their wastewater to the land, surface
water, or local public treatment works.

Ecology may issue a general or individual permit.
General Permits: Ecology permits wastewater discharged from a water-treatment
filtration process under its combined National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) and State Waste Discharge General Permit. All eligible facilities must apply for
coverage. See Table 10-4.

A general permit covers all wastewater discharge from a WTP if it meets all of the
following criteria:

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 276
      The WTP is not covered by an NPDES waste discharge individual permit.
      The primary function of the WTP is to produce water for potable or industrial use.
      The WTP produces an average of 35,000 gallons per day or more of finished
       water, as determined on an average monthly basis.
      The WTP discharges its wastewater directly to surface water. It also can discharge
       to a settling pond or basin if the overflow from them can flow to surface water.
       Surface water includes lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, wetlands,
       marine waters, estuaries, and all other fresh or brackish waters and watercourses,
       plus drainages to those waterbodies.
      A water-treatment filtration process produced the discharged wastewater (filter
       backwash, sedimentation or presedimentation basin wash down, sedimentation
       or clarification, or filter-to-waste).
      The discharged wastewater is not produced from ion exchange, reverse osmosis,
       or slow sand filtration.

If a WTP that produces an average of 35,000 gallons per day or more of finished water
meets all of the following conditions, Ecology considers it “conditionally exempt” from
operating under the general permit requirements for filter backwash wastewater
discharges.*
      The WTP discharges its filter backwash wastewater to the ground so that most of
       the liquid either evaporates or infiltrates to the subsurface. However, the area
       receiving the discharge must not contain highly permeable soils, must not lie
       directly above a shallow aquifer, must not lie above an aquifer with limited
       recharge, or lie in a location where groundwater quality appears to be
       threatened.
      WTP should discharge to a drain field, infiltration pond, or trench only when
       discharge to land application (irrigation) or a grass-lined swale is not possible.
       The state Underground Injection Control Act prohibits discharge to a “dry well.”
      Infiltration ponds and trenches must have sufficient freeboard to prevent over-
       topping and water systems must manage them to prevent any reasonable
       potential for discharge to surface water.
      The wastewater must be free of additives and any amount of toxic material
       greater than “de minimis” that could reach the waters of the state.
      The volume of the discharge and the concentration of dissolved solids do not
       demonstrate a reasonable potential to contaminate groundwater.
      Discharge must not cause soil erosion or deterioration of land features.

       Residual solids that accumulate in infiltration ponds and trenches must be
        disposed of as necessary to avoid a build-up and concentration of these
        materials.
       Disposal of solids must be consistent with requirements of the local health
        jurisdiction.

* This exemption is subject to Ecology’s periodic review of WTP processes and discharge characteristics.
  Part of Ecology’s review includes determining whether a “reasonable potential to pollute” exists, based
  on defined EPA methods. See Table 10-4.


WTPs that produce an actual average of less than 35,000 gpd of finished water do not
require a permit to discharge filter backwash wastewater (filter backwash, sedimentation
or presedimentation basin wash down, sedimentation or clarification, or filter-to-waste).
Ecology determined that generally, such WTPs have no reasonable potential to pollute.
See Table 10-5.

Ecology excludes wastewater discharges from WTPs that employ ion exchange, reverse
osmosis, or slow sand filtration from coverage under its General Permit. Depending on
site-specific circumstances, Ecology may require such WTPs to obtain coverage under an
individual permit. Design engineers employing ion exchange or reverse osmosis should
evaluate waste generation issues early and consult with Ecology because waste
discharge permit requirements could significantly affect the cost or feasibility of the
proposed treatment. See Table 10-6.

Ecology’s webpage on general permits for water treatment plants provides a link to the
current general permit, and a link to the general permit fact sheet. The fact sheet
explains how Ecology developed the general permit conditions, presents the legal basis
for permit conditions, and provides background information on water treatment
facilities.

Disposing Analyzer Reagent Waste
Due to the small volumes and low toxicity, Ecology typically does not require a
discharge permit for disposing analyzer reagent waste streams to ground. However,
Ecology does require facilities to implement appropriate best management practices
and all known, available, and reasonable methods of prevention, control, and treatment.
Ecology’s position is:
       Water systems must not discharge this wastewater to surface water.
       Water systems should discharge this wastewater to the sanitary sewer if at all
        possible.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                                278
      If discharge to the sanitary sewer is not possible, water systems should discharge
       the wastewater to the ground in a way to maximize evaporation of the reagent.
       The water system must own the discharge site and it should be as far away as
       possible from any drinking water supply. Runoff from the discharge site may not
       flow off the water system property.



10.9      Placing a Water Treatment Plant into Service
Before a water system can place a water treatment plant into service, it must properly
test, inspect, and disinfect it (WAC 246-290-120(4)). A licensed engineer must complete
a Construction Completion Report Form (DOH 331-121) and submit it to DOH before a
water system uses treatment facilities to serve water to the public (WAC 246-290-
120(5)).

It is often useful to have one or more meeting(s) with all parties involved in the design,
construction and operation of a treatment facility in the weeks or months before start-
up. These parties include representatives of the:
      Construction manager
      Design engineer
      Prime contractor
      Operators
      Owner
      Regulatory staff. Usually the DOH regional engineer.

Such a meeting can help facilitate a smooth start-up and help to address issues that
arise during the start-up process.

Water treatment plants often consist of a collection of pipes, pumps, reservoirs and
valves. As such, the following sections in this manual should be reviewed for relevant
information about placing water treatment plant components into service:
      Section 6.6 Placing a Water Main Into Service
      Section 7.7 Placing a Reservoir into Service
      Section 8.5 Placing a Booster Pump Station into Service

There can be water quality issues associated with the start-up of any treatment facility
that could compromise the safety of the water supply. At the very least, samples of
regulated water quality parameters should be collected to demonstrate that the process
is effective.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   279
Process reliability is another concern associated with start-up of a treatment plant. For
this reason, the water treatment plant should initially send treated water to waste long
enough to demonstrate that the process works reliably. The duration of sending treated
water to waste can range from a few hours to a couple of days depending on the plant’s
treatment objective and treatment process(es) used. For biological processes, such as
slow sand filtration, the plant may need to send treated water to waste for several
weeks. The plant should identify provisions for waste disposal when it may produce
large volumes of water as part of start-up.

The plant should test the critical alarms for on-line instrumentation by adjusting the
water quality to the instrument, or the alarm set points to make sure the alarms function
and all communication systems work. In addition, the plant should ensure that readings
from the local instrument controller match the information recorded in the Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. See Section 10.4.2 for additional
information on process control, including monitoring, instrumentation, and alarms.

In some cases, bringing a new treatment plant or significant process on-line may cause
hydraulic and water quality changes to the distribution system. Hydraulic changes, such
as flow reversals and changes in velocity and pressure in distribution system piping, can
lead to suspension of sediments deposited in mains and cause the loss of chlorine
residual, elevated turbidity, and customer complaints. Changes in water quality can
cause sediments and metals to release from pipe surfaces. As a result, additional
distribution system monitoring should be planned as part of placing a water treatment
plant into service. This additional monitoring may include additional rounds of tap
sampling as required under the Lead and Copper Rule (See Section 10.1.3 and 40 CFR
141.86(d)(4)(vii)).

Most water treatment facilities must complete additional start-up and testing
requirements prior to certification of construction completion (WAC 246-290-120(4)).
See Section 10.4.3 for more information on start-up and testing for water treatment
facilities.

See Section 11.6 for additional information on placing a surface water treatment plant
into service.

 The main assumption for this table is that wastes and discharges are "typical," i.e., they do not contain
 unusually large amounts of pollutants.
 Single domestic or point-of-use IX or RO systems do not require a state waste discharge permit
 because Ecology considers them to have no reasonable potential to pollute.

 pH/alkalinity adjustment

     --Chemical Addition            Caustic soda (NaOH), lime (Ca(OH) 2), soda ash (Na 2CO3), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3), calcium
                                    carbonate (CaCO 3), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) (USEPA, 1992; Economic and
                                    Engineering Services, 1990).

     --Calcite Contactor            Applies to small water systems (generally less than 500 people). No danger of chemical overfeed and is
                                    usually not operator intensive. Generally applies when Ca 2+ < 30 mg/L, alkalinity < 60 mg/L (both as
                                    CaCO3) and pH low (<7.2). Potential clogging due to Fe/Mn and other particulate matter. Waters with
                                    significant natural organic matter (>2 mg/L total organic carbon (TOC)) should be evaluated to ensure
                                    that organic deposits will not interfere with the dissolution of media over time.

     --Aeration/Air Stripping       Suitable for groundwater high in CO 2, effectiveness controlled by alkalinity and aeration system design,
                                    capital costs usually high, pre- or post-aeration disinfection should be provided. Pilot work to verify
                                    design parameters must be completed (for example, height, packing, air and water ratio).

 Calcium Carbonate Precipitation    Calcium carbonate precipitation is not a viable approach for corrosion control in the Pacific Northwest
                                    due to the region’s relatively soft waters.

 Inhibitors

     --Ortho - / Poly - / Blended   Phosphate based inhibitors are pH sensitive, so the pH range should be maintained with the range of 7.2
     Phosphates                     to 7.8. Since phosphate can increase biological activity in the distribution system, disinfection may be
                                    required along with the addition of phosphates.

     --Silicates                    Sodium silicate inhibitors are not well understood (USEPA 1992; Reiber 1990). Silicate effectiveness
                                    thought to be a combination of concurrent pH increase and protective film on piping walls.

 Technologies                               Notes

 Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)            A best available technology for VOC and SOC removal. May require prefiltration to remove particulate
                                            matter. Competition for GAC sorption sites with natural organic matter may occur. Seasonal increases
                                            in competing species may cause desorption of contaminant and must be fully evaluated. Requires
                                            reactivation of carbon on a regular basis (site and contaminant specific).

 Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)            May be effective for VOC and SOC removal, must provide adequate mixing and contact time, existing
                                            settling and filtration must effectively remove added PAC. May be used seasonally if problem is not
                                            continuous. EPA considers PAC an “emerging” technology for VOC removal (USEPA 1998).

 Aeration                                   A best available technology for VOC removal and some of the more volatile SOCs. Established
                                            technologies include packed tower, diffused, and multiple tray aeration. Some alternative
                                            configurations require evaluation through pilot studies (see WAC 246-290-250). Design goals and
                                            operational parameters control performance. Aerated water should be disinfected to prevent
                                            significant growth of heterotrophic plate count bacteria (Umphres et al. 1989).

 Chlorine or Ozone oxidation                Applies to glyphosate only. See Disinfection Section for specific issues related to these technologies.

Notes:
    1.   Pilot testing is required for all technologies listed above, and may be required over periods of varying water temperature, and varying contaminant
         concentrations, if applicable. See Section 10.3 below for additional pilot testing information.
    2.   Manufactured media and equipment must meet the requirements of WAC 246-290-220.

                                              Treatment Technologies for Reduction of DBPs
 Precursor Removal                         Notes
 Enhanced Coagulation                      Suitable only for conventional surface water plants. Nature of source water organic material, treatment
                                           conditions (coagulation pH) and background alkalinity control effectiveness. Requires significant
                                           coagulant doses. Required treatment technique according to the Stage 1 D/DBP Rule for surface water
                                           treatment plants that use conventional rapid rate filtration.
 Granular Activated Carbon                 GAC10 (empty bed contact time of 10 minutes) and reactivation period of carbon of no more than
                                           every six months. This is a best available technology for removing DBP precursors, although
                                           performance depends on the selected GAC and the nature of the organic matter to be removed.
 Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)           Suitable for conventional rapid rate surface water plants and potentially membrane plants. Effectiveness
                                           depends on the nature of the organic matter present; this must be demonstrated through a long-term
                                           pilot study (at least 1 year of operation).
 Biologically Active Filtration            Use preozonation followed by a rapid rate filtration process. Filter media may be GAC, anthracite, sand,
                                           or some combination. TOC removal in the 20 to 70 percent range possible, dependent on the nature of
                                           the organics present, ozone dose, and filter contact time (Carlson and Amy 1998).
 Slow Sand Filtration                      Standard slow sand filtration expected to remove 5 to 25 percent of source water organic matter (as
                                           TOC). Using preozonation will increase removal; however, a long-term pilot is required (at least 1 year
                                           of operation) to determine effectiveness and effect on filter cleaning requirements (Eighmy et al. 1993).
 Membranes                                 Nanofiltration can effectively remove DBP precursors. Unamended ultra- or microfiltration will not
                                           generally remove precursors. Use of PAC in ultrafiltration water systems has been effectively
                                           demonstrated (AwwaRF et al. 1996).
 DBP Removal or Mitigation
 Aeration                                  Some volatile DBP (such as chloroform) can be significantly removed through appropriately designed
                                           aeration processes (Billeo et al. 1986; Walfoort et al. 2008). Temperature and air-water ratio are
                                           significant design factors.
 Alternative Disinfection or Application   Using chloramines in distribution systems with long detention times, ozone, or chlorine dioxide as a
                                           primary disinfectant may sufficiently mitigate the formation of regulated DBPs. See Table 10-4 for
                                           issues specific to these approaches.

Chapter 11: Surface Water Treatment

11.0      Introduction
This chapter covers important concepts unique to the design of treatment facilities for
surface water sources and sources designated as groundwater under the direct influence
of surface water (GWI). Surface water and confirmed GWI sources must meet the same
regulatory requirements and are synonymous throughout this section. These sources
carry a high microbial risk. As a result, the basic treatment framework requires the
following minimum level of treatment always be achieved:
      2-log removal or inactivation of Cryptosporidium oocysts,
      3-log removal or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts, and
      4-log removal or inactivation of viruses.

For poor quality surface water sources with the highest risk of contamination, and for
water systems seeking approval for a Limited Alternative to Filtration (see Policy F.10),
Washington state rules may require a greater level of treatment than the basic
framework of federal rules outlined above.

Washington’s basic regulatory requirements for surface water treatment facilities are in
Chapter 246-290 WAC Part 6. These requirements stem from multiple federal rules
developed over the past three decades. They include the Surface Water Treatment Rule
(SWTR), Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR), Long Term 1 Enhanced
Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR), Filter Backwash Recycle Rule (FBRR), and Long
Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2ESWTR). Effective implementation of
these rules and consumer protection depends on a multiple barrier framework:
      Effective source-water protection, filtration, and disinfection.
      Maintenance of treated water quality within the distribution system.
      Trained and properly certified operators to oversee the process.

This chapter is similar to Chapter 10, with the following sections narrowly tailored to
surface water treatment issues:
      Alternatives Analysis (Section 11.1).
      Treatment Technologies (Section 11.2) including:
       o Clarification and Sedimentation.
       o Filtration.
       o Disinfection.

      Predesign Studies (Section 11.3) including pilot studies.
      Project Reports (Section 11.4) including identifying:
       o Design Criteria.
       o Process Control: Monitoring, Instrumentation, and Alarms.
       o Start-up and Testing Procedures.
       o Operations and Staffing.
       o Process Reliability.
      Operations Program (Section 11.5).
      Placing a Surface Water Treatment Plant into Service (Section 11.6).

Design engineers should familiarize themselves with the contents of Chapter 10; it
covers some design topics not covered elsewhere.
      Construction Documents (Section 10.5)
      Treatment Chemicals (Section 10.6)
      Cross Connection for Water Treatment Facilities (Section 10.7)
      Waste Residuals Management (Section 10.8)

Design engineers need to consider many factors in developing surface water treatment
projects. Source water quality and quantity will change seasonally and from year to year.
In addition, surface waters have a greater microbial risk than groundwater sources.
Therefore, the design process may be iterative and require a more thorough
characterization of the source water, longer and more detailed pilot studies, and a well-
planned commissioning process. As such, it takes much longer to develop a surface
water treatment project than it takes to develop other types of projects. Figure 2-3
outlines the general design and review process for water treatment projects.



11.1      Alternatives Analysis
A surface water treatment facility is a major capital investment with high life-cycle costs
and a potential high risk to public health if treatment processes fail to operate as
intended. Therefore, the engineer must evaluate all appropriate and applicable
alternatives before selecting a particular treatment technology and design approach
(WAC 246-290-110(4)(c)).

The engineer should cover the following items in the alternatives analysis and apply the
detailed guidance provided in professional references:
      Source capacity and projected demands.

DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                         298
        Source water protection.
        Source water quality.
        Operational complexity, reliability, and staffing.
        Secondary effects of water treatment (see Chapter 10).
        Waste disposal and management (see Chapter 10).
        Life cycle costs (see Chapter 10).

11.1.1      Source Capacity and Projected Demands
Surface water sources are more prone to changes in flow from year to year than
groundwater sources. In addition, some watersheds are experiencing prolonged
hydrologic shifts as a result of global warming (Mote et al. 2005). These hydrologic shifts
include reduced snowpack and lower summer stream flows. Logging, wildfires, and
changes in land use also can cause adverse hydrologic shifts. In some cases, it may be
necessary to evaluate these hydrologic shifts when assessing the safe yield of the water
supply. In general, the safe yield of a surface water supply is the reliable withdrawal rate
of water that a watershed can provide through the critical drought period. See Section
5.8.1 for additional information on assessing the safe yield of surface water supplies.

Periodically, filters need to be taken out of service for backwashing (rapid rate filtration),
filter scraping and ripening (slow sand filtration), recovery cleaning (membrane
filtration), and general maintenance (all types of treatment). Because water systems
cannot always schedule these activities for periods of low demand, the design engineer
should consider the production capacity of the treatment process and the ability to
satisfy consumer demand with one filter out of service. In addition, water consumed
during backwash and filter to waste should be considered when analyzing the overall
process capacity, both on a daily and annual basis. See Chapter 4 for guidance on
establishing water system capacity.

11.1.2      Source Water Protection
Source water protection is an important barrier in the multiple barrier framework to
protect consumers from risks associated with surface water. As such, engineers must
develop a watershed control program for all surface water and GWI sources and include
it in the planning document for the water system (WAC 246-290-135(4)). The overall
purpose of the watershed control program is to assess and reduce microbial and
chemical contaminant risk in the source(s) supplying a treatment plant. Poor source
water protection can increase risks from pathogens, algae, and chemicals (pesticides and
herbicides), and present other risks and treatment challenges.

11.1.3      Source Water Quality
Source water and finished water quality objectives form the primary basis for selecting
treatment process alternatives. Higher quality sources present lower risks to public
health and are usually less expensive to treat, both initially and over the long term.
Therefore, water systems must obtain their source of supply from the highest quality
source feasible (WAC 246-290-130(1)). Engineers and water systems should consider
that logging, forest fires, and changes in land use could cause changes in water quality
(higher turbidity) and microbiological risks.

The extent and availability of raw water data may affect preliminary screening of
alternatives and the duration of the pilot study. Surface water and GWI sources can
experience rapid and seasonal changes in water quality. Source water characterization
should account for source water quality variability. For most surface water sources, the
design engineer should have at least one year of water quality information before
making a preliminary treatment method determination.

The scope of source water sampling will vary depending on the type of source water,
location of the intake, seasonal changes, and other issues. For example, rivers and
streams can experience rapid changes in turbidity and inorganic parameters associated
with changes in precipitation and runoff. Lakes and reservoirs often experience seasonal
water quality changes associated with algae growth, lake stratification, and turnover.
Basic water quality information needed to plan appropriately for a water treatment
facility includes:
        Turbidity: High turbidity can rapidly clog filters, triggering frequent backwashes
         and other operational issues such as coagulant demand and control. For these
         reasons, engineers should compile daily maximum and average monthly turbidity
         data for the source water.
        Temperature: Low temperature makes water more viscous, affecting head loss
         through filters (especially membrane filters) and the ripening time for slow sand
         filters. Temperatures less than 8°C can be challenging for rapid rate filtration
         (Kawamura 1999). Low temperature affects chemical disinfection processes,
         requiring more contact time or higher disinfectant residual concentrations to
         meet pathogen inactivation requirements.
        Microbiological Risk: The Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule
         requires all surface water sources to undergo source water quality monitoring to
         assess microbial risk. For a new source, the water system must submit to DOH a
         sample location description and schedule for monitoring planned under the
         LT2ESWTR (WAC 246-290-630(16)). The water system should include results of
         this monitoring in the project report. The concentration of coliform in the source

       water can also be useful in determining the suitability of various filtration
       technologies.
      Inorganic Parameters: Engineers should assess the seasonal variability of pH
       along with regulated inorganic contaminants. Some surface water treatment
       processes are sensitive to the pH and alkalinity of the source water. Surface
       waters in parts of Washington may require added alkalinity for effective and
       stable treatment. Conversely, the efficacy of free chlorine as a disinfectant
       decreases as pH increases. For lakes and reservoirs, seasonal turnover can result
       in sudden increases in iron and manganese. Significant changes in pH also can
       indicate algal issues with a source water.
      Volatile and Synthetic Organic Contaminants (VOCs and SOCs): We require a
       complete set of samples for VOCs and SOCs as part of the approval process for
       any new surface water source. Engineers should consider detection of a regulated
       VOC or SOC in source water in their watershed risk assessment, and address it in
       their treatment objectives.
      Total Organic Carbon (TOC): Natural organic matter can lead to the formation
       of disinfection byproducts. Natural organic matter measured in milligrams per
       liter (mg/L) of TOC or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) often turns water a pale
       tea color. UV absorbance at 254nm (UV254) is a good surrogate indicator of TOC
       and DOC once the relationship between UV254 and TOC and DOC is established
       for a given source water. Analyzing for UV254 is less expensive, less complicated,
       and easy to do onsite.
      Algae and Chlorophyll-a: Algae can cause filter-clogging, changes in source
       water pH, and taste and odor issues. Algae can be a health concern; some species
       of cyanobacteria (called blue-green algae) can produce toxins. It may be
       appropriate to identify and enumerate phytoplankton, including algae, seasonally
       and as frequently as weekly, especially in lakes prone to stratification and
       turnover. Chlorophyll-a is an inexpensive surrogate for assessing the abundance
       of algae in a surface water supply. Phycocyanin is another possible surrogate,
       though it is specific to cyanobacteria and currently can only be monitored using
       in-situ probes and satellites.

After thoroughly characterizing the source water quality, the design engineer can assess
the most appropriate surface water filtration technologies. See Table 11-1 for design
guidance on source water quality limitations for various filtration technologies.
Pretreatment processes can allow for greater levels of coliform, color, or turbidity than
listed below. See Section 11.2.1 for additional information about pretreatment
technologies.

      2   These limits are for applied filter turbidity. The treatment process can handle higher source water turbidities
          if additional pretreatment is provided.
      3 According to Section 4.2.2 Recommended Standards for Water Works (Ten State Standards 2012), pressure
        filters are for iron and manganese removal, and must not be used for filtration of surface water.
      4 Special studies are required to determine limitations, which are equipment specific.




11.1.4        Operational Complexity and Staffing
We expect systems to choose the simplest available technology that can effectively and
efficiently treat the source water quality. Surface water treatment technologies vary in
their operational complexity and staffing needs. For example, rapid rate filtration is
much more mechanically and operationally complex than slow sand filtration. Rapid rate
filtration process upsets or failures are more likely to occur and can cause significant
risks to public health. Such complex treatment processes usually require closer
operational oversight and more operator time than simpler processes. More complex
treatment processes also require a higher level of operator certification.

Finding appropriately trained and certified staff can be difficult for some water systems.
Engineers should address operational and staffing considerations as part of the
alternatives analysis. Most small communities struggle to find and retain operators with
the skills and qualifications needed to operate complex filtration technologies.

Data from rapid rate filter plants that serve small communities (less than 3,300 people)
show poorer performance when compared to larger plants (see Figure 11-1). Equally
troubling, in several cases, small plant performance degraded suddenly and dramatically
when staff changes occurred. For these reasons, rapid rate filtration is not an
appropriate choice for small systems. The only exception is when a community is
committed to providing at least one full-time qualified operator dedicated exclusively to

for various surface water treatment technologies.

11.2                         Treatment Technologies
As noted above, the engineer’s treatment technology evaluation should consider source
water quality and other factors, including space availability, treatment complexity, and
cost. Multiple barriers are used to meet surface water treatment requirements including:
                       Screening and Prefiltration (Section 11.2.1).
                       Chemical Addition (Section 11.2.2).
                       Clarification and Sedimentation (Section 11.2.3).
                       Filtration (Section 11.2.4).
                       Disinfection (Section 11.2.5).

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                      303
These are typical processes that protect public health by removing and inactivating
pathogens. However, surface water treatment can provide other benefits, too, such as
removing disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors, organic chemicals, inorganic
chemicals, and taste and odor causing compounds. More information about removing
these compounds is in Section 10.2.

11.2.1    Screening and Prefiltration
Bag, cartridge and membrane filters often require screening and prefiltration to prevent
rapid fouling of or damage to the filters. Other treatment technologies use screens to
minimize the potential for damage to equipment, such as pumps, valves, and the filters
themselves. The manufacturer of the downstream filtration or prefiltration equipment
may identify the size and type of screening. For membrane filtration, self-cleaning
screens in the 200 to 500 micron (μm) range are often used. For bag filtration, a series of
prefilters with nominal pore sizes of 25 to 2 um are commonly used. Other types of
prefiltration, such as roughing filters, can be used to extend the run times for
downstream filtration processes. All types of screening and prefiltration equipment
should be equipped with a way to measure the differential pressure or head loss across
the units.

11.2.2    Chemical Addition
Adding a chemical upstream can affect many clarification, filtration, and disinfection
processes. For some processes, such as rapid rate filtration, chemical addition is
essential. Without closely controlled chemical addition, rapid rate filtration does not
provide effective pathogen reduction.

Several chemicals are used to make surface water treatment processes function
effectively, including oxidants, coagulants, and other specialized chemicals, such as
powdered activated carbon used for taste and odor control.

One key aspect of the predesign process is to identify the type and dose range of
oxidants, coagulants, and other chemicals needed to make downstream treatment
processes function most effectively. Any chemical used in a surface water treatment
facility must be ANSI/NSF Standard 60 approved and applied within its maximum
application dosage (WAC 246-290- 220(3)). See below for more information on chemical
addition for specific unit processes. Also see Section 10.6 for general design information
on chemical feed systems.

11.2.3      Clarification and Sedimentation
Water systems use clarification and sedimentation processes upstream of filtration
processes to remove pathogens, turbidity, and other materials that can clog filters.
Common clarification and sedimentation processes include:
        Ballasted sedimentation.
        Contact adsorption clarification.
        Dissolved air flotation.
        Gravity sedimentation, usually with tube or plate settlers.

In general, sedimentation processes are well suited to source waters from rivers and
other very turbid surface waters, while dissolved air flotation is well suited for lakes,
especially ones with high concentrations of algae or organic carbon (Figure 11-2).
Engineers should provide turbidity meters, level sensors, and flow monitoring on each
treatment train so operators can observe and control sedimentation and clarification
processes.




Figure 11-2: Surface Water Treatment Process Selection using Maximum Source
Turbidity and TOC (Valade et al. 2009)

We may grant pathogen removal credit of 0.5-log removal for Giardia lamblia cysts and
1.0-log removal for viruses (WAC 246-290-660(2) if clarification and sedimentation
processes demonstrate consistent and effective pathogen removal and conform with
accepted professional standards and guidelines, such as those noted in this section. If
such pathogen removal credit is granted, the water system must meet the disinfection
byproduct precursor removal requirements under 40 CFR 141.135 (WAC 246-290-
660(3)).

DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                        305
Ballasted Sedimentation: This high-rate sedimentation process uses polymers and very
fine sand to accelerate the sedimentation process. As a result, the detention time in the
flocculation and sedimentation process is short, and surface loading rates are high,
usually between 8 and 20 gpm/ft2. The process very effectively removes high turbidity
loads usually associated with river sources. In addition, the process has been shown to
consistently and effectively remove Giardia lamblia cysts, so it can be granted 0.5 log
Giardia removal credit if the surface loading rate does not exceed 20 gpm/ft2
(AWWA/ASCE 2012a, Alvarez et al. 1999, Kawamura 2000). With the short detention
times, a certified operator needs to monitor the process closely to minimize the risk of
process upsets that could affect downstream filtration and disinfection processes.
Ballasted sedimentation should not be used upstream of membrane filters because the
polymers used in the sedimentation process may adversely affect performance of the
membrane filters.

Contact Adsorption Clarification: Small package plants use this process on low to
moderate turbidity sources. The process functions more like a roughing filter than a
gravity sedimentation or flotation process. Coagulated water flows through coarse
media about the size of pea gravel. As coagulated water passes through the media,
larger flocculated particles develop and attach to the clarifier media. The media is
periodically cleaned using an air and water flushing process to remove the solids. For
non-buoyant media, prescreening is important to prevent plant debris and other
materials from clogging the clarifier. In addition, flow-to-waste piping and controls
should be provided to minimize start-up spikes from being passed on to downstream
filters.

High turbidity levels and high organic loads requiring significant coagulant addition—
such as turbidity greater than 30 NTU and total organic carbon (TOC) greater than 5
mg/L—can quickly clog the clarifier media or cause high levels of DBPs. Where suitable,
typical surface loading rates are 8 to 10 gpm/ft2 (AWWA/ASCE 2012a). Given the cyclical
nature of CAC performance, and limited research demonstrating the effectiveness of
contact adsorption clarifiers for removal of pathogenic protozoa and DBP precursors, we
cannot currently grant any pathogen removal credit for this clarification process.

Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF): Water systems use this process on lake and reservoir
sources, especially those that experience algal blooms or have high concentrations of
natural organic matter. The DAF process introduces coagulated and flocculated water
into the clarifier where very fine bubbles float flocculated particles to the surface for
removal. The process removes clarified water near the bottom of the basin.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                         306
DAF can be classified as conventional or high-rate depending on the basin design. In
most cases, the clarifiers used for conventional DAF are less than 8 feet deep, have
length-to-width ratios of at least 1.0, and have surface loading rates of less than 6
gpm/ft2. Conventional DAF has demonstrated significant removal of Giardia lamblia
cysts, so we can grant 0.5 log Giardia removal credit if the surface loading rate does not
exceed 6 gpm/ft2 (Alvarez et al. 1999, Edzwald et al, 2001; Plummer et al 1995). High-
rate DAF is a more recent development. The clarifiers used in this process are deep, up
to 16 feet, the length-to-width ratio can be less than 1.0, and loading rates may be as
high as 16 gpm/ft2. Because there is limited research on the effectiveness of high rate
DAF for removal of pathogenic protozoa, we cannot currently grant pathogen removal
credit for this clarification process.

Gravity Sedimentation: This process employs tube or plate settlers to allow for greater
surface loading rate and improved process performance than open basins. Water
systems have used gravity sedimentation on a variety of source waters, though it is best
suited for those that experience high turbidity loads. Flocculation is necessary prior to
gravity sedimentation to develop a floc that will settle. In general, the surface loading
rate above the portion of the basin using tube settlers is limited to less than 2.0 gpm/ft2;
and the loading rate for plate settlers is limited to 0.5 gpm/ft2 based on 80 percent of
the projected horizontal plate area.

Recommended loading rates are even lower if the treatment objectives are to remove
color or algae. The process has been shown to provide effective removal of pathogenic
protozoa (Logsdon et al. 1985, Haas et al. 2001). Therefore, we can grant the process
0.5-log Giardia removal credit if the design follows industry guidelines, such as those in
the Recommended Standards for Water Works.

11.2.4    Filtration
Water systems must filter all surface water sources unless they meet very stringent
source water protection, control, monitoring, disinfection, and operational criteria (WAC
246-290-630). Various filtration technologies provide effective pathogen removal and
can be used to meet surface water treatment requirements, including:
      Rapid rate filtration
      Diatomaceous earth filtration
      Slow sand filtration
      Membrane filtration
      Bag and cartridge filtration

 The most appropriate filtration technology will vary depending on various factors,
 including source water quality, the availability of skilled operators, land and energy
 requirements, costs, availability of replacement parts for proprietary technology, and
 other resource considerations. For example, rapid rate filtration may be well suited a
 large system with a high turbidity river source, and poorly suited to a cold, clear lake in a
 remote mountainous region (where a bag filter would be more appropriate). The best
 choice for a small water system usually is the simplest available technology that can
 effectively treat the source water quality. Basic information for these filtration
 technologies is in Table 11-2 and the following summaries.

 A well designed, operated, and maintained filter is very effective at removing pathogens
 and many other contaminants. However, at the start of a filtration cycle the filtered
 water quality may be less than optimal. For this reason, design engineers must provide
 filter-to-waste capability for all surface water filtration facilities (WAC 246-290-
 676(4)(b)(iii)).

     meets the performance requirements of WAC 246-290-660. To maintain the integrity of the DE filter cake, filters
     should be designed to prevent the filtration rate from dropping below 0.25 gpm/ft 2.

 Rapid Rate Filtration: This filtration technology involves adding multiple chemicals
 upstream of granular media filters. Commonly used chemicals include oxidants,
 coagulants, and various polymers. Typical filter media include anthracite, sand, granular
 activated carbon, garnet, and ilmenite. Periodically, the filters are backwashed to remove

the particles and pathogens that attach to the filter media. The pretreatment process
used prior to filtration can further classify rapid rate filtration:
      Conventional filtration process includes coagulation, flocculation, and
       clarification prior to filtration. The clarification process may be awarded pathogen
       removal credit.
      Direct filtration process provides coagulation and flocculation prior to filtration.
       It does not include sedimentation or clarification. Some direct filtration plants
       employ a contact adsorption clarifier (see Section 11.2.3).
      In-line filtration process provides only coagulation and rapid mixing prior to
       filtration. With such limited pretreatment, in-line filtration should only be used to
       treat sources with low turbidity and low concentrations of natural organic matter.

including:

       Filters (Ten State Standards 2012)
      Integrated Design and Operation of Water Treatment Facilities (Kawamura 2000)

Engineers should review these references and other resources as part of their evaluation
of rapid rate filtration for any source.

Diatomaceous Earth (DE) Filtration: For this process, the operator establishes a DE
precoat on a mesh screen or fabric, called a septum, before initiating the filtration
process. The water system can treat water after about 1/8-inch of DE coats the filter
septa. During each filter run, the process continuously feeds a small amount of DE to
maintain the porosity of the filter cake that accumulates on the septa. Temperature has
very little effect on DE filtration. However, a significant particle load will accumulate,
causing rapid head loss. For those reasons, DE filtration may be a good choice for clear,
cold source waters. However, DE is more mechanically challenging and requires greater
operator oversight than some other filtration technologies.

Numerous other texts and standards cover the design of DE filtration in detail, including:

       Filtration, (Ten State Standards 2012)

Slow Sand Filtration: This process filters water through biologically active sand at a
maximum rate of 0.1 gpm/ft2, which is 10 to 60 times slower than the filtration rate for
most rapid rate filters. As a result, slow sand filters require more surface area and space.
However, the process is much simpler. Most installations use no chemicals beyond those
required for disinfection.

The filter media size used in slow sand filters is smaller than that used in rapid rate
filters, and the filtration process can take a long time to ripen when treating cold, low
nutrient source waters. Assessing proper ripening of the filter, or developing of an
effective schmutzdecke on top of the filter, is a key part of the design process. High
turbidity, nutrient-rich source waters can cause head loss to rapidly develop leading to
short filter runs. Extensive pilot testing is necessary to determine the suitability of
available sand, optimal filtration rate, filter run length, necessary ripening duration, and
prefiltration requirements.

Appendix H includes additional information about the design of slow sand filtration. The
design of slow sand filtration is covered in detail in numerous texts and standards,
including:

      Slow Sand Filtration (Huisman and Wood 1974)

       State Standards, 2012)

Membrane Filtration: Low-pressure membrane filtration effectively removes
pathogenic protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium from source waters. Also
called microfiltration and ultrafiltration, the process may use a coagulant to decrease
fouling of the membrane, extend the time between cleaning processes, and to remove
some of color caused by natural organic matter. Natural organic matter can lead to the
undesirable formation of disinfection byproducts and exerts a disinfection demand.

Membrane filtration systems are proprietary, with fiber and module designs differing
significantly between manufacturers. For these reasons, pilot testing conducted on one
type of membrane is not transferrable to another. As proprietary systems, we grant
membranes pathogen removal credit on a case-by-case basis (WAC 2465-290-660(e)).
Also, as proprietary equipment, there is some financial risk to the water system if the
membrane manufacturer goes out of business or stops manufacturing membrane
system components. See DOH 331-617 for a list of currently approved membrane
filtration systems.

Numerous other texts and standards cover the design of membrane filtration in detail,
including:
        Membrane Filtration Guidance Manual (USEPA 2005)
        AWWA B110: Standard for Membrane Systems (AWWA 2016c)
        AWWA Manual M53 Microfiltration and Ultrafiltration Membranes for Drinking
         Water (AWWA 2016d)

Bag and Cartridge Filtration: Water systems use these filtration technologies to treat
sources with very low turbidity and low color because the filters cannot be backwashed
and do not remove any organic matter. To decrease the frequency for replacing filters,
most systems have one or more prefiltration steps before the final filter unit. A common
approach is to use multiple prefilters in series, such as 50 um, 10 um, and 5 um nominal
size cartridge filters, upstream of the compliance filter.

Bag and cartridge filters used for pathogen removal credit are proprietary equipment,
similar to membrane filtration systems. As such, we grant them pathogen removal credit
on a case-by-case basis (WAC 246-290-660(e)). The pathogen removal credit is specific
to a bag and housing combination. Also, as proprietary equipment, there is some
financial risk to the water system if the filter system manufacturer goes out of business,
stops manufacturing the filters, or otherwise stops supporting the technology. See DOH
331-616 for a list of currently approved bag and cartridge filtration systems.

11.2.5      Disinfection
Disinfection treatment approaches differ depending on the intended purpose of the
application. Water systems must treat surface water and GWI sources to inactivate
protozoa and viruses (WAC 246-290-601(1)). See Section 10.2.1 for general information
on preliminary design considerations for disinfection processes.

For surface water and GWI sources, disinfection combined with filtration must provide
at least 3-log (99.9 percent) removal or inactivation of Giardia lamblia, and at least 4-log
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                         311
(99.99 percent) removal or inactivation of viruses (WAC 246-290-662(1)). Filtration credit
for removal of Giardia lamblia cysts and viruses establishes the minimum disinfection
inactivation requirement. Regardless of the removal credit granted for filtration, water
systems must provide at least 0.5-log (68 percent) inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts
and 2-log (99 percent) inactivation of viruses (WAC 246-290-662(1)(c)) through
continuous disinfection. This disinfection process often is called primary disinfection.

Water systems that supply surface water also must maintain a disinfection residual
throughout the distribution system (WAC 246-290-662(6). This maintenance of a
distribution system residual often is called secondary disinfection.

If ultraviolet disinfection is being considered as a primary disinfectant, the design
engineer should review the information in Policy F.13 and Appendix I.

11.2.5.1 Determining Disinfection Efficacy
Multiple factors influence the effectiveness of disinfection. The two main factors under
the operator’s control are the concentration of the disinfectant (C) and contact time (T),
which is proportional to flow. The required CT depends primarily on the water
temperature and pH. The ratio of CTcalc to CT required is called the inactivation ratio (IR); it
should always be more than 1.0, and preferably greater. An IR less than 1.0 on more
than one day in a month is a treatment technique violation. To account for unexpected
conditions and provide a factor of safety we recommend designing the disinfection
process, including process control elements, to provide a minimum IR of 1.2 to 1.5.

The design engineer should clearly identify how the water systems will determine daily
CTcalc values. At a basic level, Equation 11-1 can define Tcredited through a structure
(clearwell, reservoir, or pipe). Where there are multiple different segments, the CTcalc for
each segment needs to be monitored, calculated separately, and added together.

Where:
      BF = the baffling factor (BF) of the structure, sometimes referred to as T 10/T.
      V = the volume of water in the structure.
      Q = the flowrate of water through the structure.

The baffling factor is the ratio between the time for 10 percent of the water to flow
through a structure divided by the mean residence time in the structure. The greater the

degree of baffling, the higher the baffling factor. A baffling factor of no more than 0.1
should be applied to structures with separate inlets and outlets and no internal baffling.

For other structures, engineers can use a conservative estimate based on guidance
documents (Crozes et al. 1999). However, do not use the empirical or estimated baffling
factors outlined in Surface Water Treatment Rule-related guidance because it poorly
defines the baffling factors of poor, average, and superior, and does not reflect typical
designs (USEPA 1990; AWWA/ASCE 2012d).

Use caution when evaluating contact basins where the depth is significantly greater than
the width. In these cases, significant short-circuiting can occur without proper design of
the inlet, outlet, and baffling structures. The results of multiple tracer studies performed
at 32 water treatment plants in Washington during 2014–2016 (see Porter et al 2018),
provide valuable insight into the design of contact basins and highlight the importance
of cross-sectional velocity, especially at low flows in the laminar flow range (Reynolds
numbers less than 2,000).

Contact basin design should include provisions for tracer chemical injection and sample
taps for tracer monitoring at the influent, after injection and mixing, and directly from
the effluent. Sequential basins should include sample locations between each basin.

For pipes, a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 160 is needed to achieve a baffling
factor of 1.0 if the flow through the pipe is turbulent and not laminar. For pipe segments
with a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 40, a baffling factor of 0.7 can be used
(CDPHE 2014). For shorter pipe segments, engineers can estimate the baffling factor by
using the length-to-width ratio and information in Improving Clearwell Design for CT
Compliance (Crozes et al. 1999).

Some other important design considerations:
      Flow monitoring: To provide accurate calculations of contact time, you need to
       monitor the flow leaving each contact chamber. When using parallel clearwells,
       you should monitor the flow from each. Unequal flow splits can lead to short-
       circuiting even when using valves and gates to develop an even flow split. (Porter
       et.al 2018)
      Level monitoring: The most robust design does not allow the volume to
       fluctuate. Engineers can accomplish this by installing a fixed weir at the outlet to
       the contact basin and by separating distribution storage from the disinfection
       contact basin. Where such separation and installation of a weir are not possible,
       the design engineer should specify a minimum level in the contact basin and

DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                         313
       provide level-sensing equipment and controls that will permanently maintain this
       minimum level setting.
      Water quality parameter monitoring: The design must provide disinfectant
       residual, pH, and temperature at the outlet for any CT segment (WAC 246-290-
       664(4)). In addition, the design should provide disinfectant residual monitoring at
       the inlet to any CT structure to detect abnormally low or high chlorine residual
       concentrations that could raise public health or consumer concerns.

When construction is complete, we usually require a tracer study to confirm an
empirically estimated baffling factor. While simple in theory, there are many
complexities and nuances to a well conducted tracer study. For that reason, you must
submit a tracer study plan to DOH for review and approval before you start the tracer
study (WAC 246-290-636(5)). Additional guidance on conducting tracer studies is in
Appendix B.4.

11.2.5.2 Disinfection Profiling and Benchmarking
A disinfection profile is a graphical plot of a system's level of Giardia lamblia or virus
inactivation measured over a one- to three-year period. Disinfection profiles can identify
erratic operation of the disinfection process. They also can show when a system is
adding more disinfectant than needed, either seasonally or year-round. Adding more
disinfectant may increase disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. A disinfection
benchmark is the lowest monthly average pathogen inactivation ratio during the
disinfection profile time period. You can use the benchmark to evaluate the result of a
change in treatment.

Modifications to treatment plants can cause changes to the disinfection practices and
DBP formation. Therefore, community or nontransient noncommunity systems with
surface water or GWI sources must develop a disinfection profile if they have elevated
levels of DBPs. And, we recommend that all surface water systems develop a disinfection
profile. In this context, “elevated” means one of the following:
      The annual average TTHM level is 0.064 mg/L or greater.
      The annual average HAA5 level is 0.048 mg/L or greater (40 CFR 141.530 and
       141.172).

When water systems required to develop a profile propose any change to their
disinfection process, they must include the profile and calculated disinfection
benchmark in the project report and include an analysis of how the proposed change
will affect the current level of disinfection (WAC 246-290-630(4) and (12)). Examples of
disinfection changes that trigger this requirement include moving the point of

disinfection, changing the disinfectant(s) used, increasing pH, and altering contact basin
geometry, inlet-outlet piping, or baffling conditions.

11.3        Predesign Studies
Predesign studies, including pilot studies as appropriate, are required for proposed
treatment projects (WAC 246-290-250). See Chapter 10 and Figure 2-3. The goal of the
predesign study is to establish the most effective treatment approach, considering life-
cycle costs, and produce treated water that meets all regulatory requirements. A
predesign study should precede the project report. As such, engineers must include
information from the predesign study in the project report (WAC 246-290-250).
Predesign study approaches include desktop, bench-scale, and pilot studies. See Section
10.3 for more detail. For surface water projects, engineers often use desktop and bench-
scale studies to assess various treatment options before conducting a more thorough
and detailed analysis of a treatment approach through a pilot study.

11.3.1      Pilot Studies
Pilot studies attempt to replicate as closely as possible the operating conditions and
treatment results expected at full scale. Pilot plants are scaled-down versions of a
proposed process, and may be skid or trailer mounted. Engineers use pilot plant testing
to ensure treatment is effective, determine final design parameters, and estimate
construction and operation costs.

We usually require pilot studies for proposed treatment projects (WAC 246-290-250
and WAC 246-290-676(3)). For surface water treatment, the limited situations that may
not need a pilot study include:
        Construction of a new water treatment plant that replaces an existing one using
         essentially identical treatment processes and design criteria.
        Identical treatment processes applied to nearly identical source waters, such as
         using the same membrane filtration equipment, including pretreatment on
         withdrawals with practically identical water quality.

Because equipment for proprietary processes is usually so specialized that pilot testing
results are unique to a specific equipment design, it is usually impractical to transfer
pilot results from one proprietary design to another. For example, low-pressure
membrane filtration systems have different fiber sizes, materials, packing densities, and
other factors that affect system performance and limit transferability of design criteria to
another membrane system.

11.3.2    Pilot Study Duration
Pilot studies should be long enough to demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and
reliability of the proposed treatment system. Pilot testing of surface water treatment
must capture seasonal changes in water quality, such as fluctuations in source water
alkalinity, temperature, pH, color, turbidity, tastes, odors, and organic matter (WAC 246-
290-676(3)). The testing should include the period of most challenging water quality for
the piloted treatment technology.

The number of samples collected and study duration can vary widely depending on the
type of source, amount of historical data, water quality, and the proposed treatment
technology (Logsdon et al. 1996; Ford et al. 2001; AWWA 2012e). In some cases, design
engineers can use bench-scale testing to determine the initial operational parameters
for pilot testing and possibly decrease the duration of the pilot study. See Table 11-3 for
guidance on the duration and objectives of pilot studies for a variety of surface water
treatment processes.

11.3.3    Pilot Study Plan and Report
Review the section on pilot studies in Chapter 10. Sections 10.3.3 and 10.3.4 discuss
recommended scope and content of a pilot study plan and final pilot study report.

11.4      Project Reports
A project report should define the size, scope, and design parameters for a proposed
treatment project. For all surface water projects, the design engineer should seek DOH
approval of the project report before submitting construction documents. The water
system must get DOH approval of the project report before modifying or expanding
existing treatment facilities and before beginning construction of new treatment
facilities (WAC 246-290-110).

The design engineer should await DOH approval of the project report before submitting
100 percent complete construction documents. Project reports for treatment facilities
should reference all planning, design, and applicable pilot study reports for the
proposed facility. They must include:
        Detailed design criteria and calculations.
        Process control information.
        Proposed methods and schedules for start-up, testing, and operating the
         completed treatment facility.
        Operational complexity and staffing.
        Operator training and certification requirements.
        Reliability.

Because surface water treatment projects are often more complex than other types of
projects, multiple DOH staff participate in review. The design engineer should submit at
least three copies of the project report to DOH. See Chapter 2 for additional guidance
on preparing project reports.

11.4.1       Design Criteria
Design criteria are a key element of the project report. They define the specific
treatment objectives, basis for sizing equipment, and operational requirements. As such,
project reports must include design criteria for all major treatment-facility project
elements (WAC 246-290-110(4)(h)). See Section 10.4.1 for additional guidance on
project design criteria and calculations and Section 11.2 for basic information on
pretreatment, clarification, filtration and disinfection processes.

11.4.2       Process Control: Monitoring, Instrumentation and Alarms
Process control tools, including monitoring, instrumentation, and alarms, help to ensure
that treatment processes are safe and reliable. In addition to meeting regulatory
monitoring requirements, these tools allow operators to adjust the treatment process
and alert staff when a process may not be functioning properly. See Section 10.4.2 for
basic design guidance on monitoring, instrumentation, and alarms. For surface water
treatment facilities, the water quality monitoring needed depends on the type of
treatment process. Table 11-4 summarizes these needs.

Notes:
    1. A particle counter or laser turbidimeter is required to indirectly assess membrane integrity.

       Most particle counters are useful for assessing particle breakthrough. In some cases, DOH requires particle
       counters as part of the design approval.


Some special aspects of process control for surface water treatment
        Streaming Current Monitors or Zeta Potential Meters: Water systems use
         these types of instruments for coagulation control. For on-line instruments, there
         should be a 1- to 3-minute lag time between coagulant addition and when the
         sample reaches the sensor (AWWA 2011).
        Jar Testing: Jar testing can be a useful tool for operators to evaluate
         modifications to treatment processes and chemical dosages. The design engineer
         should provide the initial jar test settings that reflect plant operations as part of
         the design process. This should include the mixing speed, mixing times, and
         chemical injection sequences.
        Turbidimeters and Particle Counters: You should keep sample lines to these
         online instruments short to keep the delay between sample collection and the
         instrument to one minute or less. In addition, engineers must provide bench-top
         equipment for turbidimeters so that operators can perform weekly verification
         checks (WAC 246-290-638(4)). Place turbidimeters in a location that also allows

         measurement of turbidity during filter to waste. You can find useful information
         about setting up these types of instruments in Monitoring Surface Water
         Treatment Processes (DOH 331-620).
        Turbidity Data Recording and SCADA for rapid rate filtration plants: The
         SCADA computer usually does turbidity data recording. The file from the SCADA
         is called the “data log.” The data logs in a SCADA system should have the
         capacity to handle long-term turbidity data storage needs. The SCADA must
         continually monitor turbidity from each individual filter effluent (IFE) and record
         the data at least every 15 minutes. The SCADA also must record turbidity from
         the combined filter effluent (CFE) every 4 hours, and record the daily maximum
         value of the continuous CFE measurements each day (WAC 246-290-664(3)).
         To support plant operators in achieving turbidity optimization goals, the SCADA
         should record maximum IFE and CFE values within a 15-minute period or capture
         data at intervals of 1 minute or less. Water systems must store recorded IFE data
         for at least 3 years and recorded CFE data for at least 5 years (WAC 246-290-480).
         The SCADA should create a daily data log in an easily accessible format - such as
         .csv or .xlsx - including date, time and turbidity value for each continuous reading
         turbidimeter. Logged turbidity data should be tagged to identify key filter
         operating conditions such as filter-to-clearwell, filter-to-waste, backwash, and out
         of service. The data log files should be in a directory easily accessible to the plant
         operators. The system should include automatic routine backups both onsite and
         offsite. Data log storage devices should have surge protection to mitigate power
         failures. The SCADA monitoring system should be programmed to allow
         operators to create their own trend lines using a flexible turbidity scale and a
         flexible time scale. It should also allow operators flexibility to create plant-specific
         control screens showing selected trend lines. Useful trend lines include selected
         filter IFE turbidity, filter flow rate, and valve open-closed positions for the selected
         filter in the same view (USEPA 2019).

11.4.3      Start-up and Testing
A well-planned start-up of any treatment process, including initial testing, is important
to ensure the treated water is protective of public health and the process is safe and
reliable. Treatment facility submittals must include proposed methods and schedules for
start-up and testing (WAC 246-290-110(4)(h) and 100(4)). See Section 10.4.3 for
additional information on start-up and testing and Section 11.6 for guidance on placing
a surface water treatment plant into service




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                    320
11.4.4      Treatment Plant Operations and Staffing
Project reports for treatment facilities must address operation of the completed project,
including staffing needs (WAC 246-290-110(4)(h)). Even the smallest and simplest
surface water treatment plant should have at least two trained and appropriately
certified operators so that public health is not placed at risk if an operator becomes ill,
needs to attend to family matters, takes leave, or participates in required training and
professional development opportunities.

The design engineer and public water system should work together with an experienced
certified water treatment plant operator to develop a staffing plan and include it in the
project report submitted to DOH for review and approval. In each staffing plan:
        Establish the legal obligation of the water system to remain fully staffed, maintain
         the treatment plant facilities, and describe the corrective actions upon failure to
         do either.
        Identify the organization or people responsible for operating the proposed
         facility, their required qualifications, and their responsibilities in the plant.
        State that the surface water treatment plant will be visited every day of operation
         including weekends and holidays.
        Prepare a draft Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet and identify the correct
         treatment plant classification.
        Describe the training program for new operators.
        Describe the succession planning process for replacing operators who leave or
         retire.
        Describe back-up staffing if one or more existing operators are unable to perform
         tasks.
        Evaluate the number of staff required to ensure safe and reliable operations,
         considering:
         o Treatment Technology. Rapid rate filtration is sensitive to changes in raw
           water quality and dependent on precise chemical feed processes to function
           effectively. A significant shift in water quality or even a short interruption in
           chemical feed can cause the filtration process to suddenly perform poorly and
           place public health at risk. That’s why rapid rate plants with limited or no
           treatment process automation require continuous staffing. This filtration
           process is more staff intensive, usually requiring significantly more operational
           oversight than other types of filtration. Monthly operational water treatment
           report forms for filtration technologies are on the forms page of our website.
           It may be useful to review them when assessing staffing needs.

DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                    321
       o Location. For small plants, especially those in remote locations, it may be
         difficult to attract and retain highly certified operators. For these locations,
         simpler technologies less prone to failure are more appropriate than complex
         treatment processes requiring a higher level of operator certification. In-plant
         training programs are essential in these areas to ensure new operators are
         trained, qualified, and readily available.
       o Automation. A well-trained operator is essential to ensure that the health of
         consumers is protected. Automation can be useful for improving process control
         and ensuring smooth operations when treatment plants are unattended, but
         cannot replace a well-trained professional to oversee operations and take action
         if an equipment failure or process upset occurs. The design engineer should
         consult with DOH early in the design process to determine the conditions under
         which remote monitoring may be appropriate (USEPA 2003a).
       o Water Quality. Some sources, such as rivers or lakes prone to algae blooms,
         may experience rapid changes in water quality that can affect treatment
         processes. Water systems should consider the vulnerability of the source to
         such changes when assessing staffing needs.
       o Treatment Capacity: Larger treatment facilities have more equipment and
         instrumentation than smaller treatment facilities, and need more staffing time
         just to keep the facility in good working condition. In addition, the
         consequences of failure for larger treatment facilities are more significant. For
         these reasons, most treatment plants greater than 10 MGD provide
         continuous operational oversight (USEPA 2002).
       o Plant or System Layout. A compact plant or system with centrally located
         controls will require a much smaller staff than a facility spread over a larger area.

Contact our Operator Certification Program for advice on finding a qualified certified
operator or getting an existing operator certified at the required level.

We developed Table 11-5 (below) after reviewing staffing at existing WTPs and other
references. You can use it as a general guide in developing staffing plans for proposed
facilities (USEPA 2002; Ohio EPA 2016; Florida DOH 2013).

Inadequate staffing presents a public health risk. The values listed in Table 11-5
represent the estimated minimum time that an operator should spend at a treatment
plant each day it operates. Additional time will be required for weekly, monthly, and
seasonal operation and maintenance activities, for equipment repairs, unscheduled
events, and during times of changing water quality. Don’t apply the guidance in Table


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                  322
11-5 to existing facilities. You should base staffing requirements at existing facilities on
what is necessary to protect the health of consumers. Staffing decisions should take into
account raw water quality, the site-specific capacity and demands of the treatment
process, the degree of automation, and the training and experience of its operators.

Note:
    1.
      If the design doesn’t provide the recommended process control noted in Table 11-6 and automatic shutdown,
    rapid rate WTPs should be continuously staffed when they operate.


11.4.5     Process Reliability
A high degree of reliability is especially important for surface water treatment facilities
because a treatment process failure can present an acute health risk. Most surface water
treatment plants include some automation, which can improve process reliability. The
extent of automation varies depending on the type of treatment process employed.

Automation analysis should identify the response to these reliability and process control
issues:
        Source water quality variations. High or sudden increases in turbidity or color, or
         decreases in alkalinity related to extreme precipitation events, algal blooms,
         chemical spills in source water, and other factors that could result in risks to
         public health.
        Chemical feed issues. Loss of chemical feed or overfeed.
        Equipment failures. Malfunctioning valves, pumps, and process control equipment.
        Finished water quality. High turbidity, inadequate disinfection, and other water
         quality changes that indicate process upsets.
        Waste handling and disposal. Engineers should consider provisions for waste
         handling so that waste disposal does not impose restrictions on the main
         treatment process. See Section 10.8 for special considerations if the design
         includes recycling any of the backwash waste stream.

Table 11-6 provides a basic overview of recommended process control by treatment

Certain process reliability features must be included in the design of any new filtration
facility (WAC 246-290-678). These reliability features include:
      Alarms: Alarms play a critical role in process control, especially when surface
       water treatment facilities operate without staff present. Therefore, project reports
       must describe proposed alarms and their settings (WAC 246-290-110(h)). Critical
       alarms include those for coagulation, filtration, and disinfection. See Section
       10.4.2 for additional guidance.
      Standby equipment: Such as pumps, chemical feed equipment, and mixers to
       ensure continuous operation and control of coagulation, clarification, filtration,
       and disinfection processes.
      Redundant treatment units: Redundant units include filtration so that treatment
       can continue when filters are out of service for operational reasons, such as
       ripening, backwash, or maintenance. In addition, redundant disinfection units are
       required for sources that meet the criteria to remain unfiltered. See Policy F.10.

A reliable power supply is another important aspect of process reliability. Most
treatment plants should have standby generators to maintain operations and life-safety
equipment during power outages. It also may be necessary to install uninterruptible
power supplies on some critical process components, such as key chemical feed pumps,
instrumentation, SCADA systems, and recirculation pumps for DE filtration to avoid
significant process upsets.

Reliability guidelines for surface water facilities include those in the “Policy Statement on
Automated/Unattended Operation of Surface Water Treatment Plants” in the
Recommended Standards for Water Works (Ten State Standards 2012). According to this
policy statement, in their project reports, engineers should:
      Identify all critical features in the treatment facility that will be monitored
       electronically. Describe automatic plant shutdown controls with alarms and
       conditions that would trigger shutdowns. Dual or secondary alarms may be
       necessary for certain critical functions.
      Provide automated monitoring of all critical functions with major and minor
       alarm features. Automated plant shutdown for all major alarms. Inability to
       automatically startup the plants following a major alarm. Built-in control test
       capability to verify the status of all major and minor alarms.
      Discuss the ability to operate all treatment plant equipment and process
       functions manually through the control system.
      Outline plans to challenge test each critical component.

references (AWWA/ASCE 2012f; Ten State Standards 2012).

11.5      Operations Program
Without proper operation and maintenance, surface water treatment involves multiple
treatment processes that could deliver unsafe water. An Operations Program is an
indispensable tool supporting plant operations staff in achieving optimized treatment.

Creating an Operations Program will inform the design and initial plant start-up,
establish routine and contingent activities operators must perform, and create the
framework for judging facility performance. New operators will rely on the treatment
plant Operations Program for support in quickly gaining an understanding of the
procedures and decisions necessary to achieve optimized treatment plant performance.
The design engineer must prepare a detailed Operations Program for a water treatment
facility treating a surface water or GWI source (WAC 246-290-654(5)).

The purpose of the Operations Program is to help water system personnel reliably
produce optimally filtered water quality. As such, it should identify specific, quantifiable
optimization goals. Engineers can use the following to develop treatment optimization
goals:
      DOH Treatment Optimization Program
      EPA Composite Correction Program
      AWWA-EPA Partnership for Safe Water
      AWWA Standard G100: Water Treatment Plant Operation and Management

At a minimum, the Operations Program must describe:
      Coagulation control procedures (when a coagulant is used).
      Procedures used to determine chemical dosages and feed rates.
      Operations and maintenance for each unit process, including overall goals and
       specific water quality targets.
      Treatment plant performance monitoring. Monthly operational report forms for
       each type of filtration technology are available on our website under surface
       water forms.
      Laboratory procedures.
      Reliability features.
      Data validation procedures.

      Emergency response plans, especially for treatment process failures and
       watershed emergencies.

The Operations Program should also include:
      An overall schematic of the treatment process.
      Process and instrumentation diagrams for the treatment facility.
      Control loop descriptions.
      Processes for verifying and calibrating instrumentation, such as turbidimeters,
       particle counters, pH meters, and chlorine residual analyzers.
      Procedures for testing alarms and confirming communications with on-call
       operators and water system staff.
      Procedures for completing required monthly operations reports.
      Documented circumstances that require a health advisory to customers, who
       decides to issue a health advisory, and how the water system will provide
       communication to customers.
      Procedures for other routine or ongoing monitoring not already included in the
       regulatory monitoring that may be used for process control.

The engineer or water system must submit the draft Operations Program for new,
expanded, or modified treatment facilities (WAC 246-290-654(5)). Often, not all of the
information needed to complete the Operations Program for these facilities is available
until after construction starts. Usually a draft Operations Program is submitted for
review and comment during construction. This process allows a revised final draft to be
available prior to startup along with the Construction Completion Report.

When developing the Operations Program, the design engineer should remember that
water system staff will need to periodically update and modify it to reflect their current
water treatment practices. As such, the water treatment plant operators and managers
should be heavily involved in developing the initial Operations Program, and be able to
readily update it.

The project report should initially specify applicable operator training requirements,
specific training the equipment supplier(s) will provide, and related schedules. The final
Operations Program and equipment-specific operations and maintenance manuals
should be available during the operator training sessions.

11.6      Placing a Surface Water Treatment Plant into Service
Given the importance of reliable and effective treatment to the protection of public
health, a thorough commissioning process is warranted. Before a surface water
treatment plant can be placed into service, it must be properly tested, inspected, and
disinfected (WAC 246-290-120(4)). A licensed engineer must complete a Construction
Completion Report Form (DOH 331-121) and submit it to DOH before a water system
uses treatment facilities to serve water to the public (WAC 246-290-120(5)).

This section complements the more general information about placing a water
treatment plant into service in Section 10.9. These more general topics include:
      Prestart-up meetings.
      Start-up of other plant components.
      Testing of process instrumentation.
      Potential for effects on the distribution system (sediment release and corrosion
       control).

Monthly operational report forms for each type of filtration technology are available on
our website under surface water forms. Water system operating staff should review
these forms before final commissioning. This will allow operating staff to work with their
DOH regional engineer on adapting the forms specific to the treatment facility,
integrating them with process control, SCADA, and operational practices. Before the
facility begins to serve water to consumers, the operator in responsible charge should
plan to submit to DOH a completed set of operational reporting forms that address any
reporting issues we raised.

Each set of operational reporting forms for a surface water treatment plant includes one
form for disinfection. The process for calculating the CTcalc, including determination of
volume(s), flow(s), and baffling factor(s), should be established in the project report as
outlined in Section 11.2.4. The design engineer should confirm the process for
calculating the CTcalc prior to commissioning, as the initial design assumptions could
have changed in the design process. The operator should plan to submit sample or
example disinfection monitoring results to DOH before serving water to the public.

Planning for disposal of treated water is an important part of the start-up due to the
large volume of water that may need to be discarded before serving water to customers.
To address this issue, it may be necessary to operate the water treatment plant
intermittently.

Table 11-7 summarizes the final commissioning tasks that should be completed before
serving water to customers. These comprehensive commissioning tasks usually follow
thorough testing of individual treatment plant components, as well as disinfection and
bacteriological testing. We covered this type of testing in Section 10.9, and in other
chapters on individual plant components such as pump testing and treated water
storage facilities.

      For membrane systems, there may be initially high particle counts or filtered water turbidity. If these conditions
      persist, direct integrity testing may be required every 4 hours until the indirect integrity monitoring provides
      reliable results.


For most surface water treatment facilities, a few tasks usually are completed after the
plant is operating fully and serving water to customers. These tasks include:
        Field Data Sheet: This document summarizes the processes and operational
         settings for the treatment plant. Engineers should develop it with the DOH
         regional engineer, who can provide an appropriate template for the treatment
         technology being installed.

      Tracer Study: Engineers usually need to make some assumptions about the
       operational levels and baffling efficiency of the disinfection process to calculate
       the initial CTcalc of the disinfection process. Often, they need to conduct a tracer
       study after constructing the disinfection facilities to confirm or revise the initial
       hydraulic assumptions. See Appendix B.4.
      Disinfection Summary: This document provides the basics for determining the
       effectiveness of disinfection for a treatment facility, including any underlying
       assumptions. This document is sometimes called a “CT summary.”
      Final Operations Program: As noted in Section 11.5, the engineer or water
       system must submit an Operations Program for new, expanded, or modified
       treatment facilities (WAC 246-290-654(5)). They should submit a draft Operations
       Program during facility construction and a final version during or shortly after the
       commissioning process.

Appendix A.1             Forms
You can obtain DOH forms for drinking water projects by contacting our regional
offices. The forms referenced in this manual are at
http://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/DrinkingWater/PublicationsandFor
ms/Forms.aspx. For persons with disabilities, forms are available on request in other
formats. To submit a request, call 800-525-0127 (TTY 1-800-833-6388).

    Project Approval Application Form (331-149). The Project Approval Application
     Form identifies the project applicant, design engineer, water system, and type of
     project. We use this information to determine review and approval fees.

    Water Right Self-Assessment Form (331-370 or 331-372).* The Water Rights
     Self-Assessment Form identifies the water right information we need to review
     and approve construction documents and project reports. We will forward the
     Water Right Self-Assessment Form to the Department of Ecology for review.
       Water system plans, small water system management programs, and project
       reports for projects involving a new or expanding source or increased water
       system capacity must include a completed Water Right Self-Assessment Form
       (WAC 246-290-100(4)(f); -105(4)(e); and -110(4)(e)).

    Construction Completion Report Form (331-121, 331-146, or 331-147).* The
     Construction Completion Report documents that the project was constructed
     according to DOH-approved plans and specifications. This form must be
     completed and submitted to us within 60 days of completion and before use of
     any new or modified water system facility DOH approved for construction (WAC
     246-290-120(5)). The water system must have a Construction Completion Report
     on file for all distribution mains and other distribution-related facilities a
     professional engineer designs, but is not required to submit it to DOH for
     approval under WAC 246-290-125.

Appendix A.3             Project Checklists
Checklists can help design engineers determine whether they met minimum design
requirements. On the following pages, you will find various project submittal checklists
you can use to prepare submittals for DOH or third party review.

The purpose of the project checklist is to ensure that you submit a complete and
properly organized project to DOH. We may return incomplete submittals; that will
result in a delayed project review due to the time required to receive the missing
information.

DOH developed a project checklist covering each of the project types listed below:
   1. General
   2. Groundwater Source of Supply
   3. Transmission and Distribution Mains
   4. Hydraulic Analysis
   5. Reservoirs
   6. Booster Pump Stations
   7. Pressure Tanks
   8. Water Treatment Facilities
   9. UV (see Appendix I for project checklist)

Appendix A.3.1           General Project Report Checklist
Include the following information in the project report, as applicable to the project and
water system’s planning status. See Chapter 2, including the project development
flowcharts therein, and WAC 246-290-110 and -120 for further design guidance and
requirements.
 The signed and dated stamp of a Washington state-licensed professional engineer.
  Federal facilities can have a PE from any state, but still must have a PE stamp.
 Narrative discussion that establishes the need for the project. It should include a
  construction schedule for the recommended alternative, project cost, and method of
  financing. Also, indicate the relationship of the project to the currently approved water
  system plan or one in the process of being prepared or updated.
 Alternatives analysis and rationale for selecting the proposed project. It should include
  an evaluation of life cycle costs, including initial capital costs and on-going operations
  and maintenance costs.
 Appropriate planning elements: Cite appropriate reference in an approved water system
  plan, prepare an amended water system plan, or include as part of the project report.
 Capacity analysis if seeking a change in the number of approved service connections.
  Include rationale and calculations to justify total number of service connections and
  equivalent residential units (ERUs). The analysis should identify the number of
  residential, industrial, commercial, and municipal connections the water system now
  serves. If the water system seeks to increase its approved number of connections
  through construction of new facilities, document water system plan approval status.
 Water Right Self-Assessment Form must be completed for new sources and all projects
  that increase the approved number of connections.
 Hydraulic analysis that demonstrates the ability of the project to supply minimum
  pressure requirements during peak flows and fire events. The analysis should include a
  narrative discussion that describes the hydraulic analysis method, explains critical
  assumptions, and summarizes the effect of the proposed expansion on the existing
  water system.
 Measures to protect against vandalism.
 Disinfection procedures according to AWWA or APWA/WSDOT standards and a
  narrative discussion on how the project will be disinfected and tested prior to use.
 Provisions to discharge water to waste including description of how wastewater is
  disposed, and documentation that procedures are acceptable to the Department of
  Ecology and local authorities.
 Routine and preventive operations and maintenance tasks and their frequency, and the
  role of a certified operator in completing them.

Appendix A.3.2           Groundwater Source of Supply Checklist
Address these design elements in source of supply project report and construction
document submittals. Refer to Chapter 5, WAC 246-290-130 and -135, and Appendix E
for further design guidance and requirements. If the new groundwater source requires
treatment, refer to Appendix A.3.8.

The following guidance also applies to sources serving existing, unapproved water
systems. If the source is an existing well the project proposes to convert into an
“approved” water source, the water system or engineer should inform the DOH engineer
about any DOH-requested information that is not available (such as a missing well log).

For new surface water supplies, contact your regional engineer for further guidance.
Applicable design references include Chapters 5, 10, and 11, and Appendix A.3.8.

Project Report
 Source of supply analysis that justifies the need for a new or expanded source of
   supply and the alternative source options evaluated.

 Provisions to dispose of solid waste material from the treatment process. Describe
  how waste is to be properly disposed, and include documentation showing the
  procedures are acceptable to the Department of Ecology and local authorities.

When the source is surface water, or confirmed to be groundwater under the direct
influence of surface water, submittals must meet the following additional requirements:
 Disinfection analysis, such as a tracer study (see Appendix B.4), to determine that
  adequate disinfection can be provided.
 Filter design details including the filter-loading rate and backwash design.
 Turbidimeter locations, including those for individual filter turbidimeters and a
  combined filter effluent turbidimeter prior to the clearwell.
 Filter-to-waste design including an adequate air gap and properly sized waste pipe.
 Alarms for critical process control elements, such as water levels, coagulation,
  filtration, and disinfection. Alarms must be set to provide sufficient warning to allow
  operators to take action or shut the plant down as appropriate.
 Standby equipment for critical processes, such as coagulation, filtration, and
  disinfection to ensure that the plant can operate continuously.
 Multiple filtration units to allow for major maintenance and repairs on the filtration
  units. Complete redundancy for peak design flows is not required.
 Draft Operations Program (O&M manual) outlining how the treatment facility will
  operate. The final manual must describe:
      Coagulation control methods.
      Chemical dosing procedure.

Appendix B.1         Well Field Designation and Source Sampling
                     Guidelines
We support the concept of designating nearby wells that draw from the same aquifer as
a “well field.” A well field designation allows the wells of a well field to be monitored as a
single source. This designation reduces the number of samples needed to meet water
quality monitoring requirements, which reduces monitoring costs for water systems and
still protects public health.

This guidance is meant to ensure consistency when dealing with well field designations for
Washington state water systems. A design engineer seeking designation of two or more
individual wells as a well field should demonstrate all of the following criteria are met:
1. The depth to first open interval of all individual wells are within 20 percent of each
   other after accounting for wellhead elevation differences.
2. All individual wells draw from the same aquifer(s) as determined by both the
   following:
   a. An analysis of water chemistry of all sources that demonstrates similar water
      chemistry for all analytes.
   b. An evaluation of geology as documented in well logs or water well reports for all
      of the wells under consideration.
   And, one of the following:
      i.   A demonstration that the cones of depression of the wells in the well field
           overlap under normal operating conditions (e.g. that the water level(s) in the
           adjacent well(s) in the well field drop when the proposed well of the well field
           is pumping).
     ii.   A report submitted by a Washington state-licensed hydrogeologist that
           demonstrates a well field designation is appropriate. If we disagree with the
           conclusions of this report, we may deny the well field designation.
3. All individual wells:
   a. Have a sample tap, installed upstream of treatment, that is not influenced by any
      other well in the well field.
   b. Discharge to a common pipe, treatment system or storage facility that has a
      sampling tap located downstream on the common pipe or after the treatment or
      storage facility but prior to any service connections.
   c. Be under the control of the same water system.

Appendix B.2             Pump Cycle Control Valve Guidelines
Designers may use a pump cycle control valve (CCV) to control distribution system
pressure. The CCV is intended to extend run time with minimal pressurized storage. It
will maintain constant downstream pressure (the valve’s set point) until demand
downstream of the valve falls below the valve’s prescribed low flow level. At that point,
pressure rises to the pressure switch pump-off set point. The valve is mechanically
prevented from restricting flow past its preset minimum.

The CCV needs pressurized storage to supply the distribution system when demand falls
below the valve’s minimum flow setting and shuts down pump operation. The size of
the pressure tank(s) will depend on several factors described below, but the size and
number always will be less than that required without a cycle control valve. Designers
should review manufacturer’s recommendations to ensure all valve application
requirements are met.

Advantages of using a CCV:
   1. Limits well pump on-off cycling and the associated wear on water system
      components.
   2. Reduces the size or number of pressure tanks required for any given installation.
   3. Reduces the potential for damaging transient pressure waves (“water hammer”)
      resulting from hard pump-start and pump-stop conditions.

Design considerations and challenges of using a CCV include:
    The control valve can impose significant energy loss (“head loss”) at the high end
      of its flow range when fully open (a 1¼-inch control valve causes the loss of
      about 10 psi at 50 gpm). The well pump design must account for the head loss
      the control valve imposes.
      It is difficult to predict whether the savings through limiting the number of
       “pump-start” events and reduced initial capital cost associated with fewer bladder
       tanks will offset the cost of the additional energy used to prolong the pump-on
       portion of the cycle.
      Water quality may affect control valve performance. Particulate matter (sand) may
       adversely affect the performance of the control valve.
      At low flow conditions, the pressure on the upstream side of the control valve will
       be near the pump’s shut-off head. You should pay attention to the design,
       material specifications, and construction of the pump to ensure it can operate
       near its shut-off head for extended periods, and to the pressure rating of the
       piping and valves on the upstream side of the control valve.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                           361
      CCV consumes greater amounts of energy per gallon pumped due to prolonged
       operation at low pump efficiency.

The CCV is usually installed between the pump(s) and the pressure tank(s). The valve’s
downstream pressure setting should fall between the pressure switch on and off
pressure settings. As demand in the water system varies, the cycle control valve
modulates the size of the valve opening to adjust the pressure generated by the pump.
The pump-on phase of the pump cycle will continue until water system demand drops
below the valve’s minimum flow setting. At this point, pump supply in excess of system
demand goes into pressurized storage until the pressure tank reaches the pressure
switch “pump-off” setting. If demand (including leaks) never drops below the valve’s
minimum flow setting, the pump will never shut off.

While the pump is off, water released from the pressure tank(s) satisfies all water
demand. The length of the “pump-off” period depends on water system demand and
the available withdrawal volume of the pressure tank(s).

The number of pump starts per hour is important because excessive heat build-up from
too-frequent starts may damage pump motors. With no other recommendation from the
pump motor manufacturer, pump starts should be limited to no more than 6 per hour.

To design the pressure tank system to limit pump starts to no more than 6 starts per
hour (or per the manufacturer’s specification), designers should consider:
      The valve’s minimum flow setting and preset downstream pressure setting.
      Pump-on and pump-off pressure setting.
      Where the valve pressure set point falls within the pump-on-off pressure range.

Example
Given:
    Bladder tank system
    Pump on pressure = 40 psi
    Pump off pressure = 60 psi
    Cycling control valve pressure setting = 50 psi
    Pump control valve low-flow setting = 5 gpm

Find:
   Volume (“V”) of pressurized storage between 60 and 40 psi available to the
   distribution system while the pump is off to provide for a minimum pump cycle time
   of 10 minutes (equal to 6 cycles per hour)

DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                         362
Solution:
    The shortest pressure tank fill time + tank draw time occurs when distribution
      system demand is about equal to one-half the low-flow valve setting (2.5 gpm in
      this example). System demand is “Y” and valve flow setting is “X”.
      To simplify and remain conservative, assume the time to fill the pressure tank
       from the low-pressure pump-on setting (40 psi in this example) to valve preset
       pressure setting (50 psi) is instantaneous. Also, assume pressurized volume from
       40 psi to 50 psi is equal to the pressurized volume from 50 psi to 60 psi.
      Time to fill (Tf) pressure tank from 50 psi to 60 psi:
                                                   0.5𝑉
                                             𝑇𝑓 =
                                                   𝑋−𝑌
      Time to draw down (Td) pressure tank from 60 psi to 40 psi while pump is off:
                                                     𝑉
                                               𝑇𝑑 =
                                                     𝑌
      Solve this equation:
        0.5V V
             + = 10 minutes = 6 cycles per hour
        X-Y Y

       If X = 5 gpm and Y = 2.5 gpm, then V = 16.7 gallons

In the above example, the bladder tank system must provide at least 16.7 gallons of
storage between 40 psi and 60 psi. Based on the following pressure tank manufacturer’s
information, the drawdown for a nominal 34-gallon pressure tank is 9.1 gallons from 40-
60 psi. To provide 16.7 gallons, two 34-gallon pressure tanks are needed. Alternately,
one 62-gallon pressure tank will satisfy the pressurized storage requirement.

Appendix B.3             Variable Frequency Drive Pumps and Motors
A variable-frequency drive (VFD) is an electronic controller that adjusts the speed of an
electric motor by modulating frequency and voltage. VFDs provide continuous control
by matching motor speed to the specific demands of the work being performed. VFDs
allow operators to fine-tune pumping systems while reducing costs for energy and
equipment maintenance.

Use in potable water systems
VFDs are becoming more popular at water facilities, where the greatest energy demand
most often comes from pump motors. VFDs enable pumps to accommodate fluctuating
demand, running pumps at lower speeds and drawing less energy while still meeting
water system needs.

Benefits
Single-speed drives start motors abruptly, subjecting the motor to high torque and
current surges up to 10 times the full-load current. In contrast, variable-frequency drives
offer a “soft start” capability, gradually ramping up a motor to operating speed. This
lessens mechanical and electrical stress on the motor system, reduces maintenance and
repair costs, and extends motor life.

VFDs allow more precise control of processes, such as water production and
distribution. They can also maintain pressure in water distribution systems to closer
tolerances. Energy savings from VFDs can be significant. Affinity laws for centrifugal
pumps suggest that a reduction in motor speed will generate energy savings. While
motor speed and flow are proportional (e.g., 75% speed = 75% flow), motor speed and
horsepower have a cubed relationship (e.g., 75% speed = 40% power consumption).
Despite some of the VFD controller’s additional energy requirements VFDs can reduce a
pump’s energy use over many single speed pumping applications.

Pumps may be designed and installed for the built-out condition, and operate
economically and efficiently for the many years it will take to reach the full demand
design condition.

Disadvantages and Design Challenges
    Outdoor installations can be a problem because VFDs cannot tolerate extremely
      cold weather. Check the manufacturer’s specifications for ambient air
      temperature limitations.
      VFD controllers are sensitive to high temperature, humidity, and particulates.
       Consult the manufacturer on the need for air conditioning and air filtering.

      Without special provisions, placing the controller more than 100 feet from the
       motor can be a problem. Check with the VFD manufacturer for specific
       requirements.
      Power and control wires must be in separate conduits.
      VFDs only work on three-phase motors, except in very small pump applications.
      VFD-controlled pumps may not meet the minimum water flow required to keep
       the motor winding cool. Make sure the pump is not operating below that speed.
       Sleeving may be an option to protect the pump motor. Confirm with the
       submersible pump manufacturer the minimum flow rate across the motor
       needed for motor cooling.
      The quality of the power coming into the VFD controller can significantly affect
       controller performance. Monitor voltage fluctuations before installing a VFD
       controller.
      The resonant frequency of the pump and motor should be checked and
       accommodations made if the resonant frequency is within the range of expected
       pump speeds.
      Experienced electronics personnel will be required for maintenance and repair.

When designing a VFD pumping system
Certain rotational speeds may induce resonance and excessive vibration. Designers
should check with the manufacturer about the resonant frequency of the pump or
motor, and find out whether that frequency could be induced by a speed within the
predicted operating range of the pump.

The designer should reference the minimum flow requirements of the pump when
establishing the operating range of the pumping system. Each manufacturer will have its
own specific requirements for pressurized storage volume to ensure compatibility with
the specific low-flow pump off discharge rate, ramping speed, and the system control
pressure range.

Appendix B.4             Tracer Study Checklist
Tracer studies are simple in concept; you add a tracer prior to the inlet of a structure and
measure the concentration at the outlet. However, conducting a tracer study that gives you
meaningful results can be very challenging. To maximize the potential for success, you
must submit a tracer study plan to DOH before conducting a tracer study (WAC 246-290-
636(5)). This checklist provides general expectations for the information you should include
in a tracer study plan.

General Information
Provide the purpose of the study and basic information about the facility. In addition,
please provide the following information:
 The names, titles, and qualifications of the persons conducting the study.
 A description of the plant and how it is operated, including range of flows, operating
  levels, and operational controls. Note if laminar flows due to low velocity occur.
 An overview of how the study will be conducted.
 A schematic of the part(s) of the facility through which the tracer will pass, showing:
      Point of tracer addition.
      Other chemical additions (such as disinfectants, fluoride, etc.) and sampling
       locations used for normal process monitoring.
      Tracer sampling locations (after tracer addition, after flow passes through the
       structure(s), and other locations as needed).
      Flow meters.
 Dimensions, depth(s), and volume(s) of the part(s) of the facility assessed, including:
      Length to width (or depth) ratio
      Cross-sectional velocity and associated Reynolds number under normal operating
       conditions (see Porter et al 2018).
      special conditions such as parallel, sequential or segmented basins

Tracer Study Plan
You should include the following information in the tracer study plan:
    Tracer
    Type of test
    Sampling schedule
    Flow rates
    Data and instrumentation

    Procedures to confirm that water level/flow rate instrumentation or measurement is
     accurate.
    Field verification of basin dimensions and configuration details.

Tracer
There is no one ideal tracer. For the best results, the tracer must be conservative. That
means it cannot react over the period of the tracer study. The most commonly used and
reviewed ones are fluoride, lithium, sodium, chloride, and calcium. Sometimes conductivity
is used as a surrogate when sodium chloride is used as a tracer. Reactive tracers, such as
hypochlorite, can be used in limited cases where the tracer study time is short, and
preliminary tests have demonstrated that there is little or no decay of the tracer under the
conditions of the proposed test.

 Information about the proposed tracer should include:
      Rationale for selected tracer.
      Sampling locations (after tracer addition, after flow passes through the structure(s),
       and others as needed).
      ANSI/NSF Standard 60 approved dose or acceptable alternative.
      How solution will be prepared.
 Target dose
 Background/baseline level of the tracer.
 Injection method (saturators should not be used. A premixed solution is best).
      Identify how tracer will be dispersed into the flow stream.
 Identification of lag times between the flow path and point of sample collection.
 Analytical method (range, sensitivity, accuracy, field or laboratory analysis).

Type of Test
The two main types of tracer studies are step dose tests and slug dose tests. Slug dose
tests can result in density current effects because very concentrated solutions are needed
to conduct the study. We recommend using a step dose approach because of this issue
and other disadvantages of the slug dose approach. We will only accept the use of a slug
dose approach if you submit a thorough and adequate justification for review and
approval.

Sampling Frequency and Duration
It is important to sample for the tracer often enough, especially shortly after the start of
the test, so that the baffling efficiency (T10/T) can be clearly identified. T10 is the time it

takes for 10 percent of the tracer to break through and T is the mean hydraulic residence
time. You can use the following framework from Teefy (1999) for step dose tests.


                                 Period       Time between samples
                             Start to 0.25T          0.025T
                             0.25T to 1.5T           0.042T
                               1.5T to 2T            0.050T
                                2T to 3T             0.100T
                                3T to 4T             0.200T



You should also collect samples shortly after the point of tracer injection (at or near the
inlet of the basin) at a frequency of 0.10T to confirm constant tracer addition and
accurately estimate tracer recovery. In addition, flow and clearwell level measurements
should be collected continuously. The duration should be sufficient to achieve at least 95
percent recovery of the tracer.

In some cases, it may be difficult to maintain a constant level in a clearwell and flow for
four hydraulic residence times. In these cases, you can use a shorter step dose test, but it
should not be shorter than the calculated mean hydraulic residence time, especially in well-
baffled structures.

Flow Rates
You should conduct tracer studies at three and preferably four different flow rates, spaced
out over the range of normal low, average, and peak flows. The basic premise is that the
baffling efficiency (T10/T) should be fairly constant over the range of flows tested. Studies
have shown that the baffling efficiency is slightly lower at lower flow rates. However, a
significant variation in baffling efficiency may reveal issues with ways the tracer study was
conducted or even issues with the facility, such as construction anomalies. The highest flow
rate tested should be at least 91 percent of the peak hourly flow expected through the
portion of the facility evaluated (USEPA 1990).
      Provide an explanation for the determination of peak hourly flow (including
       historical flow data and any supporting calculations).

You can use computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling conducted over multiple flow
conditions to minimize the number of flow conditions tested in the field. You need to
conduct at least one field tracer test, after you submit the CFD modeling results, to validate
the CFD modeling results.

You should anticipate changes in flow due to backwashing, finished water pump
operation, or other routine plant operation, and minimize or address them during the
study. For higher flow rates, you may need to address practical considerations, such as
where to put the excess water. At higher flow rates, it may be necessary to conduct tracer
studies in the summer to take advantage of increased demand.

Data and Instrumentation
The instrumentation used in the tracer study test is critical in the evaluation of the tracer
study data. The instruments of interest include the chemical test equipment as well as
flow meters. Please provide the following information on tracer study data and
instrumentation.
 Analytical method (range, sensitivity, accuracy, field or laboratory analysis).
 Identify the field and facility instruments used in the tracer study.
      Make and model of instrument(s).
      Calibration date of instrument(s).
      Reagents used in test and associated expiration dates.
      Sensitivity range of equipment.
 Level measurements (if the water level can vary during the test)
      Method for maintaining a near-constant water level.
 Provide a copy of the proposed field data sheets. Each data sheet should include the
  following.
   Flow, level, temperature, and tracer measurements.
      The instrument used to obtain the data.

Presentation of results
    Templates (forms, tables or graphs) you will use to present the results
    Instructions explaining how to use the results to complete daily CT monitoring,
     including a method for determining peak flow (inflow, outflow).
    CFD modeling results, if applicable.

Appendix D.1         Background: Residential Water Demand vs.
                     Precipitation
Appendix D.1 is a study originally published in the 1999 Water System Design Manual.
We present D.1 to support the design of new water residential-only systems without
metered data or analogous water system data to estimate the ERU ADD and ERUMDD.

Data Collection
A basic tenet for the revised design standards was to provide a conservative basis for
designing new water system development, or extensions to existing development,
whenever more reliable historical data was unavailable. It was recognized that a basic
design parameter such as residential water demand may be better estimated if it could
be based on available information throughout the state that could be both accessible
and reliable. Information gained from water system records throughout the state, or
from other locales with residential developments similar to this state, would be useful
and generally more applicable to the establishment of a general design standard.

In attempts to secure accurate water use data from all parts of the state, we used three
sources of information—two from DOH surveys and one from reviews of documented
information contained in various DOH-approved Water System Plans (WSPs). An
additional source of information was a report the California Department of Water
Resources prepared.

An initial (1993-94) survey questionnaire was sent to 30 selected utilities representing a
uniform geographical distribution throughout the state. This survey was intended to
determine a complete accounting of all water uses experienced by the utility from which
specific data regarding residential uses could be derived. Questions were asked for
number of metered accounts, total annual water demand, total population served,
recorded average annual demands for all types of accounts (residential, industrial,
commercial), multifamily uses (if possible to discern), recorded maximum day demands,
and estimates of unaccounted water uses. The information was requested for the three
year period, 1990-92. Also, the average annual rainfall for the utility service area was
requested, if it were known by the utility. Where rainfall data was not provided by the
responding systems, rainfall levels were determined from Meteorological Service records
for the gauging station within, or nearest to, the utility.

For the 19 survey responses received from the initial questionnaire, the information was
analyzed in an attempt to identify the water demands associated only with residential
uses. This data was in turn correlated with rainfall records for the area. Of the survey
responses returned, nine were of sufficient detail that residential demand estimates

could be made with a relatively high degree of confidence. Information regarding
maximum daily demands was generally not readily available, although in some instances
water systems did present estimates of maximum day uses based on ratios to their peak
monthly demands. The ratios of maximum day use to peak month use ranged from 1.4
to 2.7 for those utilities providing an estimate.

Because the results of the initial survey were insufficient to develop generalized
relationships useful for design standards, a second survey was conducted in early 1995.
Thirty-eight (geographically distributed statewide) water utilities were asked for more
directed information. Under the logical premise that irrigation demands were strongly
associated with residential lot size, questions were asked regarding specific metered
residential accounts in service locations where residential densities could be determined
(i.e. utilities were asked to provide actual meter data from 20 to 30 accounts located in
portions of their service area which ranged from a low density of one or less services per
acre to a high density of five services per acre). The year for which utility meter records
were to be reviewed and assessed was 1993.

Twenty-six systems responded to the survey and presented information based on actual
1993 meter readings for residential accounts, and where possible, an estimate of the
residential density (ranges requested were for one or fewer units per acre, two units per
acre, three units per acre, four units per acre, and in some cases, five units per acre) for
those locations in their systems from which the meter records were taken.

The analysis of this information provided somewhat more direct, and presumably more
accurate, estimates of annual residential water demands. Since 1993 was unusual in that
the summer period experienced higher than normal rainfall, the demand data were
related to the rainfall records for that year rather than using average annual rainfalls.

Analysis of the relationship of water demand to lot size, although generally showing that
higher demands were related to larger lot sizes, and that this aspect was especially
pronounced for lots in excess of an acre as compared to higher density developments
(especially in eastern Washington), was not supported by sufficient unequivocal data to
allow formulation of quantifiable design relationships.

However, the design engineer is to be cautioned that the size of residential lots,
especially in eastern Washington, is clearly influential on the expected water demands,
particularly for lots larger than an acre in size. As much as 60 percent more water may
be used by a residence on an acre-plus lot than on lots which are less than an acre. The
engineer must be aware of this aspect, and will be held accountable for proper

consideration of this factor, when estimating water demands for tracts with large lot
sizes.

Additional (and considered reliable), information on residential water demands was also
found through reviews of 28 Water System Plans (WSPs) which had received DOH
approval in 1995 to early 1996. The information from these WSPs was specific to
residential water demands associated with meter readings or from professional engineer
estimates. These data were then related to the rainfall records information documented
in the WSP or from data on file with the Meteorological Service for gauging locations
proximal to the utility.

Additional information was also collected from a 1994 report prepared by the California
Department of Water Resources (Bulletin 166-4, “Urban Water Use in CA,” August 1994).
Included in this report (which provided a wide array of recorded water use patterns
specific to utilities or geographic areas in California) was some summary data for twenty
selected utilities which associated a ten-year average annual demand (on a per capita
basis) to average annual rainfall. Using a factor of 2.7 persons per Equivalent Residential
Unit, estimates of the average annual demands for 19 of these utilities (in terms of
gallons per day per ERU) were made and incorporated into the data set used for this
demand analysis. (One utility, Palm Springs, had demands that were influenced so
greatly by an abnormally large transient population that it could not be considered
reflective of a true residential community, and was therefore not included in the data
set).

Data Analysis
The data (a total of 122 data points) were evaluated in an attempt to identify and
characterize any discernable relationships. Although it was recognized that many factors
exist which could influence residential water demands, with the exception of average
annual rainfall there appeared to be insufficient information to draw relationships with
any other factor which could be used as a numerical and rational basis for specifying
design parameters. In earlier drafts of the revised design standards, factors were
developed and proposed to account for water demand influences associated with
residential density. From the data available there was clear evidence that lot size was
related to water use in both Western and Eastern Washington. However, the data were
limited and could not be reasonably applied to specific relationships descriptive of
statewide observations. The impact of lot size was, therefore, not accounted by some
design relationship, but was addressed as a qualitative aspect of design, which must be
considered and addressed. For other factors (such as economic status, pricing structure,
landscaping practices, conservation practices, etc.) which can be of significant influence
on water demand, there was insufficient information to draw any relationships or

qualitative conclusions. Some water systems may have in the past developed specific
relationships between several of these factors and their water demands, but such
relationships would be specific to an individual system and would not be applicable on a
statewide basis, unless they could be verified through collection and analysis of
additional and reliable information.

Development of Rainfall/Residential Demand Relationship
The data were plotted in an x-y scatter plot and visually inspected. From an examination
of the plotted data, there seemed to be a generalized relationship between average
annual demand for residential developments and average annual rainfall. It was
apparent that use of a single value for demand estimates on a per household basis (as
has been historically the practice), for the design of residential water systems was not
particularly appropriate. A curvilinear function appeared to be more descriptive of
average water demands when associated with such a climatic factor as average annual
rainfall.

Accepting that the data could be better described by a curvilinear function, several
different fitting models were used to develop best-fit curves for the data. Figure D-1
presents two best-fit curves, one based on a hyperbolic function, and a second based on
a power function. Both provide similar fits to the data set, with correlation coefficients
(R) of 0.49 and 0.61, respectively. Although these correlations are not as strong as one
would like to develop basic relational equations, they were considered sufficient to allow
acceptance of the general form of a function which could be used for water demand
design criteria. The data scatter in the low rainfall areas contribute significantly to the
marginal correlations with rainfall which points out the influence of other factors in
determining average daily demands for residential populations.

In order to determine confidence intervals (C.I.s) for the mean of the data set, and more
usefully in this application, prediction intervals for individual points, the data were
transformed to develop a linear relationship. A log x-log y transformation provided a
data set with a linear regression line corresponding to the best-fit power function curve.
The linear regression line for the plot of y vs. 1/x corresponds to the hyperbolic function.
The transformed data and appropriate C.I.s are presented in Figures D-2 and D-3, and
were developed using SPSS statistical software.

Mean and Point Prediction Intervals at 60%
The centerline in Figures D-2 and D-3 represent the mean of the data set. The curved
lines on each side of the center line are the 60 percent confidence bounds for the mean
of the data, and the parallel lines at the outer portions of the data are the 60 percent
Prediction Intervals for individual points. That is, based on the data available, and
standard assumptions about the validity of that data as representative of the larger
population, it can be said with 60 percent certainty that usage, as a function of rainfall,
of any new data point will fall between the two outer, parallel lines. It is noted that
although 60 percent represents a relatively marginal level of confidence, the notable
data scatter in the low rainfall range biases these results.

An upper level curve for the Power Function based on the 60% confidence boundary,
when plotted back to arithmetic coordinates, indicates that 85% of all points are below
the upper bound. For rainfalls averaging less than 30 inches per year, almost all points
are below the upper bound.

Review of Figures D-2 and D-3 indicates that transforming the data based on a
hyperbolic function (i.e. y vs. 1/x) provides a slightly poorer linear relationship than the
power function. However, the difference was not considered of such significance that
use of a hyperbolic relationship could be discounted.

Baseline Residential Water Demand
The data (shown in Figure D-1) shows an interesting aspect which appears to have
general application and credence for baseline residential water demands. With only a
few exceptions where a few data points can be seen to be lower, all data generally lied
above a value of 200 gpd/ERU (i.e., at all rainfall levels, the average annual demands
reported were greater than 200 gpd/ERU). This observation may be construed as a
threshold level for residential demands which appear to be independent of average
annual precipitation levels and may indicate the base level of demand associated with
internal household (non-irrigation, etc.) uses. As such, the function which describes the
relationship between ADD and average annual rainfall would be more strongly
associated with external household uses (irrigation, lawn watering, etc.). Assuming this is
the case, design requirements for total demands could be separated into two
components - one related to internal uses and the other to external uses. For internal
demands, a constant value independent of rainfall could be prescribed and for external
demands, a relational function could be established which was dependent upon rainfall
levels.

From the data, the single valued level for average annual household demands (internal
uses), which would appear to apply statewide independent of rainfall, is about 200
gpd/ERU. Logic dictates that this demand may be consistent on an average annual basis,
but cannot be expected to be uniform on a day to day basis. Residential households
would be expected to experience peak demand days for internal uses associated with a
number of factors. Peak day uses could be expected with increased water demands for
showering in the summer, or when visitors or relatives are entertained. The actual levels
associated with the peaking demand days would be dependent upon many variables.
There were no known relational studies, or anecdotal accounts, that could be found
which would assist in development of design parameters for internal household peaking
uses. Nonetheless, in order to maintain consistency with stipulations of the state’s Group
B water system design criteria, and with the Department of Ecology, who in some
instances provides estimates of peak day internal uses for water rights issues, a
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                           384
reasonable level for a Maximum Daily Residential Demand for internal uses can be
established at 350 gpd/ERU (a value which can be seen is marginally less than double
the average annual internal demand of 200 gpd/ERU previously discussed).

For projects that propose to have separate irrigation systems, the design of the
potable (internal use) water system can be predicated on the estimate of 350
gpd/ERU. The irrigation portion of the system may be designed based on the respective
needs of the customers, or by using the difference between the demand estimated for
complete service (Maximum Total Daily Demand) and that for just the internal uses
(Maximum Internal Daily Demand).

Selection of Design Functions for Residential Water Demands
In development of a functional design relationship which can be used for estimating the
residential water demands in Washington State a number of approaches were examined:
      Based on the statistical features of the data set, a function that described the
       relationship associated with the upper bound of the 60% confidence interval
       could be used.
      The current approach that sets demand levels at constant values for Eastern and
       Western Washington could be retained. However, this “status quo” approach may
       not be particularly applicable based on a review of the data. There appears to be
       a trend better described by a continuous function rather than by a single, but
       separate, value ascribed to water system design simply because of gross climatic
       differences between East and West Washington.
      Another approach would be to establish a function that gives criteria higher than
       any recorded data to insure that, at least, the data set available was completely
       accounted in a highly conservative manner.

The foregoing approaches were all rejected under criteria that were believed
appropriate to guide the design function selection process. It was considered
reasonable and prudent to establish an approach that would provide for a relationship
that was patterned to the “best-fit” curves developed for the data that were sufficiently
conservative so that reasonable confidence could be placed on the use of the design
relationship (i.e., the function would describe demands that were in excess of at least
80% of the recorded data), that the relationship would be as simple as possible to use
and understand, and that the relationship would be asymptotic to a baseline demand of
200 gpd/ERU.

In addition, based on the wide range of reported data in the low rainfall range which
showed some, but very few, systems that experienced very high average annual
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                         385
demands (> 1000 gpd/ERU), it was determined appropriate to establish an upper
boundary of 1,000 gpd/ERU for any relationship (function) that was developed.

Under these criteria, two functions were developed, one a power function and the other
a hyperbolic function, which were asymptotic to the 200 gpd/ERU lower boundary and
which were presented in very simplistic terms. Another function was also developed,
which does not show an asymptotic boundary associated with the 200-gpd/ERU level,
but does parallel the best-fit power function relationship used for the previous data
analysis. Each of these functions is conservative in that 80% or more of the data would
lie below the curves describing the functions. Presented in Figure D-4 are three
graphical relationships with their associative functions. One hyperbolic relationship and
two power function relationships are presented, any of which may be used to estimate
residential water demands throughout the state when no other better information is
available or applied for design.

Although the power function relationship may have somewhat greater statistical
strength, the relatively high conservative nature of these functions would allow for any
of them to be used for design purposes. Since the hyperbolic function provides more
conservative estimates at lower rainfall ranges, and is possibly the simplest to use and
understand because of its arithmetic nature, it was selected as the function of choice for
estimates of average annual residential demands used for project designs when more
appropriate information is not available.

Maximum Day Demand
A variety of peaking factors have been reported in the literature and within the data
collected for this analysis, but generally the Maximum Daily Demand (MDD) is 1.5 to 3
times average daily demand. By selecting an appropriately conservative approach to
estimating ADDs (as was done in this analysis), use of a standard peaking factor of 2.0
was considered to be adequately conservative. MDD can therefore be calculated by
multiplying ADD values by a factor of 2.0. Again, an upper maximum level would be
been established based on the upper boundary for the average annual demand (1000
gpd/ERU). The MDD value would be 2000 gal/day/ERU as an upper bound. The absolute
lower limit MDD values, as previously discussed, are set at 350 gpd/ERU (for
developments without irrigation or with restrictions on the external use of water).

Limitations of This Analysis
It is clear from inspection of the graphs presented in this appendix that the data varies
widely, and the existence of many other factors that affect both average annual and
peak daily water use have been acknowledged. The intent of this document is to
ensure that new systems, or system improvements, are designed based on

reasonable and conservative criteria when there is an absence of sufficient
production and use data to allow other design parameters to be used. The
approaches presented here reflect this philosophy, and as such, have tried to use
relatively sparse data in a reasonable and judicious manner. The water demand design
criteria contained in the Design Manual (Chapter 3) represent an improvement over
what has historically been used in the state. In the future as more and better information
becomes available, even greater refinement of the approaches can be expected.

Appendix D.2 Estimating Nonresidential Demand
Table 3-2 in Chapter 3 of this manual provides guidance on estimating nonresidential
maximum daily demand (MDD). Design engineers should apply the following
assumptions when using the values presented on Table 3-2:
      Unit nonresidential demand will vary little from day to day.
      MDD is based on a full facility (the campsite or hotel is fully occupied or the
       school is operating at capacity).

Tables 1 and 2 provide guidance on establishing nonresidential peak hour demand
(PHD) using the fixture method.

Example
A proposed catering business in Western Washington will employ 30 daytime
employees and have no visitors. The proposed building will have its own drinking water
system, using a permit-exempt well. The area around the building to be irrigated is
3,000 sq. feet. A fire pond filled by a nonpotable water supply will meet the building’s
fire-suppression requirements. The fire pond and associated fire-suppression piping
have no physical connection with the potable water system.

Step 1: Apply the fixture weight to each fixture type (Table 1), and determine the
      building’s total fixture units.

    Fixture Type             Number of Fixtures x Fixture Weight =     Fixture Units
 Drinking fountain               2                 0.5                    1

Step 2: Round the total fixture units from 22 up to 25 (the next increment in Table 2).

Step 3: Use Table 2 to establish peak hourly demand for internal use within the building.
      Nonresidential internal PHD is 18 gallons per minute. If the irrigation system is
      not operated while the building is occupied, then the estimated design PHD
      should be 18 gpm. If the irrigation system can be operated while the building is
      occupied, then the design estimate for PHD should include both the internal PHD
      (18 gpm in this example) plus the peak flow rate of the irrigation system.

Appendix D.3 MDD vs. Maximum Month Average Daily Demand
We analyzed daily water treatment plant data in an attempt to establish a maximum
daily demand (MDD) to maximum month average daily demand (MMADD) ratio. For the
purpose of this analysis we assumed production was equivalent to total water system
demand.

We based the guidance presented in Section 3.4.1 on our analysis of the source
production records for 79 water systems using surface water in Washington for the
period 2009 through 2014. These systems operate surface water treatment plants and
are required to record and report daily source production. The surface water treatment
plants are the only routine supply for these 79 water systems, and we used their net
treatment plant production information as a proxy for daily system demand (ignoring
changes in storage).

We identified the maximum month of production for each year and calculated the
MMADD for that month. We then identified within that month the MDD, and for each
year and each system calculated the MDD to MMADD ratio. We removed significant
statistical outliers from the data set—those outside two standard deviations.

We found strength in correlation between increasing system size and decreasing MDD
to MMADD ratio for water systems serving more than 1,000 people. The larger the
system, the more likely it is that the system has access to its own daily source
production data. But, if such primary source production data is unavailable, our analysis
of the 80th percentile value indicates an MDD to MMADD peaking factor of 1.35 for
systems serving 1,000 to 100,000 would be appropriate. We believe applying a 80 th
percentile threshold for design is appropriate without daily source meter data. The
location of the water system was not seen as a factor.

For the 28 water systems serving fewer than 1,000 people, we found a weak correlation
between population served and the MDD to MMADD ratio. In addition, as with the
larger system cohort, system location did not matter. From the primary smaller system
production data, we determined the 80 th percentile value of 1.65 for the MDD to
MMADD ratio.

In the 2009 version of the Water System Design Manual we recommended a MDD to
MMADD ratio of 1.7 for water systems in Western Washington and 1.3 for water systems
in Eastern Washington. This recommendation was based on review of a single year of
data from 35 water systems. As described above, updated analysis is based on 79
systems reporting water production over a five-year period. Based on this expanded

Appendix E: Recommended Pumping Test Procedures

1.0        Introduction
We intend this pumping test guidance to provide Group A water systems with basic
information suitable to develop an approach to satisfy source approval requirements in
WAC 246-290-130 (3)(c)(iii) and (3)(d). One acceptable approach for demonstrating
source reliability is to conduct a pumping test at the maximum design rate and duration,
according to WAC 246-290-130(3)(c)(iii).

This guidance explains how to establish the physical capacity and reliability of a new or
redeveloped well for the proposed use. This guidance does not address the legal
adequacy or availability of water. The Department of Ecology manages the permitting
process for appropriating and using the state’s water resources. Local government
determines water adequacy for the purpose of making local land use and building
permit decisions. Contact Ecology and the local government for requirements necessary
to demonstrate legal adequacy and availability.

The principal objective of a source approval pumping test is to establish a reasonable
estimate of the well’s sustainable yield and specific capacity. Once established, these
values enable the proper selection and positioning of the well pump in the well.

This pumping test guidance includes:
      Basic approach to pumping tests (Section 2.0)
      Pumping test planning elements (Section 3.0)
      Pumping test methods and analysis (Section 4.0)
      Special aquifer settings and considerations (Section 5.0)
      Pumping test results (Section 6.0)
      Reporting (Section 7.0)
      Potable water supply samples (Section 8.0)

These recommendations represent the minimum criteria for obtaining reliable, useful,
and verifiable data. Some hydrogeologic settings may require investigative efforts
beyond the scope of this guidance. The design engineer should consult with a licensed
hydrogeologist wherever site conditions warrant expertise in the design and evaluation
of the pumping test.



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                 393
As a rule, the more thorough the pumping test and comprehensive the data collection
and analysis, the greater the confidence in the assessment of safe yield and specific
capacity. It is incumbent upon the design engineer to determine the appropriate scope,
duration, and data collection and analysis for each new or rehabilitated source. In so
doing, the design engineer should identify and address the degree of uncertainty by
applying a suitable factor of safety, water supply contingency planning, or developing
redundant water supply facilities.



2.0        Basic Approach to Pumping Tests
For most aquifer conditions, you can adequately define source reliability by conducting
step-drawdown and constant-rate pumping tests. If you consider another pumping test
approach, contact your DOH regional engineer before submitting your pumping test
plan. We recommend conducting pumping tests during periods when the water table is
at its lowest (summer and fall months). Bailer tests, air lift tests, and slug tests are not
acceptable.

2.1        Step-Drawdown Pumping Test
A step-drawdown test is a single-well pumping test designed to assess a well’s
performance. It is the most reliable way to determine the pumping rate and pump
setting, and it can provide a maximum design pumping-rate you can use for the
constant-rate pumping test. The test yields information primarily about the performance
of the well rather than aquifer properties and does not require observation well data.
The step-drawdown test will likely not identify impermeable boundaries, recharge
boundaries, interferences from other wells, or conditions of groundwater under the
influence of surface water, unless these conditions exist in very close proximity to the
well being tested. For the step-drawdown test, the discharge rate in the pumping well is
increased from an initially low constant-rate through a sequence of pumping intervals
(steps) of progressively higher constant-rates.

You may not need the step-drawdown test in settings with established water quality and
water reliability. For example, when a low-yield source is in an aquifer where existing
wells have repeatedly produced high-yield with very little drawdown. Talk to DOH for
approval before you start a constant-rate test without conducting step-drawdown test.

Designers may extend the last step of the step-drawdown test and skip the constant-
rate test if the proposed well is a low-yield source and they extend the last step until
they achieve stabilized drawdown. You should measure post-test well recovery. If you
can’t achieve stabilization, or the water level fails to return to 95 percent of static water
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                  394
level measured prior to conducting step-drawdown test after 24-hours, you should
perform a constant-rate test.

The designer may skip the step-drawdown test and proceed directly with a constant-
rate test if both:
      Water quality and water reliability of the aquifer have been established.
      The proposed well is a low-yield source in an aquifer known to support high-
       yielding wells with very little drawdown.

You should discuss any variation from the standard step-draw-down test with DOH
before starting the pumping test. For example, you should contact DOH before you
proceed to a constant-rate test without conducting a step-drawdown test.

Beware when satisfactory stabilized drawdown is achieved and then declines due to
poor recharge characteristics of the surrounding material. In such situations, a constant-
rate test is required. You also should observe the ability of the water level to recover. If
the water level fails to return to 95 percent of the static water level measured prior to
the low-yield source step-drawdown test after 24-hours, the reliability of the producing
zone is open to question and additional constant-rate testing is required. You will need
to submit an explanation and justification of this additional test to DOH for review and
approval.

2.2        Constant-rate Pumping Test
The constant-rate pumping test is performed by pumping a well at a constant-rate and
measuring drawdown versus time. Most engineers use or install one or more
observation wells at an appropriate distance from the pumping well to measure water
levels. You should conduct the constant-rate discharge test at the pump setting and
maximum design pumping-rate determined from the step-drawdown test. Before the
constant-rate test, you should allow the aquifer to recover to within 95 percent of the
static water level measured before the step-drawdown test.

2.2.1      Recovery Phase
Water-level measurements obtained during the recovery phase of the constant-rate test
are of equal or greater importance than those collected during the pumping phase
because they can confirm flow disturbances. The recovery phase is not subject to
fluctuations, such as discharge rate variations or well losses. Section 4.0 presents details
concerning these data.

3.0        Planning a Pumping Test
You should prepare your pumping test plan and discuss it with DOH for endorsement
before starting the test. This planning step supports efficient use of client resources in
satisfying the source approval process and in achieving test results supporting
conclusions on the safe yield and pump setting depth. Sufficient information about each
element, including references and rationale for the planning and design decisions,
should be collected, documented and discussed.

The pumping test plan you submit to DOH for review and approval can be simple or
complex, depending on the project setting, size, and owner’s resources. The
development of a well represents a significant investment for a water system. Many
elements of system design, including the number of customers that can connect to the
water system and the design of the well pump are based on the expected yield of the
source. The objective of the pumping test plan is to guide a well driller in establishing,
with an appropriate level of confidence, the capacity of the aquifer and the pumping
well to satisfy the minimum well yield expectations.

The proposed pumping well construction should be finalized prior to the pumping test
plan. A pumping test should be designed to reflect the hydrogeology of the site, the
hydraulic parameters to be determined, the defined test endpoints, and the degree of
confidence. We provide a comprehensive outline for preparing a pumping test plan in
the following sections.

3.1        Well Site Description
You should use existing data to develop a source area description:
      A map and description of the proposed well location, property ownership,
       topography, land use, known or potential sources of contamination in the vicinity
       (hazardous waste sites, sewer lines), and other pertinent related details. You
       should describe surface water bodies, including wetlands, irrigation channels,
       creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, and coastal waters near the source
       area, as well as bedrock outcrops, faults and other potential boundaries.
      A table with information about wells located within ½ mile of the source
       (location, date installed, elevation, depth, casing length, screen interval, aquifer
       where the well is screened). If available, obtain copies of the well logs.
      Include vicinity, topographic, and other maps depicting the source area features
       and existing well locations with the source area description.

      Discussion on the aquifer conditions (confined, semi-confined, unconfined),
       thickness, lateral continuity, and special aquifer conditions as defined in Section
       5.0
      Relevant aquifer or aquitard characteristics including soil or rock type; depth to,
       thickness, and areal extent of aquifer and aquitard units; known or suspected
       boundaries, water level data; type of aquifer (confined, leaky, unconfined), and
       hydraulic properties (hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity).
      Distance from the site to surface water bodies located (within one mile).

3.2        Well Construction and Condition
For a proposed well, include the following in a pumping test plan:
      Drilling method
      Ground surface elevation and method of determination
      Annular (surface) seal material, depth, and thickness
      Intended well diameter, depth, and casing
      Intended well screen type, screen interval(s), and length/depth

For an existing well, in addition to the items above, include the following:
      Well log
      Well development procedures
      Past pumping test results
      Past seasonal static water level and pumping level
      Documentation of problems with well performance
      History of well rehabilitation, cleaning, and redevelopment
      Present condition of casing, well screen, or perforations

3.3        Data
Provide test data reporting sheets, interval of data collection, means of collection
(written or by automated data logger), who will be running the pump test/collecting
data, and measuring device specifications, including:
      Clearly define the pumping test objective using definable endpoint(s) (e.g.,
       demonstrate sustainable yield equals or exceeds 500 gpm/0.7 MGD and
       determine appropriate pump setting depth during crop irrigation season while
       S01 and S03 are pumping; based on a 24-hour constant-rate pump test).
      Identify and describe data gaps you will need to fill before and during the
       pumping test. (e.g., how will data collected during high groundwater conditions

       inform the design so that the operational pumping rate and pump setting of the
       water source are suitable for the dry season?).
      Assess the confidence level obtainable with the proposed pumping test. Explain
       how the level of uncertainty effects the overall design of the water system. (Will
       data collected provide a single source that will meet the desired demand or will
       storage capacity be required for the overall design?).

3.4        Pumping Test Mechanics and Field Procedure
Describe water level and discharge measurement procedures, including measuring
device(s), device calibration and accuracy, and the frequency of monitoring. We
attached a template of the field data sheets to be used to the end of this appendix.
Describe the capacity of the pump you will use in the pumping test and the rationale for
selecting it. Provide a disposal plan for discharged water and potential impacts to the
pumping test.



4.0        Recommended Pumping Test Methods and Procedures
The following components require consideration when designing a pumping test. We
don’t intend this information to be a resource for all aspects of pumping tests; it covers
considerations necessary to collect useful, reliable data. You should conduct the
pumping tests after full recovery from pumping that occurred before the start of the
pumping tests. To reproduce the anticipated stress on the aquifer, the pumping test
should take place when nearby wells are operating under normal conditions. Likewise,
the pumping test plan should reflect multiple wells in a wellfield intended to be pumped
simultaneously to meet the design source production.

No pumping should be conducted at or near the test site for at least 24 hours before
the test. If on-site or nearby pumping cannot be curtailed due to system supply needs
or other factors, you should note this and discuss it and how it relates to the test
accuracy. If an interruption in the pumping test occurs, you need to demonstrate that
the interruption had no significant effect on the data. If the interruption is longer than
two hours, you should terminate the test, allow the water level to recover fully, and
restart the test.

4.1        Stabilized Drawdown
Stabilized drawdown is when a water level has not fluctuated by more than plus or
minus 0.5 foot for each 100 feet of water in the well (i.e., static water level to bottom of
well) over the duration of constant flow rate of pumping. See Section 4.3.2 for guidance
on the duration of a constant-rate pumping test under various aquifer conditions, and
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                398
guidance on the minimum duration of the stabilized drawdown phase the test. Plotted
measurements of drawdown should also not show a trend of decreasing water levels.

Stabilized water level can often be misjudged due to varying hydrogeologic factors and
the basis for stabilized water levels provided is the minimum required. Final judgement
for stabilized drawdown ultimately rests with the hydrogeologist or engineer in charge
of the pumping test.

4.2        Observation Wells
Observation wells provide more representative and accurate data during the pumping
test. You should consider wells near the pumping well for observation well monitoring.
Pretest analysis of well depth and distance can determine the best wells to use as
observation wells. Observation wells with an open interval in the same aquifer as the test
well are desired. If the aquifer you’re evaluating is confined, it may be useful to select
additional observation wells completed within the overlying or underlying aquifer to
determine whether there is leakage into or from the confined water system.

For saltwater intrusion concerns, observation wells between the pumping well and
saltwater body can provide the most useful information.

You should not use wells with floating food-grade lubricant or other product for
pumping test evaluation, unless there is a shortage of observation wells at the site. The
floating lubricant may introduce measurement errors and provide misleading results. If
you use wells with floating food-grade lubricant, you should estimate the density of the
product to calculate the equivalent head in the well.

4.3        Test Duration
The length of a pumping test depends on the purpose of the test and hydraulic
properties of the aquifer. This guidance does not support the historical concept of a 4-
hour pump test.

4.3.1       Step-Drawdown Test
The step-drawdown test procedure should consist of at least four constant-rate tests
each run successively at increasingly higher flow rates until stabilized drawdown occurs.
The well test begins at a low constant discharge rate until the drawdown in the well
stabilizes, then the process is repeated at successively higher pumping rates through at
least four steps. The duration of each step depends on achieving stabilized drawdown.
Each step is typically of equal duration, lasting from about 30 minutes to 2 hours


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                             399
(Kruseman and de Ridder 1994). It is important to run the initial step long enough to
establish that the effects of well storage have dissipated.

4.3.2      Constant-Rate Test
The time required to run a constant-rate pumping test depends on the type of aquifer,
distance to boundary conditions, and the level of accuracy needed to estimate hydraulic
characteristics. A confined aquifer should be pumped a minimum of 24 hours while an
unconfined aquifer should be pumped for a minimum of 72 hours. You also should do a
pumping test of 72 hours or longer if pumping from aquifers with fracture flow, aquifers
of limited areal extent, seawater intrusion, delayed yield or slow drainage effects.

You may need to extend the minimum pumping test duration if you anticipate that a
delayed yield or slow drainage effect will influence the pumping test interpretation.
While there are methods available to analyze fluctuating data, it is good practice to
achieve stabilized water levels, especially when you need accurate information
concerning aquifer characteristics. You should establish stabilized drawdown for a
constant-rate test lasting at least 6 hours at the end of the minimum test duration. If
stabilized drawdown is not achievable within a reasonable period, you should stop the
test, allow the water level to recover to its original static water level, and conduct a new
test at a lower pumping rate.

4.4        Pumping Rate
It is very important that the pumping rate be held constant during each phase of a
pumping test. The pumping rate should be monitored to ensure the rate is maintained
within 10 percent of its starting value. Fluctuations in pumping rate make the test
analysis difficult and raise questions as to whether deviations in the data are actually a
result of flow boundaries or other hydrogeologic features. Control of the pumping rate
is often best accomplished by accurately measuring and controlling the discharge rate.

4.4.2      Constant-Rate Test
You should perform the constant-rate pumping test at or above the maximum design-
pumping rate determined from the step-drawdown test results, and the rate sought for
approval in the water-supply application.

4.5        Water-Level Measurements
Water-level measurements should be recorded to the nearest 0.01 foot. The well to be
tested should be at its static water level prior to the test. Static water levels at the
pumping well and observation wells should be measured at least daily for one week
prior to the start of the test.

You also should make water level measurements of the pumping test at 24, 16, 12, 3, 2,
and 1 hours prior to initiating pumping. Within the hour immediately preceding
pumping, you should take water level measurements at 20-minute intervals to establish
short-term trends in water level changes that may be occurring. Immediately before
starting the pump, you should measure water levels in observation wells and in the
pumped well to determine the static water levels upon which you will base drawdowns.
These data and the time of measurement should be recorded.

The start of the pumping test should be recorded as time zero. It is important in the
early part of the test to record with maximum accuracy the time at which readings are
taken. You should follow the chosen time schedule as closely as possible. If the schedule
is missed, you should record the actual time of a reading. Estimating drawdown
readings to fit the schedule may lead to erroneous results. You do not need to take
simultaneous readings in the pumping well and observation wells as long as you follow
the schedule and record the exact time you take the readings.

You will make most of the measurements within the first 100 minutes when the water levels
are changing rapidly. The time intervals given are suggested minimums; more frequent
measurements can assist with pumping test analysis and interpretation. Due to the
frequency of measurement required during the initial portion of the test, you should use
electronic water level indicators marked in tenths and hundredths of a foot or data loggers.
We recommend data loggers and pressure transducers, which provide efficiency and ease.

Barometric measurements of atmospheric pressure should be made at the same water
level measurement intervals. These measurements will allow appropriate corrections to
be applied to the drawdown data. In settings where tidal influences may affect the
pumping test results, measurements should be made at a frequency sufficient to correct
the pumping test drawdown data for observed tidal influences.

4.5.1      Step-Drawdown Test
Recording water levels during a step-drawdown pumping test should start for each
change in rate. Table 2 provides a schedule appropriate for recording water levels

4.5.2      Constant-Rate Test
Before starting the constant-rate test, allow sufficient time for water levels to return to
static conditions. As a general rule, the aquifer should be allowed to recover to within 95
percent of the static water level measured before the test. Adherence to the time
schedule should not be at the expense of accuracy in the drawdown measurements.
Table 3 provides a schedule appropriate for recording water levels during a constant-
rate pumping test.

4.5.3      Recovery Data
When pumping stops water rises toward its pre-pumping level. The rate of recovery
provides a means for calculating the coefficients of transmissivity and storage. In
addition, the recovery phase is not subject to induced variations and can provide more
reliable information. The time-recovery record, therefore, is an important part of an
aquifer test.

Recovery measurements should begin immediately upon pump shut down and be
collected using the same procedure and time pattern followed at the beginning of the
pumping test. Recovery data should be recorded for at least 12 hours or until recovery
to the static water level. Water level measurements should be made to the nearest 0.01
foot, and also be collected in all measured monitoring wells. A check valve should be
used to prevent backflow of water in the riser pipe into the well, which could result in
unreliable data.

4.6        Surface Water
Fluctuations in surface water stages (or stream flow) for all surface waters within 500
feet of the pumping well should be measured. Measurements should be made using, as
appropriate: weirs, staff gages, piezometers, and so on. Weir flow measurements should
be conducted for small streams. The horizontal distance between each observation
point and the pumping well should be measured to the nearest foot. The vertical
elevation of a fixed reference point on each observation point should be established to
the nearest 0.01 foot and reported in NAVD 1988.

You should read and record measurements at least once daily for one week prior to the
start of the test and at least twice per log cycle after the first 10 minutes for the duration
of the test. Make measurements more frequently if surface water levels are changing
rapidly.

4.7        Conveying Pumped Water
The design engineer should carefully review applicable requirements and permits for
discharging pumping test water. You should dispose of the water being pumped from
the well legally and follow the discharge practices allowed by local, state and federal
regulations. Water discharged during the pumping test should be conducted away from
the pumping well in a down gradient direction and at sufficient distance to eliminate
recharge of this water to the aquifer.

The objective of conveying pumped water as far from the site as possible is to minimize
the possibility of artificially recharging the aquifer and producing an erroneous pumping

DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                 403
test or affecting later stages of the test. There is no fixed rule on how far the water
produced during the pumping test should be discharged from the vicinity of the well. It
is best to pipe the water outside of the area the pumping test is likely to influence.
Water conveyance is particularly important when conducting pumping tests in shallow
unconfined aquifer settings. Considerations for determining a suitable distance include:
   If the aquifer is confined, less distance will be necessary.
   The shorter the duration of the pumping test, the less distance necessary.
   Depth to water and nature of geologic materials overlying the water producing
    materials:
    o The greater the depth to water, the less distance necessary.
    o The more transmissive the aquifer materials, the greater distance necessary.
   If possible do not discharge conveyed water between the test well and observation
    wells or suspected flow boundaries.

5.0        Concerns in Special Aquifer Settings
Reliability concerns have been identified for several aquifer settings, including water
quality concerns and water quantity concerns. These aquifer settings do not require a
different pumping test approach, but they do require longer tests, rigorous analysis of
the test data, and additional pumping-test design details. Because of the greater
difficulty and complexity in pumping test design and evaluation these settings present,
we recommend that you consult with a licensed hydrogeologist. The design engineer
also should contact the DOH regional engineer before developing the pumping test
plan for special aquifer settings. We discuss elements and concerns unique to these
conditions below.

5.1        Low-Flow Conditions
Low-flow conditions may be encountered in wells completed in aquifers with low
transmissivity. In these situations, the ability of the aquifer to yield the required volume
is of concern. Observation wells are not necessary because effects of pumping in low-
flow conditions typically are not far reaching.

5.2        Fracture Flow
Typically, sources completed in bedrock or consolidated material may have fractured
flow. The continuity of fractures can vary significantly within an aquifer and affect the
aquifer’s ability to provide water in a consistent manner. Restrictive conditions the
pumping test identifies could include lack of stabilized drawdown, which could signify
that recharge does not occur fast enough to maintain the desired pumping rate or the
presence of multiple recharge boundaries.
Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                 404
It also is possible for the rate of drawdown to decrease with time. This effect would
suggest that a recharge boundary was encountered. An extension of the pumping test
duration and additional observation wells may be required to determine any effect the
fracture flow has on long-term well yield. To obtain the appropriate data, you should
carefully consider the goals of a bedrock source-pumping test and fracture density test
before you plan the test duration and observation well network.

5.3        Aquifer of Limited Areal Extent
Aquifers of limited areal extent present concerns similar to fracture flow. Wells in this
setting may provide a reliable source of water initially, but the limited areal extent and
recharge capacity of these aquifers result in a reduced volume of water each day over
the long term. The highly variable material that commonly make up these aquifers, can
affect their ability to transmit water. The engineer should design the pumping test to
identify recharge or impermeable boundaries. You should use observation wells, so you
can determine the coefficient of storage as accurately as possible.

5.4        Seawater Intrusion
When water is pumped from an aquifer in a coastal area, the gradational boundary
between seawater and freshwater will move in response to the pumping (Culhane,
1993). The location of the well, aquifer characteristics, and amount of the groundwater
withdrawn effect the rate and extent of seawater movement. In addition to changing the
lateral boundary between fresh and seawater, large withdrawals in individual wells can
cause underlying seawater to migrate upward into the well, which is called “upconing”
(Island County, 2005) (See Figure 1).
                                                                     Figure 1
An assessment of inducing seawater into the pumping              Seawater Upconing
well or nearby wells is required. Engineers should
design the pumping test to establish a rate that
achieves stabilized drawdown without an associated
increase in chloride levels in the pumping well or
observation wells. We highly recommend at least one
observation well, positioned between the pumping
well and the shoreline, to assess seawater intrusion.

Water quality tests conducted during the pumping
test in potential seawater intrusion areas differ from
the other aquifer settings primarily in that chloride, total hardness (as CaCO 3), and
specific conductivity are monitored in both the pumped wells and observation wells. You
don’t need to outline specific sampling intervals in the pumping test design. Seawater is

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                              405
not the only potential source of chloride in groundwater (Culhane, 1993). Highly
mineralized groundwater (hard water) can contain high levels of chloride. Other possible
sources of chloride include septic tank effluent, windblown sea spray, agricultural
practices, irrigation recharge, and well disinfection. Testing for hardness will help
determine whether elevated chloride concentrations resulted from hard water or
possible seawater intrusion.

You can use instruments or test kits specific to these parameters to monitor water
quality indicators in the field. Water quality measurements are used to determine
whether concentrations are increasing, potentially signifying that saltwater is being
drawn towards the pumping well. Field tests are good screening tools but DOH
recommends submitting some samples to an analytical laboratory to verify the field test
results. After putting the well into full-time use, continue to monitor for chloride, total
hardness, and specific conductivity to identify trends and maintain potability. You need
to evaluate tidal influences before conducting the pumping test to determine whether
you need to adjust the drawdown data (Kruseman and de Ridder, 1991).

5.5        Multiple Wells and Well Fields
This setting refers to two or more wells completed in the same aquifer. They may be
pumped alternately or concurrently. DOH’s primary concern in this setting is whether
the new well interferes with other wells or with aquifer recovery.

If a pumping test was done for an existing well and data was collected from an
observation well(s), you can determine the potential for well interference due to adding
another well by using a distance-drawdown graph and evaluating additive drawdown
for the pumping wells. This is based on the principle of superposition, where the
drawdown at any point in the area of interference caused by the discharge of several
wells is equal to the sum of the drawdowns caused by each individual well.

If an applicant is seeking approval for multiple production wells, the engineer should
monitor all wells during the test. In addition, the test should be conducted in a way that
will obtain information pertinent to the operational needs of the wellfield. Pumping test
design should reflect intended operating conditions of all wells. Conducting an
additional pumping test exclusively on the new well would provide little new
information beyond validating the findings of the initial pumping test. In general, an
evaluation of potential well interference for either cyclical or concurrent pumping can be
determined using the additive drawdown approach. If an observation well was not used
during the pumping test, the same approach can be used. However, the results will likely
be less accurate in predicting well interference.

DOH considers each source approval in a multiple well setting on a well-by-well basis.
The water system should contact DOH to discuss a pumping test approach before
conducting the test.

5.6        Groundwater Wells Potentially Under the Direct Influence
           of Surface Water
Wells identified as potentially under the direct influence of surface water, may need a
pumping test to determine whether a hydraulic connection exists with nearby surface
water. A pumping test may be conducted to supplement water quality data and/or an
MPA test. Design engineers should use the pumping test evaluation to delineate the
well capture zone and estimate the time of travel under various pumping and water
level conditions. They will need to adjust the pumping test duration to evaluate
hydraulic connectivity.



6.0        Pumping Test Results
To analyze pumping test data accurately, you need to use methods and formulae
appropriate for the hydrogeologic and test conditions encountered at, and specific to,
the pumping test site. You must know the hydrogeologic conditions in the area to
ensure you use appropriate analysis techniques. Numerous texts cover the analysis and
evaluation of pumping test data (USEPA, 1993; Kruseman and de Ridder, 1991; Walton,
1970; and Ferris, Knowles, Brown, and Stallman, 1962).

6.1        Pumping Rate Determination
You can select the pumping rate for a well from the step-drawdown test. Calculate the
well efficiency, and then plot the well efficiency versus the corresponding pumping rate,
to create a sustainable well-yield graph. Well efficiency is defined as the ratio of the
theoretical drawdown in the formation to the actual drawdown in the well. By selecting a
pumping rate that corresponds to the desired well efficiency, you can identify a
sustainable well yield. See Figure 2 for an example of the plot. A well efficiency of 70
percent or more is usually desirable for a sustainable pumping rate.




Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                             407
A specific capacity plot of                           Figure 2
drawdown versus yield may                   Sustainable Well Yield Graph
also be used to show a point
that defines a sustainable
well yield. By plotting well
yield versus drawdown, you
can create a specific capacity
curve. On this curve, you can
identify deviations from a
linear response and note the
approximate point of
departure selected as a
sustainable well yield.

6.2        Pump Setting
Pump and well characteristics determine the pump setting. Specific capacity plots
combined with constant-rate test data can identify correct pump settings by correlating
points on the plots where stabilized drawdown occurs. The drawdown depth determined
from this correlation, incorporation of a safety factor, and the distance the design engineer
choses to place the pump intake below the pumping level, will define the pump setting.

6.3        Safety Factor
There are no rules for determining a safety margin. But, it is a good idea to incorporate
a safety margin for long-term operational considerations. Failure to make these
provisions may require a change in pump design or setting the pump deeper into the
well at a future date. A safety factor helps account for inaccuracies in the pumping test,
potential effects from boundary conditions, seasonal water level fluctuations, or other
special aquifer settings. These inaccuracies usually arise because of lack of complete
information about the overall aquifer characteristics or changes that may occur over
time.



7.0        Reporting
A hydrogeologic report summarizing current hydrogeologic data and pumping test data is
required. The person preparing the report should use the elements of the planning and
design stage. It should:
       Summarize the pumping test.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, October 2019                                                                408
         Contain the specific capacity, maximum production rate, and estimated aquifer
          properties. The summary will need to substantiate these values by presenting the
          worksheets, graphs and calculations.
         Discuss interpretations made about the aquifer at the site, including confining
          conditions and boundary conditions observed during the course of the test.
         Reconcile observed drawdown characteristics with the hydrogeologic setting, and
          explain why the analysis technique chosen (curve-fitting or numerical modeling) is
          appropriate.

All calculations and data analyses should accompany the final report. You should submit
all raw data in tabular form along with the analysis and computations. All calculations
should clearly show the data used for input, the equations used, and the results
achieved. Note any assumptions made as part of the analysis in the calculation section
(EPA, 1993).

7.1         Pumping Test Data Presentation
The water-level data presentation should include a graph of the arithmetic water-level
elevation versus time for the data from each well. From these graphs, you can discuss
long- and short-term trends, recovery of water levels, and evidence of aquifer boundaries.
You should address incomplete recovery and deviations from the theoretical recovery
trends, if appropriate.

You should present graphs of drawdown, versus time and distance, versus drawdown,
on semi-log or log-log paper. You should:
         Correct water level data, graphs, and interpretations, as appropriate.
         Present the effects of ambient water level trends, partially penetrating
          production well(s), partially penetrating observation wells, delayed yield from
          well storage and unconfined aquifers, aquifer thickness, recharge, or
          impermeable boundaries, and barometric pressure changes.
         Stage changes in nearby surface water bodies, recharge events (rainfall, snow
          melt) during the week preceding the test, during the test, or during the recovery
          period, influence from nearby pumping wells, and other hydrogeologic
          influences.

Use the recorded time and the corresponding drawdown to prepare time drawdown
graphs. The graphs should be constructed on a semi-logarithmic scale with time plotted
on the log scale. The plotted points will form a straight line after a certain pumping time
and the slope of that line will estimate the transmissivity of the aquifer. Changes in the
slope of the line may indicate boundary conditions.

Theoretical distance-drawdown graphs should be prepared by plotting the drawdown in
each observation well versus the distance of those wells from the pumping well. The
graphs should set time equal to the length of the pumping test and groundwater
withdrawal equal to the pumping test production rate. Storativity values can be
determined from the distance-drawdown graph. Recovery data should be analyzed in a
similar manner to drawdown data.



8.0           Potable-Water Supply Samples
Samples should be taken at a time representative of aquifer water quality. Ideally, you
should take samples within the last 15 minutes of the constant-rate pumping test. Water
samples must be collected from the source using proper sampling procedures and be
analyzed by an accredited laboratory (WAC 246-290-130(3)(g)). DOH will determine
source-monitoring requirements prior to the pumping test. Table 4 shows the minimum
water quality parameters required for a source approval.

        level (SAL). If we adopt a SAL for a previously unregulated contaminant, we will require you to sample some or
        all new sources for that contaminant at the time of source approval.

Appendix F.1         Hypochlorination for Small Water Systems

Submittal Outline
This outline will guide and summarize your hypochlorination treatment facilities’ design
for small water systems using groundwater or seawater sources treated by reverse
osmosis.

An engineer licensed in Washington state must prepare submittals for water treatment
facilities. You must include all supporting documentation with the design submittal
(WAC 246-290-110).

F.1.1     General Water System Information
Provide the following information:
   A. Water system name and public water system identification number.
   B. Owner's name, address, and telephone number.
   C. Manager's name, address, and telephone number.
   D. Operator’s name, certification level, and telephone number.
   E. Completed (preliminary) Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet. (include all existing
      and proposed treatment processes)
   F. Completed Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149).

F.1.2     Description of the Water Quality Problem
Describe the source of supply and the purpose and goals of the proposed treatment.
For example, is groundwater treatment required to address criteria because of any of
the following?
   A. WAC 246-290-453(1): Required 4-log virus inactivation due to fecal indicator in
      source water.
   B. WAC 246-290-451(4): Required CT6 due to coliform present in source water,
      microbial contaminant sources within the sanitary control area, groundwater in
      hydraulic connection with surface water, and seawater treated by reverse
      osmosis.
   C. WAC 246-290-451(5): Required free chlorine residual throughout the distribution
      system.
   D. Other treatment objectives: Fe/Mn oxidation/filtration, arsenic oxidation,
      hydrogen sulfide oxidation, and so forth.

F.1.3      Raw Water Quality
Groundwater quality tends to vary less than surface water quality, but some
groundwater parameters can substantially change seasonally. If an E. coli MCL violation
or Ground Water Rule-triggered E. coli source detection is driving the disinfection
system design, then the priority is to complete the design and construction as soon as
possible. Under these circumstances, you should collect one set of water quality
parameter samples (see following table) in support of the design.

With sufficient time, the design engineer should use water quality information collected
from both the dry season and from the onset of the wet season before completing the
design. Two separate measurements should be performed for the parameters listed
below.

A qualified person with properly calibrated instruments must measure temperature and
pH at the well site (not in a lab). A laboratory certified for drinking water must analyze
all other water quality parameters. Submit all lab data sheets to DOH.

Seawater RO product water is of high quality and consistent with very low chlorine
demand. Hypochlorination facilities designed for seawater RO systems do not need to
sample for the parameters listed below.

                                   Raw Water Quality Table

          Water Quality Parameters                              Comment

                                           DOC is a precursor to the formation of disinfection
                                           byproducts and exerts a chlorine demand. We found
                                           values less than 1.0 mg/l DOC unlikely to result in
                                           exceedances of the TTHM MCL, and values less than
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (mg/L)
                                           2.0 mg/L DOC unlikely to result in exceedances of
                                           the HAA5 MCL. DOC levels can vary seasonally in
                                           some groundwater sources. DOH recommends
                                           seasonal testing.

                                           Iron has a secondary MCL of 0.30 mg/L. In addition,
   Iron (mg/L)                             1 mg/L of reduced iron (Fe +2) exerts 0.6 mg/L of free
                                           chlorine demand

                                           Manganese has a secondary MCL of 0.050 mg/L. In
   Manganese (mg/L)                        addition, 1 mg/L of reduced manganese (Mn+2) will
                                           react with 1.3 mg/L free chlorine

                                          virus inactivation. A qualified person with properly
                                          calibrated instruments must measure temperature
   Temperature                            and pH at the well site (not in a lab). Temperature
                                          should be measured during winter.




Secondary Water Quality Effects
Introducing chlorine into a previously unchlorinated system can cause:
       Release of accumulated metals and sediments in the distribution system
       Formation of disinfection byproducts
       Taste and odor concerns

For these reasons, additional water quality analysis should be conducted. The additional
analysis will vary from system to system and could include:
       Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of untreated and chlorinated water
       Disinfection byproduct formation potential

In some cases, destabilization and dissolution of accumulated iron, manganese, arsenic,
and other metals may create unwanted aesthetics or unsafe drinking water. Engineers
and water system staff can evaluate the potential for metal release using a variety of
methods ranging from simple desktop studies to pipe-loop studies using sections of
water main pulled from the distribution system.

Design engineers must assess how the hypochlorite addition affects the potential for
corrosion and submit it to DOH (see Section 10.1.3). We will require systems of all sizes
that install sodium hypochlorite for the first time to complete one round of annual lead
and copper tap monitoring as soon as possible within the June to September
monitoring period following installation. If the design engineer’s corrosion assessment
demonstrates hypochlorite addition will have minimal effect on corrosion, and DOH
agrees, then DOH may not require this special round of annual tap monitoring.

Small systems (population <3,300) may forego a corrosion assessment and simply opt
for the annual set of samples. Medium and large systems may not opt out of the
corrosion assessment requirement by simply agreeing to collect one round of annual
monitoring after installing and beginning to operate sodium hypochlorite treatment.

F.1.4         Hypochlorination System Details
Provide a written description of the hypochlorination treatment operational
requirements. Include:
   A. Injection point.
   B. Maximum system pressure at chlorine injection point.
   C. Peak hour demand (QPHD)
   D. Average daily water use, gallons/day (QADD).
   E. Maximum daily water use, gallons/day (QMDD).
   F. Design flow rate of water to be treated at injection point gpm (Q s), and whether
      the flow rate at the injection point is constant (for example, Q s = installed single
      speed well pump discharge) or variable (for example, VFD booster pump
      discharge).
   G. Target free-chlorine residual, mg/L (Ct). If the treatment objective is to provide 4-
      log virus inactivation, Ct is directly related to available contact time (T). See
      Contact Time discussion below. If the treatment objective is to maintain a free-
      chlorine residual throughout the distribution system, consider the residence time
      in the downstream storage and distribution system, to the last customer.
   H. Estimated chlorine demand (due to ammonia, organics, iron and manganese, or
      other inorganics), mg/L (Cd ).
   I.   Describe how you estimated chlorine demand.
   J. Describe disinfection byproduct formation potential
   K. Calculate required chlorine dose, mg/L (C s = Ct + Cd )

F.1.5      Hypochlorination Feed Pump Requirements
This section is devoted to determining feed pump requirements. DOH recommends that
water systems purchase a spare feed pump, so that it’s available for immediate
installation and use when the operating pump undergoes routine maintenance or fails.
   A. Identify sodium hypochlorite stock chlorine strength, in percent available chlorine
      (e.g., 8.25%) (Cc). If the source of hypochlorite is calcium hypochlorite, the
      following equations do not apply. Calcium hypochlorite is typically identified as
      available chlorine in percentage (e.g., 65% available chlorine). See notes below.
   B. Amount of stock chlorine to be added to solution tank, in cups (V c)

Calcium hypochlorite [Ca(OCl) 2] disinfection systems create a hypochlorite solution by
dissolving [Ca(OCl)2] into water. One pound of 65% [Ca(OCl) 2] provides 0.65 lbs. of
available chlorine. If dissolved into 25 gallons of water (about 210 lbs. of water), 1 lbs. of
[Ca(OCl)2] will produce a solution strength of 0.003 lbs. available Cl2 per lbs. of water;
equal to Cf = 3100 mg/L.

   C. Identify the pump’s volumetric discharge range, and confirm that the maximum
      and minimum capacities are compatible with the maximum and minimum range
      of flow to be treated at the point of injection.
   D. Confirm wetted parts are compatible with chemical solution being pumped.
   E. Identify the need for a hypochlorination pump discharge flow modulation.

F.1.8     Achieving 4-log Virus Inactivation (CT6) Treatment
Unanticipated environmental conditions, or other factors beyond the water system’s
control, may adversely affect source water quality at any time. DOH strongly
recommends that all water systems planning disinfection include dedicated contact-
time facilities capable of achieving 4-log virus inactivation, or CT6 disinfection treatment,
as part of the design—even if the source is currently free of contamination.
   A. Dedicated contact time in this context means contact piping (most preferred)
      and/or contact storage (less preferred) that is solely dedicated to providing
      disinfection contact time for the disinfected source, and is not nested in a larger
      storage tank that is providing operational, standby, or equalizing storage.
   B. 4-log virus inactivation treatment triggers are summarized in WAC 246-290-453.
   C. CT6 treatment triggers are summarized in WAC 246-290-451.

A water system with a groundwater or seawater RO source requiring 4-log virus
inactivation or CT6 disinfection treatment before the first customer, may achieve this
level of inactivation using free chlorine by providing a minimum CT value of 6 if pH is in
the range of 6–9 and water temperature is greater than or equal to 10ºC. Groundwater
supplies with measured temperatures below 10ºC or above pH 9 require a CT value
greater than 6. See Sections 10.2.1 for guidance.

Provide the following information:
   A. Available minimum contact volume (excluding operational, standby, and
      equalizing storage), gallons (V)
   B. Baffling factor (BF). Use 0.1 for an unbaffled chlorine contact tank with separate
      inlet and outlet, where tank volume is equal to the lowest daily value. For chlorine
      contact piping, a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 160 is needed to achieve a
      baffling efficiency of 1.0 if the flow through the pipe is turbulent and not laminar.
      A length-to-diameter ratio of at least 40 is needed to achieve a baffling factor of
      0.7. For shorter pipe segments, the baffling factor can be estimated using the

        length-to-width ratio and information in Improving Clearwell Design for CT
        Compliance (Crozes et al. 1999). The engineer should assess contact piping
        comprised of different diameters for total contact time as the sum of separate in-
        line sequences. Parallel contact pipes must each be adequate to provide a CT
        value of 6 or greater for the design flow through each pathway. Include elbows
        in pipeline length.
   C. Credited contact time, minutes (Tcredited ).
   D. Maximum anticipated flow out of the chlorine contact tank and/or through the
      pipeline to the first customer, gpm (Q).

      required CT value.

F.2.2          Description of the Treatment Objective
Describe the source of supply and the purpose and goals of the proposed treatment.
The treatment objective should be consistency of fluoride concentration at all times
throughout all portions of the distribution system. The optimal treated water fluoride
concentration is 0.7 mg/L. Water systems that fluoridate must maintain a fluoride
concentration between 0.5 mg/L and 0.9 mg/L in the distribution system (WAC 246-290-
460).

   A. Provide a written description of the fluoridation treatment operational
      requirements. Include:
          i.    Source type (surface, groundwater, purchased). Naturally occurring fluoride
                concentration in surface water may be more variable than groundwater,
                demanding more design data and the capacity to recognize changes in
                natural fluoride concentration in source water.
         ii.    Natural fluoride concentration in source water, mg/L (C n ). Provide natural
                fluoride source water quality data from the last 10 years if available.

                production rate. The maximum pump capacity of the chemical feed pump
                should be no more than twice the chemical feed pumping rate during
                average source production.
   B. Water softening:
          i.    DOH recommends that water used in saturator first undergo softening if
                total hardness is greater than 75 mg/L as CaCO3.
         ii.    Water softener regeneration frequency and salt requirement per
                regeneration. Operators should strive to maintain at least a 30-day supply of
                salt.


F.2.4          Fluoridation Feed Pump Requirements
This section is devoted to determining the NaF feed pump requirements. We
recommend that water systems purchase a spare feed pump, so it’s available for
immediate installation and use when the operating pump undergoes routine
maintenance or fails.

Appendix F.3              Arsenic Removal by Coagulation/Filtration

Submittal Outline
This outline will guide and summarize your arsenic (As) treatment facilities’ design for
small water systems using groundwater sources. The following factors are important for
the successful, reliable operation of an arsenic removal treatment facility using
coagulation and filtration.
       Correct coagulant dose.
       Adequate oxidation of As(III) to As(V).
       Properly sized filter media.
       Complete and accurate raw water data at time of design.
       Appropriate filtration rate.
       Adequate backwashing frequency, rate, and control. Proper monitoring and
        control of the backwash recycle return (if applicable).

Because many factors affect design, and because raw water quality is so critical to
selecting an appropriate treatment technique, we usually require design engineers to
pilot test all facilities at the site, and to perform certain raw water quality tests on site.

An engineer licensed in Washington state must prepare submittals for water treatment
facilities. You must include all supporting documentation with the design submittal
(WAC 246-290-110).

F.3.3       Raw Water Quality
The raw water quality of most groundwater supplies can vary seasonally and over time.
For this reason, a minimum of two separate measurements should be collected for the
parameters listed below. In aquifers where the water quality is known to vary
significantly, such as some island aquifers, we recommend additional raw water quality
sampling. To get accurate data, a qualified person with a properly calibrated instrument
must measure pH at the well site (not in a lab). A lab certified for drinking water must
analyze all other water quality parameters (WAC 246-290-300(1)(c)). Submit all lab data
sheets to DOH.

F.3.4          Pilot Testing
Pilot testing is usually necessary to determine whether a treatment process is functional,
economically viable, and to develop the design parameters for the treatment process,
including:
   A. Preoxidant type, dose, and contact time.
   B. Coagulant type, dose, and contact time.
   C. Filter media type, depth, and loading rate.
   D. Backwash frequency, duration, and hydraulic rate.
   E. Filter-to-waste duration and rate.
   F. Backwash recycle return (flow rate, volume per filter backwash cycle, quality), if
      applicable.
   G. Other process control parameters (if used) such as pH adjustment.

Inadequate arsenic pilot testing may result in treatment process performance
inefficiencies or outright failure, delayed implementation of effective treatment, and
costly retrofitting or replacement of treatment facilities. For these reasons, pilot plant
testing, including the submittal of a pilot testing plan, will usually be required. At a basic
level, the project report that summarizes the pilot testing should describe:
   H. Pilot plant setup, duration (see Table 10-2), and results as they relate to full scale
      treatment design.
   I.   Pilot plant design parameters:
          i.    Treatment rate of the pilot plant (gpm/sq.ft.).
         ii.    Oxidant and dosage (mg/L), if applicable.
        iii.    Coagulant and dosage (mg/L).
        iv.     Length of oxidation and coagulant contact times. Contact time is detention
                time from point of oxidation or coagulation addition to filter.
         v.     Backwash parameters (filter run length/volume (hours or gals), backwash
                rate (gpm), duration (min)) and recycle return (if applicable).
        vi.     pH adjustment, if necessary.

F.3.5          Summarize Coagulation-Filtration Treatment Components
Include schematic drawing of the treatment system identifying:
   A. Major system components.
   B. Process control stations, such as water quality sampling points (raw, post-oxidant,
      post-coagulant, after each filter, combined filter effluent) flow meter(s), and
      pressure gauges, chlorine residual analyzer(s), turbidity meter(s)).

                   process control and aid in troubleshooting, so the use of chlorine
                   residual analyzers, pH analyzers, and turbidimeters should be evaluated.

Appendix F.4             Arsenic Removal by Adsorbents

Submittal Outline
This outline will guide and summarize your arsenic (As) treatment facility design for
small water systems using adsorbents. The cost and performance of adsorbents varies
widely. Both depend on the adsorbent type and raw water quality. Breakthrough can
occur in as soon as a few weeks or last many months before needing replacement.
Because very short run times can make the process economically unsustainable, pilot
testing is usually necessary for adsorbents.

An engineer licensed in Washington state must prepare submittals for water treatment
facilities. You must include all supporting documentation with the design submittal
(WAC 246-290-110).

F.4.1     General Water System Information
Provide the following general information:
   A. Water system name and public water system identification number.
   B. Owner's name, address, and telephone number.
   C. Manager's name, address, and telephone number.
   D. Operator’s name, certification level, and telephone number.
   E. Completed (preliminary) Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet (include all existing
      and proposed treatment processes).
   F. Completed Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149).

F.4.2     Description of the Water Quality Problem
Describe the source of supply and the purpose and goals of the treatment proposed.
Include source number and design flow rate(s).

F.4.3     Raw Water Quality
The raw water quality of most groundwater supplies can vary seasonally and over time.
For this reason, a minimum of two separate measurements should be collected for the
parameters listed below. In aquifers where the water quality is known to vary
significantly, such as some island aquifers, we recommend additional raw water quality
sampling. To get accurate data, a qualified person with a properly calibrated instrument
must measure pH at the well site, not in a lab. A laboratory certified for drinking water
must analyze all other water quality parameters (WAC 246-290-300(1)(c)). Submit all lab
data sheets to DOH.

 Arsenic As (Total) (ug/L)          You should do speciation between As(III) and As(V) in the
                                    field, and send samples to labs. Speciation is not necessary if
 Arsenic As(III)
                                    adequate preoxidation is provided. However, it can be useful
 Arsenic As(V)                      in troubleshooting treatment.

                                    Iron in excess of 0.3 mg/L may cause fouling of the adsorbent
 Iron (mg/L)
                                    and may cause excessive backwashing.

                                    Mn removal is frequently desired if it is greater than the
 Manganese (mg/L)
                                    secondary MCL of 0.050 mg/L.

                                    TOC in excess of 2 mg/L may cause fouling of the adsorbent
 TOC (mg/L)
                                    and may result in the need for excessive backwashing.

                                    pH strongly affects the ability of arsenic to bind to iron. Ideal
 pH                                 range pH 7.0 or less. At pH >8.0, pH reduction may be
                                    beneficial.

F.4.4       Pilot Testing
Pilot testing usually is necessary to determine whether a treatment process is functional
and economically viable and to develop the design parameters for the treatment
process, including:
   A. Preoxidant type, dose and contact time.
   B. Volume of water treated to breakthrough, expressed in term of bed volumes.
   C. Backwash frequency, duration, and hydraulic rate.
   D. Backwash recycle return (flow rate, volume per filter backwash cycle, quality) if
      applicable.
   E. Other process control parameters (if used), such as pH adjustment.

Inadequate arsenic pilot testing may cause treatment-process performance inefficiencies
or outright failure, delay implementation of effective treatment, and require costly
retrofitting or replacement of treatment facilities. For these reasons, pilot plant testing,
including the submittal of a pilot testing plan, will usually be required. At a basic level,

   H. Estimate the number of bed volumes that can be treated before exhausting the
      adsorbent media and describe the basis for the estimate.

F.4.5          Summarize Adsorbent Treatment Components

   A. Major system components.
   B. Process control stations, such as water quality sampling points (raw, post-pH
      adjustment, post-oxidant, after each filter, combined filter effluent) flow meter(s),

Appendix F.5                Use of Ozone in Groundwater Treatment

Submittal Outline
This outline supplements the outline in Appendix F.3, F.4, and F.10. It provides general
guidance on the use of ozone as a prefilter oxidant on groundwater sources.

F.5.1          Raw Water Quality
        1. Based on actual water quality results, show ozone demand calculations for the
           water to be treated.
        2. Identify the benefits that the proposed ozone treatment facilities can achieve.
        3. Identify any adverse effects that the proposed ozone treatment system may
           have on other water quality parameters (disinfection byproduct generation,
           increased corrosivity, and nutrient source for regrowth bacteria).
        4. Discuss the effect of the proposed ozone treatment on the requirements of
           the Ground Water Rule and the Disinfection and Disinfection Byproducts
           Rules.

F.5.2          Pilot Plant Testing
Inadequate pilot testing has caused treatment process failures, delayed implementation
of effective treatment, and required costly replacement of inadequate treatment. For
these reasons, we usually require pilot testing, including the submittal of a pilot testing
plan. Appendix F.3, F.4, F.10, and Section 10.3 have additional information on pilot
testing. At a basic level, the project report that summarizes the pilot testing should
describe:
   A. Pilot plant setup, duration and results as they relate to full scale treatment design.
   B. Pilot plant design parameters:
          i.    Treatment rate of the pilot plant (gpm/sq.ft. or gpm).
         ii.    Ozone dosage (mg/L).
        iii.    Ozone demand and decay coefficients
        iv.     Length of oxidation contact time. Oxidation contact time is detention time
                from point of oxidation addition to coagulant or filter/adsorbent vessel.
   C. How long was the pilot plant operated? What seasonal changes in water quality
      may affect the performance of the proposed treatment plant?

                (venturi, pump, diffuser, other). Identify operating parameters of method
                used (such as pressure differential, counter-current flow, mitigation of
                precipitate formation).
             b. Identify the necessary contact vessel required to provide contact time.
                Include sizing calculations and basis for sizing. Is contact vessel resistant
                to corrosion?
             c. Include a pressure or vacuum relief valve on the contact vessel; show
                that it is piped to a location for safe discharge.
             d. Identify on a drawing controls for cleaning, maintenance and drainage of
                the contact vessel.

            Describe a system that meets safety and air quality standards for treating
            off-gas from the contact vessel (Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act
            - WISHA -Chapter 296-841 WAC- the maximum permissible exposure is 0.30
            mg/L for 15-minute exposure). If undissolved ozone gas from the contact
            vessel is recirculated, demonstrate that the ozone concentration (off-gas) in
            downstream storage vessels is within standards and that the vessel is not
            subject to excess corrosion.
     v.    Piping Materials
           Specify pipe material with demonstrated corrosion resistivity (such as low
           carbon 304L or 316L stainless for ozone service, non-solvent welded UPVC
           pipe, Teflon valve seats). Identify a replacement schedule if the manufacturer
           recommends it.
    vi.    Ozone Facility Instrumentation

           b. Dew point monitor to measure the moisture of the feed gas.
           c. Ozone monitors (or alternate equivalent) to measure ozone concentration
              in the feed gas, undissolved gas in the contact vessel, ozone residual prior
              to filtration, ozone residual post filtration and in the off gas from the
              destruct unit.
           d. An ambient ozone monitor (or alternate equivalent) near the contact
              vessel and generator.

Appendix F.6         Reverse Osmosis for Desalination of Seawater or
                     Estuarine Water
At present, reverse osmosis (RO) treatment of an open sea or seawater source is not
subject to Washington’s Surface Water Treatment Rule requirements (Part 6 WAC 246-
290). Estuary and brackish sources of water may be subject to the Surface Water
Treatment Rule, depending on the degree of surface runoff supplying the proposed
intake and the viability of protozoa. Washington has some small seawater RO systems,
all located in northern Puget Sound.

Before initiating design or planning, check with the DOH regional engineer for
treatment requirements and process control or monitoring parameters that apply to
your specific project.

F.6.1     General Water System Information
Provide the following general information:4
   A. Water system name and public water system identification number.
   B. Owner's name, address, and telephone number.
   C. Manager's name, address, and telephone number.
   D. Operator’s name, certification level, and telephone number.
   E. Completed (preliminary) Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet (include all existing
      and proposed treatment processes).
   F. Completed Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149).

F.6.2     Permitting (verify with local, state, tribal and federal agencies)
The county planning department usually will issue final approval for the facility.
However, many different governmental agencies must review and approve a
desalination facility. The following list includes key required permits and reviews. If your
project involves tribal lands, check with all levels of government including tribal
authorities.
   A. Water Right Permit (contact Department of Ecology for current requirements)
   B. Shorelines Permit (county) (includes SEPA)
   C. Building Permits (county)
   D. Discharge Permit/NPDES (Department of Ecology)
   E. 401 Water Quality Certification (Department of Ecology)
   F. Wash. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife (Hydraulic Project Approval – HPA)
   G. Wash. Dept. of Natural Resources (Aquatics resource use authorization and
      easement)

        and section 10 is for working in marine waters)
   J. Franchise from County Public Works (depends on the location of waterlines, etc.)
   K. Wash. Dept. of Health (Engineering report, construction documents approval)

F.6.3         Pilot Study
Pilot studies are an important way to determine RO pretreatment requirements and
potential fouling characteristics of the raw and pretreated water. A pilot study may not
be necessary if other plants with the same raw water quality are operating near the
proposed project. Contact the appropriate DOH regional office to discuss. If a pilot
study is needed, see Section 10.3 for guidance.

With or without a pilot study, the water system’s management and operators should
visit plants similar to theirs. Understanding the complexity of the treatment process and
its operational and maintenance requirements and costs will inform decision-making
and system design.

F.6.4         Project Report
The engineering or project report should cover the design issues described in Chapter 2
and Chapter 10. As you develop your treatment design, you should consider
redundancy, accessibility, manned and remote operations, alarm conditions, and
treatment monitoring and performance expectations. Pay special attention to:

   A. Intake and Brine Discharge Considerations
         i.    Shallow well or infiltration gallery location and design. The intake should be
               more than 200 feet from any source of contamination (septic drain field, fuel
               storage, chemical storage, waste discharge). We do not recommend these
               types of intakes due to significant problems associated with maintenance
               and with access.
        ii.    When you locate a direct seawater intake, you should consider ease of
               maintenance, protection from damage (for example, by boat anchors), and
               the potential for contamination from a fuel spill and sewage discharge.
               Environmental concerns will drive both intake and discharge design. You
               should consider redundant piping when intakes are in sensitive areas.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   449
      iii.   Intake pipe fouling from mollusks can be a significant issue affecting
             ongoing operations depending upon intake location. Design should address
             this issue. Successful approaches have included alternating the intake line
             and the brine discharge lines (brine kills the mussels); oversizing intake lines
             and physical cleaning (requires access ports).
      iv.    Intake pump considerations. The intake pump, whether submersible (in
             seawater) or located on a dock, is subject to severe environmental stress.
             Pay careful attention to the quality of stainless steel selected and the use of
             different metals in proximity to each other. If you cannot find a submersible
             pump designed for seawater, you may use a standard pump with frequent
             monitoring, inspection, and repair incorporated into the design.
   B. Raw water quality including temperature and salinity by season. Puget Sound
      waters are of high quality but subject to seasonal turbidity events, changes in
      salinity, and very cold temperatures. Local areas may have significant algal
      blooms and be subject to mollusk fouling. You may need to get this information
      from existing nearby seawater RO plants.
   C. Treated water design criteria. Total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductivity are
      usually used to control permeate acceptance. Conductivity is directly measured
      and then an assumed salinity conversion factor is used to estimate TDS. The
      conversion factor used must be identified. Affirm that the conversion factor is
      appropriate for the seawater intake location. Identify finished water alkalinity and
      pH goals. Finished water TDS following pH and alkalinity adjustment must be less
      than 500 mg/L (WAC 246-290-310). TDS of the RO permeate should be less than
      350 mg/L.
   D. Membrane design criteria and selected membrane characteristics (membrane
      type and configuration). ANSI/NSF 61 certification is required. Expected recovery
      rate (percent), useful life of membrane, and expected membrane replacement
      schedule should be determined.
   E. Membrane cleaning. If cleaning is to be performed onsite, environmental issues
      for waste disposal must be addressed (See Section 10.8).
   F. High-pressure pump design pump sizing. Engineers frequently size pumps
      together with the seawater RO membrane supplier. Consideration for startup and
      shutdown should be included along with the ability of all components to handle
      expected operating pressures.
   G. Energy recovery systems. A significant portion of the energy used for the high-
      pressure RO feed pump can be recovered from the concentrated brine stream,
      thereby reducing energy costs. We recommend using energy recovery systems.
   H. Pretreatment of the seawater. Pretreatment is the most critical component for a
      successful treatment system. Puget Sound waters are of high quality but are

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                   450
        subject to seasonal turbidity events, and very cold temperatures. Local areas may
        have significant algal blooms and be subject to severe mollusk (primarily mussels)
        fouling. Successful installations to date have pretreatment operating
        independently of the seawater RO system. Pretreatment systems deliver water to
        a filtered or treated seawater tank or tanks. The RO high-pressure pump draws
        from the seawater tank. Pretreatment considerations may include turbidity
        reduction, Fe/Mn removal, anti-scale stabilization, microbial control, organics
        reduction and hardness reduction.
   I.   Brine as a resource. Brine is a filtered water source, not just a waste stream. Store
        on site and use it to backwash a pressure media filter or to inhibit marine growth
        in intake lines.
   J. Equipment operation and maintenance. Describe instrumentation and controls,
      including alarms, telemetry for remote operation, and provisions for protecting
      instrumentation and electrical components from corrosion.
   K. Product water corrosivity. The corrosive nature of RO permeate requires
      corrosion control treatment for all seawater RO installations. Blending with other
      sources as the sole means of corrosion control is not acceptable. Alkalinity and
      pH treatment ranges should be identified. Instruments employing EPA-approved
      methods for measuring pH and alkalinity must be used (WAC 246-290-300(1)(c)).
   L. Disinfection. Disinfection for providing at least a CT of 6 (WAC 246-290-
      451(4)(e)). Water may be very cold, which affects contact time requirements.
   M. Material compatibility. Piping and fittings material compatible with seawater and
      low ionic strength permeate water should be carefully evaluated.
   N. Operation and maintenance. The treatment plant design should give extra
      thought to equipment accessibility for maintenance. Some examples include:
          i.   Setting the high pressure pump at waist height with full access for
               maintenance and repairs (HP pumps typically require frequent maintenance)
         ii.   Providing open space to allow membrane removal from the pressure
               vessels.
        iii.   Locating sampling taps and water meters for easy access and reading.
        iv.    Labeling all treatment plant piping and equipment.
   O. Operator qualifications. A certified operator is required to operate this treatment
      facility. Operator certification requirements and the availability of qualified
      operators is a critical component for determining whether seawater RO is a viable
      and sustainable option.
   P. Noise. Sound proofing and noise abatement should be evaluated.

      membranes, must be ANSI/NSF Standard 61 certified (WAC 246-290-220).
   B. All chemicals used must be within their ANSI/NSF Standard 60 approved doses
      (WAC 246-290-220).
   C. Use noncorrosive materials (stainless steel, PVC, fiberglass) throughout the
      treatment plant.

Appendix F.7             Rainfall Catchment Submittal Requirements
Rooftop catchment involves collecting rainfall from an elevated roof surface. Rainwater
collected from ground catchment areas is stormwater. Depending on the specific roof
characteristics for collecting rainfall, rooftop water can be subject to animal and human
pathogens, material degradation from roof components, and windblown contaminants.

Additionally, most rooftop catchment-systems collect untreated rainwater and store it in
large cisterns. This cistern water may be stored for months before the water is used.
Water quality changes can occur during this protracted storage. For these reasons, we
treat rooftop catchment systems as surface water sources for purposes of treatment
design and treatment operations.

Water systems must obtain drinking water from the highest quality source feasible
(WAC 245-290-130). Water systems must provide an adequate quantity and quality of
drinking water in a reliable manner (WAC 246-290-420). Using collected rainwater from
a rooftop catchment system poses significant challenges to satisfying these basic
requirements. We know from experience that small water systems struggle with
demonstrating compliance in operating a small surface-water treatment plant. As
presented in Appendix F.8, we believe it is difficult to develop a reliable rooftop
catchment system in most areas of the state without incurring significant construction
and ongoing operation and maintenance costs.

Submittal Outline
The design submittal requirements for a new surface water source and potable water
treatment facility are substantial. Even very small rainfall rooftop catchment designs
must meet all of the requirements of Part 6 of WAC 246-290. Refer to additional
guidance in Appendix A.3.8 and Chapter 11.

II.   Checklist of Additional Items
      A. Rain is acidic and very low in dissolved solids and alkalinity. As a result, it can
         leach contaminants from materials it contacts. Therefore, all roofing materials in
         contact with rainfall must be certified under ANSI/NSF 61 or NSF P151 (WAC
         246-290-220). This requirement extends to all equipment and appurtenances
         on the roof substantially contacted by rainfall, including solar panels, satellite
         dishes, chimneys, and vents.
      B. Because of rainfall’s corrosive potential, evaluate the need for corrosion control
         treatment and the effect on the distribution system.
      C. Address all applicable new surface water source treatment considerations.
      D. Water rights Department of Ecology administers may be required depending on
         the location and size of the project.
      E. Provisions for ongoing raw water cistern inspection, water quality sampling, and
         cistern cleaning and maintenance must be incorporated into the design.
      F. Address service capacity (source capacity and storage) requirements if you
         intend to use the rooftop catchment source to meet part or all of the water
         system’s source firm-yield requirements without depending on trucked water.
         Refer to Appendix F.8.
      G. Review the Department of Ecology’s policy on rainwater collection. The policy is
         on Ecology’s Rainwater Collection webpage.

Appendix F.8             Rainfall Catchment Reliability Analysis – Example
Introduction
The main points of this reliability analysis are:
      The importance of assessing rainfall data collected over many years.
      The source of supply and/or reliability analysis must be based on drought
       conditions. Designing a roof top catchment system based on average rainfall data
       will result in an unreliable water supply.
      Reliability analysis should be based on the 50-year drought, using monthly (not
       annual) rainfall data.

Annual Rainfall
The generally accepted equation for rainfall yield from a roof surface is:

       0.8 (efficiency of rainfall capture) x 0.62 (gallons per inch of rainfall per square
               foot of roof) x SF (capture area of roof) x inches of rainfall per time period

For example, a building with a 1,500 SF roof capture area receiving an average annual
rainfall of 40 inches per year will yield a water supply volume of 0.8 x 0.62 x 1,500 x 40 =
29,760 gallons, sufficient to provide the equivalent of 81 gallons per day (average daily
supply). As described below, calculating an average supply from an average annual
rainfall does not result in a reliable potable water supply.

Many locations in Washington have extensive data on monthly and annual rainfall (see
Appendix C for weather and rainfall webpages). Rainfall information was reviewed from
three locations, each with 62 years of data (1949-2010):
      Olympia
      SeaTac
      Orcas Island

Rainfall information for areas east of the Cascade Range indicate less average rainfall
and longer, more severe drought potential compared with the three locations noted
above.

We calculated the mean (µ), standard deviation (σ), and -2σ of this data in an effort to
assess the feasibility of rainfall rooftop catchment (RRC) for community water systems.

Assuming annual rainfall data follows a normal distribution, 2.2 percent of annual values
are expected to be below -2σ. The probability of annual rainfall occurring below -2σ in
any given year is about 1 in 50.

Below is the annual rainfall distribution curve for SeaTac. Rainfall frequency was
measured in 5-inch increments.

The annual rainfall for the design year will define the threshold where we consider RRC a
viable sole-source of supply to a public water system. Section 5.9.1 and 5.11.1
recommends using a 98 percent level of reliability, equivalent to a 50-year drought, for
surface supplies (including RCC).

We can approximate the threshold of low annual rainfall predicted once every 50 years
(2 percent chance of occurring in any given year) by applying the -2σ value for rainfall at
a given location.

Applying the -2σ rainfall value assumes a ~ 98 percent reliability standard. This standard
implies a 1-in-50 chance that in any given year the rainfall will be less than the -2σ
rainfall value, and a 1-in-5 chance that the rainfall will be less than the -2σ rainfall value
during any consecutive 10-year period.

For reference, Forks, Washington has a -2σ rainfall value of 82 inches per year (based on
the same 62-year data period: 1949-2010), providing an average daily supply of 165 gpd
per dwelling.

Lacking existing system information, Appendix D implies an appropriate design value for
indoor use as 200 gallons per dwelling per day.

Monthly Rainfall
Annual rainfall dictates the feasibility of captured rainfall as a public drinking water
supply. The distribution of the annual rainfall dictates the reservoir (cistern) size needed
to ensure a continuous supply of water during periods of little or no rainfall. We
reviewed data from the three locations to determine the number of years in which the
aggregate rainfall measured in any consecutive three-month period totaled less than 1.0
inches. Table 3 tabulates the results:

1   Average daily supply available from rainfall during this 3-month period, based on a 1,500 sf roof and 91 days


There are also longer periods of relatively dry weather. In 1987 there was a five-month
period (June to October) with total rainfall of 2.06 to 2.09 inches at these three locations.
This level of rainfall equates to an average daily supply of 10 gpd per dwelling during
the five-month period.

Based on the history of monthly rainfall, the cistern size needed to overcome the uneven
distribution of rainfall during the year at these three locations would have to be on the
order of five months’ supply, equal to about 30,000 gallons per dwelling unit assuming
200 gallons per day average daily demand. Storing captured rainfall for many months
will result in significant degradation of water quality.

Providing for fire flow, disinfection contact time, a factor of safety (to account for
climate change), and accounting for hydraulic inefficiency of the treatment process will
only serve to increase the total storage needed (untreated and treated).

Conclusion
The annual and monthly variability of rainfall makes harvested rainfall difficult to justify
as a sole-source drinking water supply for community water systems in all but the
wettest parts of Washington.

Appendix F.9          Iron and Manganese Treatment by Oxidation
                      Filtration

Submittal Outline
This outline will guide and summarize your iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) treatment
facility design for small water systems using groundwater sources. Refer to Appendix F.5
if your Fe/Mn treatment process will use ozone as a prefilter oxidant.

In various surveys of iron and manganese treatment facilities in the U.S., only 50 to 60
percent of the facilities produced water that met drinking water standards for iron (Fe)
and manganese (Mn). The following factors are important for the successful, reliable
operation of a Fe/Mn removal treatment facility using oxidation filtration.
       Correct oxidant dosage.
       The oxidation pH is sufficiently high and oxidation time is sufficiently long to
        ensure conversion of soluble Fe/Mn to the oxidized state.
       Properly sized filter media.
       Complete and accurate raw water data at time of design, including an
        understanding of iron complexation with humic substances or silica.
       Appropriate filtration rate.
       Adequate backwashing frequency, rate, and control. Proper monitoring and
        control of the backwash recycle return (if applicable).

An engineer licensed in Washington state must prepare submittals for treatment
facilities. All supporting documentation must be included with the design submittal
(WAC 246-290-110).

 F.9.3        Raw Water Quality
 The raw water quality of most groundwater supplies can vary seasonally and over time.
 For this reason, a minimum of two separate measurements should be collected for the
 parameters listed below, ideally capturing seasonal changes in raw water quality. In
 aquifers where the water quality is known to vary significantly, such as some island
 aquifers, we recommend additional raw water quality sampling. To get accurate data, a
 qualified person with properly calibrated instruments must measure temperature,
 ferrous iron, and pH at the well site (not in a lab). A laboratory certified for drinking
 water must analyze all other water quality parameters (WAC 246-290-300(1)(c)). Submit
 all lab data sheets to DOH.

F.9.4          Pilot Testing
Pilot testing is usually necessary to determine whether a treatment process is functional
and economically viable. It also helps engineers to develop the appropriate design
parameters for the treatment process:
   A. Oxidant type, dose and contact time.
   B. Optimal pH and adjustment (if necessary).
   C. Filter media type, depth, and loading rate.
   D. Backwash frequency, duration, and hydraulic rate.
   E. Filter-to-waste duration and rate.
   F. Backwash recycle return (flow rate, volume per filter backwash cycle, quality) if
      applicable.
   G. Other process control parameters (if used) for parameters such as pH adjustment.

   We recognize that many small systems installing Fe/Mn treatment may choose to
   skip the pilot test step and go straight to a full-scale design (see Section 10.3.5).
   Design engineers and water system owners who choose to skip the pilot study step
   do so at their own risk. Design engineers should discuss with the regional engineer
   their justification for skipping the pilot test step before proceeding to full scale
   design.

   Adequate piloting provides greater assurance of treatment performance. At a basic
   level, the project report that summarizes the pilot test should describe:
   A. Pilot plant setup, duration (see Table 10-2) and results as they relate to full-scale
      treatment design.
   B. Pilot plant design parameters:
          i.    Treatment rate of the pilot plant (gpm/sq.ft.).
         ii.    Oxidant and dosage (mg/L), if applicable.
        iii.    Length of oxidation and coagulant contact times. Contact time is detention
                time from point of oxidation or coagulation addition to filter.
        iv.     Backwash parameters (filter run length/volume (hours or gals), backwash
                rate (gpm), duration (min)), and recycle return, if applicable.
         v.     pH adjustment, if necessary.

Appendix F.10 Iron and Manganese Treatment by Sequestration
Sequestration by applying a polyphosphate enables soluble iron and manganese to
remain in solution, even in the presence of an oxidant like chlorine. This process also is
called stabilization, chelation, or dispersion. Water systems use it to preserve water’s
physical aesthetic by preventing the formation of particulate iron and manganese and
its attendant turbidity. Sequestration does not remove iron or manganese, and will not
re-suspend particulate iron or manganese back into their soluble form.

F.10.1      Design Limitations
Design engineers should recognize several limitations to sequestration.
        You should not use sequestration when the combined iron-manganese level
         exceeds 0.5 milligram per liter (mg/L). We will not approve sequestration if the
         combined iron-manganese level exceeds 1.0 mg/L, with the manganese at no
         more than 0.1 mg/l as Mn.
        Add sequestering agents, such as the polyphosphates (hexametaphosphate and
         trisodium phosphate), prior to any oxidation influence.
        Concentrations of polyphosphate cannot exceed 10 mg/L as PO 4 in the
         distribution system.
        The polyphosphate must be listed under ANSI/NSF Standard 60 and the dose
         must fall below the NSF-approved dose (WAC 246-290-220).
        Because polyphosphate is a bacterial nutrient and can lead to bacterial growth in
         distribution lines, industry standards dictate post-sequestration chlorine
         disinfection shall be provided and a detectable chlorine residual shall be
         maintained throughout the distribution system (Ten State Standards, 2012).
        Adding polyphosphate to the drinking water supply will increase the phosphate
         concentration in wastewater effluent. Design engineers should consult with the
         local wastewater treatment authority on the advisability of adding polyphosphate
         to the drinking water supply.
        Polyphosphates can increase lead solubility (Holm and Schock, 1991). For this
         reason, if polyphosphates are added to a water supply, additional tap sample
         monitoring under the Lead and Copper Rule will likely be required.
        To prevent oxidation of the iron or manganese before they stabilize, the system
         should add polyphosphate into the well near the suction side of the pump to
         minimize oxidation by aeration.
        The application point for the disinfectant should be more than 10 feet
         downstream of the pump discharge. The manufacturer's recommendations may
         require a greater distance.


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                      466
        Sequestering agents are effective in cold water, but lose their capability in heated
         or boiled water. You should recognize that this form of treatment may not
         resolve customer concerns for hot water portions of domestic service.
        DOH will require installation of Fe/Mn removal treatment if we determine that
         sequestration is ineffective at mitigating aesthetic water quality issues.


F.10.2       Pilot Testing for Sequestering – Laboratory Bench Scale Tests
When considering sequestration for iron-manganese control, we recommend the
following bench scale test* to determine the required dose of sequestering agent:
    1. Treat a series of 1-liter samples with a standard chlorine solution to determine
       the chlorine dose required to produce the desired free chlorine residual. The
       minimum target free chlorine value should be 0.2 mg/L.
    2. Prepare a standard sequestering agent solution by dissolving 1.0 gram of agent
       in a liter of distilled water in a volumetric flask.
    3. Treat a separate series of five 1-liter samples with varying amounts of the
       sequestering agent. One milliliter (ml) of the standard sequestering agent
       solution (prepared as per step 2 above) is equivalent to a 0.1 percent solution.
       One ml of this stock solution in one liter of sample is equivalent to 8.34 pounds
       of sequestering agent per million gallons, equal to one part per million (ppm).
       Add 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 ml dosages to the 1-liter samples and stir until the
       sequestering agent dose is well-mixed. Continue to stir while adding the
       previously determined chlorine dosage to avoid localized high chlorine
       concentrations.
    4. Observe the series of treated samples against a white background to note the
       degree of discoloration. The proper dose of sequestering agent is the lowest
       dose that delays noticeable discoloration for a 4-day period. This dose cannot
       exceed 10 mg/L as PO4 or the NSF-approved maximum dose for the
       polyphosphate sequestering agent (Ten State Standards, 2012).

* Use freshly collected samples for the bench test. Keep them away from direct sunlight to avoid heating, and
maintained them at room temperature for the duration of the test.

                                  Sequestration is not recommended when the concentration

                                  exceeds 0.5 mg/L.

                                  Sequestration is not recommended when the concentration
 Manganese (Mn+2) (mg/L)
                                  exceeds 0.1 mg/L.

                                  Hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) can bind with the
 Hardness (mg/L as CaCO 3)
                                  sequestering agent.

                                  Higher alkalinity waters require more chemical addition to adjust
 Alkalinity (mg/L as CaCO 3)
                                  the pH if needed.

                                  Sequestering is not effective for hot water and the sequestering
                                  agent breaks down more rapidly in warm water, though
 Temperature (ºC)
                                  temperature is usually not an issue for most groundwater
                                  supplies.

                                  Sequestering is more effective at a lower pH (less than 7.5) since
 pH
                                  iron and manganese are more readily oxidized at a higher pH.




F.10.3      Public Notification
The sequestration design submittal should include a public notification for distribution
to consumers. The notification should inform consumers that they may still experience
discoloration and particulate problems with the hot water portion of their home
plumbing. In addition, advise customers located in more remote portions of the water
distribution system that discoloration and particulate matter may still pose aesthetic
problems if water in their portion of the distribution system is not routinely flushed.

F.10.4      Distribution System Related Problems
Occasionally, complaints about aesthetic concerns are not directly related to levels of
iron or manganese in source water. Existing water systems should examine the nature of
any consumer complaints to determine whether the problem is water source or
distribution system related.

Corrosion within the distribution system may contribute to aesthetic problems at
consumers’ taps, including odor, particulate matter, or red, orange, or brown-colored
water. Before initiating a sequestration design, the design engineer should find out
whether the observed aesthetic problems result from distribution system corrosion. If
you determine that distribution system corrosion is the problem, you should target

Appendix F.11             Nitrate Removal by Ion Exchange

Submittal Outline
This outline will guide and summarize the design of nitrate (NO3) treatment facilities for
small water systems using groundwater sources. Refer to Section 10.2.5 and DOH 331-
309 for additional guidance.

In Washington, ion exchange is the most common treatment process used to remove
nitrate from drinking water. The following factors are important in the successful,
reliable operation of a nitrate removal treatment facility using ion exchange.
        Complete and accurate raw water data at time of design, including an
         understanding of seasonal changes in raw water quality.
        Clearly defined O&M practices and clearly defined role of the operator to fulfill
         O&M responsibilities.

An engineer licensed in Washington must prepare all submittals for treatment facilities.
All supporting documentation must be included with the design submittal (WAC 246-
290-110).

F.11.1          General Water System Information
Provide the following general information:
   A. Water system name and public water system identification number.
   B. Owner's name, address, and telephone number.
   C. Manager's name, address, and telephone number.
   D. Operator’s name, certification level, and telephone number.
   E. Completed (preliminary) Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet (include all existing
      and proposed treatment processes).
   F. Completed Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149).

F.11.2      Description of the Water Quality Problem
Describe the source of supply and the purpose and goals of the treatment proposed.
Include source number and design flow rate(s).

F.11.3      Raw Water Quality
The raw water quality is critical when determining whether ion exchange is an
appropriate treatment process, sizing equipment, and selecting resin. It will determine
brine regeneration frequency, waste volume generated, and the need for post-ion
exchange pH adjustment or corrosion control. You should pilot test nitrate ion exchange

 treatment facilities at the site, capturing raw water seasonal variability. You should
 perform some other raw-water quality tests on site, too.

 The raw water quality of most groundwater supplies vary seasonally and over time. For
 this reason, you should collect at least two separate samples for the parameters listed
 below, capturing seasonal changes in water quality. In aquifers where the water quality
 is known to vary significantly, such as some island aquifers, we recommend additional
 raw water quality sampling. To get accurate data, a qualified person must measure
 temperature, ferrous iron, and pH at the well site (not in a lab). A laboratory certified for
 drinking water must analyze all other water quality parameters (WAC 246-290-
 300(1)(c)). Submit all lab data sheets to DOH.

F.11.4          Pilot Testing
Pilot testing is necessary to determine whether a treatment process will be functional
and economically viable. It helps engineers develop the appropriate full-scale plant
design parameters, including:
   A. Need for pretreatment, such as softening or prefiltration.
   B. Need for posttreatment pH adjustment.
   C. Resin type.
   D. Resin bed volume.
   E. Flow rate.
   F. Empty bed contact time.
   G. Process control to start regeneration cycle.
         If the design engineer does not conduct a pilot test, they should submit at least
         two complete sets of raw water sample results reflecting seasonal variability to
         the ion exchange equipment manufacturer. Ask the equipment manufacturer for
         a written assessment of removal efficiency, treatment capacity (volume), and salt
         use between regeneration cycles.
   H. Describe the pilot plant setup, duration (see Table 10-2), and results as they relate
      to full-scale treatment design.
   I.    For each resin type tested, describe pilot plant test results including:
           i.    Bed volume.
          ii.    Surface loading rate through the reactor.
         iii.    Raw and treated water nitrate concentration, pH, and sodium concentration.
         iv.     Bed volumes treated before regeneration.
          v.     Predicted waste volume (sum of backwash and rinse, including softener if
                 applicable) expressed as a percent of water treated during the previous
                 exchange cycle.

Appendix G:            Guidance for Leachable Contaminants
                       Testing

Engineers can now use the “leachable contaminants test” (a.k.a. “soak test”) to better
identify and address contamination from leachable components when they bring new
facilities on-line. Engineers use this test predominately when there is some question
about the “quality of workmanship” associated with facility installation, or with materials
that would be in substantial contact with drinking water.

If the initial use of a facility presents, or could present, a water quality concern (for
example, storage reservoirs primarily, but could include other facilities), DOH can require
the water system to test the water before initiating service to consumers (see Section
7.6.2).

Authority for such monitoring comes from WAC 246-290-300 (1)(a)(i) if contamination
is, or could be, suspected in the water system. For example, suspicion over contractor
workmanship, illicit materials used, vandalism, or any number of reasons that would
suggest the need to ensure appropriate water quality before using a facility in contact
with the water to be provided.

For the various structures that may be of concern (usually new or recoated storage
facilities, and some treatment facilities), testing of the water quality should be
performed under defined protocols before putting those structures into service. We
outline the concerns that could be associated with various projects and the
recommended procedures for conducting leachable components tests below.

Concern Associated with Paints and Coatings
There may be concerns about organic chemical contamination resulting from improper
selection or application of paint coatings used for water storage facilities. Experience
shows that leaching of the coating materials sometimes elevates the level of organic
contaminants found in drinking water. This may lead to taste and odor problems or,
possibly, health concerns.

Because it is difficult to correct coating problems after you discover them, you should
take considerable care in selecting and applying coating materials. If testing detects
contamination above a maximum contaminant level (MCL), you must not place the
storage facility into service until you reduce contamination to levels below the MCL
(WAC 246-290-320).


Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  476
Here are some precautions:
   1. Use only coating products that meet ANSI/NSF Standard 61 for potable water
      surfaces (see WAC 246-290-220).
   2. Only experienced and competent applicators should apply the coatings. They
      should closely follow the coating manufacturer's recommendations, particularly
      for ventilation and curing. For forced-air curing, the air should draw from the
      lowest part of the tank because many volatile organic vapors are heavier than air.
      If there is any doubt about the adequacy of the curing conditions, we suggest
      additional curing time with continued forced air ventilation. Experience shows
      that the manufacturer’s suggested curing time is adequate only under the
      optimal conditions the manufacturer specifies. Longer curing periods are needed
      if temperature and humidity parameters are not optimal. After the curing period,
      you must clean and disinfect the tank before filling (WAC 246-290-451).


Concern Associated with Concrete Construction
Some petroleum-based form-release agents used to construct concrete water storage
facilities can be a source of organic contamination. Concerns about contamination may
result from the improper selection and use of fuel oil or lubricating oil as form-release
agents. Special precautions are needed to minimize the hazards associated with use of
these materials.

If these products were used, or if you suspect or find contamination, the storage facility
must not be placed into service until the contamination is reduced to acceptable levels
(see WAC 246-290-300).

Because it is difficult to remove all traces of petroleum contaminant from concrete, you
should exercise considerable care in selecting, thinning, and using form-release
materials. Some important precautions:
   1. Clean forms prior to use.
   2. Use only form-release agents that meet ANSI/NSF Standard 60, OR, in some
      instances, food-grade vegetable oils, for potable water contact surfaces (see WAC
      246-290-220).
   3. Use only ANSI/NSF Standard 60 approved materials or food-grade vegetable oils
      to thin form-release agents.

Following the curing period, you must wash and disinfect the tank before filling (WAC
246-290-451).

Concern Associated with Treatment Unit Media or Membranes (Alternate
Technologies)
We may approve natural filter sand, gravel, anthracite, ilmenite and garnet if they were
tested for leachable contaminants before they were placed into service.

This applies particularly to native mineral products, which are subjected only to
mechanical processing, such as crushing, screening, and washing.

Vehicles used to transport filter media could be a significant source of contamination.
Because it is difficult to remove all traces of contamination from media after you
discover it, you should exercise considerable care while processing and transporting
filter media. Some important precautions:
   1. Clean potential contaminating substances from vehicles before using them to
      transport media.
   2. Following media placement, wash, disinfect (slow sand filters excepted), rinse and
      test treatment units for coliform bacteria density before placing them into
      service.

Leachable Contaminant Testing Procedure
Whenever the water contact surfaces of a storage facility have been coated, or whenever
"Leachable Contaminant Testing" is considered appropriate for any type of project, we
will direct water systems to take the following steps before putting the facility into
service:

Following a period of immersion or contact time, water in the tank, vessel, basin, or
treatment unit (hereafter termed, “contact facility”) must be sampled to determine the
level of any leached chemicals. Although negotiable, the recommended contact period
with the water is seven days for storage tank surface and 24 hours for filter media. The
minimum immersion contact period should be at least equal, but preferably exceed the
maximum anticipated operating detention times under normal operations. The operator
should try to maximize the ratio of the wetted surface contact area to the volume of
water in the tank. This suggests that the tank does not need to be filled completely to
the overflow level because the area-to-volume ratio continually diminishes as a circular,
rectangular, or square tank is filled. However, we recommend using at least 10 to 20
percent of the tank volume for testing. There should be enough water in the contact
facility to account for all contact surfaces where “quality of installation or materials
handling” is a concern. A Department of Ecology-certified laboratory must analyze
samples of the water collected after the appropriate contact period. The analyses should

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                    478
include contaminants that the material being evaluated could reasonably be assumed to
contribute to potable water. Test methods may include, but are not limited to:
      Complete inorganic chemical (IOC) analysis.
      Volatile organic chemical (VOC) analysis.
      General synthetic organic chemical (SOC) analysis*, including phthalates and
       polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
      Phthalates.

   *The SOC test is primarily for pesticides. You need only consider this test if there are concerns over possible
   pesticide contamination. For example, it could be a concern if the material was transported or stored in a way
   that would expose it to SOCs.


The minimum analytes required for some particular situations are:
   a. For storage facilities having organic coatings, such as paints and sealants, the
      sample should be analyzed for VOCs. If the product contains phthalates, that
      parameter should also be analyzed.
   b. For concrete construction, the sample should be analyzed for VOCs and
      polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.
   c. For polyethylene, PVC, hypalon, or other flexible-material type storage facilities
      where fabrication involves solvents and glues, the sample should be analyzed for
      VOCs and phthalates.
   d. For filter media, including occlusion-type alternate technology filters, the sample
      should be analyzed for VOCs and regulated IOCs.

When reporting the test results to us, identify the sample purpose on the Water
Sampling Information sheet as “Investigative.” This will ensure that we don’t treat the test
results—particularly those with detections—as compliance samples under the source
monitoring requirements. You should submit a copy of the test results directly to the
DOH regional engineer reviewing the project.

Before delivering water from a storage facility to consumers, the water system must
evaluate test results for compliance with the current maximum contaminant levels
(MCLs). DOH will not allow any storage facility or treatment component to be placed
into service, or remain in service, if using it would, or could be expected to, deliver
public drinking water that contains any contaminant(s) exceeding any current MCL.

If testing reveals contaminants above DOH’s monitoring trigger levels, but below MCLs,
the water system should collect additional samples at least quarterly. Such monitoring

DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                                           479
will remain in place until we determine test results are reliably and consistently below
the MCL.

The source susceptibility rating will not change as long as testing shows the source of
contamination is independent of the source water quality.

We may advise retesting, testing for additional analytes, or both when the lab detects
contamination exceeding the method detection limit.

Appendix H:            Slow Sand Filtration

Submittal Outline
This outline supplements the design guidance for slow sand filtration provided in
Chapter 10 and 11, and in Appendix A.3.8.

Provide the following general information:
   A. Water system name and public water system identification number
   B. Owner's name, address, and telephone number
   C. Manager's name, address, and telephone number
   D. Operator’s name, certification level, and telephone number
   E. Completed (preliminary) Purification Plant Criteria Worksheet (include all existing
      and proposed treatment processes)
   F. Completed Project Approval Application Form (DOH 331-149)

 I. Pilot Plant Testing
Inadequate pilot testing has resulted in treatment process failures, delayed
implementation of effective treatment, and required costly replacement of inadequate
treatment. For those reasons, we require engineers to pilot test plants, and to submit a
pilot testing plan to us. At a basic level, the project report that summarizes the pilot
testing should describe:
   A. Pilot plant setup, duration and results as they relate to full-scale treatment
      design.
   B. Pilot plant design parameters:
        i.   Pretreatment (if any).
       ii.   Effects of seasonal water quality changes.
      iii.   Treatment rate of the pilot plant (gpm/sq.ft.).
      iv.    Sand specification and depth.
       v.    Support gravel specification and depth.
      vi.    Terminal head loss.

II. Design Guidance
Based on pilot testing results, the design must consider the following (WAC 246-290-
110):
   A. Suitability of slow sand filtration for the available raw water supply.
   B. Potential for, and evaluation of, pretreatment needs.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 481
    C. Effect of seasonal water quality changes.
    D. Suitability of specific filter sand and support gravels intended to be used.
    E. Performance demonstrated at proposed hydraulic loading rate.
    F. Length of time needed to commission (ripen) a new filter.
    G. Rate of head loss development and length of time between filter scrapings.
    H. Ripening time and proposed ripening indicators (turbidity, coliform counts, time,
       etc.).

III. Other Design Guidance
 Address the following in the project report and construction documents:
    A. Filter effluent rates (hydraulic loading rates (HLR)) must not exceed 0.10 gpm/ft2
       (0.24 m/hr) (WAC 246-290-654).
       a. For cold temperatures (water temperatures less than 5°C), we recommend a
          flow rate no higher than 0.05 gpm/ft2.
       b. Warmer temperatures may need higher filtration rates (up to 0.10 gpm/ft2
          maximum) to maintain adequate dissolved oxygen (D.O. >6 mg/l) within the
          schmutzdecke. Under low D.O. conditions, metals can be mobilized.
       c. Effect of cold-water temperatures on performance and need for covering or
          other mitigation for freezing weather.
    B. Filtration area and number of filters needed to meet system demand, including
       during cleaning or ripening.
       Provide at least two filter beds, with each filter capable of meeting peak day
       demands. If you use more than two filters, the system should be able to meet
       maximum day demands with the largest filter out of service.
    C. Optimal flow control strategy.
       Ensure design provides for continuous operation without significant filter effluent
       flow-rate variation. Any filter effluent flow variations assumed in the design
       should be gradual to limit detachment of particles from the sand, with less than
       50 percent flow change in any 24-hour period.
    D. Filter-to-waste and filter backfilling capabilities.
       Provide filter-to-waste, or return the filter effluent to the headwater when system
       demands are low. Intermittent or ON/OFF operation should not be used as a
       means of rate control.
    E. Cleaning frequency and most appropriate method(s). If scraping is the intended
       filter cleaning method:



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                  482
       a. Sand quantity removed annually through scraping or cleanings, and duration
          between re-sanding.
       b. Address removal, handling, cleaning and stockpiling arrangements for
          scraped sand.
       c. Consider allowing scraped sand to be washed and stored on-site, so you can
          reuse it. Storage area should be covered, and protected from contamination.
   F. Assessment of appropriate automation and supervisory control and data
      acquisition (SCADA) systems.
   G. Operator time needed for normal operations, monitoring, reporting and
      maintenance tasks

IV. Checklist of Additional Items
   A. Influent water should be introduced to the supernatant water with enough
      clearance above the sand (at least 12 inches) to prevent turbulence scouring.
      Energy dissipating structures may also be used to prevent sand scour.
   B. To prevent air binding within the filter, the system needs to maintain the filtered
      water elevation at or above the sand bed level. An effluent weir is a simple and
      effective way to maintain adequate water depth.
   C. Considerations for improved safety and ease of operations:
       a. Avoid confined space entry.
       b. Provide adequate headspace.
       c. Eliminate trip hazards.
       d. Prevent situations that might make maintenance activities more difficult.

 V. Operations and Maintenance
During the design phase, engineers should draft operations and maintenance manuals,
procedures for monitoring and collecting data, and procedures for recording and
reporting data. They will facilitate an understanding of how staff will operate the plant
and monitor filter performance. You should consult operations staff early in the design
phase and encourage them to visit other slow sand plants.

Designers and operations staff should conduct tabletop exercises for start-up, normal
operations, and cleaning procedures. They will identify design-related operational
problems so the engineer can correct them prior to construction.

Develop an O&M manual and submit it to DOH:
   A. Identify maintenance personnel and operators.

                                    designing new facilities. Colloidal clays may penetrate deeper into the filter bed causing higher
                                    effluent turbidity and may cause long-term filter clogging. Roughing filters can provide up to 50-
                                    90% of turbidity removal (Wegelin et al., 1996).

True Color       < 5 platinum       The source of color should be determined. Color from iron or manganese may be more effectively
                 color units        removed than color from organics. True color removals of 25% or less were reported by Cleasby et
                                    al. (1984). The point of consumer complaints about water aesthetics is variable over a range from 5
                                    to 30 color units, though most people find color objectionable over 15 color units (USEPA, 1999).
                                    The Secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels (SMCL) for color is 15 color units, which is also
                                    identified as a maximum level for slow sand filtration under the Recommended Standards for Water
                                    Works, 2012 Edition. Preozonation or granular activated carbon may be used to reduce color.

Coliform         < 800/100 ml
                                    Coliform removals through slow sand filters range from 1 to 3-log (90–99.9%) (Collins, M.R. 1998).

                                    al, 1984). Determining DBP formation potential may provide more information by simulating DBP
                                    formation in the distribution system due to disinfectants added in the presence of organics.

Manganese                           enhance organics removal, but too much iron and manganese precipitate can clog the filters. The

                                    is 0.05 mg/l. Iron and manganese removal in a slow sand filter can be > 67% (Collins, M.R. 1998).

Algae            < 200,000          By providing greater surface area for particle removal, certain types of filamentous algae may
                 cells/L            enhance biological activity and be beneficial for filtration, but in general, the presence of algae

                                    recommended to determine algae species and concentration.

Support Gravel
Support gravel should conform to published design guidelines (see endnote references, below).
An example of a 5-layer support gravel system is provided for filter sand with an effective size of
0.2 mm to 0.35 mm using design guidelines from Appendix D of ANSI/AWWA Standard B100-16
and commercially available gravel sizes according to standard sieve sizes under ASTM E11-13.
The gravel support using 5 layers as shown below will work if the orifices in the under drain pipe
are less than or equal to ¼” in diameter. 4 layers are adequate with 1/8” (3.175 mm) diameter
drain orifices and a bottom gravel layer of ½” x ¼” (12.7 x 6.35 mm).

Support media should be washed thoroughly to remove deleterious materials like clay fines and organics
prior to placement. Keep media clean and only store on a clean, hard, dry, covered surface until
placement. Refer to ANSI/AWWA Standard B100-16 or latest revision for additional storage and handling
information.

2No more than 8% by dry weight of particles should be greater than the passing screen size an d no more than 8% by dry weight of particles

should be smaller than the retaining screen size.
3The thickness of each layer of support gravel should be at least 3 times the diameter of the largest particles. For practical reasons, the

thickness of each layer should be 2-3 inches for coarse sand and gravel up to ½” (12.7 mm) in size. Keep gravel clean and only store on a
clean, hard, dry, covered surface until placement. Gravel should be washed thoroughly to remove deleterious materials like clay fines and
organics prior to placement. Layers should be placed to a uniform thickness, leveled, and washed in succession according to ANSI/AWWA
Standard B100.

Appendix I:              Ultraviolet Disinfection

Executive Summary
This appendix identifies specific technical and regulatory issues associated with the
approval and use of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection treatment for drinking water systems. It
identifies the following conclusions and requirements:
      DOH will require that each typical reactor design undergo third party dosimetry-
       based validation testing before approving it for use in Washington state.
      186 mJ/cm2 is the minimum required applied dose for UV disinfection systems
       designed to provide 4-log inactivation of viruses.
      40 mJ/cm2 is the minimum required reduction equivalent dose where UV
       disinfection is used for compliance with the Surface Water Treatment Rule.
       This assumes virus inactivation is accomplished in conjunction with another
       disinfectant.
      Where UV is used to comply with the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water
       Treatment Rule (LT2ESWTR), the validated dose will be as specified by the rule
       and the dosimetry-based validation testing for a proposed UV reactor.
      The quality of the raw water can greatly affect inactivation of target
       microorganisms with UV, and must meet specific criteria.
      Acceptable operations and maintenance procedures should be established
       during the design stage of UV disinfection system approval. UV reactors are
       complex systems and are not suitable for water systems without appropriately
       certified operators.
      UV reactors are validated using certain component parts. Changes in UV reactor
       components may decrease the effectiveness of the reactor to inactivate
       pathogens. As a result, disinfection credit awarded to a UV reactor is limited to
       the parts used in the original validation. Any modification to the UV reactor, such
       as replacing lamps, sleeves, ballasts, sensors, UV transmittance monitors, or
       controls, with parts other than those originally specified, may result in loss of UV
       disinfection credit.

Background and Purpose
There has been increasing interest in the potential use of UV light for disinfection
purposes. There are several reasons for the interest, including a desire to avoid or
eliminate using chlorine as a disinfectant, concern over formation of disinfection
byproducts associated with chlorine, and a perceived simplicity of UV system operation.
Of even greater interest is that UV light is extremely effective against the protozoan
pathogens Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium.

The purposes of this document are to outline the technical issues involved with using
UV light and to identify those considerations DOH will evaluate when reviewing specific
UV disinfection system proposals.

Identifying Technical Issues
This document identifies several technical issues that are important to the use of UV
light as an appropriate disinfection technique. It identifies multiple scenarios where
water systems may apply UV. These are:
      Groundwater sources that DOH has determined do not require disinfection (WAC
       246-290-250(4)).
      Groundwater sources that do require disinfection (WAC 246-290-451).
      Surface water sources that install UV disinfection to comply with the LT2ESWTR.
      Surface water sources that meet the limited alternative to filtration criteria.
      Other surface water sources where UV is used for compliance with the Surface
       Water Treatment Rule.

Different technical approaches and design criteria are used in addressing these
scenarios. The technical issues are presented in five categories: reactor validation, public
health criteria, water quality, design, and operations. We discuss these categories below.
Much of the information presented in these documents is also in the Ultraviolet
Disinfection Guidance Manual for the Final Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water
Treatment Rule (UVDGM) (USEPA 2006).

Reactor Validation
UV disinfection is a technically complex process and there are few water systems in the
United States that have installed UV disinfection for pathogen inactivation credit. The
two predominant factors that affect the performance of a UV disinfection system are the
irradiance distribution in the reactor, and the hydraulic flow characteristics of the
reactor. In combination, these provide a fluence, or dose distribution that is unique to
the water quality treated, and the specific operating conditions (for example, flow rate,
lamp age, cleanliness of quartz sleeves).

In contrast to chlorine disinfection, where the disinfectant concentration is relatively
consistent and easily measured, the approximate UV analogue, irradiance, varies
significantly throughout the reactor, and can only be measured in those specific
locations where a calibrated sensor is fixed. In chlorine disinfection systems, reactor
hydraulic residence times are relatively long, and can be characterized through field-
testing with physical measurements (for example, tracer studies).



Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                     494
The hydraulic residence time through UV reactors is on the order of a few seconds, and
cannot be readily field-determined. These complications render it impractical for a
design engineer or water system operator to determine the true fluence distribution for
any given UV reactor under normal operating conditions. At best, some manufacturers
may use sophisticated computational models to estimate the fluence distribution in
their reactors. Design engineers and operating water systems must be sure that UV
systems have been validated as effective under known operating and water quality
conditions, and actual installations must be operated within specified parameters
consistent with the validation. Therefore, DOH will require each reactor design to
undergo dosimeter-based validation testing before approving it for use in Washington
state.

UV reactors must be validated to establish the range of operating conditions that
qualify for pathogen inactivation credit. Detailed, defined testing protocols have been
developed in Germany (DVGW 2006) and Austria (ÖNORM 2001; ÖNORM 2003).
Reactors certified at an approved DVGW [Deutsche Vereinigung des Gas und
Wasserfaches (German Organization of Gas and Waterworks)] testing facility using the
DVGW W294 protocol or ÖNORM [Österreichisches Normungsinstitut (Austrian
Standards Institute)] facility using the ÖNORM M5873-1 or ÖNORM M5873-2 protocol
will be considered as providing a reduction equivalent dose of 40 mJ/cm 2 within the
validated conditions. For other validation efforts, Chapter 5 of the final UV Disinfection
Guidance Manual (UVDGM - USEPA 2006) will be used to review proposed validation
protocols. A full-scale reactor is necessary for all validation testing.

There are two different UV dose-monitoring strategies commonly used to control UV
reactors and confirm that the reactor is providing the required dose within the validated
range of operations. The sensor set point approach is one UV dose monitoring strategy.
The other strategy is called the calculated dose approach. The DVGW W 294 and
ÖNORM M5873 protocols use the sensor set point approach. Guidelines for the
calculated dose approach are outlined in the UVDGM (USEPA 2006). The dose-
monitoring strategy affects how a reactor validation is conducted as well as how the
reactor is monitored after it is installed.

The UV equipment manufacturer is responsible for submitting complete validation
information to DOH for review and approval. This responsibility includes submitting the
details of the testing protocol to DOH before staring the testing. This validation will
require verification of the conditions under which at least the minimum validated dose is
provided. A third party acceptable to DOH must conduct the validation, not the
manufacturer or water system.

Public Health Criteria
Disinfection requirements for ground and surface water systems are addressed in
chapter 246-290 WAC. These are discussed in turn below.

Groundwater Sources Requiring Disinfection
WAC 246-290-250 (4) requires groundwater sources to be continuously disinfected
unless acceptable source water quality (for example, historical absence of coliform
organisms) and an acceptable sanitary control area are provided. This general
requirement is consistent with the more specific requirements in WAC 246-290-451,
which lists conditions under which disinfection of a groundwater supply is required; and
in WAC 246-290-453, which requires 4-log inactivation of viruses in groundwater
supplies under certain specified conditions, including the detection of E. coli in a
triggered source sample.

When a groundwater source is contaminated, or threatened with contamination, the
source is subject to a multiplicative combination of chlorine residual (C) and contact
time (T) that results in a product (termed CT) of at least 6 mg/L-min. The Surface Water
Treatment Rule Guidance Manual (USEPA 1990) identifies this with free chlorine used as
the required level to provide 4-log inactivation of viruses in water at 10 o C, pH 6-9. If
temperature and/or pH are outside the values necessary to provide 4-log virus
inactivation at CT6, DOH may require a higher CT value. The values in EPA’s guidance
manual are based on hepatitis A virus inactivation data and an applied safety factor of 3.
The Ground Water Rule source disinfection treatment requirements in WAC 246-290-
453 requires 4-log inactivation of viruses in groundwater supplies under certain
specified conditions, including the detection of E. coli in a triggered source sample. WAC
246-290-453 also imposes a higher standard for monitoring, reporting, and public
notification in the event of a treatment technique violation.

In January 2006, EPA finalized LT2ESWTR. While the focus of the LT2ESWTR is on surface
water sources, the rule also established UV dose requirements for viruses. In November
2006, EPA finalized the Ground Water Rule. Treatment equipment installed to comply
with this rule must provide 4-log inactivation or removal of viruses (WAC 246-290-
453(1)). For UV disinfection, that means the minimum required validated dose is 186
mJ/cm2. The reduction equivalent dose for a given UV reactor will likely be greater
because of the uncertainties inherent in the validation of UV reactors.

Groundwater Sources Not Required to Disinfect
We recommend that installations provide a UV dose of at least 186 mJ/cm 2 and that
water systems meet the same design criteria applied to sources required to disinfect.
Water systems that install UV treatment units that have not been validated will be

required to install validated equipment (or use another DOH-approved disinfectant) if
disinfection is required in the future, and may be required to conduct additional source
water sampling for coliform bacteria as required by the Ground Water Rule.

Surface Water
Surface water treatment regulations prescribe treatment techniques that, either in
combination with filtration or alone, achieve identified levels of inactivation and/or
removal of pathogens. All surface water systems must provide a minimum of 3-log
removal and/or inactivation of Giardia lamblia and 4-log inactivation and/or removal of
viruses, and control of pathogenic bacteria. These requirements are prescribed in the
federal Surface Water Treatment Rule (40 CFR 141.70 through 141.75), and chapter 246-
290 WAC, Part 6. The Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR) and
Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR) impose a 2-log
Cryptosporidium removal requirement on water systems required to filter. With the
promulgation of LT2ESWTR, EPA formally recognized the effectiveness of UV for
inactivation of Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium. The LT2ESWTR public health
protection requirements are in addition to those required by the Surface Water
Treatment Rule, IESWTR, and the LT1ESWTR. We explain the different UV disinfection
standards for disinfection of surface water sources in more detail below.

Limited Alternative to Filtration
To meet the limited alternative to filtration (LAF) standards, the water system must
provide greater removal or inactivation of pathogens for the surface water source than
the combination of chlorination and filtration would provide (WAC 246-290-630(11)).
Where UV disinfection is used to meet LAF requirements, DOH requires that a minimum
design dose of 40 mJ/cm 2 be used.

Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule
The LT2ESWTR was developed to provide additional public health protection from
pathogens present in surface water, especially Cryptosporidium. The rule requires
additional treatment for some sources based on their source water Cryptosporidium
concentrations and treatment currently provided. UV disinfection is one option that
water systems have to comply with the additional treatment requirements.

UV light inactivates Cryptosporidium at relatively low doses compared to several other
surface water pathogens. Therefore, the doses required are expected to be less than 40
mJ/cm2 in most cases. The LT2ESWTR and associated UVDGM identify the installation
design and operation requirements for UV disinfection. DOH expects the design
engineer installing UV disinfection to consult the LT2ESWTR and UVDGM as part of the
design process to ensure compliance.

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                497
Surface Water Treatment Rule
When the Surface Water Treatment Rule was finalized, it focused on the use of chemical
disinfectants to inactivate waterborne pathogens. At the time, the most disinfection
resistant pathogen regulated was Giardia lamblia. In 2001, DOH recognized research
that indicated UV could effectively inactivate Giardia lamblia at relatively low doses. We
established a minimum UV dose of 40 mJ/cm 2 when water systems use disinfection to
comply with the Surface Water Treatment Rule. This is the same UV dose required by
the widely accepted German and Austrian standards, which considered the sensitivity of
several pathogens along with their ability for enzymatic repair of their damaged nucleic
acids in establishing a minimum required UV dose. This minimum reduction equivalent
dose is more than sufficient to provide 1-log credit for inactivation of Giardia lamblia.

Surface water sources must also provide 4-log inactivation or removal of viruses.
Because viruses are more readily inactivated by chemical disinfectants than Giardia
lamblia, water systems that provided at least 0.5-log inactivation of Giardia lamblia with
a chemical disinfectant readily met the 4-log virus inactivation requirement. There are
some viruses, especially adenoviruses, which are more UV resistant than Giardia lamblia.
Adenoviruses were not used to establish the German UV disinfection standard of 40
mJ/cm2. However, the LT2ESWTR used adenoviruses to establish the UV dose tables for
viruses in the rule. Based on this information, reduction equivalent doses greater than 40
mJ/cm2 will be required for virus inactivation credit.

Disinfection must be continuously provided for surface water sources (WAC 246-290-
662(1)). In this case, “continuous” means a period of 15 or more minutes. If a water
system fails to provide the required UV dose for 15 or more minutes, they must contact
DOH. Failure to provide the required UV dose on a surface water source more than one
day per month is considered a treatment technique violation (WAC 246-290-662(4)(b)).

Water Quality
Water quality can significantly influence the effectiveness of UV disinfection. Reductions
in effectiveness can result from direct absorbance of UV radiation by the water and
various constituents in the water, by the shielding of organisms often associated with
higher turbidities, and by scales forming (fouling) on lamp sleeves. The following list
identifies several water quality parameters to consider.
      Iron and Manganese: Ferric iron strongly absorbs UV radiation. It can negatively
       affect a reactor’s ability to inactivate microorganisms by “consuming” the UV
       before microorganisms absorb it. Iron and manganese oxides can cause scaling
       on the quartz sleeve that would reduce the UV irradiance that enters the water
       column. Iron and manganese concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L and 0.02 mg/L
       can cause significant fouling of quartz sleeves (Mackey et al. 2001; Chen 2009;

Water System Design Manual
DOH 331-123, June 2020                                                                 498
       Black and Hill 2009). The water system should remove iron or manganese
       exceeding the secondary contaminant levels of 0.3 mg/L, or 0.05 mg/L,
       respectively, prior to UV application.
      Hardness: Hardness greater than 140 mg/L as CaCO3 can cause scaling on the
       quartz sleeve that would reduce the UV irradiance that enters the water column
       (Mackey et al. 2001; Black and Hill 2009). Solubility calculations for carbonates of
       calcium and magnesium can provide a preliminary screening of the likelihood of
       precipitation. If it appears possible, then the water system should perform pilot
       testing using the same lamp proposed for the full-scale application.
      Total Organic Carbon: Many naturally occurring organic materials in water
       strongly absorb UV radiation. Like iron, they can negatively affect a reactor’s
       ability to inactivate microorganisms. The nature and amount of the specific
       organic carbon in the water strongly affects UV disinfection effectiveness. This
       should become evident through UV transmittance measurements.
      Turbidity: Turbidity is a measure of a solution’s ability to scatter light as a result
       of particulate matter. Turbidity alone cannot be directly correlated to a
       predictable effect on UV system effectiveness; and, in some cases, turbidity in
       excess of 5 NTU has not resulted in diminished UV inactivation performance
       (Passatino and Malley 2001). However, water systems are required to provide
       turbidity control to less than 5 NTU. In groundwater, turbidity is often a result of
       iron or manganese precipitation, and removing these inorganics may eliminate
       the turbidity problem.
      UV Transmittance (of the water): UV transmittance is a measure of water’s ability
       to transmit ultraviolet radiation, and is a function of the factors identified above,
       as well as some water treatment chemicals (Cushing et al. 2001). The UV
       transmittance of raw water directly affects the ability of UV light to disinfect raw
       water adequately. Design engineers should perform validation testing consistent
       with the UV transmittance of the water for which they propose treatment.

Most water systems do not have historical records of many of the above parameters. A
water system considering UV should begin sampling on at least a monthly basis
for each of the above. More frequent testing may be required if significant variation in
water quality is expected. It may not be possible to predict the fouling characteristics of
any particular water, and pilot testing may be appropriate in some cases. While piloting
will likely not be required, opting out of piloting may increase the risk that the facility
will not operate as expected.

Design
It is important to consider a range of issues in the design of a UV disinfection system,
including:
      Inlet and outlet conditions: Correlate to match the validation conditions (or be
       hydraulically more conservative).
      Reactor isolation: Drip-tight reactor isolation valves. If reactors are flooded with
       chemicals for cleaning, provide additional isolation such as double block-and-
       bleed valve arrangements.
      UV system operation consistent with the identified flow rate (positive flow control
       may be required).
      Accommodate the “start-stop” operation typical of many small and medium
       treatment systems to account for warm-up and cool-down requirements of some
       UV systems (You may need a “flow-to-waste” cycle).
      The possibility and control of hydraulic shock, or potential for significant
       hydraulic transients.
      The need for reliability and redundancy of a treatment system (may require
       parallel units).
      Recognition that power fluctuations can shut down some UV systems (while not
       having the same effect on pumps), and the need for alarm and automatic shut-
       off features to prevent untreated water from entering the distribution system (an
       uninterruptible power supply may be applicable).
      Because UV lamps contain mercury, a complete assessment of a particular
       treatment system’s vulnerability to lamp breakage and mercury release (included
       in an emergency response plan).
      The need for a reliable, stable, calibrated UV irradiance sensor system installed
       and monitored for operational control. The sensor system, which may be one or
       several individual sensors, is integrally included in the validation process, and
       should be well described in both the validation test report and the specific design
       report for the project.

You can find additional initial design considerations that you will evaluate during the
review of any specific proposal in the UVDGM (USEPA 2006).

2016). Consult these resources in addition to the items below when preparing project
reports and construction documents for UV disinfection facilities.

Project Reports for UV installation projects should include the following at a minimum:
 Reactor validation report submitted to and approved by DOH. The reactor validation
  must identify the operating conditions the minimum UV dose will address (flow, UV
  intensity, and UV lamp status).
 Describe CT requirements and the design factor of safety.
 Water quality data over a sufficient duration to characterize the source water
  adequately, usually monthly for a year, unless DOH agrees otherwise. Key water quality
  parameters include:
      UV transmittance (daily)
      Turbidity (daily)
      Iron and manganese (Iron at least weekly to capture transient events)
      Hardness
      Total organic carbon
 UV reactor dose-response monitoring strategy. If the calculated dose approach is
  used, the reactor validation must include measurements of UV transmittance and an
  empirical dose-monitoring equation developed through the validation testing.
 A description of the hydraulics including inlet and outlet conditions to be similar to
  or more conservative than the ones used in the reactor validation.
 Provisions for reactor isolation including adequate valves to prevent short-circuiting
  and allow for maintenance.
 Provisions for redundancy including providing more than one UV reactor to allow for
  chemical cleaning and equipment maintenance. A redundant reactor may be needed to
  ensure that design flows can be met.
 Power quality analysis including analysis of sub-second power interruptions and
  voltage sags for the location of a proposed UV facility. Inclusion of an uninterruptible
  power supply or power conditioning equipment as appropriate.
 Lamp-breakage response plan that defines emergency response actions the water
  system will take; include notifying DOH if a lamp breaks. You should evaluate the
  potential for hydraulic transients because they may cause the quartz sleeves that house
  UV lamps to fail.
 Monthly operating and monitoring report form acceptable to DOH. The report
  form must identify the conditions for which the minimum required UV dose can be
  provided. Sensor checks and UV transmittance monitor checks, as appropriate, may be
  included on the form or as part of a separate report.

       you will use during testing, including UVT analyzers, UV intensity sensors, and
       power consumption meters.
      Conduct dry testing first, with a follow-up period of wet testing. The UV supplier
       has a duty to identify tests that require testing with a dry reactor and those that
       require wet testing. Include ancillary equipment, such as flow meters and
       modulating valves.
      Test the UV system under all design conditions. Verify that the UV reactor is
       adjusting power to maintain target disinfection levels at varying flows and UVTs.
       Verify that the system records and displays correct information for continuous
       monitoring and monthly reporting. Verify all alarm set points. Verify that the
       values reported on the UV control panel(s) match the values displayed and
       recorded in the SCADA system.
      Test the UV system under a power failure scenario to demonstrate proper
       shutdown or flow diversion response.

Operations
As with all treatment systems, UV disinfection equipment requires regular monitoring
and maintenance. We developed report forms for UV disinfection reporting that water
systems may use for operational records. If we grant disinfection credit, a water system
must submit a report to us on a monthly basis (WAC 246-290-480, 666, and 696). The
following table shows the minimum monitoring and reporting requirements. Individual
projects may require variations on ways water systems present these data; however, the
elements in the table are basic.
