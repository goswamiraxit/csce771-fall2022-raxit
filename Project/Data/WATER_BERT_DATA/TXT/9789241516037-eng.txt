shall WHO be liable for damages arising from its use.
Reference to any company or product in this report, particularly those listed in any of the figures and tables, does not constitute an endorsement, certification
or warranty of fitness by WHO of such company or product for any purpose, and does not imply any preference over companies or products of a similar
nature that are not mentioned.
WHO does not furthermore warrant that any products included in the figures and tables are of acceptable quality; have obtained regulatory approval in any
country; or that their use is otherwise in accordance with the national laws and regulations of any country, including but not limited to patent laws. Furthermore,
inclusion of any products in this report, particularly in any of the figures and tables, does not imply approval by WHO of these products. Such approval is the
sole prerogative of national authorities.
This report describes the products evaluated in Round II of the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies (the Scheme)
as meeting the WHO-recommended performance levels at the time of testing. WHO cannot guarantee that the products that met a stated performance level
will continue to do so.
The figures and tables included in this report do not provide an exhaustive overview of available household water treatment (HWT) products. They reflect
those products that were submitted to WHO for evaluation in Round II of the Scheme, were found to meet the eligibility criteria for such evaluation and were
subsequently evaluated. The fact that certain products are not mentioned in this report does not mean that they are not eligible for evaluation; nor does it
mean that, if evaluated, they would not be found to meet any of the WHO-recommended performance levels.
WHO disclaims any and all liability and responsibility whatsoever for any injury, death, loss, damage or other prejudice of any kind that may arise as a result
of or in connection with the procurement, distribution and use of any product included in this report.

    Improving water safety
    Waterborne diarrhoeal disease is largely preventable through interventions aimed at identifying and managing water safety risks, including
    water safety planning. Household/point-of-use water treatment as an interim measure, allows households, schools and health care facilities to
    take charge of water safety

1 Highlights

Since the establishment of the International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies (the
Scheme) in 2014, WHO has been independently evaluating the performance of household water treatment
(HWT) technologies in removing microbial contaminants from drinking-water. The Scheme is one part of WHO’s
normative programme of work on drinking-water quality. It provides the evidence to inform Member States and
United Nations procuring agencies’ selection of effective HWT technologies to reduce the risk of diarrhoeal
disease from unsafe drinking-water. In particular, the Scheme helps to ensure that products that provide limited
or no pathogen removal are kept off the market.

This Round II report of the Scheme adds to the growing number of HWT products for which comprehensive,
health-based performance evaluations are available. The report summarizes the results of 19 of 20 HWT products
evaluated in Round II of the Scheme.1 These represent a range of treatment methods, including chemical, solar
and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection and ceramic and membrane filtration.



1.1 Improving water safety
Unsafe drinking-water still accounts for over half of the diarrhoeal disease burden globally
Although significant progress has been made in increasing access to drinking-water services, these do not always
provide water that is safe at the point of consumption, including in homes, schools and health care facilities. Over
2 billion people globally lack access to safely managed drinking-water services, and approximately 485 000
diarrhoeal deaths in low- and middle-income countries each year are attributable to unsafe drinking-water.

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.1 calls for safe drinking-water along the entire water
service delivery chain
SDG 6.1 represents a higher level of ambition than the previous Millennium Development Goal target related
to drinking-water. SDG 6.1 focuses on the type of infrastructure available and emphasizes the quality of the
service that is delivered, including safety of drinking-water. This necessitates ensuring that water safety risks are
minimized from catchment to consumer, including in households where unsafe collection, storage and handling
can result in contamination.

Drinking-water safety can be improved through effective household water treatment and safe
storage
Household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) can reduce the risk of diarrhoeal disease by as much as
61% when effective HWT methods are used correctly and consistently by populations at risk of waterborne disease
(Box 2). HWTS should therefore be targeted to where the safety of water supplies is uncertain; in emergencies
and outbreaks of waterborne disease such as cholera; and among vulnerable populations relying on unsafe water
sources, such as young children, the malnourished and people living with HIV/AIDS. Through the Scheme, WHO
works to maximize health gains from HWT by ensuring that products on the market meet global, health-based
performance criteria. Governments are ultimately responsible for progressive improvements to safe drinking-
water and towards achieving universal access.

           BOX 2
           Achieving health gains from HWTS
           Both quantitative microbial risk modelling and epidemiological evidence indicate that appreciable health gains from HWTS are
           achieved under three main conditions. These are: (i) the water treatment method sufficiently removes contaminants; (ii) rates of
           use are high that is, over 90% of the time; and (iii) HWTS is actually needed.
           Treating water that has low levels of contamination to begin with does not result in appreciable health gains. Supporting correct
           and consistent use of accepted technologies through, for example, regular promotional messaging and user training is particularly
           important for achieving health gains. Results of recent field trials from Bangladesh and Kenya suggest that not sufficiently engaging
           users in HWTS selection as well as intermittent messaging results in incorrect and inconsistent use and little to no reduction in
           childhood diarrhoea. Thus, significant effort is required in understanding contextual factors, including the most appropriate HWTS
           technology in a given setting, supporting correct and consistent use, and how technologies perform with specific source water
           quality characteristics.

    A number of available products, however, do not sufficiently protect the health of users
    Of the 30 products tested in Rounds I and II, six fail to meet minimum performance criteria. It is likely that their
    performance under actual use conditions, especially where use instructions are not followed or are unclear, is
    worse. Informed selection by procurers based on detailed consideration of candidate product performance data,
    and strengthened regulation by governments to keep poor performing HWT products off the market, are essential.

    Quality of HWT products is variable and should be strengthened
    The performance of several of the products that do not meet the performance criteria varies widely across
    production lots or units. This highlights the importance of strengthening manufacturing quality assurance/
    quality control measures and ensuring that products consistently treat water at or above minimum performance
    standards.

    Effective chlorination requires appropriate dosing and regular monitoring of free residual
    chlorine (FRC)
    The effectiveness of chlorine products depends on the characteristics of the water being treated, including the
    presence of natural organic matter (NOM), temperature and pH. As these parameters vary in natural waters, the
    chlorine demand and, ultimately, the required chlorine dose varies. These findings underscore the importance
    of appropriate site-specific dosing that is based on the chlorine demand of the water to be treated and regular
    monitoring to ensure that FRC concentrations of 0.2–0.5 mg/L are maintained. Making these adjustments
    requires competent technical support and regular monitoring, which may be difficult to achieve in individual
    households. Efforts are therefore needed to shift towards safely managed central chlorination at point of
    collection, in tanker trucks, in community/health care facility water storage tanks or in piped water systems.




4   Results of Round II of the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
1.3 Interpretation and application of results
Health gains from two-star ( ) and three-star (               ) products are similar although three-star
products provide some added protection
The results of a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) modelling study (Bivins et al., 2019) undertaken
in Round II indicate that while three-star products offer superior pathogen protection, under most water quality
conditions similar health gains can be achieved from two-star products when these are used correctly and
consistently. Essentially,

• both two- and three-star products provide comprehensive protection and are effective when a range of
  pathogens causing diarrhoeal disease is present or when the causative pathogen(s) is(are) unknown; and

• when choosing between two- and three-star products, the focus should not be on the product with a higher
  classification but on the product most likely to achieve high rates of correct and consistent use, and factors
  that support effective implementation, including supply chains, cost, etc.

Selection of one-star ( ) products should be informed by an understanding of water quality
characteristics and risks
Findings from the aforementioned modelling study also highlight that some one-star products can achieve health
gains comparable to two-star products, depending on the source water quality and pathogen classes they protect
against. For example, for water quality of low risk (i.e. <10 Escherichia coli colony-forming units/100 mL) and
very high adherence (that is, used correctly and over 90% of the time), health gains from a one-star product
that protects against bacteria and viruses are similar to those from a two-star product that protects against all
three classes of pathogens. Thus, selection of one-star products requires more careful analyses of microbial
contamination in source water and the limitations of the product.

Along with microbial performance, HWT selection should be informed by the likelihood of
achieving correct and consistent use
Achieving health gains from HWT depends on multiple factors; microbial performance is critical, but not the
sole factor. Once it is confirmed that a product meets minimum performance targets, other factors to consider
include specific relevant water quality conditions, safe storage and the likelihood of correct and consistent use
and the factors that influence such use (Fig. 2).



1.4 Strengthening national capacity and impact of the Scheme
A global evaluation scheme fills an important gap in limited national testing capacity
Unlike other health interventions, HWT technologies are diverse and must work against a number of different
pathogens and different types of waters. This complicates the testing and requires highly skilled technicians and
extensively equipped laboratories. As such, many low- and middle-income countries have limited capacity to
conduct HWT performance testing. While WHO is working to simplify protocols for use in low-resource settings,
research is ongoing and requires continued investment.

National regulatory oversight of HWT is vital and must be strengthened
National regulatory authorities can play a vital role in ensuring that available HWT products are effective and
safe through assessment, certification and control of the products. However, many low-resource countries
that commonly use HWT do not yet have comprehensive assessment and certification criteria on product
performance, highlighting the need to continue strengthening capacity in this area.

    Efforts to strengthen the technical expertise, infrastructure and mandate of national water quality laboratories and
    research institutions should be comprehensive to make effective use of resources and to ensure sustainability of
    capacity-building efforts. Efforts to support stronger HWT national assessments should be carried out alongside
    broader efforts to assess and improve safe drinking-water services and regulation as part of efforts to meet SDG
    6.1 targets and improve water safety for all consumers.

HWTS should be targeted for among high-risk groups and within key health and water safety
efforts
HWTS has the greatest health impacts in populations that use water with high levels of faecal contamination and/
or those who are particularly at risk for waterborne diseases. At risk populations include pregnant women and
young children; people living with HIV/AIDS; malnourished individuals and those living in cholera hotspots. Thus,
policies and programmes should integrate effective HWTS options into water safety efforts and comprehensive
health programmes to maximize gains.

    2 Introduction

    SDG 6.1 seeks to ensure universal access to safe drinking-water. Underpinning SDG 6.1 is an emphasis on
    incrementally improving water safety. A systematic and comprehensive approach to assessing and managing
    water safety risks, from catchment to consumer, known as Water Safety Planning (WSP) is widely recognized as
    the most effective way to consistently ensure the safety of water supply and to protect public health (WHO, 2017).

    Since the introduction of WSPs in the third edition of the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) in
    2004, 93 countries have adopted this approach (WHO/IWA, 2017).



    2.1 Targeted settings for HWTS
    Although 90% of the global population has access to a basic drinking-water source,3 contamination is widespread
    and at least 2 billion people use drinking-water sources that are contaminated with faeces (UNICEF/WHO, 2019).
    In particular, the prevalence of intermittently piped water supplies (Kumpel & Nelson, 2016) and deterioration
    in water quality during collection, transport and storage (Shields et al., 2015) in many low- and middle-income
    countries increase water safety risks.

    Within the WSP framework, HWTS is an effective intervention to improve drinking-water quality where
    continuous access to safe piped-in water is not available. Aside from households, HWTS/point-of-use water
    treatment is increasingly important in institutional settings such as schools and health care facilities. Emerging
    data indicate that water safety is often compromised in these settings, where populations are particularly
    vulnerable to waterborne disease.

    Ensuring water safety is critical in all emergencies. With 25 major health emergencies currently requiring
    international response,4 provision of safe drinking-water, including through rapid, portable water treatment units,
    is critical. This is especially true in health care facilities in emergency settings where high-risk and vulnerable
    populations receive curative care, including in the current Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the Democratic
    Republic of the Congo.

    In addition, HWTS is a key component of preventing and responding to cholera outbreaks; these currently affect
    47 countries (Global Task Force on Cholera Control, 2017). The global plan to end cholera by 2030 highlights
    HWTS as a particularly important intervention that, like the oral cholera vaccine, can be rolled out rapidly while
    longer-term investments in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are underway (Global Task Force on Cholera
    Control, 2017; Montgomery et al., 2018).

        Basic drinking-water sources are defined as those that are (i) potentially capable of delivering safe water by nature of their design and construction, and include piped
        water, bore-holes or tube-wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater and bottled and delivered water; and (ii) are within a round-trip collection time of
        30 minutes from the household. Full definitions of source types can be found at https://washdata.org/monitoring/methods/facility-types.

8   Results of Round II of the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
2.2 The Scheme
To comprehensively assess effectiveness, WHO (2011) developed health-based performance criteria for HWT
products based on the removal of the three main groups of pathogens that cause waterborne diarrhoeal disease:
bacteria, viruses and parasitic protozoa. Pathogens in these three microbial groups, that is, enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Shigella, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium were found to be the main causes of moderate-
to-severe diarrhoea in a multicluster study of 20 000 children (Kotloff et al., 2013). The WHO criteria thus provide
the basis for evaluating and classifying HWT performance against these microbial groups in three ascending
tiers of performance: (one-star),             (two-star) and         (three-star).

Many low- and middle-income countries have neither the resources nor the capacity to assess HWT performance
against WHO recommendations. Therefore WHO established the the Scheme in 2014 to support implementation
of the aforementioned criteria by independently evaluating the performance of commercially available HWT
products. Since then, harmonized testing protocols that detail the approach and testing conditions for various
treatment technologies have been developed.5

The results of the Scheme evaluations are used to inform procuring United Nations agencies, national governments
and nongovernmental organizations. Since the report from Round I of the Scheme in 2016, the evaluation results
have helped guide HWT product selection and are catalysing the shift towards better-performing products and
better-informed users.

Alongside these efforts, WHO works to strengthen the capacity of national regulatory authorities and reference
laboratories in regulating and carrying out complementary evaluations of HWT performance. This includes
facilitating training and knowledge transfer on HWT performance evaluation, and supporting development of
national health-based certification criteria for HWT products.



2.3 Report overview
This Round II report summarizes the results of 19 of the 20 HWT products recently evaluated under the Scheme.
These products represent a range of treatment technologies, including chemical, solar and UV disinfection;
ceramic and membrane filtration; and combined flocculation–disinfection.

Sections 1 and 2 highlight the key messages from the report, and outline the role of HWTS as a water safety
intervention. The sections also introduce the Scheme and its objectives.

Section 3 presents an overview of Round II of the Scheme and outlines some of the key lessons from Round I
and how they have been applied in improving how the Scheme works. The section draws attention to lessons
learned from testing chlorine products and the importance of understanding water quality conditions for both
performance testing and chlorination practice. The evaluation procedure and descriptions of each of the products
evaluated in Round II are also outlined.

Section 4 summarizes the results from Round II, highlighting that there are additional products that meet WHO
performance criteria. This section also notes that of the products that fail to meet WHO criteria, inconsistent
performance across production units – suggestive of poor manufacturing quality – is a challenge.

                                          Section 5 discusses key concepts and considerations in interpreting the Scheme results and applying them in
                                          HWT selection. It emphasizes that HWT selection should be context specific, that is, based on understanding
                                          of water quality conditions, the performance/limitations of an HWT product relative to those conditions and
                                          the likelihood of achieving high rates of correct and consistent use.

                                          Section 6 gives an update on the work of WHO in strengthening national regulation and complementary
                                          evaluations of HWT. It outlines how these efforts are improving understanding of HWT performance and of
                                          risk-based management of water safety as a whole.

                                          The report concludes with an overview of lessons learned from the two rounds of evaluation under the Scheme
                                          and outlines priorities for future evaluations and national capacity-building efforts.

3 Round II of the Scheme

In Round II, WHO worked to improve programme efficiency and increase awareness of the Scheme among
manufacturers and procurers. This section of the report summarizes the evaluation procedure and changes made
to testing protocols, and how these changes have allowed for more products to be tested, without compromising
scientific rigour. This section also provides an overview of the products evaluated.



3.1 Updates and applied lessons from Round I
3.1.1 Simplifying testing for wider uptake by laboratories
The Scheme testing protocols are designed to guide WHO-designated testing laboratories as well as laboratories
seeking to evaluate HWT products in the most scientifically rigorous, efficient and cost-effective way possible.
Cost-effectiveness is especially important to ensure that all products of public health relevance are evaluated
and to allow for adaptation of protocols for testing local products in low- and middle-income countries. Between
Rounds I and II, WHO simplified testing protocols, thus expanding where and how HWTS can be tested. In
particular, the following amendments were made to the protocols:

• Reduction in the total number of posttreatment samples collected per product from 18 to 12, based on a review
  of the data from the products evaluated in Round I. This review highlighted that the number of posttreatment
  samples collected exceeded the number necessary to determine performance and added time and cost to
  the testing.

• Reduction in the number of microbial groups tested, depending on the best available evidence for the
  performance of technologies against the relevant microbial groups. For example, free chlorine is ineffective
  against protozoan cysts, especially Cryptosporidium. In the case of filters that are based mainly on size exclusion,
  if they can effectively remove bacteria and viruses, they can reasonably be expected to effectively remove
  Cryptosporidium, which is the largest in diameter of the test organisms. Therefore, these technologies are not
  tested against protozoan cysts.6

Further amendments are outlined in the Scheme Harmonized Testing Protocol (WHO, 2018a).


3.1.2 Increasing awareness of the Scheme and understanding of HWT performance
The findings of a rapid market assessment of HWT in sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific
in 2015 indicated that awareness of key considerations in HWT performance evaluation and WHO performance
criteria was limited (WHO, 2016a). Given the relatively high proportion of HWT users in these regions (WHO,
2014), these findings point to an opportunity to strengthen user awareness and assist governments, procurers
and users in understanding the importance of the WHO performance criteria for health. Thus, following the
publication of the Round I report in 2016, WHO has been working to disseminate the results and performance
criteria among key stakeholders, including national regulatory and laboratory authorities, HWT manufacturers
and implementers. A particular focus has been emergency actors (i.e. Global WASH and Health clusters) who
often deploy HWT to address acute water quality concerns.

    In all cases, the decision to conduct an abbreviated microbial test is at the discretion of WHO, with input from the Independent Advisory Committee (IAC).




                                                                                                                                                                 11
     3.1.3 Demand for testing under the Scheme has grown
     In Round II, 39 EoIs were received for evaluation under the Scheme, compared to 27 in Round I (Fig. 3).

     The majority of EoIs received in Round II were membrane filtration and chemical disinfection technologies. Round
     II saw the inclusion of three relatively large-scale products that would be applicable in institutional settings such
     as health care facilities and schools. Given the salient need, and increased global attention to improving WASH,
     including water safety, in such settings (UNICEF/WHO, 2018; WHO/UNICEF, 2018a,b), future rounds will likely
     include more products of a similar scale.

     3.2.1 Testing protocols and evaluation criteria
     The philosophy of the Scheme evaluation is to provide a comparative and consistent assessment of HWT
     performance, to distinguish between products that are protective of health and those that are not. Testing is
     conducted in defined water quality conditions, in two test waters, according to the product use instructions. As
     much as possible, test conditions are set to simulate actual source waters and use in order to yield data that
     more closely estimate the effectiveness of the product in actual use.

     WHO has developed protocols that are specific to the treatment technology (for example, solar/ultraviolet (UV)
     disinfection or ceramic filtration) that a product may employ, taking into account parameters such as temperature
     and turbidity that may impact performance (WHO, 2018a). The product-specific test plan is developed based
     on the technology-specific protocol in accordance with the product use instructions.

     Evaluation under the Scheme comprises laboratory performance testing and review of product information,
     including labelling and instructions for use. The evaluation criteria are outlined in Box 3, with further details
     provided in Annex 1.

                Testing is currently limited to arsenic and silver leachates from ceramic filters in contact with water, and a desk review of materials in contact with drinking-
                water that may be potentially toxic.

     In brief, evaluation under the Scheme considers performance across three microbial groups: bacteria, with E.
     coli as the test organism; viruses, with bacteriophages MS2 and phiX1748 as the test organisms; and protozoa,
     with Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) oocysts as the test organism. As outlined in section 3.1.1, the number of
     microbial groups tested may be reduced based on available evidence of performance against various microbial
     groups.

         Performance classification is based on the lower-performing phage.

Products are tested in two types of test waters: General Test Water (GTW), representative of relatively “clean”,
nonturbid water such as groundwater, and Challenge Test Water (CTW), representative of relatively “dirty”,
turbid water, such as surface water.

Variation in performance across production lots or units can be indicative of poor manufacturing quality. For
devices, consistency in performance is assessed by testing three randomly selected units from a production cycle.
For consumable products such as chemical disinfectants, sufficient sample units from two manufacturing lots,
randomly selected, should be provided for testing. In addition, for chemical disinfectants expected to deliver a
certain dose, the concentration in dechlorinated tap water is assessed.

     3.2.2 Evaluation of chlorine disinfectants
     Chlorination is one of the most common methods of disinfecting drinking-water. It is especially common as
     a secondary or final treatment after filtration and/or coagulation. Chlorine is also widely applied as a primary
     household/point-of-use treatment method in low- and middle-income settings and in many emergencies where
     there is risk of waterborne disease.

     A variety of chlorine products are available; some are in granular form and some in liquid, and the efficacy of
     these products varies. The efficacy of chlorine disinfection correlates with the chlorine dose applied and the
     residual concentration subsequently available, the contact time and the type of microorganism. Chlorine is
     generally effective against bacteria and some viruses, but ineffective against most protozoan cysts including
     Cryptosporidium. In addition, site-specific water quality conditions also affect the efficacy of chlorine disinfection
     (Box 6).



          BOX 6
          What is chlorine demand and why does it matter?
          The efficacy of chlorine disinfection is influenced by water quality
          characteristics such as the presence of organic and inorganic matter, pH,
          turbidity and temperature. Disinfection generally occurs more quickly at higher
          temperatures and is more effective at pH less than 8, and at low levels of
          turbidity and inorganic or organic matter. When added to water, chlorine reacts
          with natural inorganic (e.g. iron, ammonia) and organic (e.g. fulvic and humic
          acids) matter present. These reactions “consume” the chlorine, decreasing
          the concentration available for microbial disinfection. High levels of turbidity
          also contribute to decreased disinfection efficacy by shielding microbes and
          preventing them from coming into contact with chlorine.
          Chlorine demand refers to the amount of chlorine added minus the amount
          consumed by these reactions. What is not consumed, the free residual chlorine
          (FRC), is available for additional disinfection.
          Chlorine demand varies across water sources and over time due to, for
          example, seasonal changes in source water quality such as during dry/wet
          season, algal blooms and floods
          The chlorine dose applied should be site-specific and achieve three objectives:
          (i) meet the chlorine demand of the water and sufficiently inactivate microbes;
          (ii) maintain an FRC concentration of ≥0.5 mg/L after 30 minutes of contact
          time, or ≥0.2 mg/L in stored household water to provide protection against
                                                                                                                                           © CDC/PHIL19769




          recontamination; and (iii) not exceed taste and odour thresholds that may lead
          to rejection by consumers (WHO, 2017). Note: the WHO recommendation is
          on the concentration of FRC to be maintained and not the dose to be applied,
          as the dose will vary depending on water quality conditions.
          Understanding the chlorine demand of water is important as it affects how much chlorine is required to ensure adequate
          disinfection
          For effective disinfection, it is important to determine chlorine demand through preliminary testing with a set dose of chlorine. Once
          the chlorine demand has been determined, sufficient dose should be applied to meet that demand and maintain FRC. For instance,
          if the chlorine demand is determined to be 1.5 mg/L, a dose of at least 2 mg/L of chlorine should be applied in order to ensure the
          maintenance of at least 0.5 mg/L of FRC in the treated water. Treated water should be regularly monitored to ensure that targeted
          residual concentrations are met. Where changes in the residual concentration are detected and/or seasonal and other changes to
          the quality of the water supply occur, the dose should be adjusted accordingly to achieve the minimum FRC.




16   Results of Round II of the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
Most commercially available chlorine products are designed to deliver a dose of 2 mg/L in clear water. The
recommendation is to double-dose in turbid water (i.e. 4 mg/L). Assuming chlorine demands of 1.5 mg/L in
clear water and 3.5 mg/L in turbid water, these doses would be sufficient to maintain at least 0.2–0.5 mg/L of
FRC in the treated water.

3.2.2.1 Round II chlorine technology evaluation protocol
In light of varying chlorine demands in natural waters, chlorine products were tested against a panel of four
test waters with different chlorine demand, including the existing GTW and CTW. Preliminary tests indicated
that the existing GTW and CTW exert chlorine demands that are higher than what limited data would suggest
are average demands in groundwater and surface water.9 Few products delivered a chlorine dose sufficient to
overcome these demands, as evidenced by low reduction of bacterial and viral surrogates.

Products were then tested against two additional waters, with adjusted total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations
to generate chlorine demand values that more closely reflect natural waters. For these additional test waters,
testing against coliphages MS2 and phiX174 (viral surrogates) was not conducted.10 The evaluation protocol
used for chlorine products is outlined as follows:

• Creating two types of test waters, with chlorine demand values of 1.5 ± 0.2 mg/L and 3.0 ± 0.2 mg/L, set to mimic
  a range of chlorine demand levels likely to be found in natural waters;

• Testing bacterial inactivation of the product, as a comparative assessment in the two test waters and as indication
  of microbial performance across a range of water quality conditions;

• Measuring FRC in posttreatment samples of the two test waters, to verify that at least 0.2–0.5 mg/L of FRC is
  available after 30 minutes of contact time. In addition, the chlorine concentrations in dechlorinated tap water
  were measured to verify the ability of the product to deliver a dose of at least 2 mg/L, as an indication of the
  product quality; and

• Reviewing literature and existing test data to determine expected viral inactivation.

The formal testing results derived from these adjusted chlorine-specific test waters are presented in Section 4.

3.2.2.2 Interpretation of chlorine results
Free chlorine is generally ineffective against protozoan oocysts, especially Cryptosporidium, and testing against this
microbial group was not conducted (Section 3.1.1). Thus, at best chlorine can only meet the one-star performance
category or provide targeted protection against bacteria and viruses only. While in Round II it was not possible
to test for viruses, information from literature along with posttreatment concentrations of free available chlorine
provide a basic indication of overall microbial performance and product quality.

3.2.2.3 Key considerations and recommendations for chlorination practice
While no test waters can replicate the variability of source water quality conditions around the world, the test
waters present two sets of scenarios that are broadly representative of the range of these conditions, that is,
varying levels of organic matter and turbidity, temperature and pH. Accounting for these factors is important
in performance testing and also when disinfecting with chlorine. Key recommendations include the following:



9
     A rapid review that considered data from 24 countries was conducted to determine chlorine demand values that are more representative of those found in natural source
     waters. While chlorine demand varies depending on seasonality, type of water source, etc., the data suggest mean and 95th percentile values in groundwater and surface
     water of 0.9 mg/L (1.7 mg/L) and 1.4 mg/L (2.9 mg/L), respectively.
10
     In the chlorine evaluation protocol outlined above, the amount of TOC added as an adjustment material for GTW and CTW was reduced to meet these 95th percentile
     chlorine demand values. However, methods commonly used to propagate the coliphages MS2 and phiX174 for testing use organic-based media that exert additional
     chlorine demand. Thus, including the coliphages would have led to chlorine demands higher than the target values of 1.5 mg/L and 3 mg/L in GTW and CTW,
     respectively.




                                                                                                                                                                              17
     • Use an effective high-quality product: A variety of chlorine products are available, and as the results in Section
       4 show, the quality and microbial efficacy of these products vary. A critical initial consideration in selecting
       a product is whether it works.

     • Dose based on the chlorine demand of the specific water source: Chlorine demand varies between sources
       and over time, necessitating regular monitoring and adjustment of the applied dosage, when necessary (Box 6).

     • Ideally, chlorine should be used as part of a multibarrier treatment approach: The efficacy of chlorine
       disinfection is diminished in turbid or organic-rich waters with a high chlorine demand. In addition, chlorine
       is ineffective against protozoan cysts such as Cryptosporidium. Combining chlorination with, for example,
       flocculation or filtration has the microbial and aesthetic advantages of treating against a wider range of
       pathogens by reducing turbidity and organic matter, as well as improved taste and smell. Chlorination is
       therefore an important last barrier in such a treatment approach, as it helps maintain the safety of treated
       water by providing residual disinfectant.

     • Monitor FRC: The efficacy of chlorine disinfection for the specific water quality conditions should be verified
       by ensuring maintenance of adequate residual.11

     Taken together, the findings emphasize the importance of understanding source water quality conditions when
     implementing chlorination programmes, and suggest that effective chlorination at household level may be difficult
     to achieve given variability in chlorine demand and the skill and resources required to monitor it and adjust
     dosing. As such, household chlorination may only be appropriate in the short term, and options to chlorinate
     at source or transition to more centrally managed systems supported by trained technicians and monitoring
     systems are preferable.


     3.2.3 Performance classification
     A critical aspect in HWT evaluation is whether a product is able to consistently treat water to the required level
     and thus reliably protect health. Sample units should consistently meet or exceed the performance target for each
     microbial group in both test waters (GTW and CTW). However, a maximum deviation of 0.2 log10 is acceptable
     for 25% of sample points at the two-star performance tier and of 0.4 log10 at the three-star performance tier.12
     This permissible deviation means that to be classified as a two-star product, up to three of the 12 sample points
     can achieve a reduction of 1.8 log10 for bacteria or protozoan cysts (instead of 2 log10), or 2.8 log10 for viruses
     (instead of 3 log10).


     3.2.4 Data management and quality assurance
     Evaluation under the Scheme follows standard operating procedures for data management and quality assurance
     as detailed in the Procedure for Evaluation (WHO, 2018b) and summarized in Annex 1.

          These cut-off values were determined using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) modelling and selecting ranges that still resulted in appreciable health gains
          within a specific performance tier.

     MEMBRANE FILTRATION



     3.3.1 Membrane filtration
     Membrane filtration removes microorganisms from drinking-water through size exclusion. The filters typically
     comprise hollow membrane fibres in a cartridge through which microbes are removed by physical straining. Key
     determinants of the performance of the membrane filtration systems are the pore size of the filter, integrity of
     the filter medium and seals, and the manufacturing quality. Not all membrane types are effective against viruses,
     the smallest of the three microbial groups evaluated under the Scheme (Fig. 5).

     CERAMIC FILTRATION



     3.3.2 Ceramic filtration
     Ceramic filtration removes microorganisms physically from water by a combination of size exclusion and
     adsorption. The ceramic filter matrix is composed of clay and combustible material such as rice husks or sawdust
     that provide a porous structure through which water is filtered under gravity. The filters are often impregnated
     or coated with bacteriostatic agents such as colloidal or nanoparticles of silver or copper. Pore size and quality
     of manufacturing are key determinants of the performance of ceramic filters; they are typically not effective
     against smaller microorganisms such as viruses. Ceramic filters are commonly available as pots and candles,
     although discs are also available.

     An overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of ceramic filters is provided below.


         Microbial performance                 • Effective against most bacteria and protozoa
                                               • Limited effectiveness against virusesa
         Key factors affecting efficacy        • Filter media and pore size
                                               • Quality of manufacturing
                                               • Flow rate
         Advantages                            •   Minimal likelihood of recontamination when held in integrated safe storage container
                                               •   Appearance of treated water is improved, providing a visual indicator that reinforces benefits of treatment
                                               •   Minimal change in taste of water
                                               •   Simple to use
                                               •   No power source is required
                                               •   Possibility of local production may benefit economy and allow easy supply
                                               •   Low relative cost per litre of water treated
         Limitations                           •   Variability in quality of locally produced filters
                                               •   Fragile; difficult to transport over long distances
                                               •   Filters and receptacles need to be cleaned regularly
                                               •   Flow rate is low at 1–3 L/hour (slower in turbid waters)
         Application                           Most appropriate where:
                                               • the pathogen of concern is known (e.g. Cryptosporidium) as ceramic filtration does not provide protection against
                                                 enteric viruses
                                               • there is capacity and proven quality ceramic filter production
     a
       Because of this limitation, products based on ceramic filtration alone are unlikely to achieve a performance classification higher than one-star ( ).

     FLOCCULATION-BIOFILTRATION



     3.3.3 Flocculation–biofiltration
     Flocculant biofilters employ a multibarrier approach to water treatment. The flocculant aggregates suspended
     and larger microorganisms such as protozoa to form flocs, which are removed by subsequent biofiltration. The
     biofilter component comprises a filtration medium such as sand or granular activated carbon, with a biologically
     active layer (biofilm) attached to the medium. The flocs and other contaminants dispersed in the water are
     trapped as the water filters through the biofilm under gravity.

     An overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of flocculant biofilters is provided below.


      Microbial performance                    • Effective against bacteria and protozoa
      Key factors affecting efficacy           • Maturity of the bioactive layer
                                               • Flocculant material
                                               • Flow rate
      Advantages                               • Minimal likelihood of recontamination when held in integrated safe storage container
                                               • Appearance of treated water is improved, providing a visual indicator that reinforces benefits of treatment
                                               • No power source is required
      Limitations                              • Requires regular supply chain for flocculant material
                                               • Periodical cleaning of filtration medium is required
      Application                              Most appropriate where:
                                               • water is of relatively high turbidity

Product descriptiona
The BlueQ™ Two-Stage System is a gravity-fed device that combines coagulation, flocculation and biological
filtration. The assembled unit comprises a series of three stacked buckets. Untreated water is poured into the
top bucket, and aluminium sulfate is added as a coagulant/flocculant. The water passes through a prefilter
that traps the resulting floccules. In the next bucket the water filters through a foam filter with a bioactive
layer around it. The filtered water then passes into the third bucket with a spigot, through which the treated
water can be collected.

     UV DISINFECTION



     3.3.4 UV disinfection
     UV irradiation inactivates microorganisms by damaging their intracellular proteins and nucleic acids, thus
     impairing their cell binding ability and/or ability to replicate.

     The effectiveness of UV disinfection depends on the delivered fluence/dose, which is based on intensity and
     exposure time. UV disinfection is most effective at UVC wavelengths, that is, 200–280 nm. Most household or
     small-scale water treatment technologies employ low-pressure lamps that emit UV radiation at 254 nm. Typically,
     these technologies allow water in a vessel or in flow-through reactors to be exposed to the UV radiation from
     the UV lamps at sufficient fluence/dose to inactivate waterborne pathogens.

     An overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of UV technologies is provided below.


         Microbial performance                 • Effective against bacteria, some viruses (depending on the type of UV lamp)a and protozoa
         Key factors affecting efficacy        • Turbidity or suspended matter (measured as transmittance or absorbance)
                                               • Lamp power
                                               • Flow rate/contact time
         Advantages                            • Simple to use
                                               • Minimal change in taste of the water
         Limitations                           •   Need to pretreat waters of higher turbidity e.g. > 30 NTU by filtration or flocculation
                                               •   Does not provide residual protection against recontamination unless the treated water is safely stored
                                               •   Often requires a power source and a clean UV lamp to operate effectively
                                               •   High relative cost per litre of water treated
         Application                           Most appropriate where:
                                               • water is of low turbidity
                                               • electricity or another power source is available
     a
       Medium-pressure UV is more effective than low-pressure UV in activating resistant viruses (Hijnen, Beerendonk & Medema, 2006; Eischeid, Meyer & Linden, 2009)

        achieved. The device does not include an alarm to indicate
        whether the source water is appropriate for UV disinfection. As
        such, the CTW specifications were set to the general requirements
        of the UV protocol for devices without an alarm.

3.3.5 Solar disinfection
Solar disinfection inactivates microorganisms through a combination of UV irradiation, visible light radiation and
heat. The UV irradiation damages nucleic acids, thus impairing their ability to replicate. Meanwhile, photosensitive
molecules in the water absorb the visible light, resulting in oxidative activities that damage cell structures. The
exposure to sunlight also results in temperature increases that denature proteins within the microorganisms
and/or cause oxidative damage associated with dissolved oxygen products and heat. The effectiveness of solar
disinfection depends on the sun’s intensity, which is affected by weather conditions and geographical location.
Solar disinfection is most effective in tropical or subtropical regions of up to 35 degrees latitude.

A variety of solar disinfection technologies are available, including dark/opaque containers that rely on heat from
the sun to disinfect water; clear polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers that rely on the combined action
of UV radiation, oxidative activity associated with dissolved oxygen and heat; or combinations of these effects
in other types of containers, such as UV-penetrable bags and panels.

An important aspect in solar disinfection is an indicator to provide feedback on the process and signal when
sufficient sunlight has been received for effective disinfection.

An overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of solar technologies is provided below.


 Microbial performance              • Effective against viruses, bacteria and protozoa
 Key factors affecting efficacy     • Weather conditions
                                    • Type of container material
                                    • Water quality matrix, including turbidity
 Advantages                         •   Minimal likelihood of recontamination when held in disinfecting container
                                    •   Simple to use
                                    •   Low relative cost per litre of water treated
                                    •   Little to no maintenance
                                    •   Minimal change in taste of the water
 Limitations                        • Need to pretreat waters of high turbidity (e.g. >30 NTU) by filtration or flocculation
                                    • Volume to treat dependent on availability of clean, intact containers
                                    • The time needed to treat water is relatively long and varies depending on the intensity of the sun (approximately 6
                                      hours under 50% cloudy sky)
                                    • Containers must be placed where they will be exposed to sunlight and not disturbed (e.g. on a roof)
                                    • May not have a visual indicator to indicate treatment complete
 Application                        Most appropriate where:
                                    • water is of low turbidity
                                    • there is sufficient solar radiation; between 35°N and 35°S latitude
                                    • clean, transparent and intact containers for treatment are available

3.3.6 Flocculation–disinfection
Flocculant–disinfectants employ a multibarrier approach to water treatment. The coagulant–flocculant (e.g.
iron or aluminium salts) aggregates suspended particles and larger microorganisms such as protozoa to form
flocs, which are removed by subsequent sedimentation. The disinfectant (e.g. calcium hypochlorite or sodium
dichloroisocyanurate [NaDCC]) inactivates the smaller microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses through
oxidative processes that degrade their biochemical building blocks and disrupt vital cell functions.

Flocculant–disinfectants are commonly available as powders although some are available in tablet form.

A brief overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of flocculant–disinfectants is provided
below.


 Microbial performance              • Effective against bacteria, viruses and protozoa
 Key factors affecting efficacy     • Flocculant/disinfectant material
                                    • Contact time
                                    • Mixing conditions
 Advantages                         •   Residual protection against recontamination
                                    •   Visual improvement in treated water
                                    •   Reduction of some heavy metals (e.g. arsenic) and particle-associated pesticides
                                    •   Portable; lightweight, easily packaged and easy to transport in emergencies
 Limitations                        • Multiple steps required to use the product
                                    • High relative cost per litre of water treated
                                    • Potential user taste and odour objections
 Application                        Most appropriate where:
                                    • water is of relatively high turbidity

        Product evaluation
        Evaluation of the DayOne WaterBag™ was in three components: laboratory testing of the filter component and, the
        flocculant-disinfectant component , and desk review of laboratory data on the P&G Purifier of Water which
        comprises the flocculant-disinfectant component. The complete DayOne Waterbag™, which incorporates
        combined flocculation-disinfection followed by filtration was not evaluated as a single system due to
        limitations with the test protocol. Evaluation of the flocculation-disinfection component investigated its ability
        to reduce bacteria (E. coli) only. Performance against viruses for the flocculation-disinfection component was
        based on review of existing evidence on effectiveness of chlorine against viruses (see
        section 3.2.2.) and on a review of the data submitted in Round I for the P&G™ Purifier
        of Water. Free residual and total chlorine concentrations were collected and analyzed
        in dechlorinated tap water prior to treatment and in the treated water. Evaluation
        of the a component investigated its ability to reduce bacteria and PhiX74 and MS2.
        Future protocols are being investigated for chemical products and once validated, it
        will be possible to conduct a targeted evaluation of virus removal on the full DayOne
        Waterbag™ combined treatment process.

3.3.7 Chemical disinfection: free chlorine
Chemical disinfectants inactivate microorganisms by oxidizing their biochemical building blocks and disrupting
vital cell functions. Chlorine is the most commonly used chemical disinfectant for drinking-water although
oxidants such as bromine, iodine and peroxide are available.

The efficacy of chemical disinfectants depends on how reactive they are against specific microorganisms, the
concentration/dose delivered, the contact time and water quality characteristics such as pH, oxidant demand
and temperature. For example, chlorine is ineffective against microorganisms with strong cell walls, such as
Cryptosporidium oocysts and some bacterial spores. In addition, chlorine reacts rapidly with organic and inorganic
compounds in water, which exert a demand on the chlorine, affecting the concentration available for microbial
disinfection (see section 3.2.2).

For treatment at the household level, chlorine is generally available in liquid form as hypochlorous acid (commercial
household bleach or more dilute sodium hypochlorite solution) or in dry form as calcium hypochlorite or NaDCC.

A brief overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of chlorine products is provided below.


    Microbial performance                • Effective against viruses and bacteria
                                         • Ineffective against protozoan cysts such as Cryptosporidium a
    Key factors affecting efficacy       • Organic content and turbidity
                                         • Free chlorine concentration
                                         • Contact time
    Advantages                           •   Residual protection against recontamination
                                         •   Simple to use
                                         •   Local production may benefit economy
                                         •   Low cost
                                         •   Portable; light weight, easily packaged and easy to transport in emergencies
    Limitations                          •   Less effective in inorganic- and inorganic-rich or turbid watersb
                                         •   Users may object to taste and odour
                                         •   Need to adjust dosing to meet variable chlorine demand in water
                                         •   Need to ensure quality control of locally manufactured chlorine
    Application                          Most appropriate where:
                                         • the pathogen of concern is known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae) as chlorine does not provide protection against some
                                           protozoa
                                         • water is of relatively low turbidity and organic content
a
  Because of this limitation, products based on free chlorine alone are unlikely to achieve a performance classification higher than one-star ( ).
b
  High levels of organic material in water can react with chlorine to form potentially hazardous disinfection by-products. However, the health risks from these
  by-products at the levels at which they occur in drinking-water are relatively small in comparison with the risks associated with inadequate disinfection. As such,
  disinfection should not be compromised in an attempt to control such by-products (WHO, 2017).

a
  The results indicate that the product design is capable of meeting WHO performance criteria; however, performance is inconsistent across production units.
b
  The quality management system for the manufacturing processing has subsequently been revised and an updated version of the product has been submitted for
  evaluation in Round III.
c
  Performance could not be determined due to low flow in the filter.




The results of the microbial performance evaluation highlight the following:

There are more HWT products that meet WHO performance criteria.

In total, 10 of the 30 products evaluated in Rounds I and II are classified as providing comprehensive protection
and 13 as providing targeted protection.




                                                                                                                                                                49
     4.2 Consistency across production units
     In general, performance across production units was highly variable. Even among products that do meet minimum
     performance criteria, bacterial reductions ranged from 2 log10 to 8 log10 for some filters. Two filters failed to
     consistently meet the minimum performance criteria. In the example shown in Fig. 7, bacterial reduction for a
     filter ranged from 0.5 log10 to 6.6 log10.

     Thus, while the mean log reduction exceeds the performance target of 2 log10, only one of the three filter units,
     Unit 1, consistently met or exceeded the performance target.

     For the six products that utilize chlorine as a disinfectant, the dose of chlorine delivered in dechlorinated municipal
     tap water was measured as a general indication of product quality. While most products delivered at least 2
     mg/L of chlorine, two did not, including the example shown in Fig 8.

     For the two lots tested, the mean dose of total chlorine delivered was 0.7 mg/L, and the product failed to meet
     the minimum microbial performance criteria.



     4.3 Product safety
     Of the six products that utilize chlorine as a disinfectant, the majority had at least 0.5 mg/L of FRC after
     30 minutes of contact time. One product had average FRC concentrations of 0.13 mg/L, and bacterial inactivation
     was less than 2 log10. Concentrations of total chlorine for all products were below the maximum health guideline
     value of 5 mg/L.

Arsenic and silver leachate concentrations were tested in the posttreatment water for the three ceramics
filters evaluated in Round II. Leachate concentrations were below GDWQ values. For one filter, arsenic leachate
concentrates were initially above 10 mg/L on the first day of testing but decreased over the course of the test
period.



4.4 Labelling and instructions for use
Labelling and instructions for use were reviewed based on the criteria outlined in Section 3.2.1. These include
clarity of labelling and instructions on dosing, contact time and maintenance procedures. Most products met
these criteria. A few exceptions are outlined below.

Disinfectant contact times and mechanisms to ensure sufficient dosing are sometimes unclear
For three chemical disinfectants, contact times were unclear. For one product, the labelling indicated a contact
time of 3–24 hours, depending on the pathogens to be treated. Households are unlikely to know the specific
pathogens in their drinking-water, or wait 24 hours before drinking the water. Another product did not specify a
contact time. In addition, instructions included adjusting the disinfectant dose delivered but did not include the
chlorine test strips with the product as distributed/sold. For a third product, the use instructions and contact times
indicated on the samples provided for testing differed to those indicated on the product brochure and website.

User instructions and maintenance procedures need to be simplified
The effort required to assemble or maintain a device may compromise the likelihood of it being correctly
and consistently used. The main issues identified in the evaluated devices were ease of use/assembly and
maintenance. One of the devices required 32 steps to assembly it; another required backwashing after each use.

     5 Applying Scheme results

     Selection of HWT products should consider microbial effectiveness and whether products are appropriate for the
     context in which they are to be used. No product is appropriate for all settings and all users. This section discusses
     the application of the Scheme results in HWT selection.



     5.1 Selecting HWT products: matching performance to context
     In order to maximize health gains from HWT, selection should take into account the following contextual factors:

     Source water characteristics: Selection should be informed by an understanding of existing environmental risks,
     including source water quality and contamination risks. For example, for surface waters likely contaminated by
     animal waste, the product should remove protozoa; in cholera-endemic areas, the product should remove bacteria.
     Physicochemical parameters such as turbidity and TOC also affect the effectiveness of treatment and should be
     considered in light of the limitations of various technologies. For instance, disinfection of turbid / organic-rich waters
     with UV or chlorine is most effective when part of multibarrier treatment approach that includes flocculation/
     filtration to reduce turbidity and organic matter.

     Correct and consistent use: A product that has a very high microbial removal but is not used consistently will yield
     little if any health benefits. After microbial performance, a product should be selected for use based on whether
     it is most likely to achieve high adherence (i.e. be used correctly and consistently over time). As outlined in Box 7,
     both two- and three-star products are capable of removing all three classes of pathogens and, under most water
     quality conditions and with high adherence, provide comparable health gains. Thus, selection should be based on
     which product in one of these tiers is most likely to have high adherence.



          BOX 7
          Which ‘star’ product to select?
          The dissemination of the Round I results (WHO, 2016a) has increased awareness about the importance of meeting minimum
          performance criteria. However, in selecting HWT products there is a common assumption that three-star (               ) products yield
          the highest health gains, with minimal consideration as to whether such products are likely to be used correctly and consistently over
          time. WHO has been working to improve understanding of the Scheme performance criteria and related health impacts in order to
          better inform procurer decision making. As part of these efforts, a modelling study (Bivins et al., 2019) was conducted to evaluate
          reductions in diarrhoeal disease burden associated with HWT products in the three tiers of performance ( ,         and         across
          varying conditions of source water quality and across varying levels of adherence (correct and consistent use).
          The results of the study illustrate two key points:
          • Health gains from two-star and three-star products are generally comparable at high levels of adherence, with the difference
            between these two tiers being only 8% in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for diarrhoeal disease averted. An exception is
            when source water is highly contaminated and adherence is high; under these conditions three-star products yield significantly
            higher health gains. Thus, choosing between a three-star and a two-star product should be based on factors such as ongoing
            support to achieve correct and consistent use, cost and familiarity.
          • Products classified as one-star can yield health gains similar to those from two-star products, depending on which pathogen
            classes the product is protective against, and, again, on high adherence. Selection of one-star products should be based on an
            understanding of specific microbial water quality risks and the limitations of the treatment technology.




52   Results of Round II of the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
A number of factors support high adherence to HWT; some relate to the product itself, such as acceptability/
aesthetic appeal, or familiarity and ease of use. Having a minimal number of steps to follow when using the product,
along with simple instructions in an appropriate language, support high adherence (Murray et al., 2015). Other
factors supporting high uptake include making the product easily accessible (e.g. reliable supply chains with local
stores); training on how to use and maintain the product; and provisions for product repair (Box 8).



   BOX 8
   Achieving high adherence to HWT
   In field studies, filters often show higher uptake initially and over time compared to other HWT technologies. In a recent study of
   269 households in Rwanda, 86% of filters were confirmed to be in use 12–24 months after they had been distributed (Kirby et al.,
   2017). Notably, the levels of use were higher than those that had been previously reported for an earlier model of the filter. Possible
   reasons cited for the observed high rates of use include:
   • the recent model of the filter being easier to use;
   • having an integrated safe storage compartment;
   • follow up support on filter use and maintenance;
   • technical support, including repair/replacement of broken filters; and
   • repeated behaviour change messaging.




5.2 HWTS in emergencies: a focus on cholera
Having access to safe water is an important and immediate priority in nearly every emergency. For cholera outbreaks
in particular, safe water is critical as it is needed to prevent the spread of disease, administer oral rehydration salts
and/or antibiotics, create the main curative treatments and ensure safe and quality care for cholera patients at the
health care facilities.

As many as 2.9 million individuals in 47 countries are affected by cholera annually. In sub-Saharan Africa alone,
40–80 million people live in cholera hotspots (Fig. 9). This places a considerable – and preventable – burden on
health systems and costs tens of millions of dollars in treatment costs and lost work and education hours. In some
cases, cholera infection results in death.

The Global Taskforce on Cholera Control (GTFCC) recently revamped efforts to end cholera by 2030. The Taskforce
considers water sanitation and hygiene investments as the foundation to meeting this target.

HWTS is one of several important interventions to reduce cholera risks. It complements the oral cholera vaccine,
as it can be rolled out immediately, and it provides a first step towards improving WASH while longer-term water
systems improvements are planned and financed.

Understanding water quality characteristics, user preferences for HWTS and the need to pre-position and sensitize
populations to the most appropriate options available would help support consistent and correct use of HWTS
once an outbreak occurs.

At the same time, HWTS should not be viewed as the only near- or medium-term WASH solution. A broader
package of prevention strategies should include centralized chlorination of piped supplies, point-of-collection
sources and tanker trucks as well as rapid sanitary surveys to identify contamination risks. For example, during the
2017–2018 cholera outbreak in Lusaka, Zambia, which affected 5000 people and caused nearly 100 deaths, intensive
door-to-door hygiene promotion, hygiene kit distribution and enhanced water quality testing and monitoring in
the most affected subdistricts of Lusaka helped curb the outbreak in these areas (Republic of Zambia, 2019).




                                                                                                                                             53

     However, the elimination of cholera in Zambia will require investing in both short- and long-term water sanitation
     and hygiene services in all hotspots.

     WHO has evaluated over 20 products that are effective in removing/inactivating bacteria and thus preventing the
     spread of cholera in drinking-water, including some of the chlorine disinfectants most commonly used in cholera
     response, and a range of filters.

6 Strengthening national
  capacity and impact of the
  Scheme
The main contribution of the Scheme to water safety lies in its potential to influence product selection and shift
procurement towards products that perform more effectively. To achieve this goal, WHO is working on a number of
efforts aimed at strengthening HWT at country level regulation by ensuring that health criteria are comprehensively
addressed; and by supporting the broader enabling environment. This section outlines progress in these efforts
and the impact of the Scheme this far.



6.1 Strengthening HWT regulation
WHO has developed training resources to support countries establishing or revising HWT regulations. To date,
training workshops have been conducted in Ethiopia and Ghana. Efforts are underway to expand these to other
countries. The training workshops aim to strengthen the skills of both regulatory and health staff in interpreting
evaluation results of the Scheme and equivalent laboratory efficacy data, and determining how such data can be
applied in developing certification criteria for HWT products. An example of the draft certification criteria developed
in Ethiopia is shown in Fig. 10.

     The key focus of the training workshops is how WHO performance criteria can be considered in HWT regulatory
     frameworks and how the scope of regulation can be expanded beyond chemical disinfectants to include other
     HWT technologies. Ultimately, these efforts seek to ensure that HWT products that do not work are kept off the
     market and that consumers have clear and accessible information about those products that do meet minimum
     performance standards.



     6.2 Strengthening capacity of water quality laboratories
     As part of the capacity-
     building efforts under the
     Scheme, WHO has developed
     training resources on HWT
     performance evaluation.
     These resources are aimed at
     strengthening complementary
     testing in countries. The
     training resources focus




                                                                                                                      © WHO Ethiopia/Biniyam Fisseha
     on key concepts in risk-
     based approaches in water
     safety as part of the core
     recommendations of the
     GDWQ.

     Understanding and applying these concepts is important for HWT performance and for strengthening water
     quality management functions such as surveillance and monitoring. As such, WHO is linking activities aimed at
     strengthening laboratory capacity in HWT evaluation with broader efforts to improve water quality surveillance
     as part of national plans to meet SDG 6.1 on water safety.



     6.3 Supporting the broader enabling environment
     In addition to strengthening HWT regulation, WHO continues to engage with organizations participating in the
     International Network on Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (the HWTS Network) to share experience
     on how governments, implementing organizations and the private sector are working together to improve other
     aspects of the HWT-enabling environment.

     As part of these efforts, an interregional
     workshop held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2016
     reviewed experiences in, among other things,
     implementation of existing national policies
     and strategies on HWT, including barriers and
     enabling factors (WHO, 2016b). Participants
     shared innovative approaches to reaching
                                                                                                                      © WHO Ethiopia/Biniyam Fisseha




     populations in need of HWT and ensuring that
     products are affordable and have reliable supply
     chains. Discussions highlighted that, despite
     existing policies and strategies on HWT, there
     are limitations in funding and linking with wider
     efforts in water safety. Discussions at a recent

interregional workshop in Accra, Ghana, highlighted the need to increase coordination across levels of government
(national/subnational) and sectors (water, health, environment, commerce) and improve accountability (WHO,
2019).

                                Strengthening multisectoral engagement
                                Among the key recommendations from the 2016 interregional workshop was the need to establish/revitalize
                                national working groups on water safety, including HWTS. Such working groups have been instrumental in
                                developing national strategies and policies on HWTS in the past, as part of the Network’s efforts. In follow-
                                up to the recommendation, a national
                                working group on water safety / HWTS was
                                established in Ethiopia. The working group
                                comprises representatives from the ministries
                                of health and water, the national regulatory
                                and standards authorities, implementing

                                guidance to the ongoing capacity-building
                                efforts, and ensure linking with other water

7 Reflections and
  recommendations
The two evaluation rounds have provided key lessons and insights that have been applied to improve the functioning
of the Scheme. Based on the lessons from Round I, testing protocols were simplified and subsequently validated
for use in Round II. This simplification allowed for testing of a larger number of products and will facilitate their
application in limited resource settings.

In addition, there has been important progress with regard to awareness of WHO performance criteria for HWT.
More manufacturers are requesting product evaluations under the Scheme, and procurers and regulatory authorities
are increasingly aware of the performance criteria and their application in product selection and certification. To
maximize impact of HWTS and its implementation, WHO has made the following specific recommendations:

For manufacturers:
• Submit your product for evaluation under the Scheme: Include easily understood and consistent labelling and
  use instructions on the product, the product-specific manufacturer’s website and all other relevant material.

• Invest in robust manufacturing quality: By setting out clear demands for quality from material suppliers,
  adhering to clear internal quality management systems such as checks of parameters along the production
  line (seal/flow tests, visual inspections, etc.) and training of manufacturing personnel.

For procurers and implementers:
• Use WHO performance criteria and Scheme results to inform HWT selection: First, consider microbial
  performance based on the evaluation criteria and results in this report. Once a list has been narrowed down
  to include only those that meet at least minimum performance criteria, explore water quality conditions in
  targeted locations, familiarity, supply chains and other factors that impact correct and consistent use.

• Use HWTS as a tool within broader efforts to increase access to safe water: HWTS is one option for
  improving water quality and health, especially among vulnerable populations. Evaluating HWTS should be
  considered within the context of WSP, hygiene and sanitation improvements and integrated environmental
  health interventions at the household level.

For national regulatory and laboratory authorities
• Initiate a process to develop or strengthen national certification programmes: Convene the relevant
  ministries (health, water, environment, commerce) and discuss options for expanding technical capacities in
  HWT regulation. Such a programme should also outline requirements for easily understood labelling and use
  instructions. Work with laboratories to strengthen existing protocols and testing of bacterial indicators and
  surrogates. Start by testing the most commonly sold and used devices.

• Consider fast-tracking certification of products already evaluated by WHO: Products that are sold and
  distributed internationally and have been evaluated under the Scheme may not need to undergo additional
  laboratory testing in-country.




                                                                                                                        59
                                               Priorities under the Scheme include further improving the efficiency of the evaluation process, maintaining the same
                                               high scientific rigour but reducing turn-around time and cost. Building on initial efforts to strengthen regulatory and
                                               laboratory capacity in-country, WHO aims to scale up capacities in water quality management, supported by a
                                               network of laboratories in high-income settings, including the two designated testing laboratories, NSF International
                                               and KWR Watercycle Research Institute. More broadly, WHO will work in a more integrated manner to improve
                                               national approaches to improving water safety. This will ensure that capacity building under the Scheme is packaged
                                               within a broader framework for water safety management that recognizes and promotes synergies with water quality
                                               surveillance and monitoring efforts, WSP and health-based targeting setting and assessments.

                                               Currently 30 HWT products – including those most commonly used in emergencies – have had their performance
                                               independently evaluated against WHO performance criteria. Of these products, 23 meet WHO performance criteria;
                                               however, as illustrated in the results, HWT performance varies greatly and a number of products have minimal
                                               microbial reduction and are therefore of little or no public health benefit. In this regard the Scheme continues to
                                               fulfil an important need for objective and health-based evaluation of HWT.

     Data management and quality assurance

     Data management
     EoIs and supporting product information received from manufactures were stored in a secure WHO database. As
     per standard operating procedure, this information was available only to the Scheme Secretariat and members
     of the IAC. Individual product testing protocols were sent to manufacturers for review before commencement of
     testing. The results of product laboratory testing conducted at NSF International and KWR Watercycle Research
     Institute were recorded by each technician individually. All source documents and electronic records of the
     laboratory testing are maintained in a secure database for 10 years.


     Quality assurance
     The two laboratories currently designated to conduct testing under the Scheme, NSF International and KWR
     Watercycle Research Institute, meet several criteria1. They are accredited by the International Organization
     for Standardization (ISO)/ nternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for ISO/IEC 17025: 2017, the
     internationally accepted standard for developing laboratory management systems for quality, administrative and
     technical operations. Laboratories that achieve compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 have demonstrated that they
     operate using sound management practices; are technically competent to perform specific tests, calibrations
     and/or measurements; and are able to generate technically valid results for which they hold accreditation.

     In addition, the designated laboratories have significant experience evaluating HWT technologies, which is
     important for understanding and correctly operating the technologies in the laboratory during the evaluation.
     Both laboratories are WHO Collaborating Centres and have undergone rigorous legal review for objectivity.
     They engage, without profit, in a number of technical activities with WHO. Results of product testing and raw
     data are sent to WHO and reviewed in detail by the Scheme Secretariat and the IAC. Potential discrepancies
     are identified and cross-checked against laboratory bench sheets.

Evaluation procedure

Initial screening of dossiers
Evaluation of HWT products under the Scheme is based on manufacturers voluntarily submitting an expression
of interest (EoI) and product dossier to WHO. The dossier should contain information describing the product
and its specifications, its operation and maintenance, evidence of user uptake and strategies for reaching the
underserved and those most in need. Invitations to interested manufacturers to submit EoIs are published on
the WHO website and through various listservs. The criteria for manufacturers eligible for submitting an EoI
are as follows:

• An established manufacturing process for market-ready HWT products;

• Evidence of quality management systems;

• Use of materials of known composition with well-described safety properties; and

• Robust and tested operation and use instructions (that are used as the basis for developing product-specific
  test plans).

Evaluation under the Scheme is fee-based. Subsidies are awarded by WHO subject to the availability of funds.
The criteria for determining whether a manufacturer is eligible for a subsidy are outlined in the Procedure for
Evaluation (WHO, 2018b).

Products prioritized for evaluation under the Scheme are relatively low cost, appropriate for low- and middle-
income settings; generally free-standing and not requiring installation; and able to treat enough water a day to
serve the number of individuals typically in a household or small public facility such as a tertiary health care
centre. EoIs that meet these initial screening criteria are selected for review by the Scheme Secretariat with
input and advice from the IAC.


Dossier review
The dossier review seeks to determine whether HWT products meet the WHO performance recommendations.
Product data and information on safety, performance and user testing as well as production and manufacturing
quality control processes are considered. Key criteria include the following:

• Do the existing laboratory data demonstrate that the product meets WHO microbiological performance
  criteria for all three classes of pathogens?

• Are the testing protocols and test methods used comparable to those of the Scheme?

• Is there sufficient evidence to demonstrate the independence of the testing laboratory and quality management
  procedures employed?




                                                                                                                   65
     • Is there demonstrated uptake of the product, for example, through field studies of acceptability or reported
       sales volumes?

     Depending on the extent to which a product meets these criteria, the IAC makes one of three possible
     recommendations:

     1. Full laboratory testing: criteria have not been met and testing against all three pathogen classes at one of the
        Scheme designated testing laboratories is required;

     2. Abbreviated laboratory testing and desk review of existing data: criteria have been partially met, and a combination
        of testing against one or two of the pathogen classes at one of the Scheme designated testing laboratories
        and review of existing data is required; or

     3. Desk review of existing data: the criteria have been fully met and no laboratory testing under the Scheme is
        required.

     WHO has developed technology-specific testing protocols that are adapted by the laboratories to create specific
     product needs and use requirements. WHO reviews these product-specific testing protocols and shares these
     with the manufacturer for comment before testing commences.

     With input from the IAC, WHO communicates the outcome of the evaluation to the manufacturer. A list of all
     evaluated products, their performance level and the relevant test protocols for each of the technology classes
     is published on the WHO website.
