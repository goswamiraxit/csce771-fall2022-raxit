Foreword

Legionellosis is a collection of infections that emerged in the second half of the 20th century,
and that are caused by Legionella pneumophila and related Legionella bacteria. The severity of
legionellosis varies from mild febrile illness (Pontiac fever) to a potentially fatal form of pneumonia
(Legionnaires’ disease) that can affect anyone, but principally affects those who are susceptible
due to age, illness, immunosuppression or other risk factors, such as smoking. Water is the
major natural reservoir for legionellae, and the bacteria are found worldwide in many different
natural and artificial aquatic environments, such as cooling towers; water systems in hotels,
homes, ships and factories; respiratory therapy equipment; fountains; misting devices; and
spa pools. About 20% of the cases of legionellosis detected in Europe are considered to be travel-
related; these cases present a particular set of problems because of difficulties in identifying
the source of infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) currently provides guidance on Legionella risk assessment
and management in three principal documents:
• Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004)
• Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments (WHO, 2006)
• Guide to Ship Sanitation (WHO, 2007).
As part of the ongoing review of the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, specific micro-
organisms and chemicals are periodically evaluated, and documentation relating to protection
and control of drinking-water quality is prepared. In 2001, a meeting was held in Adelaide,
Australia, to discuss approaches to regulating microbial drinking-water quality, and development
of risk assessment and risk management approaches, for incorporation into the 3rd edition of
the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004). At that meeting, health concerns relating
to Legionella were identified as an area of increasing public and professional interest. The
meeting recommended the development of this publication — Legionella and the Prevention of
Legionellosis — to review the current state of knowledge about the impact of Legionella on health.
This book provides a comprehensive overview of the sources, ecology and laboratory identification
of Legionella. It provides guidance on assessment and management of risks associated with
potentially hazardous environments, such as cooling towers, pools and spa baths. The document
also identifies necessary measures to prevent, or adequately control, the risk of exposure to
Legionella bacteria for each particular environment. Outbreaks of legionellosis generally cause
a high level of morbidity and mortality in the people exposed; therefore, the suspicion of an
outbreak warrants immediate action. This publication reviews policies and practice for outbreak
management and the institutional roles and responsibilities of an outbreak control team.

The development of this publication was guided by the recommendations of an expert meeting
hosted by the Health Protection Agency’s Centre for Infections (formerly the Central Public
Health Laboratory), Colindale, London, on 18–20 June 2002, chaired by Dr John V Lee. It was
also guided by a series of critical reviews undertaken by specialists in the field.
The production of this document was led by the Department of Public Health and Environment
— Programme on Assessing and Managing Environmental Risks to Health at WHO, in
cooperation with the Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response at WHO.
This book will be useful to all those concerned with Legionella and health, including environmental
and public health officers, health-care workers, the travel industry, researchers and special
interest groups.

Executive summary

Legionellosis is a collection of infections that emerged in the second half of the 20th century,
and that are caused by Legionella pneumophila and related bacteria. The severity of legionellosis
varies from mild febrile illness (Pontiac fever) to a potentially fatal form of pneumonia
(Legionnaires’ disease) that can affect anyone, but principally affects those who are susceptible
due to age, illness, immunosuppression and other risk factors, such as smoking.
Legionella is an important pathogen in health‑care acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia, particularly
in immunocompromised patients. Legionella spp. can also cause community‑acquired pneumonia,
which has a high rate of hospital admission. Legionnaires’ disease is recognized as a major
form of travel-associated pneumonia, and about 20% of the cases of legionellosis detected in
Europe are considered to be related to travel; these cases present a particular set of problems
because of difficulties in identifying the source of infection. Although Legionella is a well-
recognized problem in developed nations, data are scarce from developing countries. Since
risk environments and susceptible populations are found worldwide, it is likely that the
problem of Legionella is under-appreciated in developing countries.
Chapter 1 describes the disease types caused by Legionella bacteria, including risk factors, prevalence
and outcomes of Legionnaires’ disease. Although all Legionella species are considered
potentially pathogenic for humans, Legionella pneumophila is the aetiological agent responsible
for most reported cases of Legionnaires’ disease.
Chapter 2 discusses the ecology and environmental sources of Legionella. Water is the major
natural reservoir for legionellae, and the bacteria are found worldwide in many different natural
and artificial aquatic environments and ranges of environmental conditions, such as cooling
towers; water systems in hotels, homes, ships and factories; respiratory therapy equipment;
fountains; misting devices; and spa pools.
The fact that legionellae are found in hot-water tanks or thermally polluted rivers emphasizes
that water temperature is a crucial factor in the colonization of water distribution systems.
L. pneumophila has been shown to be able to withstand temperatures of 50 °C for several hours,
but does not multiply below 20 °C (Fliermans, Soracco & Pope, 1981; Katz & Hammond,
1987; Colbourne et al., 1988; Bentham 1993). It is for this reason that the recommended
temperature for storage and distribution of cold water is below 25 °C and ideally below 20 °C.
Thus, the presence of Legionella in an aquatic environment and warm temperatures are two
factors that can increase the risk of Legionnaires’ disease.
The presence of biofilms is important for Legionella survival and growth in water systems.
Legionellae are found in sources such as distributed drinking-water supplies, which then feed
into water systems within buildings and cooling towers, accounting for the bacteria’s presence
and subsequent growth in these artificial environments.

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                     xxi
Chapter 3 discusses risk management of Legionella. The public health risk posed by legionellosis
can be addressed by preventive measures — although the source of infection cannot be
completely eradicated, risks can be substantially reduced. The preferred approach to health
risk assessment in evaluating specific risks of exposure to Legionella from water systems is to
develop a water safety plan (WSP), which provides a detailed and systematic assessment and
prioritization of hazards, and operational monitoring of barriers and control measures.
Chapter 3 outlines the process involved in developing a WSP to minimise proliferation of
Legionella and exposure to the organism.
Chapters 4–8 are structured around the concept of a WSP. They are not intended to comprehensively
address the WSP approach outlined in Chapter 3; rather, these chapters summarise the general
principles and factors one would need to focus on in developing a WSP for the control of
Legionella in the different environments and operating scenarios covered.
• Potable water distribution systems — Chapter 4 covers factors affecting microbial growth
  in potable water systems and in‑building distribution systems. Distributed water is likely
  to contain some microorganisms, including legionellae. It is therefore reasonable to assume
  that all systems that use water could be seeded with microorganisms during construction,
  repair and maintenance, even if the water is treated. Risk factors that can promote the
  proliferation of legionellae include temperature, water quality, design, material used in
  construction and the presence of biofilms. The focus of attention in managing legionellae
  risks should be on preventing both proliferation and exposure. Therefore, Chapter 4 suggests
  control measures ranging from source water quality and treatment of source water to
  design of systems to prevent stagnation and control of temperature to minimise proliferation.
• Cooling towers and evaporative condensers — Cooling towers and evaporative condensers
  have historically been implicated in numerous outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease. Chapter 5
  discusses the risk factors and management of cooling towers and evaporative condensers.
  Globally, the primary legionellae associated with outbreaks of disease from these systems
  appear to be L. pneumophila serogroup 1 MAb2 reactive strains. The major risk factor for
  legionellae proliferation appears to be neglect or insufficient maintenance. A significant
  proportion of outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease in these systems have been attributable
  to the start-up of stagnant systems without adequate chemical treatment. Cooling towers
  and evaporative condensers are generally designed to maximize operational performance
  of a thermal system; however, Chapter 5 spells out the importance of an effective water
  treatment programme in controlling legionellae proliferation. Such a programme has multiple
  benefits, in that it provides for more efficient operation from reduced fouling and a longer
  system life from reduced corrosion, while ensuring safer operation of the system due to
  reduced risk of legionellosis. Maintenance of properly treated cooling systems is also an
  essential element in reducing legionellae risks in these environments.

• Health‑care facilities — Chapter 6 focuses on nosocomial cases of Legionnaires’ disease,
  which tend to have a high case–fatality rate (the mortality rate can be as high as 40%),
  although they comprise a smaller proportion of reported cases of legionellosis than community-
  acquired cases. Underlying disease is a major risk factor for acquiring Legionnaires’
  disease. Initially, cooling towers were thought to be the main source of legionellae in
  health-care facilities, but many cases have been associated with piped hot and cold-water
  distribution systems. Maintenance of temperatures outside the 20–50 °C range in the
  network is the best way to prevent colonization of Legionella in distribution systems.
• Hotels and ships — Chapter 7 considers piped water systems of hotels, which are particularly
  susceptible to colonization by legionellae because of their large size, their complexity and
  their seasonal use patterns (which mean they may have long periods of stagnation and low
  use). Preventive and control measures follow the same procedures identified for other
  buildings; for example, they involve removing dead and blind ends, maintaining elevated
  temperatures in the hot-water system, and periodic disinfection and permanent chlorination
  of the cold-water system.
   Chapter 7 also covers ships, which, like hotels, have complex water systems, and are difficult
   to link to outbreaks or cases because passengers have usually dispersed before developing
   symptoms. Ships also present particular challenges, as they are closed environments that
   may increase the opportunity for transmission of airborne infection. Hot and cold-water
   systems and spa pools have been implicated in a number of outbreaks of Legionnaires’
   disease on ships.
• Natural spas, hot tubs and swimming pools — Chapter 8 covers these devices. Although there
  are no recorded outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease associated with bathing in swimming
  pools, there is a risk of legionellosis from showers in the vicinity of pools, and these
  should be managed as for hot and cold distribution systems in public buildings.
   Thermal water systems, including hot tubs and display spas, have been responsible for
   large outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease. Hot tubs are a particular risk, due to the warm
   water temperature (optimal for the growth of legionellae), high bather density, conditions
   that increase the risk of nutrients for bacterial growth, areas of pipework that do not
   receive disinfection from the pool water or hold stagnant water, and the potential to
   inhale aerosols at a short distance from the water surface. Design, installation, management
   and maintenance of these water systems must be undertaken with control of microbial
   growth in mind. Disinfection, cleaning, monitoring and regular service and maintenance
   are key factors in controlling Legionella.
Chapter 9 focuses on surveillance for Legionnaires’ disease, which is now a statutory notifiable
disease in most industrialized countries. National surveillance depends on the country’s
infrastructure and public health laws, and on surveillance principles and procedures. Because

of the impact Legionnaires’ disease can have on tourism, the priority may be greater than local
morbidity and mortality suggests. The chapter provides information on surveillance systems;
it also gives guidance on policies and practice for outbreak management, and on institutional
roles and responsibilities when an outbreak control team is convened.
Chapter 10 considers regulatory aspects of controlling Legionella in water systems and preventing
legionellosis. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations,
identifying sources of infection, issuing public advice and limiting the scale and recurrence
of outbreaks. Notification and investigation systems can be incorporated within regulations,
which generally have a number of common features. The chapter also gives guidance on designing
new regulations, emphasizing the key features that need to be considered, such as managerial
responsibilities; registration and notification; system assessment and design; operational
monitoring and verification; documentation of management plans and record keeping; and
surveillance and audit. It also covers inclusion of specific regulations to deal with responses to
outbreaks.
Chapter 11 covers laboratory aspects. Accurate diagnosis of Legionella is important, because timely
and appropriate therapy is the key to improving patient outcomes. The chapter reviews the
five methods currently used for the laboratory diagnosis of Legionella infections — isolation
of the organism on culture media, paired serology, detection of antigens in urine, demonstration
of the bacterium in tissue or body fluids using immunofluorescence microscopy, and detection
of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using the polymerase chain reaction.

In 1976, an outbreak of severe pneumonia among the participants of the American Legion
Convention in Philadelphia led to the description of Legionnaires’ disease by Fraser et al.
(1977). The disease was found to be caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila (Legionella
after the legionnaires who were infected at the convention; pneumophila meaning “lung-
loving”), belonging to the family Legionellaceae. The generic term “legionellosis” is now used
to describe these bacterial infections, which can range in severity from a mild, febrile illness
(Pontiac fever) to a rapid and potentially fatal pneumonia (Legionnaires’ disease). Legionella
has been retrospectively identified as the cause of outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease since
1947 (Terranova, Cohen & Fraser, 1978; McDade, Brenner & Bozeman, 1979).
Legionellosis emerged because of human alteration of the environment, since Legionella
species are found in aquatic environments, and thrive in warm water and warm, damp places,
such as cooling towers. Cases can be usefully grouped by the way in which they were acquired,
as community acquired, domestically acquired, nosocomial (acquired in a health-care setting,
or “health‑care acquired”) or travel associated.
This chapter describes:
• the characteristics of the main types of disease caused by Legionella (Section 1.1)
• the prevalence of Legionella and risk factors for disease (Section 1.2)
• treatment options (Section 1.3)
• the main types of organism causing legionellosis (Section 1.4)
• the factors affecting the pathogenicity of the causative organisms (their ability to cause
  disease) and their virulence (the degree of that ability, indicated by the mortality rate from
  the disease, or the organisms’ ability to invade tissues) (Section 1.5).

1.1 Types of disease
This section describes the characteristics of Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever and extrapulmonary
syndrome (caused when L. pneumophila spreads from the respiratory system to the body).

1.1.1 Legionnaires’ disease

Symptoms
Legionnaires’ disease lacks characteristic symptoms or signs — there is no typical syndrome,
and not everyone exposed to the organism will develop symptoms of the disease (Yu et al.,
1982; Macfarlane et al., 1984; Granados et al., 1989; Roig et al., 1991; Sopena et al., 1998;
Ruiz et al., 1999; Gupta, Imperiale & Sarosi, 2001). However, several clinical signs are classically
associated with Legionnaires’ disease rather than with other causes of pneumonia. Table 1.1
(below) lists the most common symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever.

                                          LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Legionnaires’ disease is often initially characterized by anorexia, malaise and lethargy;
also, patients may develop a mild and unproductive cough. About half of patients develop
pus‑forming sputum, and about one third develop blood-streaked sputum or cough up blood
(haemoptysis). Chest pain, whether pleuritic (i.e. involving infection of the lung lining) or
non-pleuritic, is prominent in about 30% of patients, and may be mistaken for blood clots
in the lungs when associated with haemoptysis. Gastrointestinal symptoms are prominent,
with up to half of patients having watery diarrhoea, and 10–30% suffering nausea, vomiting
and abdominal pains. Fever is present in almost all cases, and fever associated with chills usually
develops within the first day (see references for Table 1.1).
Almost half of patients suffer from disorders related to the nervous system, such as confusion,
delirium, depression, disorientation and hallucinations. These disorders may occur in the first
week of the disease. Physical examination may reveal fine or coarse tremors of the extremities,
hyperactive reflexes, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and signs of cerebral dysfunction. The
clinical syndrome may be more subtle in immunocompromised patients.

Radiographic changes
The radiographic pattern of Legionnaires’ disease is indistinguishable from that seen in other
causes of pneumonia (Mülazimoglu & Yu, 2001). Radiological changes are visible from the third
day after disease onset, usually beginning as an accumulation of fluid in part of the lung, which
can progress to the other lobes, forming a mass or nodule. Diffuse accumulation of fluid
occurs in the lungs of about one quarter of patients. Chest X‑rays of immunocompromised
patients receiving corticosteroids may show clearly defined areas of opacity around lung edges,
which may be mistaken for pulmonary infarction. Abscesses can develop in immunosuppressed
patients and, in rare cases, abscesses may penetrate the pleural space, causing pus formation
(empyema) or a bronchopleural fistula (a hole between the bronchus and lung lining, allowing
air to leak). Lung cavitation may occur up to 14 days after initial disease onset, even after appropriate
antibiotic therapy and apparent clinical response. Pleural effusion (the collection of fluid inside
the chest cavity around the lung) is reported in one third of legionellosis cases, and may
occasionally precede the radiographical appearance of fluid accumulation within the lung.
Chest X‑rays show progression of fluid accumulation, despite appropriate antibiotic therapy,
in about 30% of cases; however, this does not necessarily indicate a progressive disease (Domingo
et al., 1991). Instead, the spread indicates failure of treatment in association with simultaneous
clinical deterioration.
Abnormalities may persist on X‑ray for an unusually long time, even after the patient shows
substantial clinical improvement; clearance rates of 60% at 12 weeks have been reported
(Macfarlane et al., 1984; Stout & Yu, 1997; Yu, 2002).

Long-term effects
If untreated, Legionnaires’ disease usually worsens during the first week and can be fatal. The
most frequent complications are respiratory failure, shock and acute renal and multi‑organ failure.
Appropriate early treatment usually results in full recovery; however, long-term pathological
conditions resulting from the disease (sequelae) may occur. Minor problems may include
persistent pulmonary scars and restrictive pulmonary disease in some patients who experience
severe respiratory failure. In severe infections, there are often general secondary symptoms, such
as weakness, poor memory and fatigue, which can last for several months. Other neurological
deficits that can arise from severe infection include residual cerebellar dysfunction (Baker,
Farrell & Hutchinson, 1981), retrograde amnesia, and cerebellar signs and symptoms (Edelstein
& Meyer, 1984), although retrograde amnesia is the only one of these deficits to be noted
relatively frequently.

Incubation period
The incubation period is the time interval between initial exposure to infection and the appearance
of the first symptom or sign of disease. The average incubation period of Legionnaires’ disease
is 2–10 days (WHO, 2004), although it may extend to even longer than 10 days. An epidemiological
study of a major outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease associated with a flower show in the Netherlands
found that 16% of cases had incubation times longer than 10 days, with the average being
7 days (Den Boer et al., 2002; Lettinga et al., 2002).

Diagnosis and treatment
Attempts to establish predictive scores that identify Legionella pneumonia in individual patients
have been unsuccessful. Although several clinical signs and symptoms have been described as
characteristic of legionellosis (as outlined above), there is a considerable overlap of symptoms for
Legionnaires’ disease and Legionella pneumonia. This overlap makes it difficult to develop a
checklist of characteristics for diagnosing individual patients infected with Legionella (Gupta,
Imperiale & Sarosi, 2001; Mülazimoglu & Yu, 2001; Roig & Rello, 2003).
In targeting antibiotic therapy, it is best not to rely on diagnosis of a syndrome if there is no
microbiological diagnosis. Generally, the recommended approach for all patients with pneumonia
acquired in the community is an initial trial antimicrobial treatment, based on assessment of
pneumonia severity and host-related risk factors (see Section 1.3).

Causative agents
Legionnaires’ disease is usually caused by L. pneumophila, but in some cases one or more additional
organisms may also be involved, resulting in a mixed (polymicrobial) infection. Culture of
these co-infectors has revealed a wide spectrum of organisms, including aerobic bacteria (those
that require free or dissolved oxygen, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis), anaerobic bacteria
(those from environments without such oxygen), viruses and fungi (Roig & Rello, 2003).
Section 1.4 discusses the causative agents in more detail.

1.1.2 Pontiac fever

Symptoms
Pontiac fever is an acute, self-limiting, influenza-like illness without pneumonia (that is, it is
“non-pneumonic”). Unlike Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever has a high attack rate, affecting
up to 95% of exposed individuals (Glick et al., 1978). The main symptoms are listed in
Table 1.1.

Radiographic changes and long-term effects
Chest X‑rays are normal, and recovery within one week is usual.

Incubation period
The incubation period is 24–48 hours.

Diagnosis and treatment
Treatment is supportive and aimed at relieving symptoms; complications rarely occur.

Causative agents
Depending on the causative agent, Pontiac fever may, in rare cases, not be as benign as previously
thought (Jones et al., 2003). For example, Spieker et al. (1998) reported a case of acute
disseminating encephalomyelitis that developed three weeks after a flu-like infection (Pontiac
fever) with L. cincinnatiensis. Pontiac fever has also been associated with production of endotoxins
(Fields et al., 2001).
Endotoxins can be extremely toxic to people, producing fever, shock and even death. It is not
uncommon to find endotoxin associated with high heterotrophic plate counts (tests used to
estimate the total number of all types of bacteria in an environmental sample). Therefore,
further study is needed to establish whether endotoxin has a role in causing Pontiac fever
where legionellae are also present. An outbreak in Scotland with Pontiac fever symptoms was
caused by L. micdadei, and was named Lochgoilhead fever (Goldberg et al., 1989). Section 1.4
discusses the causative agents in more detail.

1.1.3 Extrapulmonary syndromes
It has been shown by autopsy that L. pneumophila can spread from the respiratory system to
the body. Legionellae have been detected in the spleen, liver, kidney, myocardium, bone and
bone marrow, joints, inguinal and intrathoracic lymph nodes and digestive tract (Lowry &
Tompkins, 1993).
Table 1.2 provides details of cases of extrapulmonary syndromes associated with Legionella species.

Symptoms
The clinical manifestations of extrapulmonary Legionella infections are often dramatic. Legionella
have been implicated in cases of sinusitis, cellulitis, pancreatitis, peritonitis and pyelonephritis,
most often in immunocompromised patients (Eitrem, Forsgren & Nilsson, 1987; Stout &
Yu, 1997). Lowry & Tompkins (1993) reported 13 extrapulmonary infections, including
brain abscesses and sternal wound infections. The most commonly affected site is the heart
(e.g. myocarditis, pericarditis, postcardiomyotomy syndrome and endocarditis) (Stout & Yu,
1997). Endocarditis due to Legionella spp. has been cited in only a few publications, and in
all reported cases patients had a prosthetic valve (McCabe et al., 1984; Tompkins et al., 1988;
Chen, Schapiro & Loutit, 1996). The patients showed low‑grade fever, night sweats, weight
loss, malaise, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and vegetation on echocardiography
(Brouqui & Raoult, 2001). Legionella rarely spreads into the nervous system; more frequently,
it leads to neurological manifestations of encephalomyelitis, cerebellum involvement and
peripheral neuropathy (Shelburne, Kielhofner & Tiwari, 2004). Legionella meningoencephalitis
may mimic the symptoms of herpes encephalitis (Karim, Ahmed & Rossoff, 2002).

Diagnosis
Legionellosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients showing a combination
of neurological, cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in the presence of radiographic
pneumonia (Shelburne, Kielhofner & Tiwari, 2004).

Causative agent
Among the four species of Legionella responsible for extrapulmonary infections, L. pneumophila
was the most commonly isolated bacteria (Lowry & Tompkins, 1993).

1.2 Prevalence and risk factors
The exact incidence of legionellosis worldwide is unknown, because countries differ greatly
in the methods they use for ascertaining whether someone has the infection and in reporting
of cases. Also, the reported incidence of Legionnaires’ disease varies widely according to the
intensity of investigation and the diagnostic methodology applied (as discussed in Chapter 9).
Table 1.3 provides some useful definitions for epidemiological monitoring, used throughout
this publication. Table 1.4 shows European cases, by category, from 1994 to 2004.

1.2.1 Community-acquired pneumonia
The term “community-acquired pneumonia” (CAP) refers to cases that are not acquired through
travel, health care or the domestic setting. CAPs have a high rate of hospital admission, with
less than 1% being managed at home. Legionnaires’ disease can account for up to 30% of
CAPs requiring admission to intensive care (Woodhead et al., 1987; Macfarlane et al., 1993).
In recent studies involving hospitalized patients with CAP in the United States of America
(USA), Europe, Israel and Australia, 0.5–10% had Legionnaires’ disease, with an average
level of about 2% (NHMRC, 1988; Fang et al., 1990; Rello et al., 1993; Mundy et al., 1995;
Olaechea et al., 1996; Marston et al., 1997; Stout and Yu, 1997; Boldur et al., 1999; Cosentini

is higher for Legionnaires’ disease than for other causes; consequently, there is a higher mortality
rate (Ewig & Torres, 1999).

1.2.2 Nosocomial infections
Box 1.1 gives details of the classifications used for nosocomial Legionnaires’ disease.


  Box 1.1 Classifications of nosocomial Legionnaires’ disease
  • Definite nosocomial — Legionnaires’ disease in a person who was in hospital for
    10 days before the onset of symptoms.
  • Probable nosocomial — Legionnaires’ disease in a person who was in hospital for
    1–9 of the 10 days before the onset of symptoms, and either became ill in a hospital
    associated with one or more previous cases of Legionnaires’ disease, or yielded an
    isolate that was indistinguishable (by monoclonal antibody subgrouping or by molecular
    typing methods) from isolates obtained from the hospital water system at about the
    same time.
  • Possible nosocomial — Legionnaires’ disease in a person who was in hospital for
    1–9 of the 10 days before the onset of symptoms in a hospital not previously known
    to be associated with any case of Legionnaires’ disease, and where no microbiological
    link has been established between the infection and the hospital (or the residential
    institution).

Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia are:
• recent surgery
• intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea to assist breathing) and mechanical ventilation
• aspiration (the presence of foreign matter, such as food or nasogastric tubes, in the lung)
• use of respiratory therapy equipment.




10                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Aspiration may occur in patients with immunosuppression or swallowing disorders (e.g. after
an operation on the neck) (Stout & Yu, 1997). Nasogastric tubes have been identified as risk
factors in several studies of nosocomial legionellosis, with microaspiration of contaminated
water presumed to be the mode of entry (Marrie et al., 1991; Blatt et al., 1994; Stout & Yu,
1997).
Patients suffering from Legionnaires’ disease are significantly more likely to have undergone
endotracheal tube placement or to have been intubated for longer than patients with other
types of pneumonia (Muder et al., 1983; Strebel et al., 1988; Kool et al., 1998). However, a
recent study failed to detect colonization of the oesophageal tract by Legionella (Pedro-Botet
et al., 2002).
Wound infection may be caused by direct entry of legionellae into damaged skin, and has
been observed after immersion of a wound in contaminated water (Brabender et al., 1983;
Lowry et al., 1991). However, there is no evidence to support pulmonary disease arising from
wound infection. Although cases of infection have been reported among pregnant women
(which could increase their risk of premature labour), pregnancy is not considered a risk factor
for legionellosis (Roig & Rello, 2003). The most susceptible hosts are immunocompromised
patients, including solid-organ transplant recipients and those receiving corticosteroid treatments
(Arnow et al., 1982; Strebel et al., 1988).
Tables 1.5 and 1.6 identify the risk factors for Legionella infection.

1.2.3 Sporadic cases of pneumonia
Sporadic cases are isolated or unique cases. Severe Legionella infections have occurred among
previously healthy people, including young people without underlying disease, and those
without other known risk factors (Falguera et al., 2001). The role of Legionella in causing an
acute increase in the severity of symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unclear
(Ewig, 2002).

Taking France as an example, 807 cases of Legionnaires’ disease were notified by the French National
Public Health Centre in 2001. In 558 of these cases, predisposing factors included:
• cancer or blood disease (11%)
• immunosuppressant treatment (12%)
• diabetes (10%)
• smoking (40%).
In 2001, 14% of the cases (105 cases) stayed in a hospital or a clinic during the incubation
period, compared with 20% in 2000. An exposure to risk within the 10 days before the onset
of the disease was reported for 335 patients (42%) (see Table 1.7).

1.2.4 Rates of mortality and survival
The case–fatality rate depends on the severity of disease, how it was acquired, timely determination
through diagnostic methods of whether or not a person is infected with the disease (ascertainment
of infection), the appropriateness and timing of initial antimicrobial treatment, and other
risk factors present (Tkatch et al., 1998; Fernandez et al., 2002; Garcia-Fulgueiras et al., 2003;
Roson et al., 2004; Edelstein & Cianciotto, 2005).




14                                               LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
In the outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in Philadelphia in 1976, 34 out of 182 patients (18.7%)
died (Fraser et al., 1977). Subsequently, average mortality has been confirmed to be about
15–20% of hospitalized cases (Edelstein & Meyer, 1984; Guerin, 1992; Roig & Rello, 2003).
In the USA, the case–fatality rate was recorded as up to 40% in nosocomial cases, compared
with 20% among people with community-acquired legionellosis (CDC, 1997a). More recent
data from the USA and Australia showed case–fatality rates of 14% for nosocomial infections
and 5–10% for community-acquired infections (Benin et al., 2002; Howden et al., 2003). In
Europe, the overall case–fatality rate is about 12%.
Early ascertainment is an important factor for patient survival. In the largest recorded
outbreak, which occurred in Murcia, Spain, there were 449 confirmed cases, but the case–
fatality rate was only 1% (Garcia-Fulgueiras et al., 2003). This low fatality rate was probably
due to the clinicians’ awareness of legionellosis risk, as well as recognition that survival and
recovery depend on timely intervention and the correct choice of antimicrobial therapy,
particularly in severe cases (Tkatch et al., 1998; Gacouin et al., 2002; Roig & Rello, 2003).
Advanced age and comorbidity are predictors of death by Legionnaires’ disease. One study
evaluated prognostic factors of severe Legionella pneumonia cases admitted to an intensive
care unit (el Ebiary et al., 1997). In that study, the only independent factor related to death
was an APACHE score greater than 15 at admission (APACHE — acute physiology and
chronic health evaluation — is an algorithm for predicting hospital mortality). Cunha (1998)
has also published a scoring system, based on clinical signs of Legionnaires’ disease and
laboratory abnormalities.

1.3 Treatment of Legionnaires’ disease
Diagnostic tests
Tests for Legionnaires’ disease should ideally be performed for all patients with pneumonia at
risk, including those who are seriously ill, whether or not they have clinical features suggesting
legionellosis. Tests for Legionnaires’ disease should also be performed for patients displaying
symptoms that do not match any other diagnosis, and particularly on ill patients who are
older than 40 years, immunosuppressed, or unresponsive to beta-lactam antibiotics, or who
might have been exposed to Legionella during an outbreak (Bartlett et al., 1998). Urine antigen
tests, and cultures of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (washing the bronchial tubes and alveoli
with repeated injections of water), are the most suitable clinical tests for Legionella. Chapter 11
discusses diagnostic laboratory tests for Legionella.

Evaluation of antimicrobial agents
When extracellular, legionellae are susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. However,
in an infection, where the microorganism is inside the cell; the only antimicrobial agents that
are clinically useful are those that achieve high intracellular concentrations. Therefore, new
drugs have to be evaluated in regard to:
• their minimum inhibitory concentration values against Legionella spp.
• their activity in cellular culture systems
• their activity in animal studies
• the clinical context.

Suggested treatments
Only a few small, controlled clinical studies of antibiotic treatment for Legionnaires’ disease
have been completed; hence, the evidence for treatment recommendations is limited (Thornsberry,
Baker & Kirven, 1978; Yoo et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004). One small clinical study showed
that treatment with fluoroquinolone pefloxacin gives patients a higher survival rate than
treatment with erythromycin (Dournon et al., 1990).
The new macrolide antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, show more effective
in-vitro activity and a better intracellular and tissue penetration than erythromycin, as do the
quinolones. Beta-lactam antibiotics are not effective against Legionnaires’ disease, but are the
first choice of antibiotics for pneumococcal pneumonia, and are used together with macrolides
to treat severe pneumonia. Where a rapid diagnostic test for Legionnaires’ disease is not in
use, many people presenting with this disease are simply treated with macrolides plus beta-
lactam antibiotics, because a delay in the application of appropriate therapy for Legionella
pneumonia significantly increases mortality (Stout & Yu, 1997).
Table 1.8 lists the various treatments for different groups of patients with Legionnaires’ disease.

Parenteral therapy is usually given at least until there is a clinical response, although outpatients
with mild disease do well with oral therapy. Most patients recover from fever within 3–5 days.
Total duration of treatment is normally 10–14 days (5–10 days for azithromycin), but a
21‑day course has been recommended for immunosuppressed patients, as well as for those
with severe disease (e.g. extensive evidence of disease on chest radiographs). However, chest
X‑rays are not effective for monitoring the success of the therapy (see Section 1.1.1).

Adverse effects
The principal adverse effects of a macrolide treatment include gastrointestinal symptoms,
such as diarrhoea and vomiting, and effects on the ears (when given in high doses). Relatively
frequently, the respiratory fluoroquinolones cause adverse effects such as gastrointestinal
symptoms and central nervous system disturbances. Alteration to the electrocardiogram
(ECG or EKG) (i.e. prolongation of the QT interval — the duration of the contraction of the
heart’s main chambers) precludes the use of these quinolones in patients with severe electrolyte
imbalances, irregular heartbeats or severe congestive heart failure. Erythromycin has also been
reported to cause ventricular fibrillation (disorganized twitching of the heart muscle) and QT
prolongation, and should be used with caution in patients with heart disease, especially when the
drug is rapidly administered into the bloodstream via a central venous catheter.

1.4 Types of organism causing disease

1.4.1 Taxonomy
Since Legionnaires’ disease was recognized, characterization of the strains isolated from patients
has led to the creation of a new bacterial genus, Legionella, belonging to the family Legionellaceae
(Brenner, Steigerwalt & McDade, 1979). Some investigators (Garrity, Brown & Vickers, 1980;
Brown, Garrity & Vickers, 1981) have proposed placing the legionellae in three separate
genera — Legionella, Fluoribacter and Tatlockia — on the basis of low DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) hybridization values between some Legionella species (Fox & Brown, 1993). However,
other studies have shown that the family Legionellaceae forms a single subgroup, sharing a common
ancestor within the gamma‑s subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Data using 16S ribosomal
RNA (ribonucleic acid) analysis support a single family, showing that all legionellae studied
are more than 95% related (Fry et al., 1991).
Within the genus Legionella, the DNA relatedness between strains of a given species is unusually
high (>90%), whereas DNA relatedness between one species and another is less than 70%
(Brenner, 1986). Many definitions for bacterial genera and species have been suggested; however,
it is likely that the integrated use of phylogenetic and phenotypic characters is necessary for
the delineation of bacterial taxa at all levels (Murray et al, 1990). The nearest genetic relative
to Legionellaceae is Coxiella burnetti (Marti, Garcia & Bustillo, 1990), the cause of Q fever.
The Legionellacae and C. burnetti have similar intracellular lifestyles, and may have common
genes associated with the infection processes in their hosts.

1.4.2 Species and serogroups associated with disease

Number of species and serogroups
The “type” or representative species of Legionella is L. pneumophila, because it was the first species
to be described. The number of species, subspecies and serogroups of legionellae continues to
increase. Although L. pneumophila causes most cases of Legionnaires’ disease, other species
can also cause the disease, particularly in nosocomial cases. The genus Legionella currently has at
least 50 species comprising 70 distinct serogroups. These serogroups and their clinical manifestations
are shown in Table 1.9 (Drozanski, 1991; Hookey et al., 1996; Riffard et al., 1996; Fry & Harrison,
1998; Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002; La Scola et al., 2004). There are 16 serogroups of L. pneumophila
— two each in L. bozemanii, L. longbeachae, L. feeleii, L. hackeliae, L. sainthelensi, L. spiritensis,
L. erythra, and L. quinlivanii, and a single serogroup in each of the remaining species.

20                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Other causes of infection
In Europe, approximately 70% of Legionella infections are caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1,
20–30% are caused by other serogroups, and 5–10% are caused by non‑pneumophila species
(Joseph, 2002a).
The majority of human infections with species other than L. pneumophila are pneumonic, and
occur after exposure to Legionella (Fang, Yu & Vickers, 1989). Of the reported non-pneumophila
infections, the causes of infection are (Reingold et al., 1984; Fang, Yu & Vickers, 1989):
• L. micdadei (60%)
• L. bozemanii (15%)
• L. dumoffii (10%)
• L. longbeachae (5%)
• other species (10%).
L. longbeachae has been associated with exposure to potting composts in Australia, the USA
and Japan (Steele, Lanser & Sangster, 1990; Steele, Moore & Sangster, 1990). The mechanisms
of infection from potting compost are not fully understood. Outbreaks of legionellosis
associated with construction or maintenance are likely to be the result of sloughing of biofilms
(the slimy matrices produced and inhabited by bacteria, which enable them to adhere to a
surface) or descaling of plumbing systems caused by changes in water flow or pressure (Storey,
Ashbolt & Stenstrom, 2004b; see Chapter 2 for more information). Recently, it has been
suggested that there may be a spectrum of illness from a single source, with several reports of
outbreaks involving cases of both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever.
Under appropriate conditions, most Legionella that can grow at body temperatures may be able
to cause human infections (Fields, 1996). Infections due to species other than L. pneumophila may
be underdetected, because of a lack of appropriate diagnostic tests (Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002).
The Legionella count alone cannot be used to predict whether a source positive for the bacterium
will cause infection. The likelihood that a source will cause an infection depends on several
factors: the load of bacteria, the effectiveness of dissemination, the way in which the bacteria
multiply and the source’s ability to form aerosols.

Legionella-like amoebal pathogens
Some legionellae cannot be grown on routine Legionella culture media, and have been termed
Legionella-like amoebal pathogens (LLAPs) (see Chapter 11). These organisms have been
isolated and maintained by co-cultivating the bacteria with their protozoan hosts. One LLAP
strain was isolated from the sputum of a pneumonia patient by enrichment in amoebae and
is considered to be a human pathogen (Fry et al., 1999; Marrie et al., 2001). Additional LLAP
strains may be human pathogens, but proving this is difficult, because they cannot be detected
by conventional techniques used for legionellae. Recently, three LLAP strains were named
Legionella species (Adeleke et al., 2001; La Scola et al., 2004).

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                   21
Typing
Helbig et al. (1995) suggested that differences in the virulence of Legionella species or serogroups
are associated with different epitopes within the bacterial cell wall (epitopes are parts of a
foreign organism or its proteins that are recognized by the immune system and targeted by
antibodies, cytotoxic T cells or both). Tests using monoclonal subtyping show that the strains of
L. pneumophila serogroup 1 most commonly associated with disease in humans share a common
epitope (Watkins et al., 1985; Ehret, von Specht & Ruckdeschel, 1986; Dournon et al., 1988).
Depending on the typing scheme used, these strains may be referred to as Pontiac (Watkins
et al., 1985); monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2-reactive (Joly et al., 1986) or MAb 3/1‑positive
(Dresden Panel, 2002; Helbig et al., 2002).
In a European-wide study of L. pneumophila, 1335 cases of Legionnaires’ disease were serotyped,
and monoclonal types of serogroup 1 were grouped according to the presence of the epitope
recognized by MAb 3/1 (Dresden Panel, 2002). Approximately 66.8% of cases were MAb
3/1-positive, and 11.7% of the overall isolates belonged to the MAb 3/1-negative serogroup 1
subgroups. Monoclonal subtype Philadelphia was the most frequently recognized. Most of
the MAb 3/1-negative strains were from nosocomial infections (53.5%), with 27.3% from
community-acquired cases and 14.2% from travel-associated cases (Helbig et al., 2002). The
proportion of MAb 3/1-negative strains was significantly higher in the Scandinavian region
than in Mediterranean countries or the United Kingdom, for both community-acquired and
nosocomial cases.

1.5 Virulence and pathogenicity
Various studies have shown that the pathogenesis and ecology of Legionella are inherently
related. Rowbotham first demonstrated that L. pneumophila could infect amoeba, and characterized
the life cycle of Legionella in amoeba (Rowbotham, 1980). Horwitz’s classical experiments
demonstrated that L. pneumophila multiplied intracellularly in human macrophages by
avoiding phagosome–lysosome fusion (Horwitz, 1983). There are striking similarities in the
processes by which legionella infect protozoa and mammalian phagocytic cells (Bozue &
Johnson 1996; Horwitz 1984, Garduno et al., 2002). The abilities of Legionella to infect mammalian
and protozoan cells are related, using common genes and gene products.

1.5.1 Overview and life‑cycle
The virulence mechanisms of L. pneumophila are complex and not fully understood. Virulence
is an important factor in the ability of L. pneumophila to infect and subsequently multiply
within amoebae (Fields et al., 1986; Moffat & Tompkins, 1992). However, some strains with low
virulence can multiply within certain host cells (Tully, Williams & Fitzgeorge, 1992). Studies
contrasting the role that different virulence factors play in host populations may help to show
how the bacteria develop an ability to infect humans, without the need for a protozoan host.



22                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
The interaction of virulent legionellae with phagocytic cells can be divided into several steps:
• binding of microorganisms to receptors on the surface of eukaryotic cells
• penetration of microorganisms into phagocytes
• escape from bactericidal attack
• formation of a replicative vacuole (a compartment within the cell where bacterial replication
  occurs)
• intracellular multiplication and killing of the host cell.
Legionellae have a similar life‑cycle within protozoa and human macrophages; however, there
are differences in the mechanisms used to enter and exit from the respective host cell types.
These differences are summarized in Figure 1.1. Not all of the species of Legionella that have
been studied are able to infect macrophages. However, L. pneumophila that possess the
relevant virulence factors can infect and replicate within various protozoa found in soil and
in water; and by replicating in this way they may become more virulent (Cianciotto, 2001).

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                               23
Once Legionella enters the lung of an infected person (whether by aerosol or aspiration), both
virulent and non-virulent strains are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and remain
intact inside the phagocytes. However, only virulent strains can multiply inside the phagocytes
and inhibit the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes (Horwitz, 1993). This leads to death of
the macrophage and the release of large numbers of bacteria from the cell. The bacteria can
then infect other macrophages, thereby amplifying bacterial concentrations within the lungs.
The pathogenesis of L. pneumophila has been made clearer by the identification of genes that
allow the organism to bypass the endocytic pathways of both protozoan and human cells,
although not all species investigated have this ability. Ogawa et al. (2001) studied six species
of Legionella in Vero cells (a cell line developed from African green monkey nephrocytes). All
species differed in morphology, implying that Legionella species may differ in their mode of
intracellular multiplication.
During phagocytosis, legionellae initiate a complex cascade of activities, including:
• inhibition of the oxidative burst
• reduction in phagosome acidification
• blocking of phagosome maturation
• changes in organelle trafficking.
Legionellae thus prevent bactericidal activity of the phagocyte, and transform the phagosome
into a niche for their replication (Stout & Yu, 1997; Sturgill-Koszycki & Swanson, 2000;
Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002). The organisms can leave the host cell after temporal pore-
formation-mediated lysis (Molmeret & Abu Kwaik, 2002) or can remain within an encysted
amoeba (Rowbotham, 1986).
Two growth phases were described for one strain of intracellular L. pneumophila: the replicative
non-motile form and the non-multiplicative motile form (Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002).
Intracellular changes, such as host cell amino acid depletion and the subsequent accumulation
of guanosine 3’, 5’-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) (Hammer & Swanson, 1999) resulted in the
expression of stationary-phase proteins in one strain of L. pneumophila (although these findings
may not apply to all strains), as shown in Figure 1.1. The proteins produced facilitate the
infection of new host cells, affecting factors such as sodium sensitivity, cytotoxicity, osmotic
resistance, motility and evasion of phagosome–lysosome fusion (Swanson & Hammer, 2000).
The ability to infect host cells is also influenced by the expression of flagellin (Bosshardt, Benson
& Fields, 1997), although the flagellar protein itself is not a virulence factor (Fields, Benson
& Besser, 2002).

1.5.2 Surface structures involved in pathogenicity
Surface structures play an important role in the pathogenicity of Legionella (Cianciotto, 2001;
Heuner et al., 2002). Adherence followed by entry of the bacterium into the host cell is the
crucial step in the infection cycle. Together with the flagellum and the pili, certain bacterial
surface proteins are involved in the adherence and entry of Legionella into alveolar macrophages
and protozoa. These proteins include:
• the major outer membrane protein (MOMP)
• the heat shock protein (Hsp60)
• the major infectivity potentiator protein.
MOMP binds the complement component C3, and mediates the uptake of L. pneumophila
via macrophage receptors for the complement components CR1 and CR3 (Heuner et al., 2002).
Phagocytosis of L. pneumophila also occurs by a complement-independent mechanism
(Weissgerber et al., 2003).

1.5.3 Virulence factors
Individual biological and immunological factors mediating virulence have not been explicitly
defined (Stout & Yu, 1997; Yu, 2000). However, analysis of the infection process in protozoa
and human host cells has identified certain general factors that may affect virulence, such as:
• expression of multiple proteins during infection of macrophages (Abu, Eisenstein & Engleberg,
  1993)
• expression of certain proteases (Rechnitzer & Kharazmi, 1992; the proteases are thought
  to be important in the pathogenicity of L. pneumophila, but it is not clear whether they
  contribute to virulence)
• plasmids contained in L. pneumophila, which may affect intracellular survival (Bollin et al.,
  1985a; Chien et al., 2004).
One product of Legionella clearly associated with virulence is the 24-kDa macrophage infectivity
potentiator (Mip) protein, coded for by the mip gene (Fields, 1996). The Mip protein is
thought to be conserved throughout the genus (Cianciotto et al., 1989, 1990; Ratcliff et al.,
1998); it is required for efficient infection of both mammalian phagocytic cells and protozoa
(Cianciotto & Fields, 1992), but its mechanism of action is unknown.
The type IV secretion system, a bacterial conjugation system used for transporting and injecting
DNA or toxins into target cells, has a crucial role in the spread of pathogenicity. Within the
loci encoding the type IV secretion systems (dot/icm) are 24 genes essential for infection of
the host cell, and involved in assembling and activating conjugal transfer of plasmid DNA.
L. pneumophila uses these operons to deliver virulence factors and a protein that diverts the



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                               25
phagosome from its endocytic pathway (Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002). Genes such as pilE
(coding for the pilin protein) and pilD (coding for prepilin peptidase) are important for unrestricted
intracellular growth. Other loci involved in intracellular multiplication are mak (macrophage
killing), mil (macrophage-specific infectivity loci), and pmi (protozoan and macrophage infectivity).
Defects in any of these loci obstruct or interrupt intracellular growth (Sadosky, Wiater &
Shuman, 1993; Gao, 1997; Gao, Harb & Kwaik, 1998; Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002).
Tissue-destructive protease is another important factor in the ability of Legionella to cause
infection (Baskerville et al., 1986). Other factors that may increase virulence include several
cytotoxins, heat shock proteins and compounds associated with iron uptake. The stationary
phase response and the iron acquisition functions of L. pneumophila also play key roles in
pathogenesis, as do a number of other loci, including the pts and enh genes (Cianciotto, 2001).
Virulence factors affect the ability of legionellae to grow within protozoa, as seen from studies
showing the effect of incubating a virulent L. pneumophila strain and the corresponding
avirulent strain with an Acanthamoebae polyphaga from a source implicated in an outbreak of
Legionnaires’ disease (Surman, Morton & Keevil, 1999; Surman et al., 2002). Figure 1.2 shows
the organism after overnight incubation at 37 ºC.

1.5.4 Host defence
The host defence against Legionella relies principally on cell-mediated immune mechanisms.
At least two proteins produced by L. pneumophila can induce protective cell-mediated immunity
without being virulence factors — the major secretory protein (MSP, 39 kDa) and the major
outer membrane protein (ompS, 28 kDa) (Blander & Horwitz, 1991). Circulating antibodies
are produced during L. pneumophila infections in humans, but do not seem to be protective.

1.5.5 Transmission
An infected source (e.g. a fountain) can disseminate sprays or droplets of water containing
legionellae, commonly referred to as aerosols. When this occurs, most or all of the water in
the droplet evaporates quickly, leaving airborne particulate matter that is small enough to be
inhaled. Particles of less than 5 µm in diameter can be deeply inhaled, and enter the respiratory
airways to cause legionellosis (Fitzgeorge et al., 1983).
Legionella infections have frequently been associated with sources at distances of up to 3.2 kilometres
(Addiss et al., 1989); recent evidence suggests that infection may be possible at even longer
distances (Tran Minh et al., 2004). There is evidence that virulence is an important factor in
the survival of Legionella in aerosols, with the most virulent strains surviving longer than
their less virulent counterparts (Dennis & Lee, 1988).
There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of either Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac
fever (WHO, 2004).

of Legionella

A good understanding of the factors that affect Legionella survival and growth in the natural
environment is important in controlling the bacteria in artificial water systems. It allows the
areas most at risk from Legionella colonization in such systems to be identified, thereby indicating
the points at which control measures will be most effective; it also allows the control measures
that will be most effective to be identified (see Chapter 3).
This chapter discusses the relationship of Legionella with its natural environment, and provides
information on:
• natural sources of Legionella (Section 2.1)
• factors affecting Legionella growth — water temperature and presence of other microorganisms
  (Section 2.2)
• how the formation of biofilms protects Legionella and supplies nutrients (Section 2.3)
• sources of Legionella infection — aerosols, other water sources and soil (Section 2.4).

2.1 Natural sources of Legionella
Understanding the ecology of Legionella (i.e. the way it interacts with its natural environment
and with other species) helps in understanding the factors that encourage the survival and
growth of legionellae in artificial water systems.
Legionellae are ubiquitous in natural and artificial water environments worldwide, and
survive in a range of environmental conditions (Fliermans et al., 1981).The bacteria are acid-
tolerant (they can withstand exposure to pH 2.0 for short periods) and they have been isolated
from environmental sources ranging from a pH of 2.7 to 8.3 (Anand et al., 1983; Sheehan,
Henson & Ferris, 2005). Legionellae have been found in sources as diverse as water on plants
in rainforests, groundwaters (Riffard et al., 2001; Brooks et al., 2004) and seawater (Ortiz-
Roque & Hazen, 1987). The bacterium also survives in artificial sources of salt water (Heller
et al., 1998). In certain natural aquatic environments (e.g. in groundwater that is contaminated
by soils or subsoils and has a temperature below 20 ºC), legionellae may be present in concentrations


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                   29
too low to be detected using culture methods. Such water can potentially introduce legionellae
into storage tanks and systems within the built environment, where the physical and chemical
conditions encourage their growth.

2.2 Factors affecting growth of Legionella
This section discusses the effect of temperature, other microorganisms and virulence factors
on the growth of Legionella.

2.2.1 Influence of temperature
Legionellae have been isolated from hot-water systems up to 66 ºC; however, at temperatures
above 70 ºC they are destroyed almost instantly (Dennis, Green & Jones, 1984; Dennis, 1988b).
Kusnetsov et al. (1996) found that growth of all strains tested decreased at temperatures
above 44–45 ºC, with the growth-limiting temperature being between 48.4 ºC and 50.0 ºC.
The Legionella strains studied produced carbon dioxide up to 51.6 ºC, suggesting that some
respiratory enzymes survive at this temperature. Complex water systems, such as warm-water
plumbing systems, air‑conditioners and hot tubs (also known as spa pools), are increasingly
using water in the temperature range that encourages Legionella growth. In addition, these
water systems can potentially produce aerosols, increasing the spread of the bacteria.
Strains of L. pneumophila have been shown to have a decimal reduction time (D) of 80–124 minutes
at 50 ºC, and of 2 minutes at 60 ºC (Dennis, Green & Jones, 1984; Schulze-Robbecke, Rodder
& Exner, 1987). Isolates can be collected easily from many different environmental aquatic
sources with temperatures between 30 ºC and 70 ºC (Fliermans, 1984). For example, legionellae
have been isolated from frozen rivers, thermal ponds and springs, and aquatic sources in the
vicinity of a volcano (Tison & Seidler, 1983). Yee & Wadowsky (1982) showed that naturally
occurring L. pneumophila survived and multiplied in water at temperatures between 25 ºC
and 45 ºC, with an optimal temperature range of 32–42 ºC. The study also found that legionellae
were most commonly isolated at temperatures between 35 ºC and 45 ºC, with the greatest
increase in viable counts occurring between 37 ºC and 42 ºC (Wadowsky & Yee, 1983; Schulze-
Robbecke, Rodder & Exner, 1987). As the temperature falls below 37 ºC, the bacteria’s reproductive
rate decreases and there is little or no increase in numbers of bacteria below 20 ºC.
Therefore, to prevent Legionella infection, the recommended temperature for storage and
distribution of cold water is below 25 °C, and ideally below 20 °C. Recent laboratory studies
of mutant Legionella strains show that the bacteria may grow below 20 ºC under certain conditions
(Soderberg, Rossier & Cianciotto, 2004). Legionella will survive for long periods at low
temperatures and then proliferate when the temperature increases, if other conditions allow.


    The “decimal reduction time” is a unit of microbial heat resistance, defined as the time required to kill
     90% of a population of microorganisms at a constant temperature and under specified conditions.


30                                           LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
L. pneumophila is thermotolerant and able to withstand temperatures of 50 °C for several hours.
The identification of Legionella spp. in hot-water tanks or in thermally polluted rivers emphasizes
that water temperature is a crucial factor in the colonization of water distribution systems
(Yu, 2000), the proliferation of legionellae in the environment, and therefore the risk of Legionella
infection. Maintaining the temperature of hot and cold-water systems within buildings to
prevent or minimize the growth of legionellae is an important control measure to prevent the
risk of Legionella infection.

2.2.2 Effect of other microorganisms

Requirement for nutrients
Water alone is insufficient to allow L. pneumophila to proliferate; for example, in studies using
sterile distilled water and sterile tap water, L. pneumophila survived in the long term but did
not multiply (Skaliy & McEachern, 1979; Fields et al., 1984). Other microorganisms allow
Legionella to amplify; for example, naturally occurring L. pneumophila were able to survive
and multiply in non-sterile tap water (Yee & Wadowsky, 1982). In continuous-culture model
systems seeded with a mixed microflora from a potable water system, L. pneumophila grew
when fed solely with filtered, sterilized drinking water for prolonged periods (Lee & West,
1991; Rogers et al., 1994). These results suggest that growth of Legionella requires nutrients
already available in the tap water. The nutrients may be supplied, directly or indirectly, by other
species of bacteria or other associated microorganisms in the form of dissolved organic constituents,
through the excess production of organic nutrients or through decay of the microorganisms
(Tesh & Miller, 1981; Yee & Wadowsky, 1982; Stout, Yu & Best, 1985):
These results are consistent with studies showing that amino acids are the main nutrient
requirement for L. pneumophila growth (Pine et al., 1979; Warren & Miller, 1979; Wadowsky
& Yee, 1985).
The association of L. pneumophila with many different microorganisms from aquatic sources has
been demonstrated; the microorganisms include protozoa, Fischerella spp. and other bacteria
(Fliermans et al., 1981; Tesh & Miller, 1981; Bohach & Snyder, 1983; Wadowsky & Yee, 1983;
Wadowsky & Yee, 1985; Rowbotham, 1986; Grimes, 1991).

Protozoa
Drozanski (1963) described bacterial parasites of amoebae that had been isolated from soil
but failed to grow on laboratory media. It is possible that these bacterial parasites were Legionella
spp. Rowbotham (1980) was the first to report the relationship between amoebae and
L. pneumophila; it has subsequently been confirmed that legionellae are facultative intracellular
parasites. (Facultative organisms are those that are able to grow in altered environmental conditions,
for example, in the presence or absence of a specific environmental factor, such as oxygen.)




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                    31
Legionellae can multiply in 14 species of protozoa, including:
• Acanthamoeba, Naegleria and Hartmanella spp.
• the ciliates Tetrahymena pyriformis, Tetrahymena vorax (Rowbotham, 1980; Tyndall & Domingue,
  1982; Fields et al., 1984; Rowbotham, 1986; Wadowsky et al., 1991)
• one species of slime mould (Rowbotham, 1980; Fields et al., 1993; Fields, Benson &
  Besser, 2002).

Protozoa are an important vector for the survival and growth of Legionella within natural and
artificial environments, and have been detected in environments implicated as sources of
legionellosis. However, not all amoebae are acceptable hosts, indicating that a degree of host
specificity is involved. In the natural environment, L. pneumophila proliferates in protozoa
within intracellular phagosomes, possibly producing proteases with cytotoxic activity, and
thus causing localized tissue destruction (Quinn, Keen & Tompkins, 1989).
Once it has been ingested by an amoeba, the survival of L. pneumophila depends on the temperature
of the water. At 22 °C, the bacteria are digested by the amoeba (Nagington & Smith, 1980),
whereas at 35 °C they can proliferate inside the amoeba (Rowbotham, 1980). Temperature
also affects the expression of flagella, with a larger number of flagellated bacteria present at
30 ºC than at 37 ºC (Ott et al., 1991). Flagella have an important role in the pathogenicity of
many organisms, including Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Heuner & Steinert (2003)
found that nonflagellated legionellae were less capable of infecting protozoa and macrophages
than wild-type flagellated strains.
Protozoa help to protect Legionella from the effects of biocides (Barker et al., 1992) and thermal
disinfection (Storey, Ashbolt & Stenstrom, 2004a). Legionellae can survive in encysted
amoebal cells (Skinner et al., 1983; Harf & Monteil, 1988) and it has been postulated that
this can be a mechanism by which L. pneumophila is able to survive adverse environmental conditions
and survive within airborne aerosols (Berendt, 1980; Hambleton et al., 1983; Tully, 1991).

Phagocytic cells
The virulence of Legionella is linked to its capacity to proliferate in humans, where it infects
phagocytic cells opportunistically (i.e. taking advantage of certain conditions to cause disease).
However, these studies preceded the recognition of serological cross-reaction between L.
pneumophila and Campylobacter spp. Infection of susceptible animals such as guinea pigs, rats,
mice and hamsters has shown that the pattern of growth in macrophages is similar to that in
protozoa. The bacterium has been isolated from the lungs of calves, and serological conversion
has been observed in many animals, including horses, antelope and sheep (Boldur et al.,
1987). Therefore, infection is not solely caused by the virulence of L. pneumophila, but can
also depend on the susceptibility of the host. Attempts to infect birds (quails and pigeons)
with L. pneumophila were unsuccessful (Arata et al., 1992).

2.2.3 Environmental factors and virulence
The virulence mechanisms of Legionella are discussed in Chapter 1. Virulence is influenced by
environmental factors such as temperature, nutrients and sodium concentrations (Edelstein,
Beer & DeBoynton, 1987; Byrne & Swanson, 1998). At the same time, Legionella’s virulence
factors affect the ability of the bacteria to survive adverse environmental influences, such as
temperature extremes (Mauchline et al., 1994), ultraviolet (UV) light, low humidity and biocide
treatments (Rowbotham, 1980; Anand et al., 1983; Rowbotham, 1984; Barbaree et al., 1986).
Chapter 1 (Section 1.5) provides more information on environmental factors and virulence.

2.3 Biofilms
This section discusses the composition and formation of biofilms, their effect on bacterial
growth, and risk factors for the development of biofilms.

2.3.1 Biofilm composition
In 1901, Whipple noted how adherence to surfaces increased the bacterial activity of waterborne
microorganisms. Since then, many studies have recognized the importance of surfaces in
concentrating microorganism activity. Surface-associated microbial activity and colonization,
or “biofilm formation”, occurs worldwide in natural and artificial environments, and on a
range of different surfaces. Microorganisms, including L. pneumophila, form biofilms as a
mechanism to withstand adverse conditions, such as limited nutrients or temperature extremes.
Surface adherence usually occurs by means of an extracellular polysaccharide substance secreted
by the cells. This substance (the glycocalyx, or slime) is a hydrated polyanionic polysaccharide
matrix produced by polymerases affixed to the lipopolysaccharide component of the cell wall
(Morton et al., 1998).
At any stage in a biofilm’s development, portions of the film can be sloughed off by shear stresses
from the movement of water (see Figure 2.1) (Trulear & Characklis, 1982; Taylor Eighmy &
Bishop, 1985). This activity may resuspend the biofilm’s microorganisms within the system’s
water (Rowbotham, 1980), allowing them to colonize other parts of the system if conditions
are appropriate.
Microbial biofilms are extremely complex heterogeneous microbial ecosystems and may consist
of bacteria, algae and grazing protozoa. The latter may display morphological features not
usually associated with microorganisms when grown in pure culture (Cloete et al., 1989).

2.3.2 Biofilm formation
During biofilm formation, the surface to which the film will attach is first conditioned by
nonspecific binding; this process is followed by colonization of pioneering microorganisms,
which multiply to form microcolonies or stacks. The microcolonies are protected by a glycocalyx
layer, but portions can be sheared off and recolonize other parts of the system, as described

above. Fluid flow around the microcolonies (represented by curved arrows in Figure 2.1)
carries nutrients, and the surface is grazed by protozoa (if present), which releases nutrients
and clears surfaces, thus aiding growth.
Biofilms, which may include legionellae and protozoa, can form on the surfaces of poorly
managed buildings or cooling towers (see Figure 2.1). The biofilm facilitates nutrient and
gaseous exchange, and protects microorganisms not only from biocides but also from periodic
increases in temperature and attempts at physical removal, especially in areas where surfaces
are scaled or corroded. Biofilms can form at interfaces, particularly at those between water
and solid surfaces, but have also been found on oil–water interfaces (e.g. in metal-working
fluids). Biofilms are more likely to form where there are areas of low water flow and where
water is allowed to stagnate.
Studies aimed at characterizing bacterial interaction within biofilm ecosystems have evaluated
the effects of parameters such as temperature and surface materials on the growth of L. pneumophila,
and have investigated the effect of biocides on planktonic and sessile legionellae (those
attached to the surface material) (Green & Pirrie, 1993; Walker et al., 1993, 1999; Rogers et al.,
1994; Moorer, 1996; Atlas, 1999; Surman, Morton & Keevil, 1999; Murga et al., 2001; Keevil,
2003). Most studies of Legionella and biofilms use naturally occurring microbial communities,
and therefore give a true picture of such communities (Colbourne et al., 1984; Colbourne &
Dennis, 1985; Verissimo et al., 1990; Storey, Ashbolt & Stenstrom, 2004b). However, some
of the organisms present in biofilms have yet to be identified, and their contribution to the
survival and multiplication of legionellae remains unknown.
Within a biofilm, microorganisms are embedded in an extracellular matrix that provides structure,
stability, nutrients and protection from possible toxic effects of the substrate upon which the
biofilm grows (e.g. copper pipes in water distribution systems). Gradients of nutrients, pH
and oxygen within the matrix support the varying needs of different microorganisms in the
heterogeneous population (Wimpenny, Manz & Szewzyk, 2000; Allison, 2003). Legionellae
grown in biofilms are more resistant than the same bacterial species in the water phase of the
system (Barker et al., 1992; Cargill et al., 1992; Surman, Morton & Keevil, 1993; Santegoeds,
Schramm & de Beer, 1998).

2.3.3 Effect of biofilms on bacteria growth
Bacteria attached to surfaces and particulate matter within a system are more resistant to
biocide treatments (Ridgway & Olson, 1982; Kuchta et al., 1985; King et al., 1988), making
biocides less effective and allowing the proliferation of potential pathogens (LeChevallier
et al., 1988; Wright et al., 1991).
The presence of biofilms is therefore an important factor for Legionella survival and growth
in water systems (Kramer & Ford, 1994; Rogers et al., 1994; Williams, Molinari & Andrews,
1996; Martinelli et al., 2000; Goossens, 2001). Small numbers of legionellae are found in sources
such as distributed drinking-water supplies, which then feed into water systems within buildings
and cooling towers. This provides a logical explanation for the presence and subsequent growth
of legionellae in these artificial aquatic environments (ASHRAE, 2000; WHO, 2004).
The availability of complex nutrients in biofilms has led some researchers to propose that
biofilms support the survival and multiplication of legionellae outside a host cell. Growth
within a biofilm composed of naturally occurring waterborne microorganisms, in the absence
of protozoa, has been shown in a model system study. Cycloheximide — which inhibits protein
synthesis in all eukaryotic cells, and affects initiation, elongation and termination, (Oleinick,
1977) — was added in high doses to the system. Growth increased in the absence of protozoa,
with both the heterotrophic count (the number of all microorganisms) and the Legionella
count increasing (Surman, Morton & Keevil, 1999; Surman et al., 2002). Rogers & Keevil (1992)
used immunogold labelling of Legionella to show the existence of microcolonies of legionellae
within biofilms. Another study demonstrated that multiplication of Legionella in a biofilm model
was due solely to intracellular multiplication in amoebae (Murga et al., 2001).

2.3.4 Risk factors for biofilm growth
Biofilm prevention is an important control measure against proliferation of Legionella. Preventing
the growth of biofilms is important because, once established, they are difficult to remove from
complex piping systems (see also Chapter 4).
Various factors increase the likelihood of biofilm formation, including:
• the presence of nutrients, both in the source water and in the materials of the system
• scale and corrosion
• warm water temperatures
• stagnation or low flow as occurs in the deadends of distribution system pipework and in
  storage tanks.
The presence of scale and corrosion in a system will increase the available surface area and allow
the formation of microniches that are protected from circulating disinfectants. Scale and corrosion
also increase the concentration of nutrients and growth factors, such as iron, in the water system.
Uncontrolled biofilms can occlude pipework, resulting in areas of poor flow and stagnation
with higher risk of Legionella growth. Furthermore, the presence of both biofilms and protozoa
has a twofold protective effect for the bacteria in the system, because it increases the organic
load and inactivates residual levels of disinfectant. In addition, biofilm and bacteria (including
Legionella spp.) grown inside protozoa are more tolerant of chlorine and other antimicrobial
agents at concentrations above those commonly used to disinfect water supplies and shown
to be lethal under laboratory conditions (Barker et al., 1992).
The materials of the system also affect the growth of biofilms. Some plumbing materials support
or enhance the proliferation of microorganisms, including Legionella spp. (Rogers et al., 1994).
Natural substances, such as rubber gaskets, provide a nutrient-rich substrate and are preferentially
colonized by microorganisms; some plastics leach nutrients into the system. Microorganisms
will even grow on the surface of systems plumbed with copper, which has an inherent resistance
to colonization, once the surface has been conditioned.
Most engineered aquatic systems — especially those that are complex (e.g. those in health‑care
facilities and hotels) — have areas containing biofilms, even when the system is well maintained.
When control measures, such as the disinfection regime, are relaxed, microorganisms will
quickly multiply to detectable levels.
Legionella contamination can originate from small areas of a water system that are not exposed
to temperature fluctuations or circulating disinfectant. An example of this occurred in a large
teaching hospital in the United Kingdom, where legionellae were intermittently detected at
one sentinel outlet, despite the fact that there was a comprehensive control regime in place.
The source was eventually tracked down to a 10‑centimetre length of water-filled pipe where
there was little or no flow (a “deadleg”). When this section of pipe was removed, subsequent
sampling remained negative (John Lee, Health Protection Agency, UK, personal communication,
June 2005).

2.4 Sources of Legionella infection
It is not possible to predict whether a source will cause infection based solely on the Legionella
count. The likelihood that a source will cause an infection depends on the load of bacteria, the
effectiveness of dissemination, the way in which it multiplies, and its ability to form aerosols.

2.4.1 Disease spread via aerosols and inhalation
The role of aerosols from contaminated potable water distribution systems in leading to legionellosis
is well established. Other chapters of this publication (see Chapters 4–8) discuss the many
aerosol-generating systems that have been linked with transmission, such as cooling towers,
building water systems, respiratory therapy equipment and hot tubs.
Showers are often mistakenly thought to be the only source of aerosols linked to nosocomial
legionellosis (Woo, Goetz & Yu, 1992); however, water outlets, humidifiers, respiratory devices
and nebulizers that have been filled or cleaned with tap water can also spread Legionella and have
been reported as a source of infection in several cases (Arnow et al., 1982; Moiraghi et al., 1987;
Brady, 1989; Mastro et al., 1991; Woo, Goetz & Yu, 1992). Toilet flushing is also a potential
source (Albrechtsen, 2002).
As discussed in Chapter 1, community-acquired cases of legionellosis can almost always be
attributed to inhalation of aerosols from devices such as cooling towers, hot tubs, industrial
equipment and indoor fountains (Heng et al., 1997; Den Boer et al., 2002; Greig et al., 2004).
The largest outbreaks of disease to date have all been associated with transmission of aerosols
from these types of equipment (Den Boer et al., 2002; Garcia-Fulgueiras et al., 2003; Greig et
al., 2004). Cooling towers are a particular problem, with one report suggesting that cooling
towers account for at least 28% of all sporadic cases of legionellosis (Bhopal, 1995).
Other systems implicated in the spread of legionellosis via aerosols include domestic plumbing
systems (Singh, Stout & Yu, 2002; WHO, 2004; see Chapter 4); misting devices associated with
food displays (Mahoney et al., 1992), natural thermal springs (Sommese et al., 1996; Alim,
Hakgudener & Poyraz, 2002) and thermal spas (Brady, 1989; Martinelli et al., 2001; Vogiannis
et al., 2004).
As discussed in Chapter 1, nasogastric tubes have been included in several studies of nosocomial
legionellosis, with microaspiration of contaminated water presumed to be the mode of entry
(Marrie et al., 1991; Blatt et al., 1994; Stout & Yu, 1997). However, a recent study failed to
detect colonization of the oesophageal tract by Legionella in this situation (Pedro-Botet et al.,
2002). Patients suffering from nosocomial legionellosis are significantly more likely to have
undergone endotracheal tube placement, or to have been intubated for significantly longer,
than patients with other causes of pneumonia (Strebel et al., 1988; Kool et al., 1998; Winston,
Seu & Busuttil, 1998).

2.4.2 Disease spread via soil
In a number of documented cases of legionellosis, no aquatic source was implicated. In these
cases, likely sources of infection have been potting soils and soil conditioners. Most reports
of soil-derived infection since the 1990s identify L. longbeachae as the infectious agent (Steele,
Lanser & Sangster, 1990; Steele, Moore & Sangster, 1990; Koide et al., 1999). The mode of
transmission of these infections remains unclear.
Anecdotal reports suggest possible links between building excavations and outbreaks of
legionellosis (Miragliotta et al., 1992; Mermel et al., 1995). These outbreaks may be due to
increased dispersion of dust during earthmoving operations, since dust entering cooling towers
adds nutrients and surfaces for bacterial growth and may also interfere with biocide action.
Alternatively, the outbreaks may be due to interference in the water supply, which allows
contamination by bacteria, including legionellae.

Chapter 3 Approaches
to risk management

Jamie Bartram, Richard Bentham, Emmanuel Briand, Phil Callan, Sebastian Crespi, John V Lee,

The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a framework for safe drinking-water
that can be applied to assessing and managing the risks posed by Legionella. Figure 3.1 illustrates
this framework.
This chapter first considers the links between environmental exposure to Legionella and
outbreaks of disease (Section 3.1), and then describes how the framework can be used to
minimise the risk of Legionella colonizing a water system. The framework has the following
components:
• health-based targets (Section 3.2) — these are targets normally set at national or state level
  by a competent authority, either in the health sector, or in consultation with the health sector
• water safety plans (WSPs) (Section 3.3) — these are system specific plans developed and
  implemented by the operator of the system (in the case of Legionella, such plans may be
  building specific, and may be developed and implemented by the building operator)
• surveillance (Section 3.4) — this is a system of independent checking, by a surveillance
  body or regulatory agency.
The information on health-based targets and surveillance is similar for all types of situation
where Legionella may be found; however, a WSP is necessary for each particular situation. Therefore,
Chapters 4 to 8 discuss the application of WSPs for Legionella to particular situations.

3.1 Environmental exposure and disease
There is no established dose–response relationship for Legionella infections, and the concentration
of legionellae necessary to cause an outbreak is unknown. Transmission may occur through
inhalation, aspiration or directly from contaminated water (e.g. wound infections), from a
wide variety of sources, as discussed in Chapter 1. Data on population dynamics indicate that
legionellae are not distributed normally within the aquatic environment, and that even when
high concentrations of the bacteria are detected, this may not be related to health risk (Kool
et al., 1999; Bentham, 2000). Gathering information on population dynamics of Legionella is
difficult, because there have been relatively few outbreaks in which the source has been investigated
while it was still infectious, and in which no intervention has occurred before sampling.
Of the many reports of Legionella outbreaks caused by cooling towers, few provide details of
the numbers of legionellae present in the water at the time the tower was infectious. Often,
the tower was examined long after the infectious period, and the bacterial population may
have changed dramatically in the interim, as shown by the example in Box 3.1.


  Box 3.1	 Hospital outbreak in which water sampling was ineffective
  In 1985, an outbreak of legionellosis occurred at Stafford District General Hospital in the
  United Kingdom. The investigation team was able to isolate L. pneumophila from a piece
  of sealant in an air handling unit, but not from any water sample (O’Mahony et al., 1990).
  Presumably, at the time of the outbreak, the cooling water contained high levels of
  L. pneumophila. However, between the time of the outbreak and the arrival of the
  investigation team, the cooling water had been shot dosed (given a brief, high-level
  treatment) with biocide at least twice, and had been diluted by fresh make‑up water.
  Numbers of legionellae would have been reduced considerably by both the biocide
  and the dilution with fresh water. Low numbers of L. pneumophila were isolated from a
  sample of the cooling water collected between the shot doses. The sealant from which
  the investigation team isolated L. pneumophila came from around a chiller battery within
  the air-conditioning ducting. The position of the sealant meant that it could have been
  contaminated by aerosols from the cooling tower, but would not have been affected by
  the biocide additions.



3.1.1 Cooling tower outbreaks
In cooling tower outbreaks in the 1980s, numbers of bacteria were often estimated by
immunofluorescence rather than by culture. These results may have been unreliable, because
the reagents used were polyclonal antibodies, which have questionable specificity; also, the
technique detected both dead and live legionellae. However, isolation of legionellae by culture
tends to underestimate the numbers of legionellae by at least an order of magnitude.
Table 3.1 shows the results of various cooling tower outbreaks in which the towers were sampled
while probably still containing infectious legionellae.

Bhopal et al. (1991) studied sporadic cases of legionellosis (i.e. those not associated with known
outbreaks or with travel) in relation to the distance between the person’s home and cooling
towers. The study found that risk of infection decreased with increasing distance. People living
within 0.5 km of any tower were three times more likely to become infected than people
living more than 1 km away.
Bentham & Broadbent (1993) reviewed the common features of some community outbreaks
associated with cooling towers, and found that towers implicated in outbreaks were mainly
those of less than 300 kilowatts. Outbreaks were most frequent in autumn, and often involved
towers that had been operated after a period of shutdown. The study monitored the numbers
of legionellae in systems that had been shut down, with samples taken before, 10 minutes after
and 70 minutes after switching on the circulation. In some cases, switching on the system
raised Legionella concentrations from below the detection limit (4000 CFU/litre) to between
5.0 × 104 and 9.5 × 105 CFU/litre within 10 minutes.

Health-based targets are based on critical evaluation of health concerns; for example, for Legionella
safety, an overall health-based target might be to have “no cases of legionellosis caused by
artificial water systems”. Health-based targets for Legionella safety are normally set nationally
and applied locally. Targets should be set by a senior authority responsible for health, in consultation
with relevant experts, including environmental microbiologists, engineers, system designers
and installers, maintenance staff and contractors, and people responsible for ensuring the health
and safety of systems.
Health-based targets usually focus on controlling the proliferation of legionellae and the production
and release of aerosols, because of the difficulty of determining what represents an acceptable
limit for Legionella. For example, the cooling tower outbreaks listed in Table 3.1, above, all
occurred at levels of at least 105 CFU/litre (by culture), but it would be dangerous to assume
that it is safe to set an acceptable limit just below that level, because numbers could increase
rapidly if a system is not adequately controlled. Also, environmental conditions may modulate
the virulence of individual strains (Byrne & Swanson, 1998), and routine culture does not
differentiate between virulent and avirulent strains. Thus, the public health significance of a
culture result from a water sample cannot be determined, because the result is not necessarily
related to virulence, exposure concentration, survival of the organism in an aerosol or the
infectious dose of the organism.
A further issue is that culture methods are biased towards the species currently recognised to
be associated with disease, particularly L. pneumophila, and may not detect all legionellae present
in the environment. In addition, people vary in their susceptibility to infection, making it
difficult to assess generic risk for the population at large. Thus, health risk assessments must
be made without reference to the relationship between dose and response, and with only
limited reference to test results.

Even when a source reaches a state at which it is infective, the proportion of people who acquire
Legionnaires’ disease is small (usually less than 5% of those exposed). Conversely, in outbreaks
of Pontiac fever, a high percentage (about 95%) of those who are exposed become affected.
A preliminary risk assessment by Ambroise & Hartemann (in press) compared exposure linked
to aerosols produced by cooling towers and by showering. The study considered expected numbers
of cases of infection, clinical sickness and death, for similar concentrations of L. pneumophila
serotype 1 in the air (ranging from 0.02 to 200 CFU/m3). The authors found that exposure
through cooling towers led to more cases (by a factor of 100–130) than exposure during
showering.

3.3 Water safety plans
Developing a WSP is the preferred approach to managing specific health risks of exposure to
Legionella from water systems (WHO, 2004; Davison et al., 2005). In some jurisdictions, other
terms are used; for example, the term “risk management plan” is used by the Department of
Human Services, Victoria, Australia. Such plans are similar to a WSP, but are less clearly defined.
For the purposes of this document, the term WSP is used.
Authorities responsible for water system safety or building safety should develop system-
specific WSPs. Major benefits of developing and implementing such a plan are the systematic
and detailed assessment and prioritization of hazards (biological, chemical or physical agents,
or water conditions, with the potential to cause adverse health effects), and the operational
monitoring of barriers and control measures.
The steps involved in developing a WSP are shown in Figure 3.2. A plan consists of the following
key components:
• system assessment (Section 3.3.1) — determination of whether the water quality at the point(s)
  of potential exposure or use meets the health-based target, based on a risk assessment for
  the population likely to be exposed
• monitoring (Section 3.3.2) — identification and monitoring of control measures used to
  ensure water safety (e.g. biocide levels, temperature, pH)
• management and communication (Section 3.3.3) — to document the system assessment
  and monitoring, and describe actions to be taken during normal operation and after
  incidents, including documentation and communication (e.g. a plan for remedial actions
  after adverse monitoring results, such as low residual biocide levels, and listing those to be
  informed of an event).

The WSP should be prepared in conjunction with, and made available to, all concerned parties
(e.g. health authorities, water suppliers, building managers and water treatment providers).
The plan should be reviewed on a regular basis to reflect changes and ongoing improvements
in the system, the available evidence base and the surrounding environment (WHO, 2004).
Finally, the plan should be amended if control is not maintained.

3.3.1 System assessment
Assessment of the system supports subsequent steps in the plan, allowing effective strategies for
controlling hazards to be developed and implemented. The steps involved — shown in
Figure 3.2, and discussed below — are to:
• assemble a team
• document and describe the system
• assess hazards and prioritize risks
• assess the system.

Assemble a team
As shown in Figure 3.2, a preliminary stage in developing a WSP is to form a team of experts
with a thorough understanding of the particular water system. A thorough knowledge and
understanding of the system’s operation is also critical. This should incorporate knowledge of
design strengths and weaknesses and operating characteristics, so that informed decisions can
be made about system maintenance and monitoring.
The training and experience of assessors are important factors in the quality of system assessments.
Ideally, assessors should be independent of those who supply water treatment services, to
avoid conflicts of interest. Assessors must be aware of the ecological factors that encourage
Legionella growth within a system (see Chapter 2), and have some understanding of the
design and engineering of the system, and of any modifications or alterations to the system,
particularly if the system is large and complex. Assessment of complex systems will generally
require a broad knowledge base and is best conducted by a multidisciplinary team that can
address all aspects of system operation and management, including microbiological aspects.
However, a team-based approach might not be feasible in some cases, for example where
resources are limited. Therefore, a system assessment should establish the type and level of
control that can realistically be imposed.

Document and describe the system
Large water systems, such as building water systems, are those most commonly associated
with widespread human exposure to Legionella. Identifying the layout and design of such
water systems is therefore an important step in controlling colonization, although the task
can be time consuming and difficult. Due to the high level of technical capability required,


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  45
it may be useful to subcontract this task to a specialist contractor. Independent assessment of
larger water systems will also help to identify design faults and areas that need servicing.
Routine servicing and replacement of components of the system should comply with manufacturers’
specifications or existing technical references, where available, and should be carried out by
properly qualified people. System layout and design specifications should be used to determine
the servicing and replacement requirements for the entire system.

Assess hazards and prioritize risks
Each system should be assessed individually, taking into account the proximity and susceptibility
of the population, and the mode of transmission from the water source. The potential risks
associated with the system should also be evaluated. This step involves understanding the
characteristics of the water system, the hazards that may arise and how they may create risks,
and the processes and practices that affect water quality.

Assess the system
This step involves assessing the existing system, including describing the system and preparing
a flow diagram. The aim of preparing a flow diagram is to increase the accuracy of the water
system evaluation and provide a conceptual understanding of the water supply process. The
diagram — a systematic representation of the sequence of steps or operations used in the
production or manufacture of a particular water item — can be used to show:
• pathways by which legionellae can be transferred to consumers
• points where controls are in place and where improvements might need to be made
• links, water flow direction and responsibilities in the water supply process; for example,
  where the utility’s responsibility ends (e.g. at the consumer’s meter) and the consumer’s
  begins (e.g. after receipt of water).
To avoid duplication, the diagram should cross-reference any supporting documentation that
covers finer details. Such documentation might include geographical information system
(GIS) layers and plumbing schematics, which could be used to identify stagnation points; for
example, maps showing key account holders, such as hospitals, schools and nursing homes.

3.3.2 Monitoring
The steps involved in monitoring— shown in Figure 3.2, and discussed below — are to:
• identify control measures
• monitor control measures
• validate effectiveness of WSP.




46                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Identify control measures
Control measures are activities or processes applied to a system to prevent a hazard occurring.
Such measures are applied at control points, which are steps at which control can be applied to
prevent or eliminate a water safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. Some plans contain
key control points; that is, points at which control is essential to prevent or eliminate a hazard.
Control measures for microorganisms in industrial systems have been described by Eggins &
Oxley (1982), and include:
• excluding the microorganism
• manipulating the environment to prevent colonization by, and limit growth of, the micro-
  organism (e.g. by controlling nutrient levels, controlling temperature, and preventing low
  flow and stagnation)
• manipulating the environment to limit growth of the microorganism
• using a disinfectant (e.g. a biocide).
The remainder of this subsection discusses how these strategies can be used to control Legionella.
Any WSP would be based on a combination of control methods, rather than relying on any
single method.

Exclusion of microorganisms
In most systems, it is not practical to exclude legionellae or to prevent their periodic reintroduction,
because low numbers of Legionella may enter a building through piped distribution systems
or storage systems. Therefore, emphasis must be upon design and control.

Control of nutrient levels
Limiting the amount and type of nutrients (particularly organic nutrients) that are available
to the bacteria in the water system is an important control measure. Nutrient levels can be
controlled by:
• selecting materials that will not serve as substrates or provide nutrients for biofilm development
• ensuring that chemical additives used to control scaling, corrosion and microorganisms
  are applied at appropriate and effective concentrations (Crespi & Ferra, 1997), and are
  chemically compatible (i.e. nonreactive) with one another and with the system
• considering the properties of materials used in the water system (e.g. insulating properties,
  potential for corrosion, interaction with chemical disinfection processes)
• ensuring that system design is appropriate and will prevent the accumulation of biofilms,
  sediments and deposits (e.g. the design should eliminate deadends and stagnation, and
  allow access to all parts of the water system for maintenance and cleaning).



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                      47
Prevention of low flow and stagnation
Preventing low flow rates and stagnation of water is an essential and important control measure,
and the system should be designed to minimize areas of stagnation and low flow. Care should
be taken to ensure that any modifications to the system do not introduce areas of stagnation
and low flow. Where such areas are unavoidable, design and operation should aim to at least
reduce stagnation and low flow.
For example, around mixing valves, the outlet should be as close to the valve as possible.
Commercially available thermostatic mixers can be fitted into the outlet to minimize the
zone at risk of being colonized by bacteria.
Water systems at risk from stagnation should be periodically flushed or disinfected, and
temperatures that are optimal for growth of Legionella should be avoided. However, where flushing
is used, the likely exposure of people to aerosols generated during flushing must be considered.

Control of temperature
Keeping water temperature outside the ideal range for legionellae is an effective control
measure for both hot and cold-water systems (Figure 3.3 shows the effects of temperature on
survival and growth of Legionella).
Water systems should:
• avoid water temperatures between 25 °C and 45 °C to prevent Legionella colonization
• ideally, maintain cold water below 20 °C
• ideally, maintain hot water above 50 °C.
In many systems (e.g. cooling towers and some cold and hot-water systems), maintaining these
temperatures is not possible because of the nature of the system. Within such systems, temperatures
should be maintained at the upper or lower limits of the Legionella multiplication range.
In domestic and public hot-water systems, control measures for reducing the proliferation of
Legionella must not increase the risk of scalding, particularly for children, the elderly or
people with disabilities.

Control of microorganisms
Controlling protozoa is critical in reducing the risk of legionellosis; currently, the best way to
achieve this is to prevent the development of the biofilms on which the protozoa graze (Donlan,
2002). However, preventing biofilm development can be difficult, particularly in dynamic
water systems such as cooling waters and spas, where the water flow is disrupted and large
amounts of nutrients may enter.
Any strategy for microbial control depends on water chemistry, temperature and the use of the
water system. Ideally, microbial control will be achieved using the control measures described
above. However, this is often not the case because of the characteristics of different water systems.
For example, some industrial water systems are never disinfected because the cooling systems
are open to the environment and would quickly be reinoculated with microorganisms after
disinfection. In some water systems, chemical control of Legionella may not be safe because
of the system’s design. Therefore, a chemical control strategy should take into account system
design, operating parameters and water chemistry (including the potential for production of
disinfection by‑products).
A WSP should take into account the unique features of the individual water system to which
it is to be applied. Microbial control strategies are unlikely to be effective if other control
strategies, notably flow rates, temperatures and maintenance, are neglected.

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                                  51
The appropriate design of new water systems is a critical step in controlling Legionella proliferation.
The control measures listed in Table 3.2 should be borne in mind when designing and constructing
the system. Poor design and construction will inevitably compromise attempts to implement
effective control measures, which in turn will have a serious impact on Legionella control.

Monitor control measures
A monitoring programme should be developed for the water system, to ensure that identified
control measures are functioning effectively. Monitoring points should be identified throughout
the system, for each control measure, on the basis of system design, operating parameters and
high‑risk areas. Particular attention should be given to areas where control is most difficult to
achieve, and areas where Legionella is most likely to grow.
Monitoring of control measures should be primarily based on tests that are simple and rapid
to apply (ISO 5667 (ISO, 2001) can be used as a guide in developing a sampling method);
and where possible, monitoring equipment should be online and automatic. The equipment
should also be set up in such as way that remedial action is instigated as soon as failures in
control measures are detected, and before levels fall outside predetermined target ranges, such
as those shown in Table 3.3 (each target must be a measurable parameter (e.g. temperature,
biocide doses or heterotroph counts).
Results from system monitoring should be used in assessing the maintenance programme
and in improving the system. All monitoring records should be kept current and accessible,
so that the system can be assessed.

 and up to 100 000           immediate resampling. If a similar count is found again, a review
                             of the control measures and risk assessment should be carried
                             out to identify remedial actions.
 More than 100 000           Implement corrective action (action to be taken when the
                             results of monitoring at the control point indicate a loss of control).
                             The system should immediately be resampled. It should then be
                             “shot dosed” with an appropriate biocide, as a precaution. The risk
                             assessment and control measures should be reviewed to identify
                             remedial actions.

Validate effectiveness of water safety plan
This step involves developing procedures to verify that the WSP is working effectively, and
will meet the predetermined target; that is, it involves monitoring individual components of
the water system to determine whether the WSP has effectively controlled Legionella in the
system. Validation and verification are defined in Box 3.2.

  Box 3.2 Verification and validation
  Validation is the process of obtaining accurate and reliable evidence that a water safety
  plan is effective.
  Verification is defined as the use of methods, procedures or tests, in addition to those
  used in operational monitoring, to determine whether the performance of the supply complies
  with the stated objectives outlined by the health-based targets. Verification might be under-
  taken through independent surveillance; it provides an indication of the overall performance
  of the system.

Source: WHO (2004).


If control of Legionella is found to be inadequate, the operational procedures should be reviewed
and control measures re‑evaluated as a matter of urgency. A health risk assessment of the
system may be necessary, to determine whether the management contingency plan should be
used (e.g. shot dosing the system with biocide).
There appears to be little correlation between Legionella culture test results and human health
risk (Kool et al., 1999; Bentham, 2002). Legionella testing cannot be considered a control
measure, because of:
• uncertainties about the reliability of culture
• time delays
• differences between culture requirements for different Legionella species
• dynamics of the population.

Chapter 11 provides more details on laboratory diagnosis of Legionella.
Although Legionella testing cannot be considered a control measure, it can be used in validation
to provide some evidence that the WSP is effective and that control measures are operating
properly. Validation normally includes more extensive and intensive monitoring than routine
operational monitoring, and its aim is to determine whether system units are performing as
assumed in the system assessment (see Section 3.3.1). Operational monitoring of control
measures should be by measures that provide real-time results (e.g. monitoring of biocide
concentrations, temperature and pH); sampling for Legionella cannot provide results sufficiently
quickly to be useful in operational monitoring.

3.3.3 Management and communication
The steps involved in management and communication — shown in Figure 3.2, and discussed
below — are to:
• develop supporting programs
• prepare management procedures
• establish documentation and communication procedures.

Develop supporting programs
Supporting programmes are actions that are important for ensuring water safety but are not
control measures. They include:
• training and educating personnel involved in activities that could influence the water quality
  (these activities should include refresher training, to regularly assess and update competencies;
  also, records of all training should be maintained)
• gathering evidence-based data on which to base health-related targets
• developing verification protocols for the use of chemicals and other control measures (e.g. to
  ensure the use of suppliers that participate in quality assurance programmes).
Supporting programmes can be identified and incorporated within the WSP as a part of the
system assessment process.

Prepare management procedures
Effective management of the water system should include procedures for:
• the actions that should be taken in response to variations in the water system that occur
  during normal operational conditions
• the actions that should be taken in specific “incident” situations
• the actions that should be taken in unforeseen and emergency situations.
• Procedures should be realistic, without increasing the complexity of the system’s operation.
  They should clearly identify the responsibilities of all people involved in system operation
  and maintenance, and should identify an individual responsible for overall implementation.

Establish documentation and communication procedures
Documentation of a WSP should include:
•    details of all personnel involved in developing and identifying control measures and
     maintenance strategies (this list should also clearly identify an individual with
     managerial responsibility for implementing and reviewing the WSP)



54                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• clear statements of responsibilities and a chain of communication between all these
  personnel to ensure:
   – effective cooperation between people engaged in system operation and maintenance

   – a rapid and multidisciplinary response to failures in the management strategy

   – coordination of a continuing review and evaluation process

• a list of identified targets, control measures and monitoring points
• all maintenance records, control measure monitoring data and control verification data
• actions to be taken as part of routine periodic maintenance of the system and its components,
  and interventions to be undertaken should monitoring or verification data suggest loss of
  control
• a reporting process that informs all involved people of system status and control, and identifies
  actions to be taken in reporting monitoring and verification results
• a contingency plan that clearly outlines actions to be taken and chains of communication
  and reporting in an emergency, and including a definition of the circumstances under which
  the contingency plan will be instigated
• a description and assessment of the water system, including a current schematic diagram
  of the system
• the plan for operational monitoring and verification of the system (e.g. frequency of monitoring,
  target levels for parameters)
• a description of supporting programmes (e.g. training targets and manuals)
• water safety management procedures for normal operation, incidents and emergency situations.
Records are essential for reviewing the adequacy of the WSP and for ensuring that the water
system adheres to the WSP. The following records should be kept:
• supporting documentation for developing the WSP, including validation (the process of
  obtaining accurate and reliable evidence that the WSP is effective)
• records and results generated through operational monitoring and verification
• outcomes of incident investigations
• documentation of methods and procedures used
• records of employee training programmes.
Periodic review of the records is recommended, so that trends can be identified and appropriate
actions taken to maintain the safety and quality of the water system.



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  55
A person involved in implementing the WSP should be responsible for risk communication.
This person should also be responsible for developing a risk management plan (to effectively
convey the WSP to all parties involved in the process, and to other entities where appropriate).
The plan should clearly identify and interpret the goals of the risk assessment and the WSP;
it should include:
• modes of communication to be used
• background information on the risk posed by Legionella, derived from the risk assessment
  and system assessment
• the goals of the WSP in addressing the risk posed by Legionella
• content and target audiences for communication
• sources of further information about the water system and Legionella contamination.
Communication strategies should include procedures for promptly advising stakeholders of
any significant incident in the water system. This includes:
• notifying the public health authority
• making summary information available to the public
• establishing mechanisms for receiving and responding to community concerns.
The agencies responsible for monitoring should develop strategies for disseminating and
explaining the significance of health-related information.

3.4 Surveillance
Surveillance is the systematic collection, orderly consolidation, and analysis of data to verify
that health-based targets, system assessments and control measures are operating properly. It
might include:
• internal audit and external audit (by the health department) to confirm that operational
  monitoring and corrective actions are being undertaken as stated in the WSP
• monthly heterotrophic colony counts at the tap and in the source water (to track trends
  and changes, rather than as an absolute indicator, and to be undertaken by an accredited
  laboratory)
• six-monthly sampling for legionellae in water at source and at the tap.

Chapter 4 Potable water and
in-building distribution systems

Richard Bentham, Susanne Surman-Lee, John V Lee, Emmanuel Briand, Dick Van de Kooj
This chapter describes how a water safety plan (WSP) can be applied to assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella in potable water and in distribution systems in buildings.
It should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3, which discusses the different elements that
make up a WSP, and shows how a WSP fits within the framework for safe water quality
developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As explained in Chapter 3, a WSP has 10 steps that fit within the three main areas of system
assessment, monitoring and management and communications (see Figure 3.2). A WSP
must be comprehensive, and all 10 steps should be implemented in assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella. However, this chapter focuses on parts of the WSP where
information specific to potable water and in-building distribution systems is needed.

4.1 Background
The first published report of Legionella being transmitted through a potable water installation
involved renal transplant patients who acquired the infection in a hospital (Tobin et al., 1980;
see Chapter 6). Since then, Legionella has been observed in water systems in many different
types of buildings, including hotels, homes and factories, and in ships (Bartlett et al., 1983;
Habicht & Muller, 1988; Stout et al., 1992; Allen, Prempeh & Osman, 1999; Castellani Pastoris
et al., 1999). Legionella has been found throughout engineered water systems, from the mains
supply to consumers’ taps. Once present in a water system, legionellae can be isolated from a
range of sources, unless adequate controls are in place (Stout, Yu & Best, 1985; Colbourne
& Trew, 1986).
Legionella numbers in a plumbing system are influenced by many factors, and may vary considerably
in time and place, particularly in large, complex systems. Since legionellae can grow in association
with many different microorganisms (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3), it is important to control
other microorganisms to reduce the proliferation of legionellae.
Infection with Legionella requires both proliferation and exposure. Potable water systems
containing Legionella are a significant cause of sporadic cases of legionellosis acquired in the
community (Stout, Yu & Best, 1985; Yu, 1993; Venezia et al., 1994). Such systems are also the
main cause of nosocomial infection (through aspiration or direct infection of wounds —
Lowry &Tompkins, 1993), with cases reported in many European countries (e.g. see Box 4.1)
and in North America.

  Box 4.1 C
           old-water tap as a source of fatal nosocomial Legionella pneumonia
          in a rehabilitation centre in the Netherlands
  Hoebe et al. (1999) reported two fatal cases of legionellosis in a rehabilitation centre in
  the south of Limburg, the Netherlands. The water supply was investigated, and Legionella
  was cultured from:
  • respiratory patients’ specimens
  • water samples and smears from all mixing taps used in showers
  • samples from hot and cold-water taps from the infected ward and from the other wards.
  The L. pneumophila (serotype I) found in the water supply was the same as that cultured
  from the sputum of the two male patients who died of legionellosis.
  The cold-water pipes ran alongside both the hot-water pipes and the central heating
  system, and the circulating cold water sometimes reached 40 °C, which is within the
  growth range of Legionella. Also, the infected ward was closed during weekends,
  meaning that the water remained stagnant.
  The study’s authors concluded that multiplication of Legionella in the water supply was
  probably stimulated by the combination of an elevated cold-water temperature and the
  regular stagnation of water.


In northern Europe, about 50% of cases of legionellosis are associated with travel, and the
infection is often associated with hotel water systems (Joseph et al., 1998). Legionella has also
been isolated from water installations in domestic premises; for example, in a study of sporadic
cases of legionellosis in the United Kingdom, legionellae were isolated from approximately
15% of the homes of infected patients but from only about 5% of homes tested as controls
(Coward et al., 1999).

4.2 Water safety plan overview
A WSP needs to be comprehensive; however, an overview of such a plan is shown in Table 4.1,
as an example of the type of information a plan might contain. As explained in Chapter 3, a
WSP is part of a framework for safe water quality that also includes health-based targets and
surveillance.
In the case of the sample WSP shown in Table 4.1, a health-based target for drinking water might
be “Where possible, Legionella should be non-detectable”. Table 4.2 gives examples of health-
based targets for Legionella. The water quality in health‑care facilities needs special attention,
determined by the susceptibility of the patients; patients undergoing a severe immunosuppressive
therapy (e.g. organ transplant or cancer therapy) are particularly at risk of infection.
Further information on health-based targets and information on surveillance for Legionella
can be found in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 of Chapter 3, respectively.




58                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
The remainder of this chapter provides information relevant to a WSP specific for potable
water and in-building distribution systems, for each of the three main areas of a WSP:
• system assessment (Section 4.3)
• monitoring (Section 4.4)
• communication and management (Section 4.5).
Sections 4.3–4.5 should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3 from Chapter 3.
Fundamentally, the responsibility for managing the risk of legionellosis belongs to the owner
or manager responsible for the potable water or in-building distribution system. To ensure that
the WSP is properly implemented, the owner or manager should assign tasks, ensure that
documentation is complete and current, and hold people accountable.

4.3 System assessment
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.1 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in system assessment, some of which are discussed further below, are to:
• assemble a team to prepare the WSP
• document and describe the system (Section 4.3.1)
• assess hazards and prioritize risks (Section 4.3.2)
• assess the system.


60                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
4.3.1 Document and describe the system
In documenting and describing the system, all relevant information and documentation should
be compiled. Box 4.2 lists the particular components of a potable water distribution system
that should be assessed.


  Box 4.2	 Components of potable water distribution system to be assessed
  Particular components of a potable water distribution system that should be assessed include:
  • the quality of water entering the system
  • the design and construction of equipment (including operational information about
    temperature regime and water circulation)
  • treatments (e.g. anticorrosion, antiscaling and disinfection) and timing of treatments
  • systems, system components and equipment that have the potential to generate aerosols
  • the temperature of storage tanks and the environment in which the system is located
    (both in buildings and outside), including the location of the system network (e.g. pipes
    in conduits, ceilings, walls and floors)
  • the periods of water use; for example, on a daily or weekly basis (e.g. sports facilities
    may use water on a weekly basis)
  • the turnover of water in areas such as storage tanks
  • the population using the system, including any particularly susceptible people
  • the management structure
  • the competence of personnel responsible for the system.


Potential exposure pathways and the proliferation of Legionella should be taken into account
at the design stage, because modifying existing facilities can be complicated and expensive.
Once a desktop review of the system has been completed, a sanitary survey or “onsite” survey
should be carried out to verify the system (see Chapter 4 of WHO, 2004).

4.3.2 Assess hazards and prioritize risks
This step involves collecting and evaluating information on hazards and conditions leading to
their presence, to decide which are significant for safety and therefore should be addressed in
a safety plan.
In assessing hazards, it is reasonable to assume that all water supply systems have the potential
to become seeded with microorganisms, including legionellae, during construction, repair and
maintenance, even if the water is treated. Legionellae are widespread in surface water, and
numbers of L. pneumophila ranging from 104 to more than 107 cells/litre have been observed
by direct immunofluorescence assay (Chapter 11).




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  61
In many cases, direct methods of molecular detection have shown Legionella to be present in
drinking-water leaving treatment facilities and in distribution systems. Detection of low numbers
of culturable Legionella is difficult; therefore, information about the presence and behaviour
of the organism in distribution systems is scarce. Nevertheless, Legionella found in plumbing
systems has frequently been shown to originate from drinking-water. Thus, it appears that
Legionella may be present in distribution systems (at least in temperate climate zones), but at levels
below the detection limit of culture techniques. There is no evidence that such low levels of
contamination pose a direct health threat to consumers.
In assessing piped water systems, it is important to investigate whether the combination of factors
present in the system is likely to lead to the proliferation of legionellae. Such factors are listed
in Box 4.3 and discussed below. These factors are strongly interrelated, and it is not currently
possible to rank them. The risk factors discussed below include not only those for growth of
Legionella, but also those — such as aerosol production — that are likely to increase the risk of
infection.


  Box 4.3 Risk factors for growth of or exposure to Legionella in piped water systems
  Factors that can lead to proliferation of, or exposure to, Legionella in piped water systems include:
  • poor water quality and treatment failures
  • distribution system problems such as stagnation and low flow rate
  • construction materials that contribute to microbial growth and biofilm formation
  • inefficient or ineffective disinfection
  • water temperature of 25–50 °C
  • presence of biofilms
  • aerosol production.


Water quality and treatment — risk factors
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), L. pneumophila growth can only be sustained in piped
water if nutrients are available, either from the source water or (directly or indirectly) from
other microorganisms (Anand et al., 1983; Stout, Yu & Best, 1985, 1992; Barbaree et al., 1986;
Vickers et al., 1987; Lück et al., 1991). Thus, poor quality water or water that has not been
effectively treated may allow legionellae to proliferate within the system.

Distribution system — risk factors
Proliferation of legionellae is promoted by stagnation, which occurs, for example, in the deadends
of distribution system pipework, and in storage tanks and systems that are not frequently used.
Another risk factor associated with potable water distribution systems is the potential dissemination
of legionellae through aerosols. In the home, inhalation of legionellae can occur from the aerosols
that are generated by showers and toilet flushing, and from devices such as nebulizers if they
are cleaned or filled with tap water.

62                                        LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Construction materials — risk factors
In the past, water supply systems were generally constructed of metallic materials such as cast iron,
galvanized iron, brass or copper. Metallic plumbing materials are increasingly being replaced
with synthetic materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polybutylene. These different
construction materials vary in their potential to support microbial growth and biofilms. For
example, synthetic materials may leach organic compounds that may provide a source of nutrients
for microorganisms subsequently colonizing them (Colbourne & Ashworth, 1986), and copper
is more resistant to colonization than synthetic materials; however, metallic materials are
more prone to corrosion and this can encourage biofilm formation.
Certain natural materials such as hemp and natural rubber components promote biofilm
formation and thus promote the growth of legionellae more than metallic materials, both in
laboratory conditions and in practice (Niedeveld, Pet & Meenhorst, 1986). Hemp is a traditional
jointing compound, and natural rubber components are often present (together with plastic
materials) in pressure compensating vessels, and in flexible tubes and shower hoses.
Accumulation of sludge, scale, rust, or algae or slime deposits in water distribution systems supports
the growth of Legionella (WHO, 2004).
Despite its natural resistance to biofilm formation, copper pipework can become corroded
through biodeterioration, mediated by microorganisms. This is a particular problem in areas
with soft water (Keevil et al., 1989). In some cases, dosing regimes with chlorine-based biocides
have led to the failure of plumbing systems, requiring costly replacement (Keevil et al., 1989;
Grosserode et al., 1993). The risk of colonization, therefore, should be balanced with other
risks linked to the choice of materials, such as dissolution, corrosion and scaling.

Disinfection — risk factors
Chemical disinfection may not be effective against Legionella that are found in protozoa
(Kilvington & Price, 1990). In addition, the complexity of many piped water systems, particularly
in old buildings, makes effective disinfection difficult; for example, booster disinfection may
not be effective in a complex system.

Presence of biofilms — risk factors
Bacteria in drinking-water systems tend to adhere to surfaces and develop an organic protective
matrix, creating microenvironments known as biofilms (discussed in Chapter 2, Section 2.3).
Legionellae can thrive in biofilms, either directly or as parasites of certain protozoa that graze
on the films.

Temperature — risk factors
Risks from legionellae may be greater in warmer regions (subtropical and tropical), because
temperature is an important factor in the ability of the microorganism to survive and grow.
Published information about Legionella concentrations in drinking-water distribution systems


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                    63
in warmer regions appears to be lacking, but up to 108 cells/litre have been found in surface
waters in tropical regions, and Legionella has been cultured in high numbers from warm water
sources (Ortiz-Roque & Hazen, 1987).
Naturally occurring L. pneumophila can survive and multiply in water at temperatures of
25–45 °C, with an optimal range of 32–42 °C and the greatest increase in viable counts at
37–42 °C (Yee & Wadowsky, 1982). The multiplication rate decreases at temperatures below
37 °C, with no observable growth below 20 °C (HSE, 2004). In certain geographical regions,
temperatures may routinely be above 20 ºC and, in some cases, may reach optimal temperatures
for legionellae growth.

4.4 Monitoring
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.2 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in monitoring, some of which are discussed below, are to:
• identify control measures (Section 4.4.1)
• monitor control measures (Section 4.4.2)
• validate effectiveness of the WSP.

4.4.1 Identify control measures
This section should be read in conjunction with Table 3.2 of Chapter 3, which provides information
on the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods of controlling Legionella in piped
water systems.
The focus of attention in managing legionellae risks should be on preventing both proliferation
and exposure, in line with the multiple-barrier approach that forms part of a WSP. Systems
will need to be assessed individually, and any treatment will need to be validated by testing
for its effectiveness against legionellae and for the presence of legionellae in operating systems.
For example, in order to choose appropriate control measures, it will be necessary to know the
“normal” operating temperature of the water supply.

Water quality and treatment — control measures
Water from the supplier should meet the appropriate drinking-water standards or guidelines
of the jurisdiction (e.g. WHO, 2004), and should not contain high levels of nutrients.
Measures for reducing numbers of Legionella are not routinely applied in drinking-water
distribution systems because (as explained in Section 4.3) levels of Legionella are usually below
the detection limit of culture techniques. However, in most countries, surface water treatment
includes a series of barriers to eliminate or inactivate pathogenic microorganisms of faecal origin.
These physical techniques, such as coagulation–sedimentation, filtration and disinfection will
also reduce the number of legionellae (Kuchta et al., 1983).


64                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Where temperature controls (discussed below) cannot be maintained, an alternative means
of control needs to be implemented; for example, where legionellae multiply in warm areas
of cold-water systems. The effectiveness of control measures for Legionella depends on many
variables. Physical systems such as ultraviolet (UV) and filtration may be satisfactory if fitted
near the point of use, but they are not dispersive; that is, they do not form a residual level of
treatment throughout the water system and therefore will not affect biofilms harbouring
Legionella downstream of their point of use. Criteria for a universal acceptable level of effectiveness
have not been defined, but might include a required log reduction of Legionella in water and
an effect on biofilms (e.g. reduction of formation or growth of biofilms).
Applying alternative control techniques requires detailed consideration of the extent and complexity
of the system, and of the composition of the water. Where alternative measures are implemented,
monitoring is needed to ensure that controls are adequate and maintained (see Section 4.5).
Tap diffusers reduce water use but can increase aerosol production. Therefore, in high‑risk
areas, such as hospitals, diffusers should not be installed (and facilities should consider removing
diffusers that are already in place). Mixing valves should be as close to the shower outlet as
possible, and shower fittings should be detachable so that they can be routinely cleaned and
disinfected.

Distribution systems — control measures
Control of legionellae should begin at the design stage of the water system. There are many
different designs for modern plumbed water systems that supply hot and cold water in buildings.
Systems may be gravity fed, with a storage tank for cold water fed by the mains supply, or
they may be pressurized, with no intermediate storage tank. Hot water is supplied from a water
heater, calorifier, boiler or plate heat exchanger, depending on the scale of the system. Cold
water is distributed either directly from the mains supply or via a cold-water storage tank.
Pipes should be as short as possible. In complex systems, regulating valves should be used to
control flow. Deadends should be avoided in both the design and construction phases, and in
existing systems they should either be removed or regularly flushed.
Standard system fittings should include devices to prevent backflow on heat production systems,
and purge valves to prevent scaling and corrosion and facilitate monitoring. These should be
installed at appropriate locations in the system, according to national standards.

Construction materials — control measures
The materials used to construct piped water distribution systems should be compatible with the
chemical quality of water (after a corrective treatment) and should minimize bacterial growth.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                     65
Disinfection — control measures
To control Legionella numbers in the distribution system, a disinfectant residual should be maintained.
Monochloramine residual (currently available only for mains distribution systems) appears to be
effective against Legionella in biofilms, and may be more effective than chlorine (Kool et al., 1999).

Biofilms — control measures
A critical objective of any strategy to prevent the proliferation of Legionella in plumbing systems
should be to minimize the development of biofilms hosting Legionella.
Routine cleaning of storages and control of nutrients in source water will reduce nutrient load
and so help to reduce biofilm formation and growth.

Temperature — control measures
Temperature is critical in Legionella control. Consequently, water temperature should, as far as
possible, be measured and registered.
Control measures for water temperature include the following:
• For recirculating hot-water systems, the temperature of the water leaving the heater
  should be not less than 60 ºC and the temperature of the return should be not less than
  50 ºC. Very small differences between the temperature at the outlet of the heater and the
  returning water may indicate shortcuts in the circulation.
• For non-circulating hot-water systems without storage tanks, the length of the pipes connecting
  the heating device with the taps should be as short as possible.
• The temperature of hot water at the tap should reach its maximum value within one
  minute, and the temperature of the cold water within two minutes (HSC, 2000).
• The temperature of hot water reached within one minute at the tap should not be less
  than 50 ºC, except where thermostatic mixer valves are installed.
• The temperature of cold water at the tap should not exceed 25 ºC. Where possible, the
  temperature should be less than 20 ºC, to reduce growth of legionellae. Where cold-water
  supplies are routinely above 20 ºC, the water should be treated as a warm water supply.
• Where fail‑safe thermostatic mixer valves are installed, the cold-water temperature should
  not exceed 25 ºC and the hot should not exceed 50 ºC immediately before the valves.
• Temperature increases of cold-water pipes, reservoirs and treatment devices should be prevented
  by appropriate insulation and sufficient distance between cold pipes and hot-water pipes
  or heating equipment.
• In systems in which water temperature at the tap cannot be maintained at 50 ºC because
  of the risk of scalding a susceptible population (e.g. in an old people’s home), alternative
  means of control should be implemented. Alternative measures include the use of biocides
  or periodic flushing (superheating) of the system with a return (and tap water) temperature
  of at least 60 ºC. This measure requires stringent safety measures to prevent scalding.

4.4.2 Monitor control measures
This step involves defining the limits of acceptable performance and how these are monitored.
Routine monitoring of a potable water distribution system will include surrogate observations,
such as:
• turbidity
• disinfectant residual
• copper and silver ions
• structural integrity of the system
• temperature.
A thermometer and a surface probe are useful for measuring water temperatures at each part
of a system, at outlets representative of the “worst case scenario” (i.e. at the points at which
the risk is likely to be highest). Such outlets — often termed “sentinel points” — might include
the furthest point from the water heater in a hot-water system, or the incoming water in a
cold-water system.
The results of tests such as those listed above allow corrective actions (discussed in Section 4.5.1,
below) to be taken to protect public health.
Tests carried out for legionellae and heterotrophic colony counts in the distribution system do
not give timely information on the performance of the system, and are therefore most useful
in validation and verification.

4.5 Management and communication
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.3 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in management and communication are to:
• develop supporting programs
• prepare management procedures (Section 4.5.1)
• establish documentation and communication procedures (Section 4.5.2).

4.5.1 Prepare management procedures
This step involves preparing management procedures, including corrective actions, for normal
and incident conditions. Corrective actions include repairing defects, and possibly re-treating
or discarding water that might be contaminated, to ensure that unsafe water is not supplied.
Table 4.3 gives examples of values used as levels to trigger corrective action for Legionella in piped
water systems in different countries. These values are generally used to support risk assessment
or to monitor the effects of control measures.

Chapter 5 Cooling towers
and evaporative condensers

Barry Fields, David F Geary, William McCoy, Richard Bentham, John V Lee
This chapter describes how a water safety plan (WSP) can be applied to assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella in cooling towers and evaporative condensers.
It should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3, which discusses the different elements that
make up a WSP, and shows how a WSP fits within the framework for safe water quality developed
by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As explained in Chapter 3, a WSP has 10 steps that fit within the three main areas of system
assessment, monitoring and management and communications (see Figure 3.2). A WSP must
be comprehensive, and all 10 steps should be implemented in assessing and managing the
risks associated with Legionella. However, this chapter focuses on parts of the WSP where
information specific to cooling towers and evaporative condensers is needed.

5.1 Background
Cooling towers and evaporative condensers (also known as evaporative fluid coolers or closed-
circuit cooling towers) are heat-transfer devices in which warm water is cooled by evaporation
in atmospheric air (see Figure 5.1). These devices are used:
• to provide cooling for a wide variety of industrial processes
• for refrigeration plant used in cold stores
• to cool water for air‑conditioning to buildings.
Air movement through the tower or condenser is produced by fans or, occasionally, by natural
convection. Aerosols generated by the operation of cooling towers and evaporative condensers
can transmit legionellae to susceptible hosts (Broadbent, 1996; Geary, 2000).

5.1.1 Cross-flow cooling towers
As shown in Figure 5.1(a), cooling towers are heat exchangers; they act by cooling water that is in
direct contact with the air moving through the tower. Most towers use a medium, referred to as
“fill” or “pack”, to maximize the surface area of water in contact with air and therefore available
for evaporation.
Water from the cooling tower is piped from the tower to a condenser (or other heat source),
where it is heated. Warm water is distributed via a spray, or a trough and gutter system at the
top of the tower, and falls down over the fill against the countercurrent of air. The warm water
is then piped back to the cooling tower to be cooled, and the process is repeated. There may
be tens or even hundreds of metres of piping between the tower and the point where the source
is cooled. The piping circuit can be quite complex in some industrial settings, where several
devices may be cooled.

5.1.2 Counterflow evaporative condensers and cooling towers
As shown in Figure 5.1(b), counterflow evaporative condensers and cooling towers are similar
to cross-flow cooling towers, except that the warm fluid that is being cooled is contained inside
a tubular matrix and does not come into direct contact with the air.
The water has only a short circuit from the sump at the base to the distribution system at the
top. It then flows down over the tube bundle, in the opposite direction to the airflow, thus
cooling the fluid within the tubes. Figure 5.1(b) shows how vapour enters and liquid exits the
condenser coil.

5.1.3 Links to outbreaks of legionellosis
Cooling towers and evaporative condensers have been implicated in many outbreaks of legionellosis.
As discussed in Chapter 1, L. pneumophila serogroup 1 MAb2-reactive strains are the primary
legionellae associated with outbreaks of disease from these systems. The causative organism
has been readily isolated from many of these devices, usually as a result of neglect or insufficient
maintenance (Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002), as illustrated by the example given in Box 5.1.
A significant proportion of outbreaks of legionellosis have been attributable to the start‑up of
stagnant systems without adequate chemical treatment (Bentham & Broadbent, 1993).




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  71
  Box 5.1	 An outbreak of legionellosis at the Melbourne Aquarium, April 2000
  Between 11 and 27 April 2000, the Melbourne Aquarium, Australia, was linked to 125
  confirmed cases of legionellosis. The cases were caused by Legionella pneumophila
  serogroup 1. Two case–control studies confirmed the source of the outbreak and investigated
  risk factors for infection. The aquarium cooling towers were found to be poorly disinfected
  and contaminated with L. pneumophila, and visiting the aquarium was significantly associated
  with disease. The case–control studies indicated that current smoking was a dose-dependent
  risk; in contrast, chronic illness and duration of exposure at the site were not significant
  risks (Greig et al., 2004).


The number of cooling towers in existence globally is not known, but about 30 000 are registered
in the United Kingdom alone. To date, large-scale natural updraft towers, such as those commonly
associated with electricity generation, have not been implicated in outbreaks of legionellosis,
although the potential for their involvement cannot be dismissed.
The air exhausting from cooling towers and evaporative condensers carries two types of water:
• water vapour that has evaporated within the device, which may recondense and appear as
  steam
• water droplets that have been generated within the device and carried in the airflow; if
  carried over without initial evaporation, these droplets are termed “drift”.
The water droplets in drift will contain any dissolved salts or suspended particles, including
organisms that were in the original water. It is these droplets that can create an infectious aerosol
when the water evaporates in the open air outside the tower, unless appropriate controls are
in place.

5.2 Water safety plan overview
A WSP needs to be comprehensive; however, an overview of such a plan is shown in Table 5.1,
as an example of the type of information a plan might contain. As explained in Chapter 3, a
WSP is part of a framework for safe water quality that also includes health-based targets and
surveillance.
Most cooling towers and evaporative condensers are likely to become contaminated with
Legionella at some point in their serviceable life (Koide et al., 1993; Bentham, 2000). It is
unrealistic to try to prevent entry of the organism into the cooling tower or to create an
environment that entirely precludes its growth and multiplication, although this is desirable.
In the case of the sample WSP shown in Table 5.1, a health-based operational target might
be to control microbial growth through modification of the environment and the use of




72                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
water treatments (including chemicals and antimicrobials). The water quality in health‑care
facilities needs special attention, determined by the susceptibility of the patients; patients
undergoing a severe immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. organ transplant or cancer therapy) are
particularly at risk of infection.
Further information on health-based targets and information on surveillance for Legionella
can be found in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 of Chapter 3, respectively.
The remainder of this chapter provides information relevant to a WSP specific for cooling
towers and evaporative condensers, for each of the three main areas of a WSP:
• system assessment (Section 5.3)
• monitoring (Section 5.4)
• communication and management (Section 5.5).
Sections 5.3–5.5 should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3 from Chapter 3.
Cooling towers and evaporative condensers are often designed simply to optimize heat transfer
and thermal efficiency, and the practices described here might not be included in typical water
treatment programmes for such devices. However, an effective water treatment programme
that reduces the risk of legionellosis and thus ensures safer operation of the system also leads
to more efficient operation (because there is less fouling) and longer system life (because there
is less corrosion) (Broadbent, 1996).
Fundamentally, the responsibility for managing the risk of legionellosis belongs to the facility
owner or manager. To ensure that the risk management plan is properly implemented, the owner
or manager should assign tasks, ensure that documentation is complete and current, and hold
people accountable.

5.3 System assessment
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.1 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in system assessment, some of which are discussed further below, are to:
• assemble a team to prepare the WSP
• document and describe the system (Section 5.3.1)
• assess hazards and prioritize risks (Section 5.3.2)
• assess the system.

5.3.1 Document and describe the system
In documenting and describing the system, all relevant information and documentation should
be compiled. Box 5.2 lists the particular components of a potable water distribution system
that should be assessed.


  Box 5.2	 Components of cooling towers and evaporative condensers to be assessed
  Particular components of cooling towers and evaporative condensers that should be
  assessed include:
  • the quality of water entering the system
  • the design of the devices and the distribution system
  • nutrient sources
  • the population using the system, including any particularly susceptible people
  • the management structure
  • the competence of personnel responsible for the system.


Once a desktop review of the system has been completed, a sanitary survey or “onsite” survey
should be carried out to verify the system (see Chapter 4 of WHO, 2004).

5.3.2 Assess hazards and prioritize risks
This step involves collecting and evaluating information on hazards and conditions leading
to their presence, to decide which are significant for safety and therefore should be addressed
in a safety plan.

Source water quality — risk factors
The make-up water for a cooling tower or evaporative condenser will usually come directly from
a municipal or well supply. However, sometimes a holding tank is used, which may contain
rust, sludge and sediment. In some very large systems, it may be necessary to use surface water
from lakes, rivers, streams, or reservoirs as make-up water; such sources are usually laden with
microorganisms and nutrients from the environment.


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                               75
Water treatment — risk factors
In the dynamic environment of a cooling tower system, water treatment chemicals do not perform
in the same way as they do in a controlled laboratory trial (England et al., 1982). Also, the
temperature and flow velocities of cooling tower water will vary at different locations within
the system. Many other parameters, such as pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, suspended
matter and the biological mass within the system, can vary over a relatively short period,
affecting water treatment.

Disinfection — risk factors
Efficacy of disinfection depends on water quality parameters such as pH and turbidity, which
may compromise the disinfection process.
Applied microbial control programmes never sterilize cooling water systems. Even if enough
chemical or other agent could be added to achieve sterilization, the system would rapidly become
recolonized with microorganisms, since cooling systems are open to the environment. The most
significant practical consequence of attempted sterilization would be selection in biofilms of
increasingly tolerant microbial communities comprising the survivors of the applied antimicrobial
treatment (Russell, 2000).

Biofilms — risk factors
Cooling towers and evaporative condensers typically move large quantities of air, and are excellent
air scrubbers or washers. Thus, dirt, dust and other particulate matter enter the cooling tower
water in the evaporative cooling process, as large amounts of air are moved through the unit.
Depending on location, the quantity of such material added to the cooling water can be substantial
(e.g. several kilograms per day).
Organic matter and other debris present in the air can therefore accumulate in the cooling
water. This material may serve as a nutrient source for the growth of microorganisms, including
legionellae. Diverse biofilms, which can support the growth of legionellae, may be present on
all wet or moist surfaces throughout the system; for example, on heat exchangers, the fill, the
sump and pipes (Geary, 2000; Donlan, 2002).

Temperature — risk factors
The typical temperature of the water in a cooling tower ranges from 29 °C to 35 °C at the
heat exchanger, and from 22 °C to 28 °C at the cooling tower. These temperature ranges are
conducive to the growth of legionellae and their hosts.

Design and materials used in construction — risk factors
Stagnation of the system or areas of stagnant water (e.g. deadlegs) prevent proper chemical
treatment of the system, and allow legionellae and their hosts to proliferate.

Spray drift — risk factors
Even with appropriate design and under normal operation, some water droplets that are
small enough to be inhaled (i.e. <5 µm in diameter) can leave the drift eliminator. Also, some
larger droplets leaving the unit may be reduced to 5 µm or less by evaporation (Guideline
12–2000 in ASHRAE, 2000).
Wherever possible, cooling towers should be located well away from building air intakes,
other building openings and areas of public access. The influence of adjacent buildings, as well
as prevailing wind directions, should be taken into account when locating a cooling tower.
Consideration should be given to the effects of reversal of airflow through some towers when
the tower fan is idle, and preventive dampers should be installed if necessary. In certain situations,
the potential risk of having a tower in a particular site may be so great as to require its relocation;
for example, where there are air inlets to hospital wards with high-risk patients.
Dry cooling systems are used in some situations, particularly on small (175–350 kW) systems.
Although such systems use substantially more energy, and are typically larger and noisier than
cooling towers, there is no known Legionella risk associated with dry systems.

5.4 Monitoring
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.2 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in monitoring, some of which are discussed below, are to:
• identify control measures (Section 5.4.1)
• monitor control measures (Section 5.4.2)
• validate effectiveness of the WSP.

5.4.1 Identify control measures
The overall goal of water treatment for cooling towers and evaporative condensers is to provide
a heat-transfer fluid that allows equipment to function optimally and use water efficiently.
This is achieved by minimizing microbial growth, scale, corrosion, and sediment or deposition
of solids (organic or inorganic) on heat-transfer surfaces, through implementing the control
measures outlined below.
The focus of attention in managing legionellae risks should be on preventing both proliferation
and exposure, in line with the multiple-barrier approach that forms part of a WSP.

Source water quality — control measures
Where a holding tank is used to hold make-up water, the tank should be cleaned of rust, sludge
and sediment whenever the tower is cleaned and disinfected (which should be done about
twice a year). Where surface water from lakes, rivers, streams or reservoirs is used, antimicrobial
treatment before the water enters the cooling system provides a practical and highly effective
aid to control microbial fouling in the system.

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                     77
It is often practical and highly effective to reduce the concentration of dissolved minerals, such
as calcium and magnesium, in make-up water before it enters the cooling system (water softening).
Water softening reduces the potential of the system to form biofilms, but may increase corrosion.
Reduction of organic load in the source water by chlorination or filtration (or both in concert)
helps to remove nutrients that could lead to legionellae proliferation. Chlorination used to
reduce the organic load may also serve to disinfect the water of its inherent microbial load.

Water treatment and water distribution — control measures
A system should be designed in such a way that water circulates through all parts of the system
that should be wetted whenever it is operational. Deadlegs on existing systems should be
removed or shortened (so that their length is no longer than the diameter of the pipe), or
should be modified to permit the circulation of chemically treated water.
Dirt, organic matter and other debris should be kept to a minimum, as water treatment chemicals
are generally more effective when the system is kept clean.
After stagnation of part or all of the system, system operation should always be coordinated with
full chemical treatment of the water. Similarly, when a cooling tower system has been shut down
for more than three days, the entire system (i.e. cooling tower, system piping, heat exchangers,
etc.) should be drained to waste, if practicable. Since it is often not possible to completely
eliminate all water from shut-down cooling systems, cooling water must be pretreated with
an appropriate antimicrobial regimen before system start-up (HSC, 2000; Guideline 12–
2000 in ASHRAE, 2000); that is, before activating the fans.
Corrosion inhibitors should be used to minimize corrosion of metal surfaces. Surfactants,
biocides and other chemicals should be used to control fouling due to scale, silt and microbial
growth. Use of these chemicals will help to maintain efficient heat transfer at metal surfaces,
ensure free flow of water throughout the system and prevent the proliferation of microorganisms
that are responsible for surface corrosion and degradation.

Disinfection — control measures
Because of the many factors that can compromise the disinfection process (outlined above),
it is advisable to vary the antimicrobial stresses applied in the cooling water microbial control
programme (McCoy, 1998), particularly in the case of non-oxidizing biocides. One practical
and effective means to vary antimicrobial stresses is to alternate between two non‑oxidizing
biocides added as a single (“slug” or “shot”) dose, manually or automatically, at 3–4-day intervals.
Another effective approach is to alternate use of an oxidizing antimicrobial with a non-
oxidizing antimicrobial, to ensure that different modes of antimicrobial action are employed.
When varying antimicrobial stresses, performance-based monitoring is used to assess the
extent of microbial control achieved (McCoy, 2003).




78                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
The section on control measures for cleaning and maintenance (below) contains additional
information on the disinfection process.

Oxidizing biocides
Commonly used oxidizing antimicrobials for cooling water include chlorine, bromine, stabilized
bromine, combinations of bromine and chlorine, chlorine dioxide, peroxy compounds such
as hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, and ozone (Kim et al., 2002; McCoy, 2002).Oxidizing
antimicrobials are often effective when fed continuously using metering systems with small
pumps, and many towers are successfully treated with continuous dosing with chlorine or
bromine.
Shot-dosing of oxidants, which can also be very effective in microbial control, is an alternative
to unvarying application of oxidizing antimicrobials.

Non-oxidizing biocides
Non-oxidizing biocides are most effective when shot dosed. The maintenance of a continuous
residual of non-oxidizing biocides in the system will inevitably lead to the selection of resistant
microorganisms and loss of microbial control (Russell, 2000; 2002). Non-oxidizing biocides
are usually dosed at higher concentrations (15–50 parts per million [ppm]) than oxidizing
biocides, and may require longer contact times at these concentrations (4–10 hours).

Treatment programme
All biocides should preferably be fed via a metering system, and the appropriate dose calculated
on the basis of system volume and half-life (dilution rate) within the system (Kim et al., 2002).
“Blow-down” or “bleed-off ” is the removal of some of the water periodically or continually, and
its replacement with fresh water, to control the continuous accumulation of dissolved solids
in the water. This process may be controlled by a conductivity controller that detects the
increase in conductivity due to the dissolved solids, and automatically regulates the rate to
hold a preset conductivity by triggering the operation of a solenoid drain valve.
Blow-down may be activated immediately before the addition of the biocide, to ensure that the
amount of suspended dirt in the water that might react with and neutralize the biocide is
minimized. Blow-down may then be stopped for a period after the addition of the biocide, to
ensure that the chemical is retained at a sufficient concentration for long enough to be effective.
In selecting a chemical treatment programme, the operating parameters and water chemistry
that may be unique to the system should be considered. A microbial control problem is rarely
resolved by the application of generic technologies. Any microbial control strategy will fail
without due attention to other control measures. Usually, the advice and the practical guidance
of a water treatment specialist are necessary.



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  79
Where holding tanks are used, they can be disinfected by filling with water and chlorinating
at 5 mg per litre free chlorine while maintaining the pH between 7.0 and 7.6. After one hour,
this disinfected water can then be added to the cooling tower as part of the routine cleaning
and disinfection procedure.
In emergency responses, systems must be cleaned, the water used for cleaning drained, and the
system refilled. If the water used to refill the system is not clean and does not contain a
disinfection residual, recontamination may occur, making it necessary to repeat the entire
cleaning procedure.

Biofilms — control measures
To facilitate penetration of an antimicrobial into biofilms and sediments, use of a compatible
and environmentally acceptable dispersant and/or detergent is strongly advised. There are many
acceptable surfactant (surface-active) chemicals of this type, including non-ionic, anionic and
amphoteric compounds (McCoy, 2003).

Temperature — control measures
Systems operating at the lower end of their working temperature range are likely to support
less Legionella contamination (Kusnetsov et al., 1997). Therefore, systems should be designed to
operate at the lowest possible temperature, to minimize legionellae growth (Bentham & Broadbent,
1993).

Design and materials used in construction — control measures
Cooling towers should be designed to:
• be easy to clean
• avoid the accumulation of sludge and deposits
• provide easy access for maintenance of internal surfaces, including the fill (Broadbent, 1996).
Connected tanks, filters and other devices must be scrutinized for their potential to support
the proliferation of Legionella. Materials should be non-porous, with easy-to-clean surfaces,
and should not provide nutrients for growth.

Cleaning and maintenance — control measures
A maintenance programme for the cooling system is essential, and the programme should be
recognized and monitored as an important control measure.
The following procedures are effective for maintaining a clean system:
• regular physical cleaning, judicious use of chemicals and prevention of the build-up of
  dirt and dissolved solids in the circulating water




80                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• periodic or continuous bleed-off or blow-down (excessive bleed-off should be avoided,
  because it will result in a loss or dilution of water treatment chemicals, and thus reduce the
  effectiveness of the treatment programme)
• addition of chemicals to the water at a rate sufficient only to maintain predetermined chemical
  concentrations and a stable total bacteria count below a predetermined acceptable level
• regular checks of tower components
• cleaning of wetted surfaces
• water treatment to minimize corrosion and scaling, and to provide biological control
• routine cleaning and disinfection
• regular visual inspections for general cleanliness
• cleaning of the sump of the unit when any build-up of dirt, organic matter or other debris
  is visible or found through sampling (effective means of removing particulate matter include
  side-stream “filtration”, coupled with strainers, cartridge filters, sand filters, centrifugal-
  gravity-type separators or bag-type filters).
The aim of the maintenance programme is to ensure optimal thermal performance and also
to minimise the risk of disease, through a combination of mechanical maintenance and total
tower cleanliness. The programme should cover regular water treatment, inspections and cleaning,
and should be implemented as soon as the cooling tower starts to operate. Box 5.3 provides
an example of a corrective action procedure for emergency disinfection. The type of situation
that might lead to corrective action is finding that monitoring results suggest the tower is out
of control; for example, if results show a failure of biocide dosing, or repeated high counts of
total viable bacteria or legionellae.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                81
  Box 5.3	 Example of corrective action procedure for emergency disinfection and cleaning
  If a cooling tower water system has been implicated in an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease,
  emergency disinfection and cleaning of that system must take place as soon as possible.
  The following actions should be taken where appropriate:
  • switch off the fan immediately
  • take samples for laboratory investigation before any further action
  • switch off the circulation pump as soon as practicable and decommission the system
  • consult the enforcing authority before proceeding further
  • keep all personnel clear of the tower area
  • when the area has been cleared by the enforcing authority, add sodium hypochlorite
    to the system water to obtain a measured concentration of 50 mg/l of free chlorine,
    and add a suitable biodispersant to prevent biofilm formation
  • where possible, cover the air inlet and outlets with plastic sheeting or similar material
    during disinfection, to prevent the release of aerosols from the tower (partially damaged
    biofilm may be sloughed off, homogenised by the pumps and aerosolised by the water
    distribution system, potentially creating a risk until the disinfectant has had time to be
    effective)
  • where possible, check the pH and, if it is >8.0, reduce it
  • circulate the system water with the fans off for a period of at least 6 hours
  • maintain the free chlorine level at an absolute minimum of 20 mg/l at all times
  • after six hours, de-chlorinate and drain the system
  • undertake manual cleaning of the tower, sump and distribution system, with cleaning
    staff wearing full pressurised respirators
  • refill with fresh water and add sodium hypochlorite
  • recirculate without using the fan, at 20 mg/l of free chlorine for six hours
  • de-chlorinate and drain the system
  • refill, recirculate and take samples for testing
  • re-commission the system when test results detect no legionellae and/or permission
    is granted by the enforcing authority.

The procedure detailed in Box 5.3 for emergency disinfection is, in most circumstances, also
appropriate for general disinfection and cleaning. However, there may be site- or industry-specific
procedures that should be used, and local environmental health authority regulations that
must be observed. Copies of the applicable procedure, and records of all actions and any test
results, must be maintained on site at all times. Disinfection using chlorine, bromine, chlorine
dioxide or another approved antimicrobial must be in accordance with local legislation.
Particular points to be noted when cleaning and disinfecting are shown in Box 5.4.

  Box 5.4	 Points to be noted when cleaning and disinfecting
  When cleaning and disinfecting a cooling tower or evaporative condenser, it is important to:
  • minimize creation of aerosols
  • where possible, remove drift eliminators, inspect fill and packing, and clean and repair
    or replace as required
  • clean all water filters and strainers associated with the distribution system
  • check water distribution nozzles or troughs, and gutters, and clean or replace as required
  • use a low-pressure spray of a combination detergent and oxidizer (e.g. sodium
    hypochlorite) for cleaning; do not use high-pressure washers on plastic packing
    or eliminators (if high‑pressure washers are to be used on other parts of the tower,
    the washing should be covered, to contain most of the splashing)
  • manually clean the tower, packing, sump, eliminators and distribution system; ensure
    that the cleaning is timed to minimize the risk of exposing individuals in the vicinity
    of the tower, and that personnel wear positive-pressure high efficiency particulate
    absorbing (HEPA) filter masks (respirators) during the procedure
  • remove high-density plastic film pack for cleaning, if recommended by relevant
    authorities — some authorities recommend this, because it can be difficult to check
    after cleaning that the interstices in the pack are free of dirt and scale (HSC, 2000),
    but there are no published studies comparing the effectiveness of cleaning in place
    with removing the pack for cleaning
  • ensure that records of the procedures are kept, and they include the date and the
    signature of the responsible party or authority.


Spray drift — control measures
The effectiveness of drift eliminators varies, depending on their design and condition —state-
of-the-art eliminators are significantly more efficient than older designs. The eliminators should
be inspected regularly (at least every six months) and either cleaned and disinfected or replaced,
as necessary. Shorter intervals between inspection and cleaning may be advisable for systems
in which heavy fouling is a chronic occurrence, or where highly susceptible populations are
likely to be exposed (HSC, 2000).

5.4.2 Monitor control measures
This step involves defining the limits of acceptable performance and how these are monitored.
The results of tests such as those listed above allow corrective actions (discussed in Section 5.5.3,
below) to protect public health to be taken.
Legionella populations in cooling systems are highly variable, and elevated concentrations
occur sporadically in most cooling towers (Bentham, 2000), meaning that single measurements
show only a snapshot of the microbial situation. Since it is not possible to monitor Legionella
concentrations continuously, other strategies must be used to maintain concentrations as
consistently low as possible; one such strategy is to prevent situations that stimulate growth
of the bacteria.

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                   83
Regular monitoring of Legionella concentrations should be included to build up a picture of
the trend. Legionella tests are not recommended as a guide for control measures, because their
inherent unreliability means that the results cannot be used as a reproducible, sensitive and
timely measure of system control (see Chapter 11). Legionella testing should only be used to
verify and validate a WSP — test results should not be seen as a surrogate for a comprehensive
control strategy (Bentham, 2002).

Conditions and frequency of testing
The heterotrophic plate count (HPC) technique (also known as heterotrophic colony count,
total colony count, total viable count and total heterotrophic count) is useful in assessing the
efficacy of antimicrobial treatments of cooling tower water (WHO, 2004).
Microbial testing should preferably be carried out in a laboratory that is competent and accredited
to do this work. If dipslides are used to test environmental samples (e.g. from cooling tower
waters), an incubator should be used for temperature control, and the slides should be incubated
at 30 ºC for at least 48 hours before interpretation of the result. Dipslides are simple, convenient
and inexpensive, but their accuracy is limited. They are useful in detecting major changes in bacterial
levels and for verifying that a water treatment programme is being implemented. Periodic
counts by the agar plate method are required for a more reliable and reproducible assessment of
HPC. Regular (e.g. monthly) HPC on tower water should be undertaken, to assess the efficacy
of the biocide treatment and general cleanliness of the system. A count of 5 × 105 colony forming
units (CFU)/ml in HPC is an acceptable upper limit for treated tower water in a clean system
(HSE, 2004). If this level of HPC is exceeded, the frequency of testing should be increased to
weekly, until control has been re-established.

Culture techniques and detection limits
Deficiencies in culture sensitivity and precision (discussed in Chapter 11) diminish the use
of action levels as a meaningful control measure in cooling water systems. Any Legionella test
result should be considered in the light of the detection limit of the method used, which
should be clearly reported with test results.

Sampling
Chapter 11 discusses requirements for sampling.
Where open basins are involved, water samples should be taken below the surface of the water.
When samples are obtained from taps, it is preferable to select those that are connected directly
to pipes containing the circulating water. Sample taps should be clean and free of leaks and
external fittings, such as hoses. Taps should be run so that the entire length of the fitting is
flushed with water for at least 30 seconds before taking the sample.




84                                        LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
In certain circumstances, samples may be taken from locations that are not representative of
the bulk of the tower water. It may often be of interest to include sediment in the sample to
be analysed. When investigating a cooling tower implicated as a potential source of legionellosis
infection, it is essential to collect swab samples of biofilm in the sump or basin of the tower.
Timing of sampling for bacteriological analysis is important, particularly when shot dosing
of biocides is used. Sampling is best undertaken just before shot dosing, as this will demonstrate
the “worst case scenario” in the dosing cycle, and may indicate the need for corrective action
in the water treatment or cleaning programme.
Analytical results should be recorded as part of the documentation in the WSP. Records
should be kept for a period in accordance with local or national legal requirements.

Non-microbial tests
In addition to microbial testing, a number of other tests can be carried out on site, using samples
of cooling tower water. Most analyses are for parameters related to control of corrosion, scale
and particulate matter; they include measurements of temperature, pH, conductivity, chloride,
alkalinity, chromate and organophosphonate. Analysis of antimicrobials is generally limited
to oxidizing chemicals such as chlorine, bromine or chlorine dioxide. The concentrations of
non-oxidizing biocide can be determined in a well-equipped chemical laboratory, although
the methods used are often time consuming and expensive. Turbidity may be determined in
a laboratory or on site with a portable turbidity meter.

5.5 Management and communication
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.3 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in management and communication are to:
• develop supporting programs (Section 5.5.1)
• prepare management procedures (Section 5.5.2)
• establish documentation and communication procedures (Section 5.5.3).

5.5.1 Develop supporting programs
A supporting programme should be established, to train all operating staff to perform the required
monitoring and maintenance tasks. Also essential is authorization of regular servicing and
data collection by the owner of the building where the tower or condenser is located, or their
nominated representative.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  85
5.5.2 Prepare management procedures
This step involves preparing management procedures, including corrective actions, for normal
and incident conditions. Corrective actions include repairing defects, and possibly re-treating
or discarding water that might be contaminated, to ensure that unsafe water is not supplied.
For most cooling tower systems, if HPC results exceed 5 × 105 CFU/ml or show a dramatically
increasing trend, an investigation should be carried out to determine the cause. The investigation
should include:
• a check of the chemical dosing — where manual slug dosing of antimicrobial is undertaken,
  an examination of the relevant inspection reports concerning the amount and frequency
  of antimicrobial addition; where an automatic dosing system is installed, the check
  includes:
     – a check of the level of biocide in the storage container

     – an examination of the metering system for leaks, blockages and correct delivery of
        antimicrobial into the cooling tower water
• internal and external examination of the cooling tower should be for cleanliness, deterioration
  of construction materials and signs of tower pollution, including checking of the bleed-
  off rate.
Based on the results of investigations, corrective action may include:
• a complete review of the water treatment programme, in cooperation with a water treatment
  specialist
• remedial action, as required
• implementation of a routine cooling tower cleaning and disinfection procedure
• repeat water sampling for HPC after corrective procedures have been implemented
• performance of a new risk assessment after all corrective measures have been implemented.

5.5.3 Establish documentation and communication procedures
Table 5.2 gives an example of documentation for a routine monitoring and corrective action loop.

If an outbreak of legionellosis occurs in the vicinity of a tower, that tower should be considered
as a potential source of infection; a precautionary decontamination is appropriate. Water samples
should be taken from the most contaminated point, and tests commenced immediately. The
standard from the International Organization for Standardization ISO 5667 (ISO, 2001)
can be used in developing sampling methods. Samples should be taken as near to the heat
source as possible. The suspected tower can then be immediately decontaminated, rather than
waiting for the results of the bacteriological tests, which may take 3–14 days.
In an outbreak, an emergency corrective action will be required, and procedures should already
be in place and staff trained in their implementation (e.g. see Box 5.3, above).

5.5.4 Verification
As part of a regular auditing programme, the operator or their water treatment company
should inspect cooling towers at least monthly (although shorter intervals may be determined
by the risk assessment for the system). Additional access hatches may need to be provided, to
facilitate inspection and cleaning of parts of the tower.
In a system in which risk assessment indicates cause for concern, verification of control of the
system may be established by the routine assessment of Legionella concentrations in the cooling
system. This verification should not precede or replace the routine monitoring of control
measures established for the system.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  87
Isolation of Legionella from any system is likely to occur occasionally (Bentham, 2000).
Conducting comprehensive system risk assessments after positive test results should reduce
the incidence of such results. Periodic review of the number of positives recorded should be
used to assess whether a consistent level of control has been achieved and whether overall
control is improving. After the introduction of a new WSP or significant modification to the
system, the microbial test parameters described above should be applied. Verification of the
other control measures determined for the WSP should precede microbial testing.
With the fan off, the water flow throughout the tower should be viewed for unrestricted flow
from inside. If possible, drift eliminators should be examined for damage or excessive drift,
from both inside and outside.
The condition of the internal structure of the tower should be examined, with the fan, the
water pump and any dosing and filtering equipment switched off. Any deterioration of materials
(wood, metal, etc.) should be noted, particularly of the fill, the drift eliminator, the basin and
the water distribution system; a check should also be made for visible microbial growth.
More detailed inspections should be undertaken if the plant is shut down completely during
annual inspection. This provides the opportunity for examining the interior of pumps, sections
of pipework and heat exchange equipment.

5.6 Surveillance
The system assessment should be independently reviewed periodically (e.g. every two years) and
after any major changes to the system or management. The review should be undertaken by
a formal, competent authority.
The tower should be inspected under normal working conditions by an independent surveillance
team, wearing appropriate safety equipment to prevent the inhalation of aerosols. A number
of items can be examined externally; for example, the team might look for signs of microbial
growth, algae, water leaks, splashing and blockages or restrictions at air inlets. Where chemical
dosing equipment is installed, it should be examined for correct operation and for adequate
stock of chemicals.
Details of maintenance should be recorded to identify performance trends and for prompt
attention to faults reported by operational staff or building occupants. Maintenance procedures
should be constantly monitored to ensure adherence to clearly defined objectives. Any changes
to plant operation or modifications should be recorded in the maintenance manual.

Chapter 6 Health-care facilities

Martin Exner, Philippe Hartemann, Louise Lajoie
This chapter describes how a water safety plan (WSP) can be applied to assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella in health-care facilities. Infections acquired in a health-
care setting are referred to as “nosocomial”.
This chapter looks at different infection reservoirs in hospitals, such as cold and hot-water
systems or plumbing systems, cooling towers, bathing pools and dental units. For information
on infection control measures in cooling towers and bathing pools, the reader should consult
Chapters 5 and 8, respectively.
This chapter should also be read in conjunction with Chapter 3, which discusses the different
elements that make up a WSP, and shows how a WSP fits within the framework for safe water
quality developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). As explained in Chapter 3, a
WSP has 10 steps that fit within the three main areas of system assessment, monitoring and
management and communications (see Figure 3.2). A WSP must be comprehensive, and all
10 steps should be implemented in assessing and managing the risks associated with Legionella.
However, this chapter focuses on parts of the WSP where information specific to health-care
facilities is needed.

6.1 Background
In this chapter there is a risk assessment concerning different infection reservoirs in hospitals,
such as cold and hot-water systems or plumbing systems, cooling towers, bathing pools and
dental units. For infection control measures focusing on cooling towers and bathing pools,
refer to the relevant chapter of this guideline.
A WSP needs to be comprehensive; however, an overview of such a plan is shown in Table 6.1,
as an example of the type of information a plan might contain. As explained in Chapter 3, a
WSP is part of a framework for safe water quality that also includes health-based targets and
surveillance.
Nosocomial cases usually make up a small proportion of reported cases of legionellosis.
However, the proportion of cases that are fatal tends to be much higher with nosocomial
infections than with community-acquired infections. Therefore, health-care facilities have a
special responsibility for preventing Legionnaires’ disease.
Health-care facilities include hospitals, health centres, hospices, residential care facilities and
dialysis units. These institutions are settings in which people with predisposing risk factors
for Legionella infections are more likely to be present, and in which medical devices that can

disseminate Legionella into the lower respiratory tract are used (such as medical humidifiers,
inhalation devices and respiratory therapy equipment). Retirement homes should be considered
with health-care facilities, as people with predisposing risk factors are likely to live there; and
several cases of legionellosis have been reported among residents of retirement homes
(Campese & Decludt, 2002b).
Cooling towers were originally thought to be the main source of nosocomial legionellosis, after
the bacteria were isolated from a cooling tower near a hospital dealing with cases of Legionnaires’
disease (Dondero et al., 1980). For example, the world’s biggest outbreak of legionellosis (Murcia,
Spain in 2001 with 449 confirmed cases) was shown by epidemiological and microbiological
investigation to be associated with the air‑conditioning cooling towers of a city hospital (Garcia-
Fulgueiras et al., 2002). However, many nosocomial cases have been associated with piped
hot and cold-water distribution systems (Sabrià & Yu, 2002); ice made with water containing
legionellae has also been incriminated as a source of infection in hospitals, when patients
have been given ice cubes to suck (Stout, Yu & Muraca, 1985).
Underlying disease is a major risk factor for acquiring Legionnaires’ disease. Since the major
mode of transmission is aspiration, patients with chronic lung disease or those who undergo
surgery requiring general anaesthesia are at greater risk. One of the highest incidence rates of
nosocomial Legionnaires’ disease was in a population of surgical head and neck cancer
patients. This group of people has a propensity for aspiration, as a result of their oral surgery
(Johnson et al., 1985). Nasogastric tubes have been linked to nosocomial legionellosis in several
studies, with microaspiration of contaminated water the presumed mode of entry (Blatt et al.,
1994; Venezia et al., 1994). It is unlikely that colonization of the oropharynx by L. pneumophila
leads to transmission (Bridge & Edelstein, 1983; Pedro-Botet et al., 2002).
Heart transplant patients have been shown to have a high incidence of Legionnaires’ disease
(Hofflin et al., 1987; Mathys et al., 1999), whereas bone marrow transplant patients have a low
incidence (Chow & Yu, 1998). Corticosteroid administration is an independent risk factor
(Carratala et al., 1994; Lepine et al., 1998).
For people with predisposing risk factors, there is not only a higher risk of infection but also
a higher case–fatality rate (up to 50%) than in other settings, as a consequence of their often
immunosuppressed or predisposing status (Yu, 2000). Paradoxically, patients with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) appear not to be at increased risk for nosocomial
Legionnaires’ disease (Gutiérrez et al., 1995).

6.1.1 Surveillance data on nosocomial Legionnaires’ disease
Between 1980 and 2001, 4021 cases of Legionnaires’ disease in residents of England and
Wales, United Kingdom were reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre’s
National Surveillance Scheme — an average of 183 cases per year. Of the total number of
cases, 269 were linked to hospital-acquired infection (PHLS, 2002).


90                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
For 1999 and 2000, a total of 384 cases of Legionnaires’ disease among residents of England
and Wales were reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service. Of these patients, 19 (5%)
acquired their infection in hospital. In 1999, there were seven single cases of Legionnaires’
disease among residents of England and Wales. Five of the seven people affected were
immunosuppressed, two were renal transplant patients and one was a cardiac transplant patient.
In 2000, 12 cases with five deaths were considered to be nosocomial. Half of these cases were
immunosuppressed, and three were associated with an outbreak in a hospital that had had a
previous outbreak (PHLS, 2002).
Table 1.7 in Chapter 1 shows the exposure setting for Legionnaires’ disease cases in France between
1999 and 2002. Due to an improvement in notification of legionellosis, the total annual
number of cases reported in France from 2000 to 2003 increased. However, the percentage of
nosocomial cases decreased annually and significantly, from 20% in 2000 to 9% in 2003. During
the same period, the percentage of cases reported in people staying in hotels and at camp sites
increased from 9% to 13% (Campese, 2004). This has been interpreted as a reflection of the
impact of measures taken by health institutions to control the risk of Legionnaires’ disease
following a ministerial circular in 1998.

6.2 Water safety plan overview
A WSP needs to be comprehensive; however, an overview of such a plan is shown in Table 6.1,
as an example of the type of information a plan might contain. As explained in Chapter 3, a
WSP is part of a framework for safe water quality that also includes health-based targets and
surveillance.
The remainder of this chapter provides information relevant to a WSP specific for potable
water and in-building distribution systems, for each of the three main areas of a WSP:
• system assessment (Section 6.3)
• monitoring (Section 6.4)
• communication and management (Section 6.5).
Sections 6.3–6.5 should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3 from Chapter 3.
Fundamentally, the responsibility for managing the risk of legionellosis belongs to the owner
or manager responsible for the potable water or in-building distribution system. To ensure
that the WSP is properly implemented, the owner or manager of the facility should assign
tasks, ensure that documentation is complete and current, and hold people accountable.

6.3 System assessment
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.1 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in system assessment, some of which are discussed further below, are to:
• assemble a team to prepare the WSP
• document and describe the system (Section 6.3.1)
• assess hazards and prioritize risks (Section 6.3.2)
• assess the system.

6.3.1 Document and describe the system
A system assessment for health-care facilities should consider the well-described infection
reservoirs in community-acquired Legionnaires’ disease; for example, potable and in-building
water systems (discussed in Chapter 4) and cooling towers and evaporative condensers (discussed
in Chapter 5); in addition, the assessment should assess the type of health care provided, and
the immune and health status of the individuals using the facilities. Table 6.2 details the types
of system components that should be considered.

6.3.2 Assess hazards and prioritize risks
This step involves collecting and evaluating information on specific hazards associated with
health-care settings, and conditions leading to their presence, to decide which are significant
for safety and therefore should be addressed in a safety plan. The hazards considered here
include those associated with the system components listed in Table 6.2.

Hot and cold-water systems — risk factors
The risk of nosocomial Legionnaires’ disease associated with the colonization of hot and
cold-water systems by Legionella is well established. For example, Joly & Alary (1994) performed
a follow-up study for 9 months at 20 hospitals, and found that the 10 hospitals containing
readily detectable Legionella experienced significantly more frequent cases of Legionnaires’
disease than did the 10 hospitals where Legionella was not readily detected (P = 0.054).
A five-year prospective study in 20 hospitals in Spain analysed the incidence of new cases of
nosocomial legionellosis. In 64.7% of hospitals, Legionella-positive water cultures were found
and nosocomial legionellosis was diagnosed; however, in hospitals where Legionella was not
detected, no nosocomial legionellosis was reported. The reported incidence of nosocomial
legionellosis has increased significantly since environmental studies increased detection of the
organism (Sabrià et al., 2004).
The proportion of distal sites in the water system of a hospital that are positive for Legionella
directly correlates with the incidence of Legionnaires’ disease; that is, the greater the percentage
of sites holding Legionella, the more likely it is that cases will occur. The opposite is also true
— if Legionella is not detected in the water supply, cases will not occur (Stout & Yu, 2001).
Based on the evidence of a link between the colonization of hot and cold-water systems in
hospitals and other buildings and the risk of a Legionella infection, Exner et al. (1993) investigated
hospitals, residential units and other buildings that could be affected by the colonization of
water systems with Legionella. The study distinguished between:
• a local or non-systemic colonization (defined as a colonization of isolated parts of the system,
  such as water outlets or shower heads)
• a systemic colonization of the water system (defined as a colonization of the whole system,
  including the central parts of the water supply).
Table 6.3 shows the type of colonization of water distribution systems by Legionella in health-
care facilities in Germany.

Source: Adapted from Exner et al. (1993)


In a study in Spain, L. pneumophila was isolated from 17 out of 20 (85%) hospital potable hot-
water systems (Sabrià et al., 2001). Each hospital had its own unique DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) subtype, reflecting systemic colonization (as defined by Exner et al., 1993, above).

Cooling towers and evaporative condensers — risk factors
Because evaporative condensers are an important potential infection source for hospital-acquired
pneumonia, they are considered briefly here, although they are covered in detail in Chapter 5.
In Germany, investigations of evaporative condensers mainly in hospital areas found high
concentrations of L. pneumophila, with 13 out of 15 condensers having concentrations above
104 CFU/litre (colony forming units per litre) (Pleischl, Krizek & Exner, 2002). The causes
of the high concentrations were insufficient cleaning and disinfection, and low maintenance
of the evaporative condensers.
In hospitals, the risk of legionellosis from cooling towers appears to be much higher than the
risk from showers. According to this risk assessment model (Ambroise & Hartemann, 2005),
the annual median risk of clinical legionellosis cases for people exposed to daily showers is
(Prof P Hartemann, Faculté de médecine de Nancy, pers comm, July 2006):
• less than 1 in 100,000 people for a concentration of less than 1000 CFU/litre of L. pneumophila
  serogroup 1 in hot water
• less than 1 in 10,000 people for concentrations of more than 2 × 105 CFU/litre of L. pneumophila
  serogroup 1 in hot water.



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                 95
A risk assessment for cooling towers and evaporative condensers in health-care facilities should
take into account the proximity of cooling tower exhausts to the air inlets for wards housing
high-risk patients, such as those who have undergone renal transplants.

Respiratory apparatus and tubing — risk factors
In addition to the normal inhalation risks, patients in health-care facilities are at greater risk
when forced to inhale water in respiratory devices that may contain legionellae (Marrie et al.,
1991; Blatt, Parkinson & Pace, 1993; Yu, 1993; Venezia et al., 1994; Kool et al., 1998). For
example, inhalation of contaminated aerosols may occur when tap water is used to rinse or
fill respiratory devices, tubing for use in mechanical ventilation machines and chambers of
hand-held medication nebulizers. Nosocomial aspiration pneumonia has been reported in
patients, particularly after surgery where there is intubation (Blatt, Parkinson & Pace, 1993;
Yu, 1993; Venzia et al., 1994). Patients with Legionnaires’ disease were found to have undergone
tracheal tube placement significantly more often or to have been intubated for significantly
longer than patients with other types of pneumonia (Yu, 2000).
A retrospective review of microbial and serological data from the laboratories of a hospital in
the United States of America (USA) dealt with clusters of cases of Legionnaires’ disease among
hospitalized patients (Kool et al., 1998). By reviewing the charts of patients over a period of
10 years, the authors identified 25 culture-confirmed cases of nosocomial or possibly nosocomial
Legionnaires’ disease, in which 12 patients (48%) died. For cases that occurred before 1996,
intubation was associated with increased risk of disease. High-dose corticosteroid medication
was strongly associated with a risk for disease. Six or seven available clinical isolates were
identical and were indistinguishable by pulse-field gel electrophoresis from environmental
isolates from the water system.

Birthing pool water — risk factors
The important role of pool water — especially of hot tubs — as infection reservoirs of Legionella
is well established (see Chapter 8). The first report of a newborn contracting L. pneumophila
pneumonia after water birth was in 2001 (Franzin et al., 2001). Because the hospital water
supply and, particularly, the pool water for water birthing were contaminated by L. pneumophila
serogroup 1, the newborn was infected — perhaps by aspiration — after a prolonged delivery
in the contaminated water.

6.4 Monitoring
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.2 of Chapter 3. The steps
involved in monitoring, some of which are discussed below, are to:
• identify control measures (Section 6.4.1)
• monitor control measures (Section 6.4.2)
• validate effectiveness of the WSP.

96                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
6.4.1 Identify control measures
This section should be read in conjunction with Chapters 4 and 5, which provide control measures
for potable water, in-building systems, cooling towers and evaporative condensers. Control
measures must be implemented in evaporative condensers installed in or near hospitals. In
Britain, most cooling towers have been removed from hospitals following a major outbreak
of legionellosis in 1985 (J Lee, Health Protection Agency, UK personal communication, June
2005). Where high-risk patients are housed, additional precautions should be considered,
such as installation of high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filters on the air inlet and
monitoring of both the cooling systems and patients. One of the most effective control measures
is to maintain a temperature outside the range of 25–50 °C in the network, as discussed in
Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.

Hot and cold-water systems — control measures
The guidance given here relates to general hospital hot and cold-water systems. In high-risk
areas, such as transplant centres and intensive care units, water from the outlet should be free
of Legionella (no colonies detectable in 1 litre of water). If this cannot be achieved within the
system then point-of-use filters will be needed at the outlet. Ice should be made either from
water that has had Legionella removed by filtration, or from heat-sterilized water.
If there is only an isolated colonization of a distal site, it is possible to flush out Legionella from
the site (for example, from a water tap). In the case of a systemic colonization of the water
distribution system, even intensive flushing causes no sustained reduction of legionellae.
In one study mentioned above (Kool et al., 1998), the water system was extensively modified,
and no further cases were identified in the hospital in the following year. The authors concluded
that Legionella can colonize hospital potable water systems for long periods, resulting in an
ongoing risk for patients, especially those who are immunocompromised. In the investigated
hospital, nosocomial transmission possibly occurred for more than 17 years before it was finally
interrupted in 1996 by extensively modifying the water system as a substantive control measure.
Point-of-use filters may also be used to mitigate the risk of legionellae.
Analysis of hot and cold-water systems for Legionella is no substitute for control measures;
rather, it is a verification that control measures are working.

Respiratory apparatus and tubing — control measures
Water that is used to rinse and clean respiratory apparatus should be sterile.
Because of the seriousness of nosocomial Legionella infections and the availability of low-cost sterile
water (proven to be effective in reducing proliferation of legionellae), sterile water should be
used in high-risk equipment such as respiratory devices, to avoid exposing at-risk hospitalized
patients to hospital water. Sterile water should also be used for rinsing and cleaning humidifiers,
nebulizers and respiratory machines.


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                     97
Birthing pool water — control measures
Birthing pools should be designed for the purpose, and should be physically cleaned and
disinfected both before and after birth (noting that the high amount of organic material will
inactivate residual biocides). Where hoses are used for filling, they and any connectors should
be disinfected before use. A risk assessment and pool management plan should be designed
that takes into account the intermittent use and storage conditions of the pool. Disposable
liners are available for pools.

Disinfection — control measures
Monochloramine is likely to be more effective for disinfection than free chlorine, because it
is more resistant and a residual is more likely to persist to the point of delivery; also, it is more
likely to penetrate biofilms. Hospitals supplied with drinking-water treated with monochloramine
as the residual disinfectant have been shown to be less likely to have a reported outbreak of
Legionnaires’ disease than those using water treated with free chlorine. In contaminated hospitals,
the proportion of sites testing positive was inversely related to the free residual chlorine
concentration (P = 0.01) (Kool, Carpenter & Fields, 1999; Kool et al., 1999).

6.4.2 Monitor control measures
This step involves defining the limits of acceptable performance and how these are monitored
(i.e. what will be monitored, and how, when and by whom). Again, this section should be
read in conjunction with Chapters 4 and 5.
To protect the most vulnerable patients in hospitals, there are distinct requirements, which
depend on the risk estimation. For example, one requirement might be to maintain legionellae-
free water in systems that produce aerosols in showers, in wards or in hospital rooms where
there are immunocompromised patients.
The results of monitoring allow corrective actions (discussed in Section 6.5.1, below) to protect
public health to be taken.

6.5 Management and communication
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.3 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in management and communication are to:
• develop supporting programs
• prepare management procedures (Section 6.5.1)
• establish documentation and communication procedures (Section 6.5.2).




98                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
6.5.1 Prepare management procedures
This step involves preparing management procedures, including corrective actions, for normal
and incident conditions. Box 6.1 provides an example of limit values set for Legionella
concentrations in water used in health-care settings.

  Box 6.1 Example of limit values for Legionella concentrations and microbiological
           indicators in water used in health-care settings in France
  Limit values
  For patients with classical individual risk factors such as the elderly, those with alcoholism
  or tobacco addiction:
  • target level           <1000 CFU/l          Legionella pneumophila
  • alert level            1000 CFU/l           Legionella pneumophila
  • maximum level          10,000 CFU/l         Legionella pneumophila
  For high-risk patients, such as those with severe immunodepression, transplantation,
  corticotherapy with an equivalent dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day prednisolone for 30 days or
  more, or 5 mg/kg per day for 5 days or more:
  • target level           not detectable
  • alert level            250 CFU/l            Legionella spp.
  Microbiological indicators
  Aerobic flora at 22 °C and 36 °C. No variation above a 10-fold increase compared with
  the usual value at the entry point. One control per 100 beds per year, with a minimum of
  four controls per year.
  • Pseudomonas aeruginosa                      <1 CFU/100 ml quarterly
  • total coliforms		                           <1 CFU/100 ml quarterly
  Values may vary in other countries. Control measures should be implemented, these
  could include “point-of-use filters” fitted at the outlets.
  Because no detailed risk assessment has focused on the immunosuppressed, these
  values are based on the precautionary principle.

Samples must be taken immediately:
• if there are signs that the water system is not under control
• after periods of stagnation
• after work on the distribution system, etc.

The target levels defined in Box 6.1 are seen as the best way to minimize the risk. The alert
level is designed to ensure that relevant people are informed, and that corrective actions (e.g. a
review of the procedure for maintenance, or new controls) are instigated. When the maximum
level is reached, disinfection of the water distribution system must be organized and the
procedure for maintenance revised. Additionally, an independent body (e.g. local sanitary
authorities) should carry out a new inspection before authorization for reuse is given.
Operationally, control measures, such as temperature, disinfectant residual and pH should be
monitored on line, as discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.
Every case of nosocomial legionellosis constitutes an alert, meaning that other cases may have
occurred or could occur in the future in the health‑care facility (which would constitute an
outbreak; see Box 6.2). Where there is a possibility of a nosocomial case, it should always be
investigated.


  Box 6.2 Definition of a nosocomial outbreak
  A nosocomial outbreak is defined as two or more confirmed cases of legionellosis in the
  same hospital or residential institution within a six-month period.
  Location of the outbreak is defined in terms of geographical proximity of the cases and
  requires a certain level of judgement.


The WSP and system assessment for control of Legionella in the hospital and the maintenance
records must be reviewed by the following people, working together:
• the incident and outbreak management control team
• the person responsible for Legionella control
• the appropriate hospital engineer
• the infection control physician (hospital hygienist).
The aim of the review is to ensure that the preventive procedures identified as necessary to
prevent proliferation of and exposure to Legionella are followed. Any deficiency in the control
procedures should be remedied as soon as possible. Sampling should be undertaken, followed
by precautionary disinfection of parts of the water system, if this is considered to be justified.
The incident and outbreak control management team should always include an expert in
environmental monitoring of Legionella. Researchers should not be confined to the index case;
it is important to also look for other previously undetected cases of legionellosis. The search
should look for other confirmed or presumptive cases of Legionnaires’ disease associated with
the hospital or community, unexplained cases of nosocomial pneumonia in patients (especially
those with impaired immunity), and pneumonia in hospital staff.



100                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Until the situation is under control, a critical review of every presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia
in the hospital or residential institution must take place. It is the responsibility of the infection
control doctor or hygienist to declare an outbreak and consider the measures outlined in
Box 6.3.


  Box 6.3	 Recommended corrective actions as part of an outbreak investigation
  • Shut down any process capable of generating and disseminating airborne water droplets,
    and keep the system shut down until sampling procedures and any remedial disinfection,
    cleaning or other intervention have been completed. Final clearance to restart the system
    may be required.
  • Take appropriate samples from the system before any emergency disinfection is
    undertaken, for use in investigating the source of the outbreak.
  • Review and monitor staff health records to find out whether there are any further,
    undiagnosed cases of illness, and to help prepare case histories for affected people.
  • Review water systems records, and investigate any equipment or systems that could
    have been involved in the outbreak. For example, this may involve tracing all pipework
    runs, and taking statements from plant operative managers and from water treatment
    contractors or consultants. Any infringement of relevant legislation may be subject to
    formal investigation.
  • If a cooling water system has been identified as the source of an outbreak of Legionnaires’
    disease, emergency cleaning of the system should be carried out as soon as possible
    (see Chapter 5).
  • If a water system other than a cooling system is involved in an outbreak of Legionnaires’
    disease, an emergency treatment of that system should be carried out as soon as
    possible.


6.5.2 Establish documentation and communication procedures
Table 6.4 gives an example of documentation for a routine monitoring and corrective action
loop for a hot and cold-water system (see Chapter 5 for information on corrective action for
cooling towers).

6.5.3 Verification
The frequency of verification monitoring of control measures for Legionella depends on the status
of the system:
• In water systems treated with biocides, where storage and distribution temperatures are
  lower than the recommended temperatures, samples should be analysed for Legionella on
  a monthly basis. After a year, test results should be reviewed. The frequency of testing may
  be reduced when confidence in the efficacy of the biocide regime has been established.
• In systems in which control levels are not being achieved consistently through the treatment
  regime, more frequent samples for analysis of Legionella (e.g. weekly) should be taken until
  the system is brought back under control (see Chapter 3). This action may also form part
  of a corrective action procedure.
• In hospital wards with high-risk patients, testing for Legionella is recommended. The results
  must be reviewed (HSC, 2000).
Verification requirements for cooling towers are discussed in Chapter 5.
Appropriate diagnostic testing for Legionella is necessary and is discussed in Chapter 11.

Chapter 7 Hotels and ships

Roisin Rooney, John V Lee, Sebastian Crespi, Guillaume Panie, Pierre Franck Chevet, Thierry Trouvet
and Susanne Surman-Lee
This chapter describes how a water safety plan (WSP) can be applied to assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella in hotels and ships.
It should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3, which discusses the different elements that
make up a WSP, and shows how a WSP fits within the framework for safe water quality
developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As explained in Chapter 3, a WSP has 10 steps that fit within the three main areas of system
assessment, monitoring and management and communications (see Figure 3.2). A WSP must
be comprehensive, and all 10 steps should be implemented in assessing and managing the
risks associated with Legionella. However, this chapter focuses on parts of the WSP where
information specific to hotels and ships is needed.

7.1 Background
The first detected outbreak of legionellosis occurred in a hotel in Philadelphia, United States
of America (USA) in 1976. Subsequently, many other cases of legionellosis have been associated
with hotels worldwide. Travel and hotel stays are recognized as risk factors for legionellosis
(WHO, 1990). In Europe, approximately 20% of detected legionellosis cases are considered
to be travel associated (Joseph, 2002b).

7.1.1 European initiatives
Most of the data currently available on the cases of legionellosis associated with travel and
hotel stays originate from the European Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated Legionnaires’
Disease, established in 1987 by the European Working Group for Legionella Infections
(EWGLI). This system — now called EWGLINET — was established principally to enable
rapid identification of legionellosis outbreaks among tourists of different nationalities. Its
history and current activities are described in detail on the EWGLINET web site. The need
for a specific surveillance system for travel-associated legionellosis in the USA has also been
recognized (Benin et al., 2002; Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002).
Cases of legionellosis occurring in hotels have often received extensive publicity in the mass media.
Additionally, the growing importance of international tourism, and the significance of morbidity

and mortality of hotel-associated legionellosis, justify the attention given to this issue by the
tourism and medical community. Since the implementation of the European Community’s
Directive for Package Travel in 1996, the International Federation of Tour Operators in Europe,
together with some tour operators in individual European countries, has been informed of
travel-associated cases of Legionnaires’ disease in people who purchased holidays through tour
operators. The aim of this scheme was to prevent additional cases (Anon, 1996a).
The European tourism industry has developed several initiatives to reduce travel-associated cases
(Cartwright, 2000). In some regions and countries with important tourist industries, such as
the Balearic Islands (Spain), Portugal and Malta, tourist and health authorities have issued
specific recommendations for the prevention of legionellosis in tourist accommodation. In
2002, the European Guidelines for the Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires’
Disease were introduced (EWGLI, 2003).
The number of detected and reported cases of travel-associated legionellosis in Europe rose
between 1994 and 2003 (see Figure 7.1). In 1996, travel-associated cases made up 16% of the
total number of detected legionellosis cases in Europe; in 1999, they made up 21%. Of these
cases, 90% were associated with hotels or apartments; the rest were associated with camp
sites, cruise ships, private houses and other sites (EWGLI, 2001).
The sex and age distributions of travel-associated legionellosis cases differ little from those of
other cases: they occur mainly in the fifth and sixth decades of life, and with an incidence in
men that is approximately three times as high as in women (Ricketts & Joseph, 2004). The
mortality rate in travel-associated cases in Europe has dropped over the years, from 10–12%
in the early 1990s to 6% in 2003 (Ricketts & Joseph, 2004). This trend probably reflects the
improved treatment that follows rapid diagnosis of the illness due to the introduction of the
urinary antigen assay (see Chapter 11).
Tourism-associated legionellosis exhibits a clear seasonal distribution that corresponds to the
holiday periods usually chosen by older tourists. Most European cases occur between May and
November, with the highest peaks in June and September (EWGLI, 1999, 2001, 2004ab).
These peaks have been attributed to tourists without school‑age children preferring not to
holiday during July and August, when the average age of tourists is generally younger, because
of school breaks.

  7.1.2 Hotel-associated cases
  Although the origin of most sporadic travel-associated cases is unknown, outbreaks have been
  associated with hotels. Systematic investigation of sporadic travel-associated cases may shed
  some light on their origin. A major challenge in determining the true source of cases is usually
  the lack of clinical isolate from the patients. Since the method of diagnosis has moved towards
  use of urinary antigen detection, it is now rare to have an isolate of Legionella from a patient
  to compare by molecular typing methods with one from the environmental source.
  Approximately 60% of hotel-associated cases of legionellosis are sporadic (EWGLI, 2003). The
  epidemiological relationship between these sporadic cases and the hotel in question is considered
  to be weak and is often not properly investigated, although it has occasionally been possible to
  show a causal relationship (Muhlenberg, 1993). When there are several cases, constituting an
  outbreak, there is an increased probability that the hotel will be the source of infection, and
  such cases are usually investigated by the health authorities. The epidemiological relationship
  between clusters and hotels has been corroborated microbially in several outbreaks, including
  those affecting tourists of different nationalities (Joseph et al., 1996).

7.1.3 Ship-associated cases
Legionnaires’ disease was first associated with a ship in 1977 (Rowbotham, 1998). At least 55
incidents (outbreaks or cases) were associated with cruise ships, ferries, cargo ships, fishing
vessels or naval ships between 1977 and 2004. Outbreaks of two or more cases are summarized
in Table 7.1. Some of these incidents have been linked to ship’s water systems, air-conditioning
systems and recreational hot tubs. However, in the majority of cases, the source of the
infection and/or the mode of transmission were not established.
The risk of exposure to Legionella on ships is difficult to assess. Surveys carried out on general
cargo ships have shown drinking-water and air-conditioning systems to be contaminated with
L. pneumophila. Serologic surveys of some seafarers on cargo ships showed that a high proportion
had antibodies to L. pneumophila, suggesting that those on some ships could be at increased
risk of legionellosis compared with communities on shore (Temeshnikova et al., 1996).
The number of outbreaks and cases reported in the literature is probably an underestimate of
the true incidence of the disease. As for hotels, outbreaks and cases associated with ships,
especially ferries, are difficult to detect because the incubation period of 2–10 days or more
(see Chapter 1) means that passengers may have dispersed widely, including to different countries,
before developing symptoms. To detect such outbreaks, an international surveillance scheme,
such as the European Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease, is necessary
(see Section 7.1.1).
Even when an outbreak or cluster of cases is detected on a ship or ferry, it is often difficult to
implicate that vessel as the source of infection, if passengers disembarked at different locations
or stayed in hotels before or after the voyage. Tracking previous incidents associated with
ships can also be a problem if the vessel’s name has changed, particularly if ownership has also
changed. To implicate a particular source during an outbreak investigation, it is necessary to
isolate environmental strains of Legionella and match them with clinical isolates. However,
this is often more difficult to do for ships, because the suspect vessel will often have sailed to
another country before a case is recognized. Unless there is good cooperation between international
port health authorities and maritime authorities in different countries, ships may escape
adequate investigation.

108                                 LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
7.2 Water safety plan overview
WSPs are increasingly being recommended and implemented in hotels, because testing for
Legionella in hotel water systems has limited ability to prevent infections. This chapter should
be read in conjunction with Chapters 4–6 and Chapter 8, which cover most of the system
components found on ships and in hotels.
Developing a WSP for dealing with Legionella in hotels and ships involves the following steps:
The remainder of this chapter provides information relevant to a WSP specific for hotels and
ships, for each of the three main areas of a WSP:
• system assessment (Section 7.3)
• monitoring (Section 7.4)
• surveillance (Section 7.5).
Sections 7.3–7.5 should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3 from Chapter 3.

7.3 System assessment
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.1 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in system assessment, some of which are discussed further below, are to:
• assemble a team to prepare the WSP
• document and describe the system (Section 7.3.1)
• assess hazards and prioritize risks (Section 7.3.2)
• assess the system.

7.3.1 Document and describe the system
In addition to piped water distribution systems, Legionella has been isolated from many sources
in hotels and ships (see Box 7.1). All these sources need to be investigated, documented and
described in the system assessment as potential reservoirs of legionellae.

  Box 7.1 Potential sources of legionellae to be investigated in a system assessment
  Hotels
  Potential sources of legionellae in hotels include:
  • hot and cold-water storage tanks
  • shower heads
  • taps
  • toilet cisterns
  • hot tubs and swimming pools (both cold water and heated pools)
  • cooling towers
  • air-conditioning humidifiers
  • condensation trays in air-conditioners and fan coils
  • evaporative coolers
  • fire-fighting systems
  • irrigation systems
  • ornamental fountains
  • food humidifiers.
  Ships
  Potential sources of legionellae in ships include:
  • humidifiers (including food display units)
  • stagnant areas of pipework
  • air-conditioning (suspected) and handling units
  • regions on the ship with higher ambient temperatures on board than on shore
  • the general complexity of onboard water storage and distribution systems.

7.3.2 Assess hazards and prioritize risks
This step involves collecting and evaluating information on hazards and conditions leading
to their presence, to decide which are significant for safety and therefore should be addressed
in a safety plan.
A survey conducted in the United Kingdom showed that legionellae were more likely to be
found in hotels that had a large number of supply tanks and hot-water outlets, a high-capacity
calorifier, and piping made of a metal other than copper (Bartlett et al., 1985). In general, this
situation is what would be expected from our knowledge of the ecology of Legionella (discussed
in Chapter 2).




110                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
The risk of legionellosis is increased for those on board ships where legionellae are present in
the water systems. Cruise vessels, in particular, have many similarities to hotels in the complexities
and operations of their water systems. The risks in ships may also be exacerbated in a number
of ways, outlined in Box 7.2.

  Box 7.2	 Factors exacerbating risks on board ships
  • When at sea, a ship is a closed environment, and might provide additional opportunities
    for the transmission of airborne infection.
  • Water storage and distribution systems on ships are complex, and may provide greater
    opportunities for bacterial contamination as ship movement increases the risk of surge
    and back-siphonage.
  • The risk of sediments in tanks being resuspended and dispersed may be increased by
    the ship’s movement and by adjustments to the water levels in tanks to maintain the
    trim of the vessel.
  • Loaded water may vary in quality and temperature.
  • In some tropical regions, the risk of bacterial growth in the cold-water system is
    increased because of higher ambient temperatures.
  • Ships’ engine rooms are hot, and may affect water temperatures in pipes passing nearby.
  • The movement of the ship could increase the potential for the formation of aerosols
    (e.g. in air‑conditioning ductwork) where there would not be an equivalent risk ashore.
  • Proliferation could also result from long-term storage and stagnation of water in tanks
    or pipes, and this risk could be increased when vessels are laid up for several months.
  • Legionella can proliferate at temperatures sometimes experienced in stagnant warm
    water in ships’ plumbing systems, especially in tropical regions, and in storage tanks on ships.
  • Water can remain in a tank on a ship for a long time in comparison to on land, where
    storage is usually for less than 24 hours.

Regional aspects — risk factors
Travel-associated infections tend to be diagnosed in the country of residence, because symptoms
are often recognized after the patient returns home. The incidence of legionellosis in tourists varies
with the country of residence or the outbound country, and the country of infection. The differences
may be attributable to differences in diagnostic rates or reporting, rather than to a difference in
susceptibility. Historically, the United Kingdom has reported more cases to EWGLINET than
other countries, but France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands have increased their reporting
in recent years (EWGLI, 1999, 2001, 2004ab). This increase is probably due to a combination
of improved ascertainment (i.e. the determination through diagnostic methodology of whether
or not a person is infected with the disease) and improved surveillance. Cases from hotels have
also been reported from Japan (Suzuki et al., 2002); Sri Lanka (Wahala & Wickramasinghe,
2000); Beijing, China (Deng, 1993; Peng et al., 2000); Australia (Bell et al., 1996); Serbia and
Montenegro (Klismanicacute et al., 1990) and the Caribbean (Schlech et al., 1985).
LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                   111
The rates (per number of tourists) of infection among travellers vary with the country visited.
In the period 1997–2002, using the United Kingdom international passenger survey statistics,
Turkey was reported as the country with the highest incidence rate, with 10–20 cases per
million travellers. Spain, Italy, Greece and France had incidence rates of between one and
seven per million travellers (EWGLI, 1999, 2001, 2004ab). Taken together, the countries in
southern Europe show higher incidence than those in the north. However, there is a trend
towards more declared cases being associated with travel within the home country — in 42%
of all the reported travel-associated cases in 1999, infection was related to travel within the
country of residence (Joseph, 2002b).
There may be important regional variations within countries (Cano et al., 1999) and also
among hotels. Cases of recurrent colonization in hotels have been known for some time (Bartlett
et al., 1984). In certain geographical areas (e.g. Benidorm, Spain), a significant percentage of
cases have been associated with a small number of hotels (Crespi et al., 1999). Analysis of the
data held on the EWGLI database indicated that a hotel previously associated with a case is
15% more likely to have another case than a hotel that has not had a case in the past (Slaymaker,
Joseph & Bartlett, 1999). In Spain, of 34 hotels associated with clusters in the period from
1980 to 1999, more than one third (13 hotels) had repeated cases or clusters of cases of Legionella
on two or more occasions (Martin, Pelaz & Baladrón, 2000).
These data suggest that infections from Legionella in hotels are not distributed at random,
and that certain hotels tend to transmit Legionella persistently. This can sometimes be attributed
to a relaxation of controls put into place after an initial outbreak, but in other cases the factors
contributing to continuing transmission are unknown.

Hot and cold-water systems — risk factors
Most information about the source of legionellosis in hotels has been obtained from outbreak
investigations, which show that the most common source of infection in hotels is the water
distribution system, particularly the hot-water system. In Spain, the vast majority of hotel
outbreaks in which the source of infection was determined microbially (by showing that
clinical and environmental isolates were related) were associated with water distribution systems.
In addition, in 12 out of 14 hotels that had subsequent cases after a first outbreak, the origin of the
infection was shown to be the hot-water system specifically (Martin, Pelaz & Baladrón, 2000).
The piped water systems of hotels and other tourist accommodation such as apartment hotels
are particularly susceptible to colonization by legionellae, because they have large, complex water
systems with a high surface-to-volume ratio, and may be subject to seasonal use with long
periods of low usage or stagnation. In addition, staff turnover may be high, making it difficult
to maintain training and competence.
Legionellae have been isolated from hotel water distribution systems throughout the world.
A study of hotels in five European countries (Austria, Spain, Germany, Italy and the United
Kingdom) found an average colonization rate of 55%, ranging from 33% in the United


112                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Kingdom to 66% in Spain (Starlinger & Tiefenbrunner, 1996). In Mallorca, Spain, of 114 hotel
water systems sampled, 45.6% were positive for Legionella (Crespi et al., 1999). A survey in
the United Kingdom of 103 hotels between 1982 and 1984 found that Legionella was present in
20% of hotels in the north, 43% in the midlands and 52% in the south (Bartlett et al., 1985).
These studies also show that the prevalence of Legionella in a water distribution system correlates
to a large degree with the water temperature — isolation rates are highest in warm water systems,
particularly within a temperature range of 25–50 °C. Starlinger & Tiefenbrunner (1996) also
showed a positive correlation between the presence of Legionella and amoebae in some installations.
Few published data are available on the concentrations of Legionella in the piped water systems
of hotels that are colonized but have not been associated with outbreaks. In Germany, Habicht
& Muller (1988) detected concentrations of 101–103 CFU/ml in most of the samples analysed,
with a maximum of 105 CFU/ml.
Hot and cold-water systems on ships have also been implicated in a number of outbreaks.
Following an outbreak on a cruise ship in Italy in 1995 and 1996, strains of L. pneumophila
serogroup 1, identical by monoclonal subtyping and genomic fingerprinting, were isolated
from patients and the ship’s water supply, although the exact source of the infection was not
established (Pastoris et al., 1999). In 1998, an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease occurred on a
cruise ship that sailed to the Mediterranean and the Norwegian fjords (Arthur, 1998). Water
samples taken from the hot-water system at shower heads were contaminated with legionellae.
The ship was unable to maintain safe temperatures in both hot and cold-water systems, and
the chlorine dosing system on board the ship was not working effectively (Arthur, 1998). In
June 2001, two mechanics working on a cargo ship under repair in Barcelona, Spain were reported
to have died after contracting Legionnaires’ disease. The mechanics had been working with
the pump of the ship’s water system. Molecularly indistinguishable isolates of L. pneumophila
serogroup 1 subgroup Pontiac (Knoxville) were isolated from one of the patients and from
the cooling water circuit valve of the ship’s pump (Cayla et al., 2001).

Hot tubs and recreational pools — risk factors
Hot tubs are installed on many cruise ships and on some ferries. The risks are similar to those
on land (see Chapter 8), and there have been several outbreaks on ships due to hot tubs. In
1994, a cruise ship had 50 cases of Legionnaires’ disease, spread over nine cruises. The disease
was believed to have been caused by inadequate bromination of the ship’s three hot tubs, and
the risk of acquiring Legionnaires’ disease increased by 64% for every hour spent in the hot
tub (Jernigan et al., 1996). Passengers spending time around the hot tub, but not in the
water, were also significantly more likely to have acquired infection. L. pneumophila serogroup 1
was isolated only from the sand filter of a hot tub (Jernigan et al., 1996).
In 1997, an outbreak occurred on a Rhine cruiser and affected six people. One man had fallen
into the cruiser’s hot tub and subsequently developed Legionnaires’ disease. Large numbers

of L. pneumophila were isolated from the pool (Rowbotham, 1998). In 2003, there were eight
cases and one death among passengers who had been on a cruise around Iceland. Strains of
L. pneumophila serogroup 1 that were indistinguishable by multilocus sequence typing were
isolated from the hot tub and hairdressing station, but not from anywhere else on the vessel,
and infection was epidemiologically linked with the hot tub (Lai et al., 2004). This latter
outbreak demonstrates the importance of international collaboration to investigate shipborne
outbreaks, since the cases were detected and investigated in Germany after the vessel had
docked there to disembark passengers, and it was investigated in its next port of call, in the
United Kingdom.

Air-conditioning — risk factors
There are no confirmed reports of outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease associated with air‑
conditioning systems on ships, but these systems have been suspected in some outbreaks. In
1984, a large outbreak on a cruise ship occurred after the air‑conditioning was turned on at
Bordeaux, France. No common source was discovered, but the epidemic curve indicated that
the air‑conditioning system contributed in some way to the outbreak (Rowbotham, 1998). In
another outbreak on a cruise ship in 1984, no source was identified, but the outbreak investigation
revealed problems with the air handling units (Christenson et al., 1986). Air‑conditioning
systems on ships are dry and do not have evaporative coolers; however, humidifiers (including
food display units) are often installed on ships and could generate aerosols. A study carried out by
Temeshnikova et al. (1996) identified L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in washings from air‑conditioning
equipment, and in samples from the mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation equipment
on ships.

7.4 Monitoring
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.2 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in monitoring, some of which are discussed below, are to:
• identify control measures (Section 7.4.1)
• monitor control measures (Section 7.4.2)
• validate effectiveness of the WSP.

7.4.1 Identify control measures
Since the introduction of the European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated
Legionnaires’ Disease in July 2002 (EWGLI, 2002, 2003), the number of hotel cases associated
with each identified cluster has reduced, indicating that control measures have been effective
in preventing further cases. In 2004, the proportion of clusters involving only two or three cases
reached almost 90%, compared with 84% in 2003 and 81% in 2002 (John Lee, Health Protection



114                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Agency, Legionella Section, United Kingdom, personal communication, October 2005).
Procedures for control and prevention of hotel-associated legionellosis have been published
elsewhere (Crespi, 1993; Anon, 1999; HSE, 2004). The European guidelines give detailed
definitions and procedures for responding to travel-associated cases (EWGLI, 2002, 2003).
Ship-associated Legionnaires’ disease is preventable. The principles for control of land-based
water systems and for WSPs applied to piped water supplies in the engineered building
environment (see Chapter 4) are applicable to the control of systems on ships.

Source water quality — control measures
International health regulations require ports to supply potable water to ships; however, there
is no requirement for potable water to be Legionella-free, and such a requirement would be
unrealistic. The water taken on board should be of potable quality and from a reliable source.
Since the reliability of the water supply cannot always be guaranteed, precautions should be
taken to ensure that the water is adequately disinfected on board.

Hot and cold-water systems — control measures
Primary and secondary methods of prevention and control, as applied to hotels, are based on
experience acquired in managing outbreaks and are largely empirical. These measures do not,
in general, differ from those that are applied to other types of buildings, in that they aim to
eradicate Legionella in the installations by means of a risk assessment that focuses on:
• factors leading to Legionella proliferation (e.g. the long periods of stagnation that occur in
  water systems in hotels and hotel rooms)
• implementation of remedial measures (e.g. removal of dead and blind ends, maintenance
  of elevated temperatures in the hot-water system, periodic disinfection and permanent
  chlorination of the cold-water system).
The efficacy of these measures in the control and secondary prevention of outbreaks is well
established, although they may be insufficient in hotels repeatedly associated with cases. An
example of a checklist specifically designed for water systems in hotels is provided in Appendix 1.
In ships, onboard exposure through piped water can be prevented by such water quality management
measures as:
• treating source water (where the water is non-potable)
• maintaining water temperatures outside the range in which Legionella proliferates (25–50 ºC)
• maintaining disinfection residuals greater than 0.2 mg/litre throughout the piped distribution
  system and storage tanks (WHO, 2004).

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                115
United Kingdom regulations stipulate that a concentration of at least 0.2 mglitre free residual
chlorine should exist at all outlets, and that water storage tanks should be cleaned at least
annually with 50 mg/litre for at least four hours (Department of Transport, 1986), which is
often accomplished by supplementary chlorination in the storage tanks and in distribution.
Since it is often difficult to maintain cold water at less than 25 ºC on ships, supplementary
chlorination is required to maintain disinfectant residual throughout the system; a level of
free chlorine will contribute to the control of Legionella in such circumstances (WHO, 2004).
Water flow in the distribution system should also be maintained during periods of reduced
activity.

Disinfection — control measures
A study of 62 hotels in the Balearic Islands, Spain (Crespi et al., 1998) investigated the use of
continuous hyperchlorination at 1–2 parts per million (ppm) of free residual chlorine in the
cold water, and intermittent thermal treatment in the hot water. Samples positive for Legionella
dropped from a level of 32.4–31.3%, after the first year of application, to 20% after three years
and to 6% after five years. Another study evaluated the systematic purging of the hot and
cold-water pipes in two hotels with water chlorinated at 1–1.5 ppm of free residual chlorine
(Moreno et al., 1997). Negative cultures were not obtained in the two hotels until five and seven
months respectively after the treatment, highlighting the recalcitrant nature of legionellae
and the need for repeated and diligent disinfection.

Temperature — control measures
Some buildings may not be able to raise their hot-water temperature sufficiently to control
Legionella growth; therefore, an on-line treatment such as chlorine or copper/silver ionization
should be considered. Chapter 4 has more information on control measures relating to
temperature in distribution systems.

Design, operation and maintenance — control measures
The control of Legionella in water distribution systems in hotels is difficult, and requires the
continuous and effective maintenance of preventive measures.
Hotel personnel responsible for the maintenance of hotel water systems must be educated
and qualified to perform these duties. The importance of training and education has been
recognized in a large number of published preventive guides. Data from the application of
training programmes are very encouraging, and suggest that education may be important in
preventing legionellosis in the tourist sector (Crespi & Ferra, 2002).




116                                    LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Given the complexity of distribution systems on ships, the chance of deadends and stagnation
is best reduced by proper design of storage tanks and pipes, both at the initial build and when
alterations are made, together with a flushing regime if water outlets are not being used regularly.
Preventing the risk of colonization during repair of the plumbing systems on ships deserves
special attention. Periodic maintenance and cleaning of the water storage tanks (i.e. draining,
physical cleaning and biocide treatment) should be carried out at least every six months.

Hot tubs and recreational pools — control measures
The risks from recreational pools and hot tubs on ships can be controlled in the same manner
as for pools on land, as described in Chapter 8 and in the World Health Organization Guidelines
for Safe Recreational Water Environments (WHO, 2006). The Centers for Disease Control in
the USA have issued guidelines for prevention of Legionnaires’ disease associated with hot
tubs on board cruise vessels (CDC, 1997b), and the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the UK has also produced guidelines for management
of hot tubs, which are as applicable at sea as they are on land (HPA, 2006), and update earlier
guidelines published by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS, 1994).

Air-conditioning — control measures
Humidifers or devices likely to amplify or disseminate the bacteria should be periodically
cleaned and replaced (Edelstein & Cetron, 1999). Special attention should be paid to the
proliferation of Legionella in humidifiers. Liquid should not be allowed to accumulate within
such units; they must drain freely and be easily accessible for cleaning.

7.4.2 Monitor control measures
Monitoring of systems in hotels and ships, including for facilities such as hot tubs and pools,
should largely follow the instructions set out in Chapters 4–6 and in Chapter 8.
Routine monitoring of the water system for Legionella has been used extensively in the hotel
sector, but its preventive efficacy is debatable; instead, WSPs are increasingly being recommended
and used in hotels.
If a source of Legionella transmission is identified, especially after an outbreak, a disinfecting
procedure (superheating or hyperchlorination) is recommended. Continued maintenance
and verification of controls should also be carried out.

7.5 Surveillance
Outbreaks could be detected at a very early stage on ships, if a routine surveillance system for
respiratory illness were implemented and if procedures for taking action when the number of
cases increases above a certain threshold were followed. As the incubation period of the disease
could be longer than the length of a cruise, outbreaks could go undetected, even if the ship
has a surveillance system in place. Thus, it is important for community physicians to enquire
about recent cruise ship travel if patients present with symptoms of pneumonic illness.
Routine surveillance by external authorities, such as through public health inspections of ships
by environmental health officers, should also be conducted, to pre‑empt disease outbreaks.

Chapter 8 Natural spas,
hot tubs and swimming pools

Susanne Surman-Lee, Vladimir Drasar, John V Lee
This chapter describes how a water safety plan (WSP) can be applied to assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella in natural spas, hot tubs and swimming pools.
It should be read in conjunction with Chapter 3, which discusses the different elements that
make up a WSP, and shows how a WSP fits within the framework for safe water quality
developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As explained in Chapter 3, a WSP has 10 steps that fit within the three main areas of system
assessment, monitoring and management and communications (see Figure 3.2). A WSP
must be comprehensive, and all 10 steps should be implemented in assessing and managing
the risks associated with Legionella. However, this chapter focuses on parts of the WSP where
information specific to natural spas, hot tubs and swimming pools is needed.

8.1 Background
Bathing has been recognized as a source of infectious disease for centuries; in the 16th century,
it was thought that syphilis, plague and leprosy were linked to bathing, and many public
pools were closed as a result. Today, there continue to be reports of outbreaks of infectious
disease linked to swimming pools, but these can be avoided by:
• good pool management, including adequate filtration and disinfection
• bathers observing advice to shower before entering pools
• bathers refraining from bathing if unwell with diarrhoeal disease.
Immersion in water can be both pleasant and therapeutic, and various techniques have been
used over centuries for a diverse range of physiological effects, such as healing injuries, reducing
swelling and cooling burns, and for psychological effects, such as calming psychiatric patients
(de Jong, 1997). The risk of Legionnaires’ disease from swimming pools, spas and hot tubs is
low if they are well managed.
This chapter covers swimming pools, spas and hot tubs; Box 8.1 explains what is meant by
each of these terms.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                 119
 Box 8.1 Types of pools

 Swimming pools
 Swimming pools may be supplied with fresh (surface or ground), marine or thermal water
 (i.e. from natural hot springs). Pools may be domestic (private), semi-public (e.g. hotel,
 school, health club, housing complex or cruise ship) or public (e.g. municipal) and they
 may be supervised or unsupervised. Swimming pools may be located indoors, outdoors
 (i.e. open air) or both; also, they may be heated or unheated.
 In terms of structure, the conventional pool is often referred to as the main, public or municipal
 pool. It is by tradition rectangular, with no extra water features (other than possible provision
 for diving), and it is used by people of all ages and abilities. Temporary or portable structures
 are often used in the domestic setting. In addition, there are many specialist pools for a
 particular user type — for example, paddling pools, learner or teaching pools, diving pools
 and pools with special features such as “flumes” or water slides. Although termed “swimming”
 pools, they are often used for a variety of recreational activities, such as aqua aerobics,
 scuba diving and so on.

 Plunge pools
 Plunge pools are generally used in association with saunas, steam rooms or hot tubs,
 and are designed to cool users by immersion in unheated water. They are usually only
 large enough for a single person, but can be larger. For the purposes of this document,
 they are considered to be the same as swimming pools.

 Hot tubs
 For the purposes of this document, the term “hot tubs” is used to denote various facilities
 that are designed for sitting in (rather than swimming), contain water usually above 32 ºC,
 are generally aerated, contain treated water, and are not drained, cleaned or refilled for each
 user. They may be domestic, semi-public or public, and may be located indoors or outdoors.
 They are known by a wide range of names, including spa pools, whirlpools, whirlpool
 spas, heated spas, bubble baths or Jacuzzi (a trade name that is also used generically).
 Both domestic hot tubs and those in commercial premises have dramatically increased
 in popularity in recent years; they are now found in sports centres, hotels, leisure and
 health spa complexes, on cruise ships and, increasingly, in the home environment.
 In some countries, especially when in health spa resorts, hot tubs may also be known as
 hydrotherapy spas or pools, though these terms are more usually applied to pools used
 within health‑care premises (e.g. physiotherapy departments) for treatment that may
 include swimming (see below).

 Whirlpool baths
 Whirlpool baths are a type of hot tub often found in bathrooms of hotel suites or private
 residences. They are fitted with high-velocity water jets and/or air injection but, unlike the
 hot tubs described above, the water is emptied after each use. They are mainly intended
 for a single individual, but double versions are available.

  Spas
  “Natural spa”, denotes facilities containing thermal and/or mineral water, some of which
  may be perceived to have therapeutic value. Because of their particular water characteristics,
  natural spas may receive minimal water-quality treatment.

  Hydrotherapy pools
  In addition, there are physical therapy pools, in which professionals perform treatments
  for a variety of physical symptoms on people with neurological, orthopaedic, cardiac or
  other diseases. These are termed “hydrotherapy pools”, and are defined as pools used
  for special medical or medicinal purposes. Hydrotherapy pools are not specifically covered
  by this document, although many of the principles that apply to swimming pools and hot
  tubs will also apply to them. There are also therapy pools containing small fish (Garra
  ruffa) which feed on the scaly skin lesions caused by psoriasis. These types of therapy
  pools are not covered here.

Legionellae have been isolated from swimming pool water and from pool filters (Jeppesen,
Bagge & Jeppesen, 2000; Leoni et al., 2001). However, as at 2005, no recorded outbreak of
Legionnaires’ disease has been directly associated with bathing in swimming pools. In contrast,
hot tubs have been associated with many outbreaks of infectious disease, including Legionnaires’
disease, for which they are the third most common source (Spitalny et al., 1984; McEvoy et al.,
2000; Benin et al., 2002; Den Boer et al., 2002; Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002; Nagai et al.,
2003). The high incidence of outbreaks associated with hot tubs is due to their increased
popularity in recent years. Table 8.1 shows the number of outbreaks related to hot tubs
between 2000 and 2003, in selected countries in Europe.

It is of some concern that hot tubs, particularly those intended for the domestic market, are
commonly found on display at exhibitions and garden centres, where they have not been
adequately treated. Just being in the vicinity of a hot tub on display has resulted in cases and
deaths due to legionellosis. One of the largest ever outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, with
21 deaths, was caused by a hot tub on display at a flower show in the Netherlands in 1999
(Den Boer et al., 2002). In the same year, a second outbreak (in Belgium) was linked to a hot
tub on display at a fair (De Schrijver et al., 2000). An outbreak of Pseudomonas folliculitis,
which occurred within two weeks of the installation of a domestic hot tub, was found to be
due to the hot tub having been on display before purchase, without appropriate treatment.
On investigation, the pool water yielded 8 × 104 – 5.5 × 105 CFU/100ml Ps. aeruginosa and
2.9 x 105 CFU/litre L. pneumophila serogroups 2–14. Typing of the Ps. aeruginosa isolates
from patients and pool showed they were indistinguishable.

Rare cases of Legionnaires’ disease have been associated with birthing pool use (Franzin et al., 2001),
and one where a spa pool was used as a birthing pool (Nagai et al., 2003) (see Chapter 6).
Various other types of pool are available, such as flotation tanks and small vessels used for
therapeutic use. There is no evidence to date of legionellosis associated with these but, as with
any water system, the potential for Legionella growth within such systems and for aerosol
production should be assessed, and an appropriate WSP put in place.
This chapter addresses the risk from infections caused by legionellae in recreational waters.
The risks to humans from other infectious diseases and chemicals is dealt with in the WHO
Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments, Volume 2 (WHO, 2006).

8.2 Water safety plan overview
A WSP needs to be comprehensive; however, an overview of such a plan is shown in Table 8.2,
as an example of the type of information a plan might contain. As explained in Chapter 3, a
WSP is part of a framework for safe water quality that also includes health-based targets and
surveillance.
The remainder of this chapter provides information relevant to a WSP specific for natural
spas, hot tubs and swimming pools, for each of the three main areas of a WSP:
• system assessment (Section 8.3)
• monitoring (Section 8.4)
• communication and management (Section 8.5)
• surveillance (Section 8.6).
Sections 8.3–8.6 should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3 from Chapter 3.

This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.1 of Chapter 3. The steps involved
in system assessment, some of which are discussed further below, are to:
• assemble a team to prepare the WSP (Section 8.3.1)
• document and describe the system (Section 8.3.2)
• assess hazards and prioritize risks (Section 8.3.3)
• assess the system.

8.3.1 Assemble the team
Managing the risk of Legionnaires’ disease requires a multidisciplinary approach, including
input from:
• designers
• architects
• manufacturers
• installers
• water treatment specialists
• microbiologists
• operatives and users.
It is important that all of these are informed about the potential risks from the systems covered
in this chapter.

8.3.2 Document and describe the system
In documenting and describing the system, all relevant information and documentation should
be compiled.

Where the design of swimming pools or other recreational water-based facilities includes a
water feature created spray (e.g. a fountain), the potential for transmission of legionellae from
aerosols should be considered.
System assessments of hot tubs have revealed an array of factors contributing to unhygienic
conditions and, potentially, predisposition to legionellae proliferation (see Box 8.2).


  Box 8.2 E
           xamples of problems found with balance tanks in hot tubs in commercial
          settings after a system assessment
  Problems identified with balance tanks during investigations of poor microbial quality in
  hot tubs include:
  • tanks found bricked up behind wall
  • a tank with a shower built on top of it
  • several tanks buried beneath the hot tub, so that access for cleaning is not possible
  • tanks constructed of materials that are difficult to clean, such as rough concrete
  • some tanks underground, within confined spaces, creating access problems for cleaning
  • one tank found to contain large amounts of builders’ rubble.


8.3.3 Assess hazards and prioritize risks
This section discusses generic risk factors, in line with the preceding chapters. Where appropriate,
and for ease of reference, it also looks specifically at recreational facilities such as hot tubs,
although this creates some repetition of information.

Source water quality — risk factors
In pools, the quality of source water is an important factor in preventing microbial growth within
the system. Where the source contains high numbers of background heterotrophic microorganisms,
or is high in organic content, there is potential for growth of Legionella in parts of the water
system that may be subject to a rise in temperature (e.g. in storage systems or near underwater
lighting or pumps).
Mineral water taken from hot springs is widely used in many spa treatment centres, where it
is claimed to be beneficial for relaxation and for its therapeutic effects. The thermal water, which
is high in mineral content, is usually drawn from underground boreholes, collected and then
distributed. Samples from these boreholes may contain small numbers of legionellae, but
high levels have been detected where such water is stored before distribution (Martinelli et al.,
2001). As many as seven different Legionella species or serogroups have been found in one thermal
water distribution system at a spa in the Czech Republic. The high mineral content of these
hot spring waters leads to deposition of scale on surfaces in the distribution network, increasing
the surface area for bacterial colonization.

Hosepipes may sometimes be used to fill hot tubs and other facilities. If the hose and/or
connectors have not been disinfected, the pool may be seeded with nuisance and harmful
microorganisms, such as Legionella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which will grow in damp
hosepipes left in warm environments.

Nutrients — risk factors
Nutrients for bacterial growth, originating from users of the facilities, are another factor to be
taken into account. The turbulence in hot tubs increases the risk of nutrients (e.g. dead skin
cells, cosmetics, body lotions and oils) being scoured from bathers. As the water is not drained
between users, the nutrients accumulate over the period of use, inactivating biocides and encouraging
microbial growth. Many users ignore advice to shower before using pools, increasing the
introduction of nutrients, faecal matter and urine.

Hot and cold-water systems — risk factors
A separate and additional risk of legionellosis arises from hot and cold-water systems including
showers in the vicinity of a swimming pool (Leoni & Legnani, 2001). Showers should be managed
as for hot and cold distribution systems in public buildings, and should be considered in the
Legionella risk assessment. Chapter 4 discusses risk assessments and control measures for piped
hot and cold-water systems.

Disinfection — risk factors
The bathing load, frequency of use and other factors that increase demand on the disinfectant
regime must be taken into account at the design stage. For example, hot tubs or natural spas in
health facilities that use seaweed therapies or mud treatments may have higher loads of nutrients.
In hot tubs in commercial premises, bathers often override the planned rest intervals (e.g. the water
and air jets automatically switching off for 5 minutes after every 15 minutes of use), which
would normally allow the hot tub to recover its effective disinfectant potential. The resulting
low disinfection residual increases the risk of colonization and growth of bacteria, including
legionellae. Bacteria colonizing and growing on surfaces (biofilms) are more resistant to biocides.

Temperature — risk factors
Legionella species can survive, but not grow significantly, in waters at temperatures below 25 ºC;
however, there is always a risk that legionellae will be present, albeit in small numbers, in the
water supplied to pools and their associated water systems (Hsu, Martin & Wentworth, 1984;
Ortiz-Roque & Hazen, 1987; Brooks et al., 2004).
Although the risk of Legionella growth is reduced in cold-water swimming pools, when water
is heated above 25 ºC, even in only part of the system, bacterial growth will occur in that region
and may then seed the rest of the system.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  127
In hot tubs, the temperature of the water is within the optimal range for the growth of
legionellae (30–42 ºC).

Design, operation and maintenance — risk factors
Thermal water systems, including hot tubs, are at a high risk of being a source of potentially
pathogenic microorganisms, including Legionella, if they are not designed, installed, managed
and maintained with control of microbial growth in mind. This also applies to hot tubs on
display, whether or not they are used for bathing.
Hot tubs have a high bather-to-water ratio; they also have an extensive surface area within the
pipes used to provide both the air and water-driven turbulence. These pipes are often inaccessible
and difficult to clean and drain, and may also have areas of low flow or stagnation allowing
biofilms to form as illustrated in Figure 8.1. Pipework above the water line, such as pipework
supplying air to the jets, does not usually receive any disinfection from the pool water; its
interior is often humid and allows biofilms to form.
Many hot tubs provide no suitable access to all areas of the plumbing system, such as the
balance tank, for cleaning, disinfection and maintenance. High levels of legionellae have been
found in pools that had areas of pipework with stagnant water (deadlegs) as a result of
modifications made to the system.

Hot tubs that are not effectively designed, installed, maintained and managed have a high
risk of causing outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, even when not being used
for bathing. Further, hot tubs may be sold after having been on display for several months.
An important factor for manufacturers to consider is the risk of growth of Legionella after
construction and leak testing. Residual water left stagnant in the system will grow biofilm
microorganisms, which could infect the pool water after the system has been purchased and
refilled. Additional risk factors for hot tubs in commercial and domestic settings are detailed
in Box 8.3.


  Box 8.3	 Additional risk factors for hot tubs in commercial and domestic settings
  Commercial settings
  • Heavy use can result in poor pH control and reduced concentrations of active biocide.
  • Staff might not be aware of safety issues because of high staff turnover or short-term
    employment, or because the hot tub is the only equipment that uses water (especially
    in small clubs, for example).
  • Operators might have insufficient information; for example, they might not know what
    to do if parameters are tested and found to be outside the acceptable range.
  Domestic settings
  • Owners often lack information or knowledge about the risks; they often also lack
    training on treatment and maintenance regimes.
  • Domestic spa pools are often located outdoors, where there are no convenient showers.
    Dust and debris can enter the pool, and windy or breezy conditions can dissipate
    biocide more rapidly.
  • Consistent control can be difficult if the hot tub is used and dosed intermittently.
  • A contaminated hosepipe might be used to fill the pool.


Because legionellae have been isolated from whirlpool baths, there is potential for infection
(Ishikawa et al., 2004; Susanne Surman-Lee, Health Protection Agency, United Kingdom,
personal communication, June 2005). Like hot tubs, whirlpool baths have an extensive array of
pipework beneath them, which provides a huge surface area for colonization.

Aerosols — risk factors
Bathers inhale aerosols at a short distance from the water surface, and the high humidity of
the environment increases the likelihood of survival of Legionella (Berendt, 1980; Hambleton
et al., 1983).
Various hydrotherapy treatments occur in some thermal spa resorts, including mouth irrigation,
vaginal douches and colonic irrigation. To date, there is no evidence of cases of Legionnaires’
disease directly linked to such procedures, but a risk assessment should take into account the
susceptibility of the users of such treatments.



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                             129
Where treatments involve the inhalation of thermal waters, there is an increased risk of exposure
to legionellae through inhalation directly into the lungs; nebulizers have been shown to be the
source of nosocomial cases (Mastro et al., 1991). Because the use of nebulizers and inhalers
involves inhaling fine aerosols, the devices must be filled with water that does not contain
potential pathogens such as legionellae, and the suitability of such treatments for high‑risk
patients must be assessed (see Chapter 6).

8.4 Monitoring
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 3.3.2 of Chapter 3. The steps
involved in monitoring, some of which are discussed below, are to:
• identify control measures (Section 8.4.1)
• monitor control measures (Section 8.4.2)
• validate effectiveness of the WSP.
Adequate controls, implemented and maintained in a well‑designed and well‑constructed
system, can ensure the safety of a pool, spa or hot tub. Any control system should be validated
and continually monitored to ensure that it works in the pool.

8.4.1 Identify control measures
People who operate hot tubs and pools must fully understand their entire system, and ensure
that it is managed and maintained to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents. The
management structure and staff involved will depend on the nature of the premises. Management
systems must be in place to ensure that operators have sufficient knowledge, competence,
experience and resources to understand and control the risks of infectious disease, including
legionellosis. Inadequate management, poor training and poor communication can all contribute
to outbreaks of infectious disease associated with these systems.
Because most hot tubs, spas and swimming pools are operated at temperatures conducive to
the growth of legionellae, temperature control cannot be relied on as a control measure in the
way it can in distribution and other systems. Therefore, the main control measures are cleaning,
operational procedures, disinfection, good source water quality, and maintenance of water quality.
This section should be read in conjunction with Chapter 4, which describes control measures
for such factors as source water quality and temperature.

Source water quality — control measures
The starting point for control of legionellae and other microorganisms is to ensure that the water
used for filling and topping up the pool is of good microbial quality and free from nutrient sources.




130                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Nutrients — control measures
Bathers have a responsibility to ensure hygienic practices, and should be encouraged to:
• shower before immersion, preferably using soap (adequate signs should be visible, explaining
  the need)
• adhere to limits set for the number of bathers allowed at any one time
• limit the time spent in the pool.
Ideally, the jet pumps of hot tubs should cut out automatically after 15–20 minutes, so that
bathers are encouraged to leave the water and the disinfectant levels allowed to recover (see
also Disinfection below).
Spa pools should have clearly visible information listing the range of pre-existing medical
conditions for which bathing in such pools is not recommended.
Because of the high bather-to-water ratio in hot tubs, it is important to ensure that the water
turnover is adequate. Guideline figures vary from six minutes in the United Kingdom (Health
Protection Agency, 2006) to one hour in New South Wales, Australia (New South Wales
Health, 1996).

Disinfection — control measures

Choice of disinfectant
The microbial and chemical quality of the water used for filling pools and hot tubs will affect
the efficacy of disinfection. Ideally, a detectable residual biocide level should be maintained
at all times, to prevent colonization of the system by microorganisms living in biofilms.
Biocides used in hot tubs and pools are commonly oxidizing biocides; for example, chlorine
or bromine, sometimes combined with additional treatment regimes such as ultraviolet (UV)
light or ozone. Because UV and ozone have no systemic residual effect, they should be used
with a residual biocide to improve control and reduce by-products. Alternatively, non-
oxidizing biocides, such as polyhexamethylene biguanide and copper/silver ionization (usually
with an oxidizing biocide) may be used. Particular features of hot tubs (such as elevated
temperatures, high turbulence, high organic load, the amount of sunlight present and natural
water chemistry) may affect the choice of disinfectant.
Halogen-based oxidizing disinfectants, such as chlorine, are most commonly used in pools and
hot tubs. They have the advantage of being relatively inexpensive, simple to use, easy to
measure on site, and active against most infectious organisms. Many commercial and chemical

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                       131
forms are available (e.g. gaseous, granular, liquid, tablet), with varying amounts of available
(free) chlorine, so it is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Sufficient
disinfectant should be added so that there is still free, active biocide after combination with
bacteria, urine and other organic pollutants. The free chlorine residual recommended by the
WHO for hot tub water is at least 1 mg/l (WHO, 2006); in the USA, it is 2–5 mg/l (CDC,
2005)10; in South Australia, it is 2–4 mg/l (Broadbent, 1996)11; in the UK it is 3–5 mg/l
(HPA, 2006).
When chlorine is in water it combines with organic materials arising from the bathers, such
as urine and perspiration, to form chloramines. These act much more slowly than when chlorine
is free or uncombined; they also give rise to odours. Ideally, the level of combined chlorine is
nil, but up to a value equivalent of one-third of the total chlorine is acceptable (HPA, 2006).
Bromine-based products such as bromochlorodimethylhydantoin (BCDMH) are often used
in hot tubs. When BCDMH dissolves in water, it produces a solution of hypobromous and
hypochlorous acid. Bromamines are formed from bromine-based disinfectants in a similar
way to chloramines; however, bromamines are still effective as a biocide and are less susceptible
to changes in pH. In bromine-treated pools, a residual of 4–6 mg/l of total bromine is
recommended.
Ozone is often used in combination with chlorine or bromine; it can be very effective, but it
is not suitable for use on its own. Excess ozone is removed by the use of a charcoal filter.

Practical aspects
Features such as water sprays in pool facilities should be periodically cleaned and flushed with
a level of disinfectant high enough to eliminate Legionella species (e.g. at least 5 mg of free chlorine
per litre) (WHO, 2006).
In hot tubs in commercial premises, the introduction of water treatment chemicals should be
automatically controlled. Intermittent dosing by hand will not achieve a consistent level of
biocide and is not recommended.
The pH value indicates whether the water is acid or alkaline. Maintaining a pH range of
7.2–7.8 for chlorine and 7.2–8.0 for bromine-based and other non-chlorine processes is
important for bather comfort, for safety (by controlling disinfectant activity), and for control
of corrosion or chemical attack within the pool system. In unusual situations where there is
a maintenance fault, the pH could drop to levels at which oxidizing biocides will be disassociated,
leading to increased levels of chlorine or bromine, which can cause eye and skin irritation. At
high pH levels, the chlorine will remain bound and be less effective.

Various additives may also be used to help maintain the water balance; for example, cyanuric
acid helps to stabilize chlorine, particularly in outdoor pools, by preventing its breakdown by
UV light and sunlight. Bicarbonates or carbonates may be added to act as a buffer against
rapid changes in pH caused by high bather loads, pollutants and chemicals.
In some circumstances, such as in natural spring-fed spas, the addition of chemical disinfectants
is considered an adulteration and is not usually allowed, because of the reputed therapeutic
effects of the natural water (Martinelli et al., 2001). Since disinfectants are not used, options
for control strategies are limited. Pasteurization is the most common means of control, combined
with flushing of outlets for 5–10 minutes. The interval between flushes must be based on a
risk assessment of the particular system.
Similarly, if mineral water at a hydrotherapy facility is inhaled for its claimed beneficial or
therapeutic effects, disinfection might not be considered acceptable, because it would change
the chemistry of the water. However, UV treatment may be acceptable, provided the water is
not turbid. UV combined with filtration could be used if there is high turbidity.

Design, operation and maintenance — control measures
Systems should be designed, operated and maintained to optimize control strategies. For
example, decreasing the available surface area within the system and associated pipework will
reduce the potential for bacterial colonization, and avoiding the use of non-metallic materials
in construction will help to reduce the risk of Legionella growth.

Types and design of materials
Only materials that have been tested and shown to be suitable for use in contact with potable
water should be used in the construction and installation of pool, hot tub or spa systems. In
choosing materials, their potential to resist microbial growth should be taken into account;
this includes not only the surfaces of the pool, but also the materials used for pipes and seals.
Materials used during installation, such as jointing compounds, sealants and washers, should also
be considered for their potential to support microbial growth. It is not advisable to use items made
from natural materials, such as hemp and natural rubber, because these components promote biofilm
formation, as discussed in Section 4.3.2 of Chapter 4 (Niedeveld, Pet & Meenhorst, 1986).
Pipework in hot tubs should have a minimal surface area, which should be smooth so that it
does not support colonization by biofilm bacteria. Flexible, corrugated pipework should be
avoided, because this increases the surface area and may allow water to be retained in valleys,
both of which increase the risk of colonization.
Pipework should also be easily detachable for draining and cleaning — even small volumes of
stagnant water will pose a threat from microbial growth in biofilms. There should be adequate
access to all parts of the system, including the balance tank and associated pipework. The air
and water jets should be removable for physical cleaning and disinfection.


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                 133
Schedules for cleaning, disinfection and replacement
Treatment regimes should be validated to ensure that they can maintain control of microbial
growth under the worst case (highest bather load and throughput), and should be tested when
the pool is in use.
Frequent physical cleaning of hot tubs, as well as disinfection, is important because no disinfectant
can work efficiently if there is an accumulation of organic matter or biofilms in such areas as
the balance tank, strainers, filters and pipework. The whole system, including the balance tank,
should be cleaned at least once a week, and sand filters should be backwashed daily. While
advice about replacing the water varies, and depends to some extent on the amount of use, a
minimum of half the volume of water should be replaced each day (EWGLI, 2003).12
Because of problems with rapid build‑up of scale in many natural spa facilities, the main distribution
pipes are replaced every year. Chemical descaling of pipes is also possible, but is usually considered
less cost effective.
For whirlpool baths, it is advisable to disinfect the pipework regularly, while running the pumps
intermittently and using a biocide that is approved by the manufacturer as fit for the purpose
and that will not damage the surface. Designers should ensure that the system is completely
drainable, so that water does not stagnate between uses.

Keeping records
Disinfection, cleaning, operation, maintenance and servicing should be documented in appropriate
manuals, which must be integral parts of the risk assessment documents. All pool owners and
operators should have available:
• details of the person or people responsible for conducting the risk assessment and managing
  and implementing the WSP, including their training portfolios
• drawings and updates that accurately describe the system, including any modifications
• operations manuals of manufacturers, suppliers and service providers
• standard operating procedures (e.g. for cleaning and disinfection)
• maintenance and service requirements
• shutdown procedures
• laboratory monitoring reports
• the dates and results of monitoring inspections, tests and checks
• the significant findings of the risk assessment and required remedial measures

• descriptions of any significant incidents, their investigation, action plans for necessary
  work, and changes arising from them.
Records should be retained for several years. These documents should be checked and audited
regularly by a competent person, according to the risk assessment.

8.4.2 Monitor control measures
This step involves defining the limits of acceptable performance and how these are monitored.
The pH should be measured continuously in public pools, and adjusted automatically. For hot
tubs, monitoring should be conducted several times a day during operating hours (WHO, 2006).
Visual inspection of pool water should accompany other monitoring, such as monitoring of pH
and disinfectant residuals. Facilities should be free of visible physical contamination, such as
hair, sticking plasters, etc.
Strainers should be inspected and cleared regularly. Where filters are installed, they should be
backwashed, either automatically or manually.

8.5.2 Verification
Microbial parameters for hot tubs commonly include the heterotrophic plate count (HPC)
at 37 °C, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and sometimes also Legionella. For
Legionella, WHO recommends the following routine sampling frequencies during normal
operation (WHO, 2006):
• disinfected pools, public and heavily used — quarterly
• disinfected pools, semi-public — quarterly
• natural spas — monthly
• hot tubs — monthly.
Table 8.4 gives examples of national standards in a selection of countries (Broadbent, 1996).13
Well-maintained pools regularly achieve no detectable counts of pseudomonas, aerobic colony
counts, Legionella, coliforms or E. coli, and this should be the goal. Failures should be investigated
and the effectiveness of any remedial work should be monitored.
Special attention should be paid to microbial sampling for hot tubs linked to cases of legionellosis.
In such cases, water samples must be supplemented with swabs from air jets, dismantled
shower heads, hoses and taps, including water outlets and inlets. Water samples of 1 litre should
be collected from the pool, filter housing and balance tank, where fitted. Balance tank samples
are more likely to yield legionellae than hot tub samples; filter material and biofilm from inside
the pipes may also contain large numbers of legionellae and should be sampled by swabbing.
Often, sections of pipe will have to be cut into to achieve this, but sometimes it is possible to
gain access to the insides of pipes by removing the water jets in the base or sides of the spa pool.

8.6 Surveillance
In some jurisdictions, health authorities may periodically inspect facilities (e.g. sports facilities,
such as gymnasia); this may include both physical inspections and inspections of records of
activities such as cleaning and disinfection. The competency of staff may also be checked; for
example, there may be checks to determine whether staff hold appropriate pool maintenance
qualifications.

138   LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Chapter 9 Disease surveillance
and public health management
of outbreaks

Carol Joseph, John V Lee
This chapter describes:
• the requirements of a surveillance system for legionellosis (Section 9.1)
• results of an international scheme for surveillance for legionellosis (Section 9.2)
• methods for managing an outbreak of legionellosis (Section 9.3)
• case studies of disease outbreaks (Section 9.4).

9.1 Surveillance systems
Legionellosis is now a statutory notifiable disease in most industrialized countries. Differences
in public health surveillance systems mean that provision of Legionella data is determined by
each country’s technical ability to identify cases, produce data and allocate resources to this particular
infection. These factors are influenced by the historical, social and cultural value systems that
pertain to each country’s public health system (Anon, 1998b; WHO, 1999). Thus, a country’s
national surveillance of Legionnaires’ disease will depend on factors such as:
• infrastructure and public health laws
• adopted surveillance principles and standard operating procedures
• notification law
• data protection
• patient confidentiality
• freedom of information legislation.
The priority given to legionellosis surveillance may need to be greater than suggested by local
morbidity and mortality, because of its impact on the tourist industry.
Box 9.1 defines disease surveillance.

  Box 9.1 Definition of disease surveillance
  Surveillance has been defined as:
  … the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data, essential
  to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated
  with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know. The final link in
  the surveillance chain is the application of these data to prevention and control. A disease
  surveillance system includes a functional capacity for data collection, analysis, and
  dissemination linked to public health programmes.

9.1.1 Standardized case definitions
Combined microbiological and epidemiological case definitions are used for surveillance of
legionellosis. Classifications are shown in Box 9.2.


  Box 9.2 Case classifications for legionellosis
  Depending on the diagnostic method used and the result, cases are classified
  microbiologically as either confirmed or presumptive.
  Based on the patient’s clinical history, cases are classified as one of the following:
  • Legionnaires’ disease (relevant pneumonic illness and microbiological evidence of infection)
  • Pontiac fever or similar illness (relevant non-pneumonic illness and microbiological
    evidence of infection)
  • asymptomatic Legionella infection (no illness compatible with microbiological result)
  • Legionella infection (microbiological evidence of infection but symptoms not known)
  • suspected legionellosis (relevant pneumonic or non-pneumonic illness but no
    supporting microbiological evidence).


9.1.2 Defined datasets
One of the most important pieces of information in the dataset for surveillance of Legionnaires’
disease is the history of exposure. The incubation period for legionellosis is normally between
two and ten days (see Chapter 1). Thus, whenever possible, an exposure history for two weeks
before the onset of illness should be obtained from the patient (or partner, close relative, friend,
etc.) to provide a focus for further investigations. A home or work diary and street maps are
useful memory aids for this exercise. An example of a two‑week exposure history form is given
in Appendix 2.




140                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Exposure histories allow cases to be grouped into the following categories:
• community acquired
• domestically acquired
• nosocomial (i.e. health‑care acquired)
• travel associated.
For surveillance purposes, cases should be reported to the relevant national centre after the
exposure history has been obtained. An example of a national surveillance report form is given
in Appendix 3.
Table 1.3 in Chapter 1 provides some useful definitions for epidemiological monitoring at
the national level and for comparing exposure risks at the international level; it also defines
community clusters and outbreaks.
In the presence of a pneumonic illness, a laboratory diagnosis will support or refute clinical
suspicion of Legionella infection and will help to classify the case. Table 9.1 summarizes the
patient dataset required for surveillance of Legionnaires’ disease. The dataset should include
as many of the items shown in Table 9.1 as possible.

Single cases
Single cases reported to a surveillance scheme are normally entered into a database that is
then searched for links in time or place to previously reported cases. If no links are found, the
environmental actions in response to a single case will be determined locally or nationally.
However, whenever possible, these actions should include:
• a review of the possible sources of infection
• a risk assessment of potential or suspected sources (see Chapter 3).
A memorandum of understanding or a local or national protocol agreed in advance between
all the relevant agencies helps to facilitate this process and to ensure that all the appropriate
measures have been taken. Local documentation or registration of cooling towers is also
extremely helpful when searching for potential community sources of infection. A flowchart
for investigating single cases of legionellosis is given in Figure 9.1.

9.2 International surveillance of legionellosis
National bulletins on public health, published weekly, are important vehicles for disseminating
surveillance updates, outbreak reports and notification data from individual countries. Useful
publications include:
• Communicable Disease Report — published by the Health Protection Agency in England
  and Wales14
• Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports — published by the Centers for Disease Control
  in the United States of America15
• Bulletin of the World Health Organization.16
However, interpretation and comparison of surveillance data from different countries can be
problematic because of differences in case definitions, types of surveillance system (e.g. national,
sentinel, state-funded and private health care) and the types of data collected from cases. The
opportunity to carry out international surveillance using consistent definitions and reporting
procedures was presented in 1987, when the European Working Group for Legionella
Infections (EWGLI) established the European Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated
Legionnaires’ Disease (EWGLINET17; see Box 9.3).


     Box 9.3	 European Working Group for Legionella Infections
     Since 1993, member countries of EWGLI have submitted annual data to the group by
     completing a set of standardized reporting forms. These data supplement those provided
     to EWGLINET, and include the following information on Legionella infections:
     • annual total cases
     • sex group
     • numbers of cases, categorized by the exposure group
     • main methods used for diagnosis
     • species and serogroups of Legionella isolates.

  Box 9.3	 (continued)
  Since the inception of the surveillance scheme, an increasing number of countries have
  participated. Countries also provide information on the number and type of outbreaks
  detected each year and the sources of infection (Joseph, 2004b). These surveillance data
  are extremely useful for:
  • comparing incidence rates between countries of similar population size and population density
  • comparing the number and size of outbreaks detected
  • assessing the effect of national guidance and legislation on the control and prevention
    of Legionella infection in the different countries.


Table 9.2 lists cases of Legionnaires’ disease reported to EWGLI in Europe from 1993 to 2004. In
2004, 33 countries provided annual data; their reported cases are summarized in Table 9.3.

9.2.1 Effect of improved surveillance
Participation in an international surveillance scheme has led to improved surveillance and
higher detection rates in many European countries. For example, Figure 9.2 shows that detection
of cases in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Spain has increased with improved surveillance.
Figure 9.3 shows reported cases from 1994 to 2004, categorized by type of exposure.
At the national level, underdiagnosis and underreporting are recognized limitations in the
surveillance of Legionella infections, mainly because:
• many patients with pneumonia are not tested for Legionella
• many countries do not have epidemiological follow-up of the laboratory reports through
  which data are collected and reported.
In Denmark, the annual rate of Legionella infections is 17–20 cases per million population,
compared with the European average of 4–10 cases per million population. The difference
may be due to Denmark’s long history of surveillance — the country has a high level of
testing for Legionella in patients with pneumonia, and a centralized reference laboratory for
diagnosing and reporting cases. If all countries had incidence rates similar to those of Denmark,
the total number of cases reported by the 33 countries would amount to more than 10 000 per
year, rather than the 4500 currently reported. Thus, although the burden of disease associated
with Legionnaires’ disease is not known, these estimates suggest that it is much higher than is
currently recognized.

9.3 Management of outbreaks
Investigation of an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease is complex, and involves many people
from many different agencies. Therefore, clear guidelines and terms of reference must be
agreed and practised by all the players involved. By following good public health principles
and best practice, the team should operate effectively and be successful in detecting and controlling
the outbreak.
This section covers:
• confirmation of an outbreak (Section 9.3.1)
• composition of an outbreak control team (Section 9.3.2)
• policies and practice for outbreak management (Section 9.3.3)
• institutional roles and responsibilities (Section 9.3.4)
• engineering and environmental investigations during an outbreak (Section 9.3.5)
• particular requirements for high-profile disease outbreaks (Section 9.3.6).

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                     149
The principles outlined here apply to the investigation of all outbreaks in which microbiological
and epidemiological expertise is used, regardless of the disease under investigation.

9.3.1 Confirmation of an outbreak
The first stage in any investigation is to confirm that an outbreak exists. Most outbreaks of
Legionnaires’ disease will be detected through local or national surveillance schemes.

9.3.2 Outbreak control team
Most outbreaks will be managed by epidemiologists, microbiologists, environmental health
specialists and hygienists from the country concerned.
The outbreak control team should be identified and convened before an outbreak occurs.
The team must reflect all the relevant organizations responsible for the management of water
systems used in industrial, commercial, hospital or leisure facilities, many of whose operations
are controlled by legally enforceable codes of practice. A media spokesperson is also essential
for preparing and disseminating information to public health officials and the general public,
because of the high media interest following detection of an outbreak. Box 9.4 outlines the
recommended composition of an outbreak control team.


  Box 9.4	 Recommended composition of an outbreak control team
  An outbreak control team should include at least the following members:
  • public health specialists in the area in which the outbreak has occurred
  • consultant epidemiologist with expertise in Legionella
  • consultant microbiologist with expertise in Legionella
  • environmental microbiologist with expertise in detection and control of Legionella
  • consultant from the local microbiology laboratory
  • environmental health officer or hygienist
  • data manager to take responsibility for all aspects of data structure, storage, security
    and dissemination
  • health and safety enforcement officer
  • infection control nurse or national equivalent
  • representative from the local department of public health medicine
  • people responsible for the engineering services at the community, industrial,
    commercial, hospital or other premises suspected to be associated with the outbreak
  • general manager at the community, industrial, commercial, hospital or other premises
    suspected to be associated with the outbreak
  • senior media spokesperson
  • other members as decided by the chairperson of the outbreak control team.




150                                    LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Training opportunities
Trainees in public health medicine, epidemiology, microbiology or environmental health welcome
the opportunity to become involved in outbreak investigations. However, their training activities
role should not hinder the work of the outbreak control team, and trainees should not be put
into roles with responsibilities beyond their level of expertise or competence. The trainees should
be a resource for the outbreak control team at a level appropriate to their training needs.

9.3.3 Policies and practices
Good public health practice must be paramount when planning the management of an
outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. International travel-associated outbreaks will be managed
differently (see below).
The outbreak control plan should outline the local or national lines of communication in response
to the diagnosis of one or more linked cases of legionellosis. The plan should specify who is
responsible for convening the outbreak control team, and the key groups of staff to be included
in the team.
Once an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, the control team should be convened immediately.
At its first meeting, the team should:
• elect a chairperson, who will be responsible for convening all future meetings and organizing
  secretarial support for taking and promptly distributing minutes and any other information
  associated with the outbreak
• establish terms of reference for the outbreak investigation (see Section 9.3.4)
• determine which groups of public health professionals will be enforcement or legislative
  authorities for prevention and control of Legionella infection
• agree on a plan for ensuring that immediate action is taken to eliminate the source of
  infection, once it has been identified
• review epidemiological information to decide where to focus the initial environmental
  investigations and control measures (see Section 9.3.5).

Resources
Regardless of the size, magnitude and duration of an outbreak, it is vital that sufficient resources
are mobilized and maintained until the investigation is complete. This includes resources for
managing all aspects of the outbreak investigation, analysing data and producing an outbreak
report.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                 151
European guidelines
European guidelines for the control and prevention of travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease
came into use in July 2002. These guidelines, produced by EWGLI, were endorsed by the
European Commission in June 2003. The guidelines formalize the procedures for responding
to clusters of Legionnaires’ disease in the country of infection.
Within two weeks of the cluster alert, the collaborator in the country of infection is required
to inform the hotel, arrange for an immediate risk assessment, and arrange for control measures
to be implemented. Within six weeks, the results of a full environmental investigation must
be reported, including the results of any sampling that has taken place and information on
whether the hotel remains open or closed. If this information is not received within the
specified time, or control measures are found to be unsatisfactory, the name of the hotel associated
with the cluster is posted on the EWGLI web site, where it remains until the relevant information
is received at the coordinating centre.
The average number of cases in a travel-associated outbreak has declined in the past two years,
because of rapid and effective interventions by the participating countries.

International travel-associated outbreaks
Occasionally, countries will request international collaboration, as happened after travel-
associated outbreaks in Turkey (Joseph & Lee, 1996; Brand et al., 2000), Antigua (Hospedales
et al., 1996), Spain (Garcia-Fulgueiras et al., 2003) and elsewhere. Increasingly, more than
one country may participate in an investigation through exchange of clinical and environmental
specimens or sequence typing data from an outbreak (Joseph et al., 1996; Gaia et al., 2003).
International collaborations help to validate diagnostic tests and the microbiological association
between cases and sources of infection.
A major outbreak of legionellosis, particularly an outbreak considered to have international public
health importance, would warrant notification under the International Health Regulations
(2005) and, when requested, a WHO coordinated response, including support to the affected
country and information to alert other countries of a potential health threat.

9.3.4 Roles and responsibilities
The control team should have terms of reference that clarify the roles and responsibilities of
the relevant partner agencies and disciplines, and that cover all identified tasks. This is critical
to the smooth management of an outbreak. A sample checklist is given in Box 9.5, and
further information on some of these issues is given below.




152                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
     Box 9.5	 Example of terms of reference for an outbreak control team
     The terms of reference for an outbreak control team should include at least the following areas:
     • membership and composition of the team
     • allocation of tasks
     • confidentiality and ownership of data
     • disclosure and dissemination of information
     • preparation of reports — immediate, interim and final
     • authorship of publications
     • review of outbreak procedures, management and outcomes
     • documentation of lessons learnt.


Confidentiality and information disclosure and dissemination
Confidentiality of data should be respected at all times; therefore, information on cases received
in medical confidence should be confined to members of the outbreak control team and should
be referred to without patient identifiers when reports are produced for wider dissemination.
Media reports should also respect the confidentiality of the data on which they are based.
Procedures for disseminating information from the outbreak investigation should be agreed
in advance, so that all relevant people are aware of the latest findings and developments in the
investigation. All members of the outbreak control team should be prepared and informed through
regular telephone conferences. When results of laboratory findings are being released, or testing
of specimens is being requested, the channels of communication should be made clear, so
that the appropriate people are informed in the correct order. Normally, the chairperson will
receive the results of all diagnostic tests and forward them to the relevant members of the
outbreak control team.
Outbreaks generate a great deal of anxiety among the population involved; there is often extensive
media coverage, and the outbreak control team may be subject to excessive public scrutiny
during the course of the investigation. A media spokesperson or a single member of the team
should therefore be designated to speak to the media to ensure consistency. It is a good idea
to have a pre‑prepared press statement.
The media can sometimes be used to help find cases and protect public health by providing
advice. Questions and answers can be pre-prepared and posted on the internet. For example,
the web site of the United Kingdom’s Health Protection Agency provides general information
on Legionnaires’ disease in the form of questions and answers.21 The site poses and answers
questions such as “What is Legionnaires’ disease?”, “Why is it called Legionnaires’ disease?”,
“How is Legionnaires’ disease spread?” and “What are the symptoms?”.

Preparation of reports
The outbreak control team should produce regular reports on the outbreak investigation. They
should also produce a final report for dissemination to members of the team, the ministry of
health or equivalent government agency, the chief executive of the health authority or the region
where the outbreak took place, and any other relevant institutions.
Investigation records or documents held by the outbreak control team may be required if litigation
arises out of a demonstrable breach of practice in the operation or maintenance of aerosol-
generating water systems.

Review of outbreak procedures, management and outcomes
When the outbreak is over, the final meeting of the outbreak control team should include a review
of the way the outbreak was managed and any lessons learnt from the investigation process.
This information should be included in the final report produced by the team. If a report for
publication in a peer-reviewed journal has been discussed, the chairperson should review
authorship with the team and agree on the principal authors before producing the publication.
Any outstanding litigation or criminal proceedings that might prevent publication of certain
findings from the investigation must be considered before going ahead with a report for publication.

9.3.5 Engineering and environmental investigations

Obtaining environmental isolates
In all outbreak investigations, it is important to prevent further cases and ensure that the
source has been located. This can be achieved by obtaining environmental isolates, which can
then be matched with those of the patients (if available). Hence, wherever possible, potential
sources should be sampled before any precautionary disinfection. In many cases, equipment
can be made safe simply by switching it off or not using it; for example, fountains can be
switched off and showers temporarily closed until after sampling and disinfection. With non-
essential pieces of equipment, it may be possible to leave the equipment out of action until
microbial analyses are complete and there is confirmation either that the equipment is not
contaminated or that it has been successfully decontaminated.

Target of investigations
As explained above, the outbreak control team first reviews the epidemiological information
to decide where to focus initial environmental investigations and control measures. If the patients
are all associated with a particular building, the initial investigations should be targeted at all
the water uses (as described in Chapters 4–8) in that building. Investigations of the piped
water system should include the rooms used by the patients, as well as the systems as a whole.
Ideally, the water systems should be subjected to a risk assessment; however, in the initial
intensive phases of an outbreak investigation, a brief, rapid assessment is often all that is possible,



154                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
because doing anything more could unduly delay the collection of samples and the initiation
of control measures. Thus, the initial risk assessment is often necessarily superficial, but is often
followed by a more complete assessment once the initial intensive sampling phase is over.

Potential sources outside the building
Even when the initial epidemiological evidence indicates a particular building as the source,
the possibility of a source outside, but close to, the building should also be considered. In the
United Kingdom, investigations have usually concentrated on all potential sources within a
500-m radius of the epicentre of an outbreak, although cooling towers and evaporative condensers
are inevitably the most likely targets. Such investigations are aided if the local authorities have
a register of cooling towers in their area (a requirement in the United Kingdom; Anon, 1992).
All cooling towers should be visited as soon as possible and sampled before being given a precautionary
disinfection with a high dose of chlorine (50 mg/litre for at least 1 hour) or another suitable
oxidizing biocide. As further epidemiological evidence becomes available, the epicentre of the
investigations may shift and other water systems may need to be targeted. Once all potential
sources within the 500-m radius have been identified and visited, the radius may be increased
to 1000 m or more. Transmission is usually only considered likely up to about 2000 m, although
in an outbreak in Lens in the north of France in 2003–2004, transmission up to 8 km has
been suggested (Nguyen et al., 2006).
It is usually easiest to investigate each water system systematically by starting at the water
supply into the property and working forwards through storage tanks and any intermediate
equipment, such as water heaters and softeners, to the outlets.

Changing epicentre
The epicentre of an investigation may change rapidly during an outbreak. For example, in
1999, the initial investigation of an outbreak in Piccadilly Circus in London centred on a
hotel several hundreds of metres to the south, because the first two cases recognized stayed
there. The hotel was investigated and sampled during the night following the day on which
the first cases were reported. On the following day, as more cases were discovered, the focus
shifted to Piccadilly Circus (Watson et al., 1994; JV Lee, Health Protection Agency, United
Kingdom, personal communication).

Large numbers of sources and samples
The investigation of an outbreak can be extremely labour intensive, particularly:
• in city centres, where there may be many tens or even hundreds of cooling towers within
  a few square kilometres
• on industrial estates, where there may be many and varied potential sources.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                    155
The number of samples collected can be considerable, and it will often be necessary to use
more than one laboratory to ensure that all the samples are processed in good time. If this is
the case, the outbreak control team should ensure that the laboratories used are competent and
experienced, and use the same method of detection, with the required sensitivity. The outbreak
plan, which should be prepared in advance, should include information on:
• roles that individuals may play
• laboratories that are to be used
• contingency plans for situations in which the local laboratory cannot cope
• means to rapidly obtain sufficient laboratory media
• transport arrangements for specimens, to ensure arrival within the recommended time.
Chapter 11 has detailed information on sampling for legionellae. Advice on sampling that
complies with the European and United Kingdom guidelines has recently been published
and is freely available from the Internet (Standing Committee of Analysts, 2005).

9.3.6 High-profile outbreaks
Occasionally, outbreaks may be of such magnitude or importance that all investigations
should be managed from an incident room established within a national public health institution.
In such cases, resources must be identified, because many staff may be required for:
• interviewing patients
• carrying out a case–control study to determine the epidemiological importance of certain
  risk factors
• collecting and processing clinical and environmental samples.
These staff will not be part of the outbreak control team but must be briefed regularly to ensure
that all resources required for the outbreak investigation are used efficiently and effectively.
Regular updates of factors such as case ascertainment, patient outcomes and environmental
results must be conveyed to all core members of the outbreak control team. This does not
necessarily mean convening meetings; it can be achieved using e‑mail groups, video conferencing
or telephone and fax communications by the chairperson of the outbreak control team.
Where there is an international dimension, the relevant health departments in overseas
governments, the relevant department in WHO,22 and other stakeholders and institutions must
be informed. Case searching and follow-up must be organized through national public health
institutions.

9.4 Case studies
This section describes:
• a community outbreak in England (Section 9.4.1)
• a health‑care facility outbreak in Israel (Section 9.4.2)
• an outbreak associated with hot tubs in Austria (Section 9.4.3)
• a case of Legionnaires' disease associated with a concrete batcher process on a construction
  site in the UK (Section 9.4.4).

9.4.1 Community outbreak — England
In late 2003, 27 cases and two deaths were associated with an outbreak in a small city in England.
As soon as the outbreak was recognized, the outbreak control team was convened. The team
constructed a case definition, and carried out detailed epidemiological and environmental
investigations.
The source of the outbreak was shown to be the cooling towers at an industrial plant used to
make cider. The industrial process involved switching on the cooling towers once a year, when
the apples used to make the cider were delivered to the plant for processing.
None of the workforce became ill, but clinical isolates obtained from two of the cases were
indistinguishable by sequence-based typing methods from the environmental isolates obtained
from the cooling tower water samples (Gaia et al., 2003).
The investigation included use of meteorological data, plume modelling, helicopter infrared
surveillance of potential sources of infection, and geographical information systems for analysis
of patient travel in the local vicinity over the outbreak period.
The outbreak was stopped when the cooling towers were shut down (Anon, 2003).

9.4.2 Nosocomial outbreak — Israel
During a two-week period in June–July 2000, a nosocomial outbreak of Legionella pneumonia
caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 3 occurred in four patients, following haematopoietic
stem cell transplantation, in a new bone marrow transplant unit. The causative organism was
recovered from the water supply system to the same unit, just before the outbreak occurred.
Serologic screening revealed no other cases of Legionella pneumonia in 19 consecutive bone
marrow transplant patients hospitalized in the same unit at the same time.
The outbreak was contained by early recognition, immediate restrictions of the use of tap water,
antibiotic prophylaxis for all non-infected patients, and water decontamination by hyperchlorination
and superheating. In November 2000 and February 2001, two more nosocomially acquired
cases occurred, along with the re-emergence of Legionella in the water.


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                 157
This case highlights the high risk for Legionella pneumonia among bone marrow transplant
patients, and the need to take permanent (rather than intermittent) decontamination measures
to prevent nosocomial L. pneumophila in high-risk patients (Oren et al., 2002).

9.4.3 Hot tub outbreak — Austria
In March 2004, a spatial and temporal cluster of cases of legionellosis occurred in a small area
of northern Austria. The cluster prompted immediate epidemiological and environmental
investigations by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety. Four cases of L. pneumophila,
with onset of illness between 10 and 13 March 2004, were reported to the Austrian Legionella
Reference Centre by hospital laboratories or local health authorities. The cases were all male
and were aged between 28 and 65 years.
In all four cases, pneumonia was diagnosed clinically and by X‑ray, and all cases had a confirmed
laboratory diagnosis by detection of L. pneumophila antigen in urine. A significant seroconversion
(more than fourfold) to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was observed in the first and third cases.
The reference laboratory detected L. pneumophila serogroup 1 by direct fluorescent antibody
staining, and L. pneumophila DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) by polymerase chain reaction in
the respiratory secretion of the third case. A single, high‑specificity serum antibody titre to
L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was found in the fourth case. No isolates were obtained from any
of the cases.
All four patients were hospitalized. The third case, a 65-year-old patient, developed multi‑organ
failure and required mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis for 11 days. All cases recovered.
The Federal Ministry for Women and Health announced this cluster of cases of Legionella
infection in a press statement on 31 March 2004. The ministry initiated active case finding
by alerting practitioners and clinicians working in the areas where the cases occurred.
The four cases were linked by area of residence. The timing of clinical onset indicated that all
were exposed to a common source of infection during a restricted period. Interviews with the
patients about their activities during the 10 days before clinical onset revealed that all had
attended a trade fair for energy-saving products, held on 5–7 March 2004 in a city near their
residences. The trade fair included hot tub display stands. All patients reported that they had
visited the hot tub stands at the exhibition.
This information prompted a series of environmental investigations. Water samples were
obtained from the cold and warm water system of the exhibition centre at which the trade
fair was held. Only 5 out of 20 demonstration hot tubs that had been exhibited at the trade
fair were identified and sampled. No legionellae were detected in any water sample.
The epidemiological evidence indicates that the most likely source was one or more hot tubs
at the display. The fact that the microbiological environmental investigations did not confirm
this was probably due to the inevitable delay between exposure and the investigation.

9.4.4 Concrete batcher process on a construction site — UK
This section is based on a case study submitted by SB Surman-Lee, C Seng and T Harrison,
of the Health Protection Agency, London, UK.
Untreated warm water and high pressure aerosols are high-risk factors for causing Legionnaires’
disease. Aggregate (used in making concrete) stored outside in winter in the UK is too cold
for production of some concrete mixes. A case of Legionnaires’ disease was found in a construction
site worker. The person was working near a concrete batching plant where warm water (about
30 ºC) was added to a concrete batcher to facilitate the chemical process during cold weather.
The untreated warm water source was a storage tank containing borehole water, heated by an
adjacent boiler.
A powered jet washer connected into the warm water supply was used to hose down and remove
concrete from the batcher plant, surrounding areas and lorries. Water from the storage tank,
associated pipework and jet washer had high levels of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1
(>105 CFU/litre). Isolates obtained from the patient and the environmental sources were
found to be indistinguishable by further typing from L. pneumophila serogroup 1, MAb
subgroup “Knoxville”, SBT 3,10,1,10,14,9.
This is the first time that a case of Legionnaires’ disease has been associated with concrete
production on a construction site. The site workers believe that similar systems operate elsewhere.
This case therefore highlights the need for a thorough risk assessment of all systems using
water on construction sites worldwide, and the need for systems to manage and control warm
water used in similar processes.

160   LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Chapter 10 Regulatory aspects

David Cunliffe
Two complementary types of regulatory approach can be applied to legionellosis:
• preventing risk from systems that can support the growth and dissemination of Legionella
• notification of illness.
The water safety plan (WSP) approach (WHO, 2004) provides an appropriate mechanism for
implementing preventive risk management systems, and should form the basis of guidelines
or regulations developed for controlling Legionella.
WSPs incorporate multiple barriers; in the case of Legionella, this approach should focus on
the events that, combined, are prerequisites for most waterborne Legionella infections. These
events include:
• survival and growth of virulent organisms
• inhalation of aerosols
• aspiration
• exposure of susceptible hosts.
Each of these factors can be influenced by management practices, and hence can be subject
to regulation.
Disease notification systems provide a basis for initiating investigations, identifying sources of
infection, issuing public advice and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. Notification
and investigation systems can be incorporated within regulations.

10.1 Existing guidelines and regulations for risk prevention
Many countries have developed guidelines or regulations for the control of Legionella in water
systems and for the prevention of legionellosis. Guidelines are advisory, whereas regulations
and codes of practice have a more formal standing and are supported by legislative enforcement
(including, in the case of regulations, specific information on managerial responsibility and
operator competency).
• Guidelines include NHMRC (1988); CDC (2003); Allegheny County Health Department
  (1997); ASHRAE (2000); Ehrlich, Steele & Sabatini (2000); Standards Association of
  Australia/Standards Association of New Zealand (2002); EWGLINET (2003); and WHO
  (2004, 2006).



LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                               161
• Regulations include HSC (2000), IEE (2001) and Victorian Department of Human Services
  (2001). Table 10.1 summarizes European regulations.
WHO publications relevant to the control of Legionella are listed in Box 10.1.
Current guidelines and regulations vary in scope and design, but usually include certain common
features, such as general support of a risk management approach. Some guidelines are very
broad (e.g. ASHRAE, 2000; HSC, 2000), whereas others deal with specific circumstances,
such as control of infection within health-care facilities (Allegheny County Health Department,
1997; Ehrlich, Steele & Sabatini, 2000; CDC, 2003) or travel-related disease (CDC, 1996,
1997a; CDC, 2003; EWGLINET, 2003).

  • Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments, Volume 1 —
    Coastal and Fresh Waters (WHO, 2003)

  • Health Aspects of Plumbing (WHO, 2006)
  • Legionella and the Prevention of Legionellosis (WHO, 2007)
  • Guide to Ship Sanitation (WHO, 2007)


10.2 Legionella testing
An issue that has been the subject of some debate is the role of testing programmes for the
presence or absence of Legionella, and whether such testing should be included in regulations.
Chapter 11 discusses some of the issues involved in such testing programmes, which include
lack of correlation between test results and human health risk (Kool et al., 1999; Bentham, 2002),
and uncertainties about whether or not detected legionellae are infectious (Bentham, 2000).
Much of the debate about routine testing for Legionella has focused on the potential for
over‑reliance on results at the expense of risk management strategies. Legionella testing is not
suitable for operational monitoring, in the same way that enteric pathogens and indicator
bacteria are not suitable for operational monitoring of drinking‑water supplies (WHO, 2004).
However, Legionella testing can be a useful component of monitoring to verify the performance
of water safety plans (WSPs), and it is recommended for cooling towers, hot tubs and water
distribution systems where people at high risk might be exposed (e.g. in health‑care facilities).
Legionella testing can also be undertaken as part of:
• investigation of an outbreak




162                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• validation of the effectiveness of control measures
• verification of the effectiveness of decontamination.
If requirements for testing are included in regulations, it is important to define the purpose
of testing and how results will be treated.

10.3 Scope of regulations
Regulations for control of Legionella should be framed within a preventive risk management
approach that is consistent with the approach outlined in WSPs and the Framework for Safe
Drinking-water (WHO, 2004). Preventive risk management is based on the premise that it is
far better to prevent hazardous situations occurring than to wait until they occur and then
take remedial action.
For operational monitoring, risk management relies on measuring parameters that show whether
systems are working properly, rather than relying on end-point testing, which often only
shows whether a system worked at some earlier time.
Risk management strategies for Legionella should incorporate a multiple barrier approach aimed
at controlling the growth, survival and dissemination of the bacteria. Multiple barriers have
long been used to deal with waterborne organisms. Although all barriers should preferably
remain functional at all times, one advantage of the approach is that if one preventive measure
fails, others may maintain adequate protection.
Specific matters that should be covered by regulations include:
• managerial responsibilities and reporting requirements
• system assessment of buildings and devices that are potential sources of Legionella (e.g. cooling
  towers, water distribution systems, spa pools, humidifiers, ice machines); this assessment
  should consider the susceptibility of those who may be exposed (e.g. transplant and cancer

• control measures to prevent the growth, survival and dissemination of Legionella
• operational monitoring procedures to ensure that control measures remain functional
  whenever devices are in use
• verification procedures to ensure that WSPs are operating effectively
• mechanisms for surveillance and audit of risk management plans.
Regulations could also include requirements relating to notification of disease and responses
to outbreaks of disease.

10.4 Designing regulations
Basic principles need to be observed when developing new regulations. There needs to be an
overall aim, which in this case is to reduce the risk and incidence of legionellosis. The aim is
achieved by applying a set of specific requirements, each of which should have a specific and
stated purpose. Compliance with requirements should be measurable and (where appropriate)
enforceable. Monitoring regimes should be defined, and corrective action to remediate non-
compliance should be described.
Specific health-based targets might be established for the incidence of illness or outbreaks. Such
targets can be useful in undertaking cost–benefit analyses as part of a regulatory impact assessment.
If Legionella testing is included in requirements, target concentrations and responses to
detections should be specified.
In some cases, there may need to be a balance between different regulatory requirements. For
example, in the case of water distribution systems, avoiding temperatures between 25 °C and
50 °C will reduce the risk from Legionella; however, regulations designed to reduce the risk
of scalding can require that hot-water temperatures be kept below 50 °C or even below 45 °C.
This can be achieved by lowering water temperatures throughout distribution systems or by
installing thermostatic mixing valves close to the point of water use. In either case, greater levels
of maintenance will be required to compensate for loss of temperature-based control of Legionella.

10.4.1 Managerial responsibilities, registration and notification
Regulations should identify managerial responsibilities associated with systems, and should
include requirements for the training and competence of operators. Requirements could also
be included for registration of devices with regulatory authorities. Consideration should be
given to notification requirements in the event of serious non-compliance.

10.4.2 System assessment and design
System assessment should include inspections of buildings and surrounding areas to identify
potential sources of Legionella and to evaluate the risk associated with devices, taking into account
design, location and operating conditions. A risk assessment could include consideration of:
• the potential for conditions that could favour the survival or growth of Legionella
• the potential for production and dissemination of aerosols
• design features, such as deadlegs, the position of air intakes or cooling tower exhausts, and
  the presence of drift eliminators in cooling towers
• control measures to minimize risks (e.g. automated biocide dosing, flushing, cleaning and
  general maintenance)




164                                      LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• operating conditions, such as temperature ranges in water distribution systems, and whether
  devices are operated continuously or intermittently
• the location of devices in relation to exposure of vulnerable groups.
The risk assessment should determine whether existing control measures are sufficient and
operate effectively. If they are not sufficient, additional measures should be identified. Guidance
on appropriate control measures can be provided in codes of practice referenced within
regulations. In addition, regulations can identify specific control measures to be applied, such as:
• application of temperature controls for water distribution systems
• use of biocide dosing as part of an ongoing water management programme
• regular flushing of water systems
• frequencies of cleaning and inspection
• use of drift eliminators on cooling towers.
A number of design features can influence the growth and dissemination of Legionella; for
example, reducing the occurrence of circulating water temperatures between 25 °C and 50 °C,
minimizing stagnant water, installing biocide dosing systems and installing drift eliminators
on cooling towers. Cooling towers should be located so that outlets are not close to air intakes
or windows of adjacent buildings. Consideration of such features is fairly straightforward
when designing new systems, but can present difficulties when dealing with existing systems.
The inclusion of design requirements within regulations should be considered. Some existing
regulations deal with design, and others do not.

10.4.3 Operational monitoring and verification
Operational monitoring procedures need to be identified for each control measure. Operational
monitoring can take the form of testing for defined parameters and inspection programmes.
Regulations should include the requirement to institute operational monitoring systems.
Operational monitoring requirements regarded as essential could be defined (e.g. the frequency
of testing or inspection of cooling towers or water distribution systems). Further guidance on
the design and implementation of operational monitoring could be provided in codes of
practice and referenced within regulations.
In addition to operational monitoring of individual components and control measures, verification
procedures need to be identified. Verification provides reassurance that WSPs as a whole are
operating effectively. The process can be undertaken by owner, operators or regulatory authorities,
and regulations should specify who is responsible. Verification can include testing for Legionella.

Regulations should describe responses when specified requirements are not complied with.
Where testing is prescribed, regulations should identify targets and responses to detection. In
addition to any immediate remedial action that is deemed necessary, detection of Legionella
should always lead to a review of risk management procedures. However, failure to detect
Legionella should not lead to any relaxation in the application of these procedures.
Written procedures for decontamination of devices should be available at the time of commissioning
a system, to deal with an outbreak of illness or with other conditions that constitute a substantial
risk to public health.

10.4.4 Documentation of management plans and record keeping
All management plans and procedures need to be documented, including those to be followed
during normal operation and during incidents and emergencies. The scope and nature of records
and documentation should be identified, as should minimum retention times. Requirements
for documentation and record keeping should be considered in drafting regulations. Records
that could be required include:
• details of building assessments
• plans of water systems
• details of system assessments
• monitoring plans
• results of monitoring, verification, inspections, investigations and any associated remedial action
• the identities of contacts, including managers and/or operators
• results of audits.

10.4.5 Surveillance and audit
Mechanisms for ensuring that appropriate risk management strategies have been implemented
should be considered. Similarly, procedures for independent verification and auditing should
be considered; these may take the form of regular or random inspections of facilities, devices,
documentation and records, and may include testing.
Surveillance agencies should have the authority to enter premises, undertake inspections,
review WSPs and results of sampling, and require specific remedial action. Surveillance agencies
can include government departments of health, environmental health departments of local
government, or agencies with responsibilities for occupational health and safety.

10.4.6 Outbreak investigation and notification of disease
Inclusion of specific regulations to deal with responses to outbreaks should be considered. Such
regulations could include provisions for investigations and inspections of devices and documentation
by surveillance agencies; they could also include provisions for additional testing and remedial
(or even precautionary) decontamination of devices.
A number of countries and regions have established mandatory or voluntary systems for
notification of legionellosis, as described in Chapter 9. Such notification can be provided by
clinicians or testing laboratories. In Europe, a notification and surveillance scheme has been
developed to facilitate detection and investigation of travel-associated infections (EWGLINET,
2003; see Chapter 9).
The International Health Regulations (IHR) (WHO, 2005) are a legal instrument designed to
provide security against the international spread of infectious diseases. The regulations incorporate
provisions for notification and public health responses to events of international significance.
Legionellosis is not incorporated in the lists of diseases cited in the IHR (WHO, 2005);
however, any disease event that meets the criteria described in Annex 2 of the regulations
(Serious public health impact, unexpected, likely to spread internationally or likely to result in travel or
trade restrictions) must be notified to WHO following the entry into force of the IHR (2005)
in June 2007. The IHR (2005) also introduces new requirements for the inspection of ships
and the issuing of a ship sanitation certificate which will be relevant to outbreaks associated
with ships (see Chapter 7), when these and other provisions in the regulations could be applied.
Notification systems allow prompt investigation of outbreaks or even single cases. Such investigations
can lead to the identification of sources of illness, implementation of remedial action and
provision of public health advice. As a result, the size of outbreaks and the likelihood of
recurrence can be reduced. In some jurisdictions or circumstances, single cases are investigated,
on the basis that they may be the first reported case of an outbreak. Investigations of nosocomial
cases are considered to be of high importance because of the potential risk to immuno-
compromised patients (Lee & Joseph, 2002).

10.5 Outbreak impact and economic consequences
Since the first recognized outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in Philadelphia, USA (Fraser et al.,
1977), many outbreaks have been reported, often involving health‑care facilities (see Chapter 6).
During outbreak investigations and the associated media interest, a more complete picture of
the true number of cases is possible than at other times, because during an outbreak clinicians
tend to do more diagnostic tests, and reporting of cases is more complete. In Europe, the number
of clusters reported to the European Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI) is
also increasing (see Figure 10.1).

The risk of infection after exposure to Legionella is difficult to assess and remains a matter of some debate.
Since Legionella is ubiquitous in both natural and human-made environments, it must be assumed that most
people are exposed frequently, at least to single organisms. Generally, there is either no reaction to such
exposure or an asymptomatic production of antibodies. Drinking-water from natural sources and from public
supplies may carry single organisms or Legionella-containing amoebae. However, other than in health‑care
facilities, there are no reports of outbreaks or recurrent cases of disease following consumption or use of
drinking-water that has been kept cool and not subjected to prolonged periods of stagnation.


Although it is impossible to completely eradicate legionellosis, the risks could be reduced to
a tolerable minimum. For example, decontamination of colonized installations has effectively
interrupted outbreaks and prevented recurrences of sporadic cases. In two prospective studies
conducted in hospitals, the frequency with which L. pneumophila was isolated from patients
with pneumonia was reduced from 16.3% to 0.1% over a six-year period; similarly, the
frequency of isolation from patients who were immunocompromised was reduced from 76%
to 0.8% over a 10‑year period (Grosserode et al., 1993; Junge-Mathys & Mathys, 1994). These
reductions were due to hyperchlorination to prevent nosocomial infections.
Design measures can also help to prevent further outbreaks. For example, after the 1999 outbreak
in the Netherlands (Den Boer et al., 2002), the Dutch government launched a plan to combat
Legionnaires’ disease, emphasizing the need for greater vigilance by general practitioners
(GPs) and community health services. The plans included a computerized rapid alert system
for GPs, measures to ensure that all GPs and hospital casualty departments are alerted within
24 hours of possible cases of Legionnaires’ disease, and stricter controls of public buildings using

hot water (e.g. health‑care facilities, hotels, saunas and swimming pools). The Dutch College
of General Practitioners has also been asked to improve the education of GPs on rare,
preventable, infectious diseases. In addition, regulations were drafted and guidance was issued
to ensure the safety of water in buildings (see Table 10.1).
Several guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia have been
published. These include:
• American Thoracic Society guidelines, which were published in 1993 and updated in
  2001 (Niederman et al., 1993; ATS, 2001)
• Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which were published in 1998 and
  updated in 2004 (Mandell et al., 2004)
• Canadian guidelines for the initial management of community-acquired pneumonia (Mandell
  et al., 2002)
• British Thoracic Society Guidelines (2001)
• European Respiratory Society Guidelines (ESOCAP, 1998).
Although these guidelines differ in several treatment recommendations, they uniformly recommend
regular antibiotic coverage of Legionella spp. in severe pneumonia requiring admission to
intensive care units.
Likely benefits of the adoption of the described measures to control and reduce the risks posed
by legionellae in cooling tower systems and warm water systems have been discussed in the
regulatory impact statement for the Victorian Health (Legionella) Regulations (Anon, 2001).
The direct benefits are from expected reductions in the incidence of the disease, which would
reduce mortality and lead to hospital cost savings. Indirect benefits include savings of medical
costs from treating patients, due to an associated reduction in non-fatal incidence of the disease,
and a reduction in loss of economic output caused by inability to work. Benefit calculations
range from US$8 million (“worst case”, with 25% effectiveness) to US$15 million (“best case”,
with 50% effectiveness). These calculations do not include any valuation of the estimated
10–20 lives that could be saved over a 10‑year period. Given the US$20–27.5 million range
of net present value for the proposed package of controls, including the health regulations for
Legionella, the implicit costs per life saved range between US$1 million and US$3 million
(Anon, 2001).

This chapter provides:
• background information about Legionella biology and staining (Section 11.1)
• information on diagnostic tests for legionellosis (Section 11.2), including:
   – culture (Section 11.2.1)

   – detection of bacterial antigen (Section 11.2.2)

   – detection of bacterial DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) (Section 11.2.3)

• particular considerations for diagnosing patients with health‑care associated (nosocomial)
  pneumonia (Section 11.2.4)
• approaches to the environmental sampling of Legionella (Section 11.3)
• methods for identifying and differentiating Legionella species (Section 11.4).

11.1 Legionella biology and staining

11.1.1 Biology
Legionella are 0.3–0.9 µm wide and 2–20 µm long, depending on the age of the culture —fresh
cultures of Legionella produce coccobacilli about 2–6 µm long, whereas older cultures may
produce filamentous forms up to 20 µm long. L. pneumophila usually has limited motility, and
some strains are completely non‑motile (Harrison & Taylor, 1988). The bacterium has one
or two polar flagellae, the expression of which may depend on temperature (Ott et al., 1991).
In contrast to other aquatic bacteria, L. pneumophila requires iron salts and the amino acid L-
cysteine to grow on laboratory media. Occasionally, rare clinical isolates of three Legionella species
(L. jordanis, L. oakridgensis and L. spiritensis) may lose their L-cysteine growth dependence (Orrison
et al., 1983). This characteristic only develops after serial passage, when Legionella from an
infected host is used to infect a second host — a process that often results in the mutation of
Legionella genes not essential for survival. However, legionellae that are not L-cysteine dependent
still grow more vigorously on media containing L-cysteine.

11.1.2 Staining
Legionellae are Gram-negative bacteria with a thin cell wall, but stain poorly in the Gram
procedure if neutral red or safranin is used as the counterstain. This characteristic is probably
due to the composition of legionellae cell walls, which have large amounts of branched-chain
cellular fatty acids and ubiquinones with side chains of 9–14 isoprene units (Moss et al., 1977;
Lambert & Moss, 1989). Fatty acid and ubiquinone profiling have been used for identifying
Legionella isolates to the level of species (Benson & Fields, 1998). On its own, Gram staining is
inconclusive, even when samples are taken from normally sterile sites, such as transtracheal aspirates,
lung biopsies or pleural fluids. Legionellae from these tissues appear as small, Gram-negative
rods of varying sizes when counterstained with basic fuchsin. This effect is emphasized in legionellae-
infected tissues (Yu, 2000). Dieterle’s silver impregnation method is an alternative means of staining
legionellae (Dieterle, 1927; Thomason et al., 1979). More sensitive and specific methods of
identifying legionellae include antibody-coupled fluorescent dyes and immunoperoxidase staining.
Further information on identifying legionellae species is given in Section 11.4.

11.2 Diagnostic methods
The clinical symptoms of infection with Legionella are indistinguishable from the symptoms
of other causes of pneumonia. Accurate diagnostic methods are therefore needed to identify
Legionella, and to provide timely and appropriate therapy. To improve diagnosis, specialized
laboratory tests must be carried out, by the clinical microbiology laboratory, on patients in a
high-risk category.
Tests for Legionnaires’ disease should ideally be performed on all patients with pneumonia at risk,
including those who are seriously ill (with or without clinical features of legionellosis), and those for
whom no alternative diagnosis prevails. In particular, tests for Legionnaires’ disease should be carried
out on ill patients who are older than 40 years, immunosuppressed or unresponsive to beta-lactam
antibiotics, or who might have been exposed to Legionella during an outbreak (Bartlett et al., 1998).
Despite the availability of immunological and molecular genetic methods, diagnosis of
Legionnaires’ disease is generally effective only for L. pneumophila serogroup 1. The sensitivity and
specificity of methods for diagnosing and identifying other L. pneumophila serogroups and
species of Legionella are far from perfect (Tartakovsky, 2001).
Since 1995, diagnostic tests for legionellosis have changed significantly. The following laboratory
methods are currently used for diagnosing Legionella infections (Stout, Rihs & Yu, 2003):
• isolation of the bacterium on culture media
• identification of the bacterium using paired serology
• detection of antigens in urine




176                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• detection of the bacterium in tissue or body fluids by immunofluorescent microscopy
  (e.g. direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) testing)
• detection of bacterial DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Table 11.1 compares the sensitivity, specificity and other characteristics of these methods.
Use of culture or DFA techniques has decreased, and most cases of legionellosis are now
identified through detection of urinary antigens. As a consequence of this shift, detection of
L. pneumophila serogroup 1 is increasing, and all other serogroups are probably underdiagnosed.
The highest number of cases of Legionnaires’ disease in travellers was reported by the European
Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease in 1999. This reflects both
greater surveillance and an increase in the use of urinary antigen for detecting L. pneumophila
serogroup 1. Detection of urinary antigen was the most common method of detection (55% of
cases; see Figure 11.1). The antigen detection test is substantially more sensitive for community-
acquired and travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease than for nosocomial (health-care acquired)
infection, because the tests are more sensitive for Pontiac L. pneumophila serogroup 1 than for
non-Pontiac strains; the tests use monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb2 or Dresden MAb3/1.
Pontiac strains cause the majority of community-acquired and travel-associated Legionnaires’
disease cases, but are significantly less common in nosocomially acquired cases.

11.2.1 Diagnosing legionellosis using culture media
Before the development of an in vitro medium that could sustain legionellae (Feeley et al., 1978;
Feeley et al., 1979), legionellae could only be grown by isolating them in guinea pigs or hen eggs
(McDade et al., 1977; Morris et al., 1979). Currently, the preferred technique for checking
other diagnostic methods is to grow the bacteria on direct culture.
Primary isolation of Legionella spp. is carried out using a defined Legionella agar medium
containing L-cysteine, such as buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar. Supplements that
reduce the background competing bacterial flora and yeasts may be added to increase selectivity
of the media. These supplements include BCYE-agar with anisomycin (Dournon, 1988),
BMPAα medium with buffered cefamandole, polymixin B, or anisomycin agar (Edelstein,
1981). It is best to use both selective and nonselective agars, because cefamandole may inhibit
some Legionella species (Edelstein, 1981). Supplemented BCYE medium is the most commonly
used. This medium can be easily prepared by any large clinical microbiological laboratory
and can be made in a semiselective form. However, supplements need to be added carefully
so that they are not overheated. The quality of each batch of the media (i.e. each flask) must be
checked using Legionella strains that have not been adapted to laboratory media by successive
subculture. This is because laboratory strains adapt to laboratory media and are less sensitive
to poor-quality media than fresh isolates of Legionella from clinical and environmental samples.
Culture yield is greatest in highly experienced laboratories using multiple media and pre-
plating specimen decontamination. Culture plates are incubated at 36+/– 1 °C for up to
14 days and are examined every two or three days. Even the detection of one or a few colonies
is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. The appearance of colonies may be delayed if patients
have received appropriate antibiotics, and if the specimen is contaminated with other microorganisms
or another species (Stout & Yu, 1997; Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002).

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                               179
Ideally, specimens for culture should be taken before antibiotic treatment is initiated, although
Legionella has been isolated from lower respiratory tract specimens and blood after several
days treatment with erythromycin. Sputum should be considered for culture even when not
purulent (Ingram & Plouffe, 1994). Respiratory specimens that are particularly difficult to
obtain, such as lung tissue, pleural fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), should be cultured
if received on a routine basis (Stout, Rihs & Yu, 2003).
Legionella has been successfully isolated from lower respiratory tract specimens, including
BAL, transtracheal aspirate, endotracheal suction specimens, pleural fluid, lung biopsy and
expectorated sputum. In the early phase of illness, legionellosis is often accompanied by a dry
cough with little sputum. In this context, the low number of organisms present outside the
lungs and the inhibitory effect of oral flora reduce the sensitivity of the culture method. In
severe forms of legionellosis, especially in immunocompromised patients, bacteraemia (bacterial
spread to the bloodstream) can occur, with a frequency of approximately 30% in patients
with severe legionellosis. Sometimes, legionellae are found in samples from extrapulmonary sites,
especially from postmortem specimens (e.g. liver, spleen, pericardial fluid, kidney wounds,
cutaneous abscess or vascular grafts).

Benefits and limitations of using culture media
Culture of Legionella is often the most sensitive detection method, and has high specificity
(>99%) (Edelstein, 1987). Culture is particularly important for diagnosis in:
• cases in which severe pneumonia causes respiratory failure
• immunocompromised patients
• nosocomial infections
• cases in which disease is caused by any legionellae other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1.
Some legionellae cannot be grown on routine Legionella culture media and have been termed
Legionella-like amoebal pathogens (LLAPs), because they grow in certain host species of
amoeba. These organisms have been isolated and maintained in culture by co‑cultivating the
bacteria with their protozoan hosts. One LLAP strain was isolated from the sputum of a
pneumonia patient by enrichment in amoebae. This LLAP strain is considered to be a human
pathogen (Fry et al., 1999; Marrie et al., 2001). Other LLAP strains may be human pathogens,
although this is difficult to prove because they cannot be detected by conventional techniques
used for legionellae. Recently, three LLAP strains were named Legionella species (Adeleke et
al., 2001; La Scola et al., 2004).

11.2.2 Detecting Legionella antigens

Urinary antigens

Enzyme immunoassays
The use of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for detecting L. pneumophila antigen in urine allows
Legionnaires’ disease to be diagnosed early in the course of infection. EIA is a convenient and
rapid test with excellent specificity and sensitivity for L. pneumophila serogroup 1. The antigen
is detectable in most patients between one and three days after the onset of symptoms, and may
persist for some weeks or months — even when other tests can no longer detect the antigen
(Birtles, 1990). The EIA urine antigen test has 80–85% specificity, which is similar to culture
(Hackman et al., 1996; Kazandjian, Chiew & Gilbert, 1997), but may have greater sensitivity
than culture. Commercial EIA kits are available for detecting L. pneumophila serogroup 1
antigen in urine.
Immunoassay for detection of urinary antigen is the method of choice for L. pneumophila
serogroup 1 (Cosentini et al., 2001; Formica et al., 2001). Compared with other diagnostic
methods, the advantages of urinary antigen detection are striking. Specimens are easily obtained,
the antigen is detectable very early in the course of disease, and the test is rapid and specific.
The antigen might also be detectable in non-pneumonic illnesses and during antibiotic
therapy (Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002).

Immunochromatographic assays
A rapid immunochromatographic assay for detecting L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in
urine is also available. This assay detects urinary antigen within a very short time and does
not require laboratory equipment (Helbig et al., 2001). Concentration of urine improves the
sensitivity of both the EIA and immunochromatographic assays, without decreasing their
specificity.

Tissue antigens

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy
Immunofluorescence microscopy can be used to detect Legionella, using either direct or
indirect techniques, in samples such as respiratory tract secretions, lung and pleural fluid. The
indirect immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT) is used in most laboratories to detect
the serum antibody level. A fourfold rise in titre develops within 1–9 weeks after disease
onset in approximately three quarters of patients with culture-proven legionellosis caused by
L. pneumophila serogroup 1. On average, patients seroconvert (develop antibodies) within
two weeks; however, up to 25% of seroconversions are undetected because serum is collected
more than eight weeks after disease onset.




LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                               181
In the clinical setting, serology is limited in its usefulness as a diagnostic tool for legionellosis
because of the length of time required, the need for paired sera, and the difficulty of obtaining
appropriate convalescent samples (Stout & Yu, 1997). Although diagnosis by antibody detection
from tissues is still useful for epidemiological studies in outbreaks or to establish an infection
retrospectively, it has generally been superseded by the urinary antigen test, as discussed above.
A single high titre with clinical symptoms suggestive of legionellosis gives a presumptive
diagnosis. However, in one study, a single acute-phase antibody titre of 1:256 could not
discriminate between cases of Legionella and non-cases (Plouffe et al., 1995). Cross‑reactions
with other bacteria, such as Campylobacter and Pseudomonas species, have also occurred (Marshall,
Boswell & Kudesia, 1994; Boswell, Marshall & Kudesia, 1996; Harrison, 1997).
Indirect IFAT is used to diagnose legionellosis by incubating samples with a hyperimmune
antiserum and then visualizing them by applying a fluorescently tagged anti-Legionella antibody,
fluorescein–isothiocyanate-conjugated immunoglobulin (FITC). A positive control (human
reference serum) and a negative control (human serum from a healthy individual) are required
(Rose et al., 2002). The sensitivity and specificity of IFAT have only been evaluated using
L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen; sensitivity and specificity for other serogroups or species
are not known (Muder 2000; Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002). Because of the formation of
cross-reactive antibodies, about 50% of patients infected by L. pneumophila non-serogroup 1
seroconvert with antigens specific to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (Edelstein, 2002). A negative
result does not exclude legionellosis, and care needs to be taken to confirm a positive result
when low numbers of bacteria are seen (Benson & Ward, 1992).
Antigen preparation differs between laboratories and manufacturers, resulting in different
critical titre levels. For some antigen preparations, specificity could be relatively high for a single
specimen, and low for another antigen (Rose et al., 2002).
A number of companies produce FITC-labelled antibodies for the detection of L. pneumophila.
An FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against L. pneumophila common
outer-membrane protein is commercially available, and is preferred because it is more specific
than polyclonal reagents. The MAb has the advantage of reacting with all L. pneumophila
serogroups, but only identifying L. pneumophila. Genus-specific MAbs are not suitable for
immunofluorescence.

Direct immunofluorescence assays
Direct immunofluorescence assays (DFAs) using antibody conjugated with a fluorochrome
require 2–3 hours to complete the staining procedure. DFAs for Legionella species other than
L. pneumophila should not ordinarily be used. DFA of sputum remains positive for 2–4 days
after the initiation of the specific legionellosis antibiotic therapy, and often for a longer period
in cases of a cavitary pulmonary disease (Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002).




182                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
DFA has been used successfully with expectorated sputum, endotracheal suction aspirates,
lung biopsies and transtracheal aspirate (Stout, Rihs & Yu, 2003). Pleural fluid examination in
patients with legionellosis by culture or DFA rarely yields positive results, but has occasionally
been helpful. Between 25% and 70% of patients with culture-proven legionellosis have positive
DFA for L. pneumophila, and the test’s specificity is higher than 99.9%. Therefore, a negative
result does not rule out legionellosis but a positive result is almost always diagnostic, provided
that the slide is read correctly.
Care must be taken to prevent false‑positive results of DFA. These can result from clinical specimens
coming into contact with contaminated water, such as contaminated buffers or organisms
washed from positive control slides (Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002). In addition, skill and
experience are required to interpret the DFA; therefore, laboratories lacking expertise should
be discouraged from using it.

Enzyme immunoassays
Microagglutination or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods can be used to serologically
diagnose L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in tissues (Edelstein, 2002). Several EIA serologic
diagnostic kits are commercially available, with sensitivity ranging from 80% to 90% and a
specificity of about 98%. The sensitivity of kits for testing antibody from serotypes 2–6 is still
unknown. The conformity of EIA tests with the immunofluorescence method is about 91%
(Edelstein, 2002).

11.2.3 Diagnosing legionellosis using nucleic acid detection

Overview of polymerase chain reaction assays
L. pneumophila DNA was first detected in clinical samples by a commercial nucleic acid
hybridization assay that used a radioisotopically labelled RNA (ribonucleic acid) probe.
However, concerns about the sensitivity and specificity of the assay led to its subsequent
withdrawal (Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002).
Since then, Legionella polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been used more actively to
detect DNA from environmental samples, but can also be used for analysing clinical samples,
particularly those from the respiratory tract. Detection of Legionella and L. pneumophila
DNA has been reported using PCR assays (with or without confirmation by blot hybridization
or sequencing) (Mahbubani et al., 1990; Lisby & Dessau, 1994; Ko et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2003),
including those targeting:
• ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes or their intergenic spacer regions
• a gene coding for heat-shock protein (dnaJ)
• the RNA polymerase gene (rpoB)
• the macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene.

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                  183
Traditionally, the rRNA genes have been used for assays targeting the Legionella genus and the
mip gene for L. pneumophila-specific assays. Assays for Legionella and L. pneumophila using
direct (real-time) monitoring platforms have also been described (Ballard et al., 2000; Hayden
et al., 2001; Rantakokko-Jalava & Jalava, 2001; Wellinghausen, Frost & Marre, 2001). With
respiratory samples, Legionella PCR has a reported specificity of ≥99% and sensitivity of 85%
(Edelstein & Meyer, 1994; Fields, Benson & Besser, 2002; Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002;
Uldum & Molbak, 2002).
An important feature of Legionella PCR is that the method can potentially detect all serogroups
of L. pneumophila and is therefore useful in the early diagnosis of infections, particularly in
nosocomial cases (Uldum & Molbak, 2002). Over the past few years, PCR techniques have
improved substantially, particularly those for direct (real-time) monitoring of the generation
of PCR fragments. The use of real-time PCR technique accelerates the diagnostic procedure
for legionellosis and improves the specificity.
PCR methods could have important economic benefits. Their use in outbreaks of legionellosis
could help to rapidly rule out implicated sites, thereby minimizing lost revenue and allowing
resources to be diverted to areas that need further investigation. Until the diversity and distribution
of legionellae are better understood, results from methods other than culture should be
interpreted cautiously.

Limitations of PCR assays
Current data are insufficient for reliably estimating PCR sensitivity and specificity values, or
for comparing PCR to other methods. Broadening the application of PCR requires evaluation
and standardization of sample preparation and PCR protocols, to define primer and probe
specifications and assay sensitivities, and to reduce the effect of PCR inhibitors. Ideally,
internal process controls should also be included, to indicate the presence or absence of PCR
inhibitors or the failure of PCR (Ursi et al., 1992; Hu et al., 2002; Lück, Helbig & Schuppler, 2002).
Few validation data are available for the many assays described, particularly for use in a clinical
setting. L. pneumophila PCR assays appear to be promising, but assays reported to specifically
target all Legionella species should be viewed with caution and carefully assessed. Before a
specific PCR assay is used to diagnose legionellosis, its analytical sensitivity and specificity
should be determined and compared with that of other PCR assays.

11.2.4 Diagnosing patients with health-care associated pneumonia
Nosocomial Legionnaires’ disease is discussed in detail in Chapter 6. This section applies to
diagnostic testing used to evaluate patients with health-care associated pneumonia.
Diagnosing patients with nosocomial pneumonia requires the following:
• Every health‑care facility should have access to a laboratory that is proficient in isolating
  Legionella from cultures and has urine antigen testing facilities.


184                                       LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• Serologic testing can be used for diagnosis, but is not the most helpful diagnostic tool,
  because a fourfold rise in antibody titre from specimens obtained 3–6 weeks apart is necessary
  to make a clinical diagnosis of legionellosis; a diagnosis is rarely made from a single high titre.
• DFA testing can be used for diagnosis; however, testing using this method must be regular
  so that changes in results can be detected immediately.
The consequences of failing to regularly test patients with health-care acquired pneumonia
were identified in a study by Lepine et al. (1998), who reported a cluster of cases of legionellosis
in a hospital soon after the introduction of urine antigen testing. The hospital had experienced
an outbreak of nosocomial legionellosis 16 years earlier and, as revealed by molecular subtyping
methods, the isolates from the two outbreaks were identical. There was no increase in the
hospital’s overall rate of nosocomial pneumonia. The study suggested that persistent transmission
of Legionella infections may have been occurring over a long period, without being recognized.
Several investigations report underuse of diagnostic testing. Fiore et al. (1999) published a
survey sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control on surveillance systems for health-care
acquired infections. Of the 192 hospitals that responded, only 60% could provide in-house
testing for legionellosis, and only 21% had established routine testing procedures that included
legionellosis for respiratory specimens from patients with nosocomial pneumonia. This study
highlights the importance of surveillance for legionellosis and infection control in hospitals,
residential institutions and other such buildings.
Health‑care facilities must have policies in place to test for legionellosis in patients with nosocomial
pneumonia. Effective diagnosis and evaluation of results are crucial for the adequate and
prompt management of incidents and outbreaks, for the control of clusters of infections, and
for the protection of other patients.

11.3 Analysing environmental samples for Legionella

11.3.1 Standards for Legionella detection and recovery
There are a number of manuals and laboratory procedures for the recovery of legionellae from
environmental samples. In 1998, an international standard (International Organization for
Standardization ISO 11731) was developed to incorporate the different strategies used by a number
of institutions for efficient recovery and detection of legionellae (ISO, 2004). The following
sections provide an overview of methods for detecting the bacterium in water samples,
according to the ISO standard.

11.3.2 Ensuring safety during environmental sampling
Environmental samples of Legionella should be collected by people with knowledge of Legionella
ecology and general risk assessment (see Chapters 2 and 9). People taking environmental
samples require training to ensure that they select samples containing the highest numbers of

LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                                     185
bacteria, and that they are aware of the risk to themselves and to others from potentially
positive sites. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to use respiratory protective equipment,
although in most cases cooling systems can be turned off to allow safe sample collection. An
exception may be where a wet cooling system is being used to cool a potentially explosive
industrial process. In that situation, a risk assessment must be made before sampling. If it is
not safe to take samples, the system should be rendered safe as soon as possible.
Several countries or regions produce guidelines on sampling. Advice on methods that comply
with the European and United Kingdom guidelines has recently been published and is freely
available from the Internet (Standing Committee of Analysts, 2005).26

11.4 Legionella speciation and serology typing

11.4.1 Identifying different Legionella species
Methods used to identify and differentiate Legionella species include (Benson & Fields, 1998;
Ratcliff et al., 2003):
• phenotypic characteristics
• growth requirements
• biochemical characteristics
• fatty acid and carbohydrate analysis
• ubiquinones
• protein profiling
• serology
• monoclonal antibodies reactions
• various molecular techniques (including, recently, the use of sequencing techniques).
The use of biochemical profiles for routine identification of legionellae other than L. pneumophila
is limited. Legionellae test positive for catalase — an enzyme in blood and cells that catalyses
the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. The oxidase reaction gives
variable results and is therefore not very useful. Reactions for nitrate reduction, urease and
carbohydrate use are negative. Most species of Legionella produce beta-lactamase, lipase and
phosphatase (Thorpe & Miller, 1981) and liquefy gelatine. Strains belonging to all serogroups
of L. pneumophila, except serogroups 4 and 15, strongly hydrolyse hippurate (Hebert, 1981).
Several laboratories have described methods for identifying putative Legionella isolates to the
genus level, and in some cases to the species level, using only phenotypic characteristics.

186                                     LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
Although not all strains can be reliably identified to the species level, narrowing strains to groups
is useful, and this is usually achieved using serology. DNA–DNA hybridization best identifies
a strain of Legionella or a new species. The procedure requires DNA from the test strain to be
hybridized with DNA from all known species of Legionella, and is therefore only undertaken
by specialized laboratories. Sequence analysis of specific genes has been used for taxonomic
analysis of legionellae. Analysis of 16S rRNA genes led to the designation of Legionella within
the gamma-2 subdivision of the class Proteobacteria, and has been used to show the phylogenetic
relatedness of new species of this genus (Fry et al., 1991). A sequence-based classification
scheme that targets the mip gene has been developed for legionellae (Ratcliff et al., 1998).
This scheme can unambiguously discriminate between the 39 species of Legionella tested so
far, and it is likely that all taxonomic analysis will soon become sequence-based.
Within the genus Legionella, species can therefore be distinguished by biochemical analysis,
fatty acid profiles, protein banding patterns, serology, DNA–DNA hybridization and analysis
of 16S rRNA genes (Hookey et al., 1996; Benson & Fields, 1998; Riffard et al., 1998; Fields,
Benson & Besser, 2002).

11.4.2 Identifying Legionella colonies
Steps for identifying and confirming Legionella colonies are the same, irrespective of whether the
isolates are from clinical or environmental samples. Young, presumptive colonies of L. pneumophila
show a characteristic speckled green, blue or pink–purple iridescence. More mature colonies
(after three or four days) have entire margins, and are convex, 3–4 mm in diameter and like frosted
glass in appearance. Older colonies lose most of their iridescence. Subsequent confirmation
should be carried out using a cysteine-free agar to show dependency on L-cysteine (Barker,
Farrell & Hutchinson, 1986).
The rapid identification and separate confirmation of L. pneumophila serogroup 1, other serogroups
and some other pathogenic species is important for epidemiological investigations. Presumptive
colonies of pathogenic Legionella species from clinical or environmental samples can be confirmed
using a range of antibody reactions, such as indirect immunofluorescence, direct immunofluorescence,
immunodiffusion, crossed immunoelectrophoresis and slide agglutination.
Preliminary identification of Legionella spp. with an antibody-reaction test can be done by
routine microbiological laboratories. Commercially available latex agglutination kits may be
used for confirmation. Suspect colonies are simply emulsified as directed, and mixed with each
latex reagent separately on a disposable reaction card. Each reagent is sensitized with antibodies
specific to Legionella. In the presence of homologous antigens, the latex particles agglutinate
to give a clearly visible positive reaction for some minutes (Hart et al., 2000). Isolates that
react with specific antisera against known legionellae are confirmed legionellae. The different
serogroups of L. pneumophila may cross‑react (Wilkinson et al., 1990), and when isolates fail
to react with specific antisera to all known legionellae, they must be evaluated and eventually

considered as potential new species. A more detailed identification can be carried out in reference
laboratories.
Both environmental strains and clinical isolates can be successfully subtyped by molecular techniques,
such as ribotyping, macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), or
PCR-based methods (Schoonmaker, Heimberger & Birkhead, 1992; Pruckler et al., 1995; Van
Belkum et al., 1996; Ballard et al., 2000). The most accurate way to compare epidemiologically
linked environmental and clinical isolates is to use two typing methods — genotyping (e.g.
PFGE) and phenotyping (monoclonal subtyping) — in parallel (Drenning et al., 2001). An
internationally recognized typing method using amplified fragment length polymorphism
(AFLP) was tested on Legionella infections by 11 countries within the European working
group (Fry et al., 2000; 2002). This method allows culture media to be compared without
the need for transportation. In future, sequence-based typing methods, such as that described
by Gaia et al. (2003), will be more commonly used. A consensus sequence-based scheme
based on this previous work, using a standard protocol and dedicated web site27 will greatly
assist in timely epidemiological investigation, particularly of travel-associated cases of infection
caused by L. pneumophila (Gaia et al., 2005).

11.4.3 Identifying appropriate sampling sites
Selection of sampling sites depends on whether the sampling is for routine monitoring or to
investigate an outbreak. The use of PCR for detecting nucleic acids of legionellae in the environment
has been valuable in some investigations of legionellosis outbreaks, and is particularly useful
for eliminating epidemiologically and geographically implicated sources. Quantitative methods
are being developed for determining whether a potential environmental source is above guideline
or mandatory levels contained in national legislation, where available (Ballard et al., 2000).
The use of PCR to detect legionellae in the environment shows that up to 80% of fresh water
is positive; this compares with only 20–40% when using culture to detect Legionella. The
discrepancy could be due to the presence of non‑viable or injured organisms, viable but
non‑culturable legionellae, a nonspecific reaction with unrelated organisms (although data
suggest this is not the case), or the presence of new species of legionellae.
The number and types of sites that should be tested to detect legionellae must be determined
on an individual system basis. This is because of the diversity of plumbing, heating, ventilation
and air-conditioning systems in the various institutions that may be sampled, which include
industrial facilities, hotels, hospitals, retirement homes, public facilities and domestic environments.
In 1987, an environmental sampling protocol was published, dealing with selection of appropriate
sites to sample within a hospital (Barbaree et al., 1987) (see Table 11.2). This protocol can
serve as a prototype for identifying sites that should be sampled in various institutions.

Generally, any water source that may produce aerosols should be considered a potential
source for the transmission of legionellae (see Chapter 2). Legionellae require temperatures
between 20 °C and 50 °C to multiply. Consequently, the bacteria are rarely found in municipal
water supplies and tend to colonize warm water systems and point-of-use devices, particularly
hot-water systems. Legionellae do not survive drying, and so condensation from air-conditioning
equipment, which frequently evaporates to dryness, is not a likely source. High numbers of
environmental legionellae, which grow only at 30 ºC or below and will not grow at 37 ºC,
have been isolated from cold systems (Vladimir Drasar, OHS National Legionella Reference
Laboratory, Czech Republic, personal communication, January 2005); however, these are
unlikely to have any clinical significance.

11.4.4 Collecting environmental samples
Two primary sample types — water samples and swabs of point-of-use devices or system
surfaces — should be collected when sampling for legionellae. Collection of at least 1 litre of
water allows the sample to be concentrated, if necessary. If the water source has recently been
treated with an oxidizing biocide, such as chlorine or bromine, sodium thiosulfate must be added
to each 1‑litre sample in sufficient quantities to neutralize any disinfectant present. Depending
on the reason for sampling, the sample may be taken as a first flush (i.e. no disinfection). This
is appropriate for most occasions and will represent the worst case. After disinfection, the
sample will be taken from a running outlet representing the circulating system.


190                                          LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
During outbreak investigations, swabs should be taken in conjunction with water samples from
sites where biofilms are likely to form. These swabs can be taken from various points within
plumbing systems, from surfaces such as biofilms, and from areas that are difficult to reach,
such as within the jets of hot tubs (see Chapter 8), thermostatic mixer valves or showers. The
swabs can be submerged in a small volume of water taken at the same time, or in Pages’s
saline to prevent drying during transportation to the laboratory.
All samples should be transported to the laboratory in dark, insulated containers to protect
them from extreme temperatures and from light.
Information should be gathered to help interpret the results. As a minimum, the following
information should be included on the request form:
• the site and sample point
• the sample references and date
• the reason for sampling
• the temperature of the sample source (e.g. the temperature of a hot-water system at one
  minute after turning on the tap, and at two minutes after turning on the cold tap)
• any biocide used
• the timing of the dosage in relation to sampling
• the concentration detected at the time of sampling
• any other risk factors of importance (e.g. closed system opened for maintenance)
• high risk of nutrient present, such as in plastics manufacturing plants
• any cases associated with the site.

11.4.5 Sample preparation and isolation
Isolation methods for clinical and environmental samples differ. Legionellae are usually a very
minor component of the total bacterial population in environmental samples, and are rarely
present in high numbers. Thus, when working with environmental samples, it is usually necessary
to first concentrate the microfloras. In the case of clinical specimens such as sputa and tissue
biopsies, these may need to be homogenised before culture; in contrast, the organisms in
fluids such as bronchiolar lavages will need to be concentrated by centrifuging. For both
environmental concentrates and clinical samples, it is necessary to eliminate or suppress the
competing background flora during primary culture.
Legionellae and background bacteria can be concentrated from water samples by centrifugation
or membrane filtration, or by a combination of the two. Recovery in the presence of other
bacterial species present in the sample can be improved by heating, usually at 50 ºC for


LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS                                             191
30 minutes (Maiwald, Helbig & Lück, 1998), and by treating with acid (Bopp et al., 1981;
ISO, 1998; ISO 2004). If using an acid treatment, an acid buffer of pH 2.2 should be used for
five minutes, although this may also inhibit the growth of legionellae (Lück, Helbig &
Schuppler, 2002). Homogenates of sputa and tissues, and centrifuged deposits from more fluid
clinical specimens should be cultured directly, and after treating with heat or an acid buffer
(Stout, Rihs & Yu, 2003).
Although it may be possible to isolate legionellae on the non-selective growth medium BCYE
(particularly from clinical specimens), it is usually necessary to use modified versions of
BCYE containing an antibiotic supplement to suppress the background flora, such as:
• polymixin, anisomycin and cefamandole (Edelstein, 1981)
• glycine, vancomycin and polymixin, plus one of the following:
   – cycloheximide (Dennis, 1988b)

      –   natamycin, which is an alternative antifungal to cycloheximide that is less toxic to
          humans (Edelstein & Edelstein, 1996).

An alternative medium — Wadowsky and Yee medium (MWY) as modified by Edelstein
(1982b) — includes vancomycin, bromothymol blue and bromocresol purple, and is used to
increase the differentiation of legionellae from the background organisms (Wadowsky & Yee,
1981; Vickers et al., 1981). Morrill et al. (1990) advocated the additional use of albumin to
increase the recovery of L. micdadei and L. bozemanii.
In environmental investigations of outbreaks of legionellosis, culture has been used to detect
legionellae in the environment. As a result, most of the epidemiologically relevant information
concerning legionellosis is based on direct culture data. All agar plates are inoculated with a
portion of sample (generally 0.1–0.2 ml) by the spread plate technique and incubated at
36 °C, preferably in a humidified 2.5% carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere or candle
extinction jar.

11.4.6 Interpreting results
To date, no direct relationship has been established between the risk of infection and the
number of Legionella detected in a water system using the generally adopted culture method.
Recovery of L. pneumophila by culture is poor because:
• Legionella exist with other background heterotrophic bacteria; therefore, the sample needs
  to be treated with heat or acid to repress the growth of non-Legionella bacteria on the
  culture media
• antibiotics need to be added to the culture medium for Legionella growth.




192                                    LEGIONELLA AND THE PREVENTION OF LEGIONELLOSIS
• other Legionella species that do not cause legionellosis produce colonies on the medium,
  as does L. pneumophila
• the culture technique often fails to detect some other disease-causing Legionella species
  (e.g. L. bozemanii and L. micdadei)
• residual disinfectant in the system may affect the cultivation of legionellae
• if the sample collection bottles do not contain a neutralizing agent, Legionella may be
  killed (Wiedenmann, Langhammer & Botzenhart, 2001).
These uncertainties and differences in susceptibility of Legionella populations make it difficult
to interpret the colony count values for Legionella in relation to disease risk. However, culture
results, together with the percentage of samples containing Legionella, provide useful information
about the degree of amplification of Legionella in a system. A high degree of amplification
results in a higher exposure, which may be related to a higher infection risk.
When using L-cysteine dependence to confirm legionellae, it is worth remembering that
some bacteria produce extracellular cysteine that can support the growth of legionellae, which
then appear as satellite colonies on the cysteine-free medium (Wadowsky & Yee, 1983). Some
pseudomonads can grow with Legionella within water systems; however, their presence can
reduce Legionella growth on artificial media. When this occurs and the pseudomonads cannot
be removed by pretreatment or dilution, the results must be interpreted carefully.
