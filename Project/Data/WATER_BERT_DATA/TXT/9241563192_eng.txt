Introduction



The first WHO publication dealing specifically with drinking-water quality
was published in 1958 as International Standards for Drinking-water (WHO,
1958). It was subsequently revised in 1963 and in 1971 under the same title
(WHO, 1963, 1971). In 1984–85, the first edition of the WHO Guidelines for
Drinking-water Quality was published. The philosophy and content of the
Guidelines constituted a significant departure from the previous International
Standards. The basic premise of the Guidelines was that they are not standards as
such, but should be used as a basis for setting national or regional standards
taking into account local social, cultural, environmental and economic
considerations.
    In 1989, work was started on a second edition of the Guidelines for
Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ) which was published in three volumes:
Volume 1 Recommendations (WHO, 1993), Volume 2 Health Criteria and Other
Supporting Information (WHO, 1996) and Volume 3 Surveillance and Control of
Community Supplies (WHO, 1997) with Addenda published in 1998 and 2002
(WHO, 1998, 2002). A fully revised edition of Volume 1 Recommendations was
published in 2004 (WHO, 2004).
    The primary aim of the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality is the protec-
tion of public health. The GDWQ provide an assessment of the health risk
presented by micro-organisms and chemicals present in drinking-water. This
assessment can then be applied to the development and implementation of

national standards for drinking-water quality. In addition, in response to
demands from Member States, the Guidelines have always included guidance
material concerning specific problems related to small community supplies.
    Fluoride is one of the very few chemicals that has been shown to cause signif-
icant effects in people through drinking-water. Fluoride has beneficial effects on
teeth at low concentrations in drinking-water, but excessive exposure to fluoride
in drinking-water, or in combination with exposure to fluoride from other
sources, can give rise to a number of adverse effects. These range from mild
dental fluorosis to crippling skeletal fluorosis as the level and period of exposure
increases. Crippling skeletal fluorosis is a significant cause of morbidity in a
number of regions of the world. Fluoride is known to occur at elevated concen-
trations in a number of parts of the world and in such circumstances can have,
and often has, a significant adverse impact on public health and well-being.
There is now a continuing process of updating the GDWQ, through which it was
concluded that there was a need for a monograph on fluoride in drinking-water
that would be useful to a wide range of individuals, including health workers and
sanitary engineers who may require a broad introduction to the subject, but
would still provide more detailed guidance in some specific areas. Such a mono-
graph could provide an appropriate introduction and background information,
and indicate where other more detailed information could be obtained. The
primary focus of the monograph should be the prevention of adverse effects from
excessive levels of fluoride in drinking-water. This document, Fluoride in
Drinking-water, was written to meet that need. It is one of several monographs,
which also cover arsenic and complements guidance previously published on
cyanobacteria in water. The draft monograph was issued for extensive consulta-
tion and the final draft, which considered the comments received, also received
further peer review from experts in developing and developed countries.

Environmental occurrence,
geochemistry and exposure



F  luorine is the lightest member of the halogen group and is one of the most
reactive of all chemical elements. It is not, therefore, found as fluorine in the
environment. It is the most electronegative of all the elements (Hem, 1989)
which means that it has a strong tendency to acquire a negative charge, and in
solution forms F– ions. Other oxidation states are not found in natural systems,
although uncharged complexes may be. Fluoride ions have the same charge
and nearly the same radius as hydroxide ions and may replace each other in
mineral structures (Hem, 1985). Fluoride thus forms mineral complexes with a
number of cations and some fairly common mineral species of low solubility
contain fluoride.
    Fluorine in the environment is therefore found as fluorides which together
represent about 0.06–0.09 per cent of the earth’s crust. The average crustal abun-
dance is 300 mg kg–1 (Tebutt, 1983). Fluorides are found at significant levels in a
wide variety of minerals, including fluorspar, rock phosphate, cryolite, apatite,
mica, hornblende and others (Murray, 1986). Fluorite (CaF2) is a common fluo-
ride mineral of low solubility occurring in both igneous and sedimentary rocks.
Fluoride is commonly associated with volcanic activity and fumarolic gases.
Thermal waters, especially those of high pH, are also rich in fluoride (Edmunds
and Smedley, 1996). Minerals of commercial importance include cryolite and
rock phosphates. The fluoride salt cryolite is used for the production of

aluminium (Murray, 1986) and as a pesticide (USEPA, 1996). Rock phosphates
are converted into phosphate fertilizers by the removal of up to 4.2 per cent fluo-
ride (Murray, 1986); the removed and purified fluoride (as fluorosilicates) is a
source of fluoride that in some countries is added to drinking-water in order to
protect against dental caries (Reeves, 1986, 1994).


2.1      Fluoride distribution in water
Fluoride is found in all natural waters at some concentration. Seawater typically
contains about 1 mg l–1 while rivers and lakes generally exhibit concentrations of
less than 0.5 mg l–1. In groundwaters, however, low or high concentrations of
fluoride can occur, depending on the nature of the rocks and the occurrence of
fluoride-bearing minerals. Concentrations in water are limited by fluorite solu-
bility, so that in the presence of 40 mg l–1 calcium it should be limited to
3.1 mg l–1 (Hem, 1989). It is the absence of calcium in solution which allows
higher concentrations to be stable (Edmunds and Smedley, 1996). High fluoride
concentrations may therefore be expected in groundwaters from calcium-poor
aquifers and in areas where fluoride-bearing minerals are common. Fluoride
concentrations may also increase in groundwaters in which cation exchange of
sodium for calcium occurs (Edmunds and Smedley, 1996).
    Fluorosis has been described as an endemic disease of tropical climates, but
this is not entirely the case. Waters with high fluoride concentrations occur in
large and extensive geographical belts associated with a) sediments of marine
origin in mountainous areas, b) volcanic rocks and c) granitic and gneissic rocks.
A typical example of the first extends from Iraq and Iran through Syria and
Turkey to the Mediterranean region, and hence from Algeria to Morocco. Other
important examples come from the southern parts of the USA, southern Europe
and the southern parts of the former USSR.
    The most well-known and documented area associated with volcanic activity
follows the East African Rift system from the Jordan valley down through
Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania. Many of
the lakes of the Rift Valley system, especially the soda lakes, have extremely
high fluoride concentrations; 1,640 mg l–1 and 2,800 mg l–1 respectively, in the
Kenyan Lakes Elmentaita and Nakuru (Nair et al., 1984), and up to 690 mg l–1 in
the Tanzanian Momella soda lakes. In Kenya, a detailed survey of fluoride in
groundwater was undertaken by Nair et al. (1984). Of over 1,000 groundwater
samples taken nationally, 61 per cent exceeded 1 mg l–1, almost 20 per cent
exceeded 5 mg l–1 and 12 per cent exceeded 8 mg l–1. The volcanic areas of the
Nairobi, Rift Valley and Central Provinces had the highest concentrations, with
maximum groundwater fluoride concentrations reaching 30–50 mg l–1. Most of
the sampled wells and boreholes were providing drinking-water, and the

prevalence of dental fluorosis in the most affected areas was observed to be very
high (Manji and Kapila, 1986). A similar picture emerges for the United
Republic of Tanzania, where 30 per cent of waters used for drinking exceeded
1.5 mg l–1 fluoride (Latham and Gretch, 1967) with concentrations in the Rift
Valley of up to 45 mg l–1.
    High groundwater fluoride concentrations associated with igneous and meta-
morphic rocks such as granites and gneisses have been reported from India,
Pakistan, West Africa, Thailand, China, Sri Lanka, and Southern Africa. In
China, endemic fluorosis has been reported in all 28 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities except Shanghai. Both shallow and deeper
groundwaters are affected; in general the deeper groundwaters have the higher
concentrations. In Sri Lanka, Dissanayake (1991) found concentrations of up to
10 mg l–1 in groundwaters in the Dry Zone, associated with dental and possibly
skeletal fluorosis. In the Wet Zone, the intensive rainfall and long-term leaching
of fluoride and other minerals from the crystalline bedrock are probably respon-
sible for the much lower concentrations. Reported drinking-water fluoride levels
are outlined on a country-by-country basis in Chapter 7.
    Endemic fluorosis remains a challenging and extensively studied national
health problem in India. In 1991, 13 of India’s 32 states and territories were
reported to have naturally high concentrations of fluoride in water (Mangla,
1991), but this had risen to 17 by 1999 (UNICEF, 1999). The most seriously
affected areas are Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil
Nadu and Uttar Pradesh (Kumaran, et al., 1971; Teotia et al., 1984). The highest
concentration observed to date in India is 48 mg l–1 in Rewari District of Haryana
(UNICEF, 1999). The high concentrations in groundwater are a result of dissolu-
tion of fluorite, apatite and topaz from the local bedrock, and Handa (1975) noted
the general negative correlation between fluoride and calcium concentrations in
Indian groundwater.
    Efforts to address the problem of fluoride in rural water supplies in India have
been led by the Rajiv Ghandi National Drinking Water Mission, with consider-
able support from external agencies, particularly UNICEF. However, even with
the great interest in fluoride in India, it is not easy to arrive at an accurate or reli-
able estimate of the number of people at risk. This is because of the difficulty of
sampling groundwater from India’s many millions of handpumps. Existing
sampling has been selective but unstructured, taking some villages from districts
and some of the many pumps in each village (UNICEF, 1999). Further, there
have been no comprehensive health surveys for dental fluorosis from which the
overall extent of the problem could be assessed. Nevertheless, in the most
affected states listed above, half or more of the districts have some villages with
groundwater supplies having high fluoride concentrations. In these states, 10 to
25 per cent of the rural population has been estimated to be at risk, and perhaps a
8                          Fluoride in Drinking-water

total of 60–70 million people in India as a whole may be considered to be so
(UNICEF, 1999).


2.2     Exposure

2.2.1 Air
Due to dust, industrial production of phosphate fertilizers, coal ash from the
burning of coal and volcanic activity, fluorides are widely distributed in the
atmosphere. However, air is typically responsible for only a small fraction of
total fluoride exposure (USNRC, 1993). In non-industrial areas, the fluoride
concentration in air is typically quite low (0.05–1.90 µg m–3 fluoride) (Murray,
1986). In areas where fluoride-containing coal is burned or phosphate fertilizers
are produced and used, the fluoride concentration in air is elevated leading to
increased exposure by the inhalation route. High levels of atmospheric fluoride
occur in areas of Morocco and China (Haikel et al., 1986, 1989). In some prov-
inces of China, fluoride concentrations in indoor air ranged from 16 to 46 µg m–3
owing to the indoor combustion of high-fluoride coal for cooking and for drying
and curing food (WHO, 1996). Indeed, more than 10 million people in China are
reported to suffer from fluorosis, related in part to the burning of high fluoride
coal (Gu et al., 1990).

2.2.2 Dental products
A number of products administered to, or used by, children to reduce dental
decay contain fluoride. This includes toothpaste (1.0–1.5 g kg–1 fluoride), fluo-
ride solutions and gels for topical treatment (0.25–24.0 g kg–1 fluoride) and
fluoride tablets (0.25, 0.50 or 1.00 mg fluoride per tablet), among others. These
products contribute to total fluoride exposure, albeit to different degrees. It is
estimated that the swallowing of toothpaste by some children may contribute
about 0.50 or 0.75 mg fluoride per child per day (Murray, 1986).

2.2.3 Food and beverages other than water
Vegetables and fruits normally have low levels of fluoride (e.g. 0.1–0.4 mg kg–1)
and thus typically contribute little to exposure. However, higher levels of fluo-
ride have been found in barley and rice (e.g. about 2 mg kg–1) and taro, yams and
cassava been found to contain relatively high fluoride levels (Murray, 1986).
    In general, the levels of fluoride in meat (0.2–1.0 mg kg–1) and fish
(2–5 mg kg–1) are relatively low. However, fluoride accumulates in bone and the
bones of canned fish, such as salmon and sardines, which are also eaten. Fish
protein concentrates may contain up to 370 mg kg–1 fluoride. However, even

with a relatively high fish consumption in a mixed diet, the fluoride intake from
fish alone would seldom exceed 0.2 mg F– per day (Murray, 1986).
    Milk typically contains low levels of fluoride, e.g. 0.02 mg l–1 in human
breast milk and 0.02–0.05 mg l–1 in cow’s milk (Murray, 1986). Thus milk is
usually responsible for only a small fraction of total fluoride exposure.
    Tea leaves contain high levels of fluoride (up to 400 mg kg–1 dry weight).
Fluoride exposure due to the ingestion of tea has been reported to range from
0.04 mg to 2.7 mg per person per day (Murray, 1986). However, some Tibetans
have been observed to ingest large amounts of fluoride (e.g. 14 mg per day) due
to the consumption of brick tea as a beverage (Cao et al., 1997). This type of tea
is made from older leaves and contains much higher levels of fluoride than stan-
dard teas such as black or green tea.
    It is also possible that other forms of tea will contribute to fluoride uptake,
although data appear to relatively limited. In one study 34 per cent of the fluoride
in black tea was shown to remain in the oral cavity but no data were presented on
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (Simpson et al., 2001). The fluoride
content of a range of different foods is given in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.
    In general, Western-style diets appear to contribute only slightly to the total
daily fluoride intake (Murray, 1986). However, not everyone eats such a diet.
The following examples are exceptional to the general rule:
+   Trona (Na3H(CO3)2.2H2O) is used in cooking in the United Republic of
    Tanzania to tenderize certain vegetables. Fluoride contaminated trona has
    significantly contributed to the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in
    the United Republic of Tanzania (Mabelya, 1997).
+   Consumption of high fluoride brick tea as a beverage (Cao et al., 1997).
+   In some regions in China significant dietary fluoride exposure occurs due to
    the consumption of maize polluted by fly ash generated by the burning of
    high fluoride coal (Chen, 1991).
+   The composition of the diet influences retention of dietary fluoride
    (Whitford, 1997). High protein diets (e.g. Western-style diet) result in a more
    acidic urine than a vegetarian diet. A more acidic urine results in increased
    retention of fluoride due to decreased renal excretion. However, at present,
    the effects of a vegetarian vs. a non-vegetarian diet on the effects produced by
    fluoride in different regions of the world are unclear.

2.2.4 Water
Drinking-water is typically the largest single contributor to daily fluoride intake
(Murray, 1986). However, as noted above, this is not necessarily true in every
case (e.g. Haikel et al., 1986, 1989; Chen, 1991; Cao et al., 1997; Mabelya,
1997). For a given individual, fluoride exposure (mg kg–1 of body weight per

day) via drinking-water is determined by the fluoride level in the water and the
daily water consumption (litres per day). Water consumption data are most
readily available for countries such as Canada (Environment Health Directorate,
1977), the USA (Ershow and Cantor, 1989) and the UK (Hopkin and Ellis,
1980). More recently national figures can be obtained or computed from various
compendia of environmental and water supply statistics such as World Bank
(1994) and WRI (1996). However, national consumption figures, especially for
developing countries, may be of limited use for this purpose because there are
likely to be major differences between urban communities with fully piped
supplies and rural communities using wells and boreholes with handpumps.
Consequently, data concerning exposure to fluoride are difficult to come by
except for temperate regions. In the USA, young children who consume water
containing 0.7–1.2 mg l–1 fluoride are estimated to be exposed to approximately
0.5 mg fluoride per day (USNRC, 1993); for those drinking 1 litre of water per
day exposure may be up to 1.2 mg fluoride per day (USEPA, 1994). Similar
values would probably apply to other similar climatic regions.
    For a given individual, water consumption increases with temperature,
humidity, exercise and state of health, and is modified by other factors including
diet. Roughly, the closer to the Equator, the higher the water consumption
(Murray, 1986).
24                              Fluoride in Drinking-water

2.2.5 Total fluoride exposure
Based on the previous discussion, it follows that total daily fluoride exposure can
vary markedly from one region to another. However, from several studies, a
rough estimate of total daily fluoride exposure in a temperate climate would be
approximately 0.6 mg per adult per day in an area in which no fluoride is added to
the drinking-water and 2 mg per adult per day in a fluoridated area (WHO, 1984).
In many countries this can be potentially increased for children from the use of
fluoridated dental products but there will be significant variation in individual
exposure. In hot climates the much higher consumption of water will also
increase the intake and this is frequently highly significant. In addition, fluoride
exposure in many areas is considerably higher as a consequence of a range of
practices, including the consumption of brick tea and the cooking and drying of
food with high fluoride coal. A range of estimated fluoride intakes as a conse-
quence of exposure to a number of different sources is given in Tables 2.3 and 2.4.

Human health effects



Fluoride has beneficial effects on teeth at low concentrations in drinking-water,
but excessive exposure to fluoride in drinking-water, or in combination with
exposure to fluoride from other sources, can give rise to a number of adverse
effects. These range from mild dental fluorosis to crippling skeletal fluorosis as
the level and period of exposure increases. Crippling skeletal fluorosis is a
significant cause of morbidity in a number of regions of the world.
    Both national and international groups (USNRC, 1993; IPCS, 2002) have
comprehensively reviewed available data on the metabolism and health effects
of fluoride in both laboratory animals and humans. The following is a summary
of the conclusions that have been developed by these groups, particularly the
IPCS working group on fluorides held in May 2001 (IPCS, 2002). The reader is
directed to these documents for a more detailed assessment of the data.


3.1       Fluoride metabolism

3.1.1 Absorption
Approximately 75–90 per cent of ingested fluoride is absorbed. In an acidic
stomach, fluoride is converted into hydrogen fluoride (HF) and up to about 40
per cent of the ingested fluoride is absorbed from the stomach as HF. High
stomach pH decreases gastric absorption by decreasing the concentration uptake

Publishing, London, UK.
30                          Fluoride in Drinking-water

of HF. Fluoride not absorbed in the stomach is absorbed in the intestine and is
unaffected by pH at this site (Whitford, 1997; IPCS, 2002).
    Relative to the amount of fluoride ingested, high concentrations of cations
that form insoluble complexes with fluoride (e.g. calcium, magnesium and
aluminium) can markedly decrease gastrointestinal fluoride absorption
(Whitford, 1997; IPCS, 2002).

3.1.2 Distribution
Once absorbed into the blood, fluoride readily distributes throughout the body,
with approximately 99 per cent of the body burden of fluoride retained in
calcium rich areas such as bone and teeth (dentine and enamel) where it is incor-
porated into the crystal lattice. In infants about 80 to 90 per cent of the absorbed
fluoride is retained but in adults this level falls to about 60 per cent. Fluoride
crosses the placenta and is found in mothers milk at low levels essentially equal
to those in blood (WHO, 1996; IPCS, 2002).
    Under certain conditions, plasma fluoride levels provide an indication of the
level of fluoride in the drinking-water consumed. USNRC (1993) notes that
“Provided that water is the major source of fluoride intake, fasting plasma fluo-
ride concentrations of healthy young or middle-aged adults expressed in
micromoles per litre are roughly equal to the fluoride concentrations in drinking
water expressed as milligrams per litre”. Levels of fluoride that are found in the
bone vary with the part of the bone examined and with the age and sex of the indi-
vidual. Bone fluoride is considered to be a reflection of long-term exposure to
fluoride (IPCS, 2002).

3.1.3 Excretion
Fluoride is excreted primarily via urine (IPCS, 2002). Urinary fluoride clearance
increases with urine pH due to a decrease in the concentration of HF. Numerous
factors (e.g. diet and drugs) can affect urine pH and thus affect fluoride clearance
and retention (USNRC, 1993).


3.2      Effects on laboratory animals and in vitro systems

3.2.1 Medium and long-term exposure
A number of sub-chronic and chronic studies have been carried out in laboratory
animals in which relatively high doses of soluble fluoride were given in drink-
ing-water. In some studies there is uncertainty regarding the actual dose because
commercial laboratory animal rations contain variable amounts of fluoride.
Dental fluorosis and a range of effects on bone were noted in several studies. A
                      Assessment of Human Health Effects                        31

number of other adverse effects have also been reported, including increased
hepatic cell size, nephrosis, myocardial mineralization and degeneration of the
seminipherous tubules in testis in mice (IPCS, 2002).

3.2.2 Mutagenicity and related end-points
A large number of mutagenicity studies have been conducted with inorganic
fluoride ion. This includes studies in bacteria, insects, laboratory animals and in
vitro studies with human cells. The results have been mixed but, in general, fluo-
ride is not mutagenic in prokaryotes. There have been a number of positive
results in a variety of mammalian cell types for chromosome damage (USNRC,
1993; WHO, 1996; IPCS, 2002). It is generally considered that these effects are
due to interference with protein synthesis rather than any direct interaction
between fluoride and DNA. Although some cytogenetic damage or changes in
sperm cell morphology have been reported in rodents following intraperitoneal
injection of fluoride, most studies by the oral route are negative (IPCS, 2002). In
commenting on these studies, particularly those in human cells, WHO (1996) has
concluded that the data are probably of limited relevance for humans.

3.2.3 Carcinogenicity
In 1987, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the
available data concerning the carcinogenicity of fluoride and concluded that there
was inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC, 1987).
    Two separate sets of long-term fluoride carcinogenicity studies in rats and
mice have been published in the 1990s (NTP, 1990; Bucher et al., 1991; Maurer
et al., 1990, 1993). These studies have been extensively reviewed with the general
conclusion that they do not provide adequate evidence to conclude that fluoride is
carcinogenic (USNRC, 1993; WHO, 1996; IPCS, 2002).

3.2.4 Developmental and reproductive toxicity
Effects on the morphology of reproductive organs and reproductive function
have been reported in male and female rabbits and mice given doses of greater
than 4.5 mg kg–1 body weight per day for varying periods, either orally or by
injection. However, in recent studies in laboratory animals, no effects have been
observed on reproduction, reproductive organs or the development of the foetus
(IPCS, 2002).


3.3      Effects on humans
A number of studies have reported on the acute effects of fluoride exposure
following fluoridation overdosing. However, the effects of long-term exposure
32                           Fluoride in Drinking-water

to naturally occurring fluoride from drinking-water and other environmental
sources is the major concern with regard to human health. A large number of
epidemiological studies have been conducted in many countries concerning the
effects of long-term exposure to fluoride. Information from countries where
dental or skeletal fluorosis has been documented is summarized in Chapter 7.

3.3.1 Effects on teeth
The beneficial and the detrimental effects of fluoride naturally present in water
were well established by the early 1940s. High levels of fluoride present in
concentrations up to 10 mg l–1 were associated with dental fluorosis (yellowish
or brownish striations or mottling of the enamel) while low levels of fluoride,
less than 0.1 mg l–1, were associated with high levels of dental decay (Edmunds
and Smedley, 1996), although poor nutritional status is also an important
contributory factor.
    Concentrations in drinking-water of about 1 mg l–1 are associated with a
lower incidence of dental caries, particularly in children, whereas excess intake
of fluoride can result in dental fluorosis. In severe cases this can result in erosion
of enamel. The margin between the beneficial effects of fluoride and the occur-
rence of dental fluorosis is small and public health programmes seek to retain a
suitable balance between the two (IPCS, 2002). The various indices used to rate
the severity of dental fluorosis are outlined in the Appendix.
    The level of dental caries (measured as the mean number of Decayed,
Missing or Filled teeth) falls from seven at a fluoride concentration of 0.1 mg l–1
to around 3.5 at a fluoride concentration of 1.0 mg l–1. As fluoride concentration
increased further (up to 2.6 mg l–1) dental decay continues to fall, but only
slightly (Dean, 1942; USPHS, 1991). Conversely, dental fluorosis increases as
fluoride concentration increases. At a fluoride concentration of 1 mg l–1 about 20
per cent of children have evidence of dental fluorosis but this fluorosis is of a
mild degree of severity and would not be cosmetically obvious to the children or
their parents (Dean, 1942). Thus the evidence suggested that, at least for fluoride
naturally present in water, the optimal level of fluoride for a temperate climate
was around 1 mg l–1; this concentration was associated with a substantial resis-
tance to tooth decay but with only a small and cosmetically insignificant increase
in the prevalence of dental fluorosis.
    Dental fluorosis is a cosmetic effect that ranges in appearance from scarcely
discernible to a marked staining or pitting of the teeth in severe forms. It is
caused by an elevated fluoride level in, or adjacent to, the developing enamel
(Whitford, 1997). Thus, it follows that dental fluorosis can develop in children
but not adults. Dental fluorosis in an adult is a result of high fluoride exposure
when the adult was a child or adolescent. The problems involved in measuring
the incidence and severity of dental fluorosis (USNRC, 1993) are beyond the
                      Assessment of Human Health Effects                          33

scope of this work other than to note that adequately trained individuals are
required. There are a variety of ways of describing dental fluorosis (USNRC,
1993) (see Appendix).
    The first reports of the occurrence of dental fluorosis date back to 1888, when
a family from Durango, Mexico were described as having “black teeth”. Subse-
quently, erosion of dental enamel was described among inhabitants of Naples in
1891 and in Italian migrants to the USA from towns near Naples (Eager, 1901,
cited by Belyakova and Zhavoronkov, 1978). Subsequently, dental fluorosis was
described in the early 1900s at several locations in the USA (Black and McKay,
1916; Fleischer, 1962) and in many other countries around the world. Indeed,
Belyakova and Zhavoronkov (1978) suggested that fluorosis might be one of the
most widespread of endemic health problems associated with natural
geochemistry.
    Endemic fluorosis is now known to be global in scope, occurring on all conti-
nents and affecting many millions of people. Although no precise figures for the
global number of persons affected are available, some figures at national levels
have been given in the literature. Thus, for example, in China some 38 million
people are reported to suffer from dental fluorosis and 1.7 million from the more
severe skeletal fluorosis (WRI, 1990). In India, Susheela and Das (1988)
suggested that around one million people suffer from serious and incapacitating
skeletal fluorosis. Using the Chinese dental:skeletal fluorosis ratio, India could
therefore have up to 20 million dental fluorosis sufferers, and in fact Mangla
(1991) suggested that fluorosis affects an estimated 25 million people in India.
Thus in India and China alone over 60 million people may be affected and, when
other populations in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean in particular are taken
into account, the global total may exceed 70 million.

3.3.2 Skeletal effects
Endemic skeletal fluorosis is well documented and is known to occur with a
range of severity in several parts of the world, including India, China and
northern, eastern, central and southern Africa. It is primarily associated with the
consumption of drinking-water containing elevated levels of fluoride but expo-
sure to additional sources of fluoride such as high fluoride coal is also potentially
very important. This is compounded by a number of factors which include
climate, related to water consumption, nutritional status and diet, including addi-
tional sources of fluoride and exposure to other substances that modify the
absorption of fluoride into the body. Crippling skeletal fluorosis, which is asso-
ciated with the higher levels of exposure, can result from osteosclerosis,
ligamentous and tendinous calcification and extreme bone deformity. Evidence
from occupational exposure also indicates that exposure to elevated concentra-
tions of fluoride in the air may also be a cause of skeletal fluorosis (IPCS, 2002).
34                          Fluoride in Drinking-water

    Although there are a large number of epidemiological studies available, the
data are such that it is difficult to determine a clear exposure–response relation-
ship. One possible feature of fluorosis is bone fracture, although some studies
have reported a protective effect of fluoride on fracture. In an epidemiological
study in China the relationship between fluoride intake via drinking-water and
all other sources, and all fractures, followed a U shaped dose response with
higher rates of fracture at very low intakes below 0.34 mg l–1 and high intakes
above 4.32 mg l–1 (total intake 14 mg per day) (Li et al., 2001). It was concluded
by the IPCS that for a total intake of 14 mg per day there is a clear excess risk of
skeletal adverse effects and there is suggestive evidence of an increased risk
of effects on the skeleton at total fluoride intakes above about 6 mg per day
(IPCS, 2002).

3.3.3 Cancer
Studies of occupationally exposed populations, primarily from aluminium
smelting, have reported an increased incidence of, and mortality from, lung and
bladder cancer and from cancers in other sites. However, the data are inconsis-
tent and in a number of studies the results can be more readily attributed to
exposure to other substances than fluoride. There have also been a significant
number of epidemiological studies examining the possible association between
various cancers and exposure to fluoride in drinking-water. However, in spite of
the large number of studies conducted in a number of countries, there is no
consistent evidence to demonstrate any association between the consumption of
controlled fluoridated drinking-water and either morbidity or mortality from
cancer (USPHS, 1991; USNRC, 1993; WHO, 1996; IPCS, 2002).

3.3.4 Other possible health effects
A number of epidemiological studies have been carried out to examine other
possible adverse outcomes as a consequence of exposure to fluoride, either from
drinking-water or as a consequence of occupation.
    Studies on the association between exposure of mothers to fluoride in
drinking-water and adverse pregnancy outcome have shown no increased risk of
either spontaneous abortion or congenital malformations.
    No reasonable evidence of effects on the respiratory, haematopoietic, hepatic
or renal systems have emerged from studies of occupationally exposed popula-
tions that could be attributed specifically to fluoride exposure. In addition, such
studies have failed to produce convincing evidence of genotoxic effects.
    The majority of fluoride is excreted via the kidneys (USNRC, 1993). Thus it
is reasonable that those with impaired renal function might be at greater risk of
fluoride toxicity than those without. In discussing this point, WHO (1996)
                          Assessment of Human Health Effects                                  35

concluded that the data were too limited to permit any quantitative evaluation of
possible increased sensitivity due to impaired kidney function.

3.3.5 Acute effects
A number of overdosing incidents have occurred, mostly in small water supplies,
that practice artificial fluoridation. With well designed fail-safe equipment and
working practices overdosing incidents can be avoided (Leland et al., 1980).
Where incidents of acute intoxication have been reported following overdosing
in water supplies, fluoride levels have ranged from 30–1,000 mg l–1 (Peterson,
1988). To produce signs of acute fluoride intoxication, it is estimated that
minimum oral doses of at least 1 mg fluoride per kg of body weight are required
(WHO, 1996). Indeed, such doses could be expected from water with a fluoride
content of approximately 30 mg l–1.

Guidelines and standards



I n 1984, WHO conducted an extensive review and found that there were insuffi-
cient data to conclude that fluoride produces cancer or birth defects. In addition,
WHO noted that mottling of teeth (i.e. dental fluorosis) is sometimes associated
with fluoride levels in drinking-water above 1.5 mg l–1 and crippling skeletal
fluorosis can ensue when fluoride levels exceed 10 mg l–1. A guideline value of
1.5 mg l–1 was therefore recommended by WHO as a level at which dental
fluorosis should be minimal (WHO, 1984).
    The 1.5 mg l–1 fluoride guideline value that was set in 1984 was subsequently
re-evaluated by WHO and it was concluded that there was no evidence to suggest
that it should be revized (WHO, 1996, 2004). The 1.5 mg l–1 guideline value of
WHO is not a “fixed” value but is intended to be adapted to take account of local
conditions (e.g. diet, water consumption, etc.).


4.1       Application of the WHO guideline value to local
          conditions
It is particularly important to consider climatic conditions, volume of water
intake and other factors when setting national standards for fluoride (WHO,
1996). This point is extremely important, not only when setting national stan-
dards for fluoride, but also when taking data from one part of the world and
applying them in regions where local conditions are significantly different.

    The effects of fluoride are best predicted by the dose (i.e. mg fluoride per kg
of body weight per day), the duration of exposure and other factors such as age
(e.g. dental fluorosis). However, most epidemiological studies concerning the
effects of fluoride on teeth and bone have correlated the effects with the concen-
tration of fluoride in the drinking-water (mg l–1 fluoride) consumed rather than
total fluoride exposure.
    Provided water is the major source of fluoride exposure, and water consump-
tion is reasonably constant in the population examined, the concentration of
fluoride in mg l–1 is a reasonable surrogate for fluoride exposure in that population.
However, populations that drink significantly different volumes of water per day
containing the same level of fluoride are exposed to significantly different daily
doses of fluoride. Because the daily fluoride dose determines the likely health
outcome, data obtained from, for example, temperate climates are not directly
applicable to hot humid regions where significantly more water is consumed.
    Ideally, epidemiological data for fluoride should be extrapolated from one
region to another on the basis of mg fluoride per kg body weight per day. At a
minimum, daily water consumption data in several regions would be needed for
this. However, water consumption data are typically only available for a few
countries in temperate climates, such as Canada (Environmental Health Direc-
torate, 1977), USA (Ershow and Cantor, 1989) and UK (Hopkin and Ellis, 1980).
    While water is frequently the major source of fluoride exposure, this is not
always the case as exposure from the diet and from air can be important in some
situations (see section 2.2). There is also a clear indication that high altitudes can
increase fluoride retention and have an effect on dental appearance independent
of fluoride exposure (Whitford, 1997). While the world-wide significance of this
effect is not clear at present, it does appear to be a local factor that needs to be
considered in some situations (Cao et al., 1997).
    Thus, although it is particularly important to consider climatic conditions,
volumes of water intake, diet and other factors when considering fluoride
(WHO, 1996), it is not clear how many of these local conditions can be applied
quantitatively, because of a lack of data.
    Perhaps the best general advice that can be given in relation to local condi-
tions is that, at a minimum, the fluoride level in local water supplies should be
monitored and the population examined for signs of excessive fluoride exposure
(e.g. moderate and/or severe dental fluorosis and crippling skeletal fluorosis).
    Where treatment to remove fluoride is practised, chemicals used should be of
a grade suitable for use in drinking-water supply as outlined in the WHO Guide-
lines for Drinking-water Quality.

Removal of excessive fluoride



O   ccurrence of fluoride at excessive levels in drinking-water in developing
countries is a serious problem. Its detection demands analytical grade chemicals
and laboratory equipment and skills. Similarly, the prevention of fluorosis
through management of drinking-water is a difficult task, which requires favour-
able conditions combining knowledge, motivation, prioritization, discipline and
technical and organizational support. Many filter media and several water treat-
ment methods are known to remove fluoride from water. However, many
initiatives on defluoridation of water have resulted in frustration and failure
(COWI, 1998). Therefore, in any attempt to mitigate fluoride contamination for
an affected community, the provision of safe, low fluoride water from alternative
sources, either as an alternative source or for blending, should be investigated as
the first option.
    In cases where alternative sources are not available, defluoridation of water is
the only measure remaining to prevent fluorosis (Figure 5.1). However, there are
several different defluoridation methods. What may work in one community
may not work in another. What may be appropriate at a certain time and stage of
urbanization, may not be at another. It is therefore most important to select an
appropriate defluoridation method carefully if a sustainable solution to a
fluorosis problem is to be achieved (Figure 5.2).
    This chapter introduces the basic characterization of the removal methods,
followed by discussion of the most promising defluoridation methods; bone

charcoal, contact precipitation, Nalgonda, activated alumina and clay. Finally
the methods discussed are compared using indicators, which may be appropriate
in developing countries.
    Advanced treatment technologies, e.g. reverse osmosis, electrodialysis and
distillation, plus methods based on patented media and natural media of
restricted interest are largely excluded from the scope of this document.
Defluoridation of drinking-water is technically feasible at point-of-use (at the
tap), for small communities of users (e.g. wellhead application) and for large
drinking-water supplies. Activated alumina and reverse osmosis are the most
common technologies. Activated alumina can concurrently remove other anions,
such as arsenate. Reverse osmosis achieves significant removal of virtually all
dissolved contaminants.
    Point-of-use systems can produce sufficient quantities of treated water for
drinking and cooking requirements of several persons. Numerous plumbed-in,
small distillation units are marketed that have been tested and can produce
several gallons per day or much larger volumes. Many certified low pressure
reverse osmosis units are available with rated capacities in the range of 8–33
gallons per day. Point-of-use defluoridation using activated alumina anion
exchange is capable of removing fluoride from small volumes of water, but inter-
national performance standards have not been developed to date.
    Community-sized, commercially available, package water treatment systems
that use activated alumina or reverse osmosis technology also exist. They can be
purchased as a complete unit that can be readily shipped and installed on-site.
These can produce hundreds of gallons or more of treated, low fluoride water
per day. Large defluoridation systems can also be designed and constructed
on-site to engineer’s specifications (Heidewiller, 1990; Bulusu et al., 1993).


5.1      Method characterization

5.1.1 Scale and decentralization
Conventional water treatment, as carried out in both rural and urban areas in
industrialized countries, takes place typically:
+  in a water works without direct involvement of the users,
+  under the supervision of skilled operators, and
+  where the affordability of treatment is taken for granted.

    In such cases the method of treatment is well established and well controlled.
However, it requires major input of resources and may have serious limitations
or disadvantages in less-developed countries, especially in rural areas where the
water users are scattered or the supply is entirely local. Here treatment may only

be feasible at a decentralized level, e.g. at community village level or at house-
hold level (Table 5.1).

5.1.2 Set-up and flow
Water treatment design should account for the required storage of water and
different feed and withdrawal patterns. Filter columns, as used for bone charcoal,
activated alumina and clay, are often fed intermittently and operate at various
flow rates. Thus there will be a need for a pre-storage container and a control of
the flow rate in order to ensure a minimum contact time. Batch units, as in the
Nalgonda technique, are often fed once a day. In both cases a separate clean
water container would be useful or even essential.
    Even in situations where the water is supplied through piped schemes, the
decentralized solution may be more advantageous. This is because there is no
need to remove the fluoride from the water that is not consumed, i.e. used for
cooking or drinking, and water demand for all uses is often more than 10 times
the water needed for drinking and cooking. Defluoridation of the total amount of
water used would, therefore, be more costly, and possibly unaffordable for the
community or the household. Unnecessary removal of fluoride from water
would result in accumulation of unnecessarily large amounts of toxic sludge,
which is likely to create an environmental disposal problem.
    Whilst water supply in industrialized countries is typically stable and contin-
uous through household connections; arrangements in developing countries may
46                           Fluoride in Drinking-water

be more variable and include piped systems, community source treatment and/or
household treatment. For example, the bone charcoal process can be utilized in
water works, in a village plant and at the household level. Also it can be used in
columns for continuous supply or in batches, e.g. water buckets.
   Taking into consideration the environmental and socio-economic
sustainability of the treatment system, the difference between a centralized
system and a household system may be much more significant than the differ-
ence between bone charcoal and alumina.

5.1.3 Media and process
Defluoridation processes can be categorized into three main groups:
+  Bone charcoal, activated alumina and clay resemble sorption media, prefera-
   bly to be packed in columns to be used for a period of operation. Sorption
   processes result in saturated columns to be renewed or regenerated.
+  Aluminium sulfate and lime in the Nalgonda technique, polyaluminium chlo-
   ride, lime and similar compounds act as co-precipitation chemicals to be
   added daily and in batches. Precipitation techniques produce a certain
   amount of sludge every day.
+  Calcium and phosphate compounds are the so-called contact precipitation
   chemicals to be added to the water upstream of a catalytic filter bed. In
   contact precipitation there is no sludge and no saturation of the bed, only the
   accumulation of the precipitate in the bed.

    Magnesite, apophyllite, natrolite, stilbite, clinoptilolite, gibbsite, goethite,
kaolinite, halloysite, bentonite, vermiculite, zeolite(s), serpentine, alkaline soil,
acidic clay, kaolinitic clay, China clay, aiken soil, Fuller’s earth, diatomaceous
earth and Ando soil are among the numerous naturally occurring minerals which
have been studied and confirmed to adsorb fluoride from water (Bower and
Hatcher, 1967; Maruthamuthu and Sivasamy, 1994; Bjorvartn and Bårdsen,
1997; Singano et al., 1997). The common feature of these minerals is their
contents of metal lattice hydroxyl-groups, which can be exchanged with fluo-
ride. Ion exchange of a metal compound M:

                           M-OH(s) + F– M-F(s) + OH–                           (1)

    In general, the minerals themselves do have some capacity for fluoride
removal. The capacity can be increased through “activation” by acid washing,
calcination or air drying. None of these minerals can be considered to be a
universal defluoridation agent. Should one of them, however, occur adjacent to a
fluorotic area, and thus be available at low or no cost, it may be considered as the
medium of choice for that particular area. In this document clay is used as a

prototype for these minerals. Clay, for example, has been reported to be appro-
priate for use in Sri Lanka (Padmasiri, 1998).


5.2      Bone charcoal

5.2.1 Description
Bone charcoal is a blackish, porous, granular material. The major components of
bone charcoal are calcium phosphate 57–80 per cent, calcium carbonate 6–10
per cent, and activated carbon 7–10 per cent. In contact with water the bone char-
coal is able, to a limited extent, to absorb a wide range of pollutants such as
colour, taste and odour components. Moreover, bone charcoal has the specific
ability to take up fluoride from water. This is believed to be due to its chemical
composition, mainly as hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, where one or both the
hydroxyl-groups can be replaced with fluoride. The principal reaction is
hydroxyl-fluoride exchange of apatite:

               Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F– Ca10(PO4)6 F2 + 2 OH–                    (2)

5.2.2 Preparation
The preparation of bone charcoal is crucial to optimize its properties as a
defluoridation agent and as a water purifier. Unless carried out properly, the
bone charring process may result in a product of low defluoridation capacity
and/or a deterioration in water quality. Water treated with poor bone charcoal
may taste and smell like rotten meat and be aesthetically unacceptable. Once
consumers are exposed to such a smell or taste, they may reject the bone charcoal
treatment process and it may be difficult to persuade them to try water from the
process again. It is therefore essential to ensure that the bone charcoal quality is
always good. Even single failures in the production may be disastrous for a
defluoridation project (Dahi and Bregnhøj, 1997).
    Another potential disadvantage of bone charcoal is related to the problems of
supply to local users. Industrially prepared bone charcoal used to be commer-
cially widely available some decades ago. Today the commercial distribution of
bone charcoal is much more limited. One option may therefore be to prepare the
bone charcoal at village factory or household level (Jacobsen and Dahi, 1998).
    Bone charcoal is prepared by heating ground bone in retorts or in pots stacked
in a furnace resembling a potter’s kiln, without or with only limited admission of
atmospheric oxygen. Ground bone is prepared industrially by degreasing,
boiling, washing and drying, prior to grinding and sifting out. The bone grains
are normally available from the manufacturing of bone meal used as fodder addi-
tive (Mantell, 1968). Several attempts to find optimum heating temperature and

duration seem to have failed. Heating to 550 °C for about 4 hours or even less is
in principle sufficient, but the process in total, including heating up and cooling
down, would take not less than 24 hours. The required temperature and duration
of heating would be expected to depend to a large extent on the batch size and the
packing rather than the type or the nature of the bone.

    At village level the process can be carried out in a kiln, in which the raw bones
can be packed directly along with coal. This technique has an advantage, because
crushing of the charred bone is much less labourious than uncharred bones. Table
5.2 illustrates that poor bone charcoal quality would mainly be due to:
+   Insufficient charring, i.e. temperature too low and duration too short.
+   Admission of oxygen, i.e. running the process as calcination instead of
    charring.
+   Overheating of the bones, especially if oxygen is admitted to the heated bone
    material.
+   Inhomogeneous heating which always results in poor bone charcoal quality.

    It must be noted that the preparation of bone charcoal may, if not carried out
in a properly designed kiln or furnace, cause an extremely unpleasant smell even
in a spacious rural environment (Jacobsen and Dahi, 1998).

    One of the differences concerns the water flow in the filter. In the column
filter the flow resembles plug flow, where the upper parts of the filter bed become
saturated at a time where the lower parts are still fresh. Then the saturation zone
moves slowly towards the bottom effluent point. This kind of flow allows for
saturation of the medium with respect to the high fluoride raw water, hence the
high capacity utilization in the column systems. In the drum or the bucket filter
the flow resembles a totally mixed system, where the medium at saturation point
is in equilibrium with the treated water. Hence the low capacity utilization in the
drum and the bucket type filters.
    Another difference between the various configurations is whether the filter
allows the filter medium to drain water, if treated water is withdrawn without
ensuring an adequate influent, allowing the medium to become dry. “Drying” the
medium results in disturbance of the sorption process and more contact time
would be required to re-establish treatment. Unfortunately this point is over-
looked in many household filter designs.

5.2.4 Regeneration
It is feasible to regenerate bone charcoal saturated with fluoride by allowing
equilibrium with 1 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide followed by washing
or neutralization of the surplus caustic soda (AWWA, 1971). Regeneration is
probably only cost effective at a large-scale water works level or in the case of a
shortage of the medium. At village-community and household levels, it may be
environmentally acceptable to use the saturated bone charcoal as a fertilizer and
soil conditioner.

5.2.5 Design criteria
Apart from the daily water demand (the load), and the raw water fluoride concen-
tration, the key parameter of all designs would be the bone charcoal theoretical
defluoridation capacity (Γ). This is expressed as the amount of fluoride absorbed
by one grain of bone charcoal at saturation. Unfortunately, in laboratory studies
Γ is often estimated with respect to unrealistically high fluoride concentrations.
In water treatment the operational defluoridation capacity should be used, with
reference to the given fluoride concentration and experimental set-up. Obvi-
ously, saturation with respect to the raw water fluoride concentration, as in
column filters, would result in much more efficient utilization of a bone charcoal
medium than saturation with respect to the effluent concentration at the end of a
filter period, as in bucket filters (drum or bucket filters).
    Thus at an operational level, Γ depends on the loading pattern, i.e. the varia-
tion of water flow through the filter medium, and the back mix pattern, i.e. to
what extent the water flow resembles a plug flow through the filter medium.
Different sorption models have been developed to simulate the operation of bone
52                          Fluoride in Drinking-water

charcoal filters and thus to create a rational background for the design of these
filters (Dahi and Bregnhøj, 1997).
    Examples of the design of bone charcoal filters are given in Table 5.4.
Assuming the theoretical bone charcoal defluoridation capacity is 6 mg g–1, the
operational capacity would then be 4 mg g–1 for column filters and 2 mg g–1 for
bucket filters. It can generally be assumed that:
+   Operational defluoridation capacity in column filters ≅ 2/3 theoretical
    defluoridation capacity
+   Operational defluoridation capacity in bucket filters ≅ 1/3 theoretical
    defluoridation capacity

    Table 5.4 demonstrates how the dosage equivalent is 2 and 4 g l–1 respec-
tively for column filter and bucket and drum filters. If the same dose is added, as
in a batch process, the residual concentration from a column filter will be lower.

5.2.6 Cost
All three types of bone charcoal filters can be made locally using cheap, locally
available, robust and corrosion resistant materials such as plastic, concrete,
ferrocement or galvanized iron sheets. In such cases the unit price would be
affordable to most motivated communities.
    The price of bone charcoal on the other hand may be significant, depending
on the method of manufacture. For example, in 1995 quotations were collected
for large scale delivery of bone charcoal ab fabric from UK, China and the
United Republic of Tanzania. The prices given were US$ 2280, US$ 333 and
US$ 167 per ton respectively. Finally, it was discovered that the bone charcoal
could be prepared in a low cost, locally-made kiln from freely-collected bones in
the Arusha region in the United Republic of Tanzania by using about 120 kg of
charcoal per tonne of bone.

5.2.7 Experience
Bone charcoal is the oldest known water defluoridation agent. It was used in USA
in the 1940s through to the 1960s, when bone charcoal was commercially widely
available because of its large scale use in the sugar industry (AWWA, 1971).
     The first domestic defluoridators were developed in the early 1960s as column
filters similar to the one shown in Figure 5.3 (Dunckley and Malthus, 1961; Roche
1964). In 1988 the ICOH filter type was launched by WHO (Phantumvanit et al.,
1988) and has since been tested both in and outside Thailand. In contrast to the
filter described by Roche (1964), the ICOH type filter is enriched with charcoal,
and thus has the capacity for removal of impurities in case of either poor raw
water quality or insufficient bone charring. Furthermore, the water flow in the
ICOH defluoridator occurs by siphoning the raw water from an overhead
                           Removal of Excessive Fluoride                             53

container. This arrangement allows for manual adjustment of the water flow by
using tube clamps, but the unit would need supervision and operator training in
order to avoid the column running dry or the clean water jar overflowing.
   Today bone charcoal defluoridation at waterworks has been replaced by the
use of ion-exchange resins and activated alumina. At a domestic level, bone
charcoal defluoridation seems to work well in Thailand and Africa, but so far
there is no experience of wide scale implementation.
   Relatively expensive filters are commercially available based on packages of
medium and a modification of the candle-type stainless steel domestic filters.

5.2.8 Local customs and beliefs
One of the constraints of bone charcoal defluoridation is related to religious
beliefs in some societies and communities that any use of animal bones is unac-
ceptable. In such cases the use of bone charcoal must be avoided.
    However, this may relate only to the use of bone charcoal originating from
certain animals, such as cows among Hindus, pigs among Muslims and Jews,
and hyena and dogs among many Africans. From a scientific point of view all
types of bones are equally good as raw materials for bone charcoal, but in such
circumstances the problem would be solved through production of bone charcoal
in accordance with local acceptability and ensuring that this is widely known in
the community.
    Irrespective of local beliefs, microbiological, aesthetic and psychological
problems would render bone charcoal defluoridation completely unacceptable,
if drinking-water was allowed to percolate through a medium containing organic
residues from animals. It must, therefore, be emphasized that this could only
happen in the case of incomplete charring. Properly prepared bone charcoal is
totally mineralized and, if this is the case, the black colour of the product shows
that it is only non-organic activated carbon.


5.3      Contact precipitation

5.3.1 Description
Contact precipitation is a technique by which fluoride is removed from the water
through addition of calcium and phosphate compounds and then bringing the
water in contact with an already saturated bone charcoal medium. In solutions
containing calcium, phosphate and fluoride, the precipitation of calcium fluoride
and/or fluorapatite is theoretically feasible, but practically impossible due to
slow reaction kinetics. It has recently been reported that the precipitation is easily
catalysed in a contact bed that acts as a filter for the precipitate (Dahi, 1996). Using
Table 5.4      Examples of design of the bone charcoal filters illustrated in Figure 5.3. For simplification the filters are
               designed assuming the same daily water consumption, raw water and bone charcoal quality.

The plants comprise a column, containing a relatively small, saturated bone char-
coal contact bed. Gravel, or coarse grained bone charcoal, is used as a supporting
medium. Above the bed a relatively large space is used for mixing the chemical
with the raw water. From the bed the defluoridated water flows continuously by
gravity to a shallow, but wide, clean water tank. One or more clean water taps are
fitted at the bottom. The flow from the raw water tank to the clean water tank is
constrained by a valve or a narrow tube arrangement to allow for appropriate
contact time in the bed. Too short contact time would reduce the removal
capacity and increase the escape of chemicals in the treated water. Too long
contact time may result in precipitation of calcium phosphates in the upper parts
of the filter bed, thus also reducing the removal efficiency. The optimum contact
time is not yet known but contact times of 20 to 30 minutes have been shown to
produce excellent operation. The filter resistance is negligible compared to the
flow resistance through the tube and/or the valve (Dahi, 1998). The process
seems to be promising, because it implies:
+   relatively low daily working load;
+   high reliability without the need of surveillance of flow or effluent
    concentration;
+   high removal efficiency, even in case of high raw water concentrations;
+   low operating cost; and
+   no health risk in the case of misuse or over-dosage of chemicals.

5.3.2 Technical configuration
Although it has so far only been implemented at village level in the United
Republic of Tanzania and in Kenya, contact precipitation is probably suitable for
implementation at any required level. Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show contact

precipitation plant as developed for household use and installed at various
schools in the rural areas of the Arusha region, the Un ited Republic of Tanzania.
   In a large scale plant both the contact bed and the defluoridated water tank may
be supplied with plastic tubes used as manometers. The ends of both tubes are
located a few centimetres below the upper edges of the tanks to avoid overflow.
Chemicals in stock solutions
Any calcium and phosphate compounds can be used. It is, however, important to
dissolve the chemicals prior to mixing with the water. As a calcium compound,
calcium chloride (CC) may be used. As a phosphate compound, sodium
dihydrogenphosphate (also called monosodium phosphate or MSP) may be used.
Both compounds are easily dissolved, quite cheap and widely used. Calcium
chloride is manufactured as technical grade flakes containing 77–80 per cent
calcium chloride. One MSP product is fabricated as a granulated formulation

the chemicals may be 1.04 for CC and 0.95 for MSP.
    The chemicals are preferably prepared as stock solutions to be used in
aliquots. The two stock solutions may be prepared once every month, for
example, but should not be mixed before treatment in order to avoid the precipi-
tation of calcium phosphate. Two special measuring cups may be used for
volumetric portioning of the chemicals. It is advisable to check the bulk density
as it may vary for different brands. The stock solutions, stored in Jerry cans,
along with the respective chemical bags and the measuring cups and cylinders
may be coloured respectively red and green in order to minimize the risk of
exchange and so incorrect dosage.

Operation of the domestic unit
Initially the raw water bucket would be empty. The plant operator starts by
closing the flow control valve completely and one and a half litres of each of the
stock solutions are added to be mixed with a part of the raw water brought to the
raw water compartment. As the remaining raw water is poured into the raw water
compartment, the supernatant water is completely mixed. The flow control valve
is then opened, but only to allow a slow flow through the contact bed, the average
filtration velocity not exceeding 0.5 m per hour.

Operation of the community plant
Initially the raw water column would be empty. The plant operator starts by
closing the flow control valve completely and each of the two stock solution
aliquots are added to be mixed with a part of the raw water brought to the raw
water compartment. As the remaining raw water is filled into the raw water
compartment, the supernatant water would be completely mixed. The flow
control valve is then opened, but only to allow a slow flow through the contact
bed, the average filtration velocity not exceeding 0.5 m per hour or about 0.5 cm
per minute.

5.3.3 Design criteria
The construction of the contact precipitation plants is simple, but the theoretical
background for doing it is not. Probably both reactions (5) and (6) play important
roles, but the extent to which each reaction occurs is not well understood. In
calcium fluoride precipitation, the Ca/F weight ratio is about 1, equivalent to a
CC/F ratio of about 4. In fluorapatite precipitation, the Ca/F is 11 and the PO4/F
ratio is 15, equivalent to a CC/F ratio of about 39 and a MSP/F ratio of about 23.
    Thus the more fluoride that is precipitated as calcium fluoride, rather than as
fluorapatite, the lower is the required dosage of chemicals. Calcium fluoride
precipitation is probably more dominant with higher raw water fluoride concen-
tration. Long term operation of the contact precipitation technique in the United
Republic of Tanzania, where the fluoride concentration is about 10 mg l–1, has
shown that the process functions effectively when the dosage ratios are 30 and 15
for CC and MSP respectively. This dosage would ensure at least 65 per cent
precipitation of fluorapatite and a surplus of calcium for precipitation of the
residual fluoride as calcium fluoride. This dosage is shown in Table 5.5.
Over-dosage is of no economic or health significance and lower dosage levels
may be recommended on a trial and error basis.

5.3.4 Cost
Quotations were obtained in 1996 for calcium chloride and sodium
dihydrogen-phosphate wholesale. The figures given were US$ 283 and
US$ 780 per ton respectively.

5.3.5 Experience
Experience from the Arusha region of the United Republic of Tanzania has
shown that construction of a plant needs skilled supervision, at least until a team
of bricklayers has completed the construction of a few plants. The critical points
seem to be:
+   watertight cement or plastic plastering;
+   proper installation of fittings; and
+   adjustment of the flow rate to meet the requirements of contact time and
    filtration time.

    Once these issues are addressed, it has been demonstrated that a young school
pupil can easily operate the plant satisfactorily. No bacterial growth or distur-
bance in the efficiency of the plant has been observed during stagnation during a
rainy season or a summer vacation.


5.4      Nalgonda

5.4.1 Description
The Nalgonda process was adapted and developed in India by the National Envi-
ronmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and developed to be used at
both the community or household levels. The process is aluminium sulfate based
coagulation-flocculation sedimentation, where the dosage is designed to ensure
fluoride removal from the water. Aluminium sulfate, Al2 (SO4)3 18H2O, is
dissolved and added to the water under efficient stirring in order to ensure initial
complete mixing. Aluminium hydroxide micro-flocs are produced rapidly and
gathered into larger easily settling flocs. Thereafter the mixture is allowed to
settle. During this flocculation process many kinds of micro-particles and nega-
tively charged ions including fluoride are partially removed by electrostatic
attachment to the flocs (equations 7–10):

Alum dissolution:
Al2 (SO4)3 18H2O = 2Al3+ + 3SO42– + 18H2O                                     (7)

Aluminium precipitation (Acidic):
2Al3+ + 6H2O = 2Al(OH)3 + 6H+                                            (8)

Co-precipitation (non-stoichiometric, undefined product):
F– + Al(OH)3 = Al–F complex + undefined product                          (9)

pH adjustment:
6Ca(OH)2 + 12H+ = 6Ca2+ + 12H2O                                          (10)

Compared with normal drinking-water flocculation, a much larger dosage of
aluminium sulfate is normally required in the defluoridation process. As the
aluminium sulfate solution is acidic, simultaneous addition of lime is often
needed to ensure neutral pH in the treated water and complete precipitation of
aluminium. Surplus lime is used as a weighting agent, i.e. to facilitate more
complete settling. The treated water can be decanted. Filtration is, however,
64                           Fluoride in Drinking-water

required as a polishing stage in order to ensure that no sludge particles escape
with the treated water.

5.4.2 Technical configuration
The Nalgonda defluoridation techniques was developed for African households
as shown in Figure 5.6. Aluminium sulfate and lime are sold to the consumers as
powders in small sealed differently marked plastic bags. One set of two bags
contains the dosages required to defluoridate one bucket of water. The treatment
system consists of two locally available 20 litre plastic buckets, each supplied
with one small brass tap of the type used for domestic filter containers. The taps
are fixed 5 cm above the bottom of the buckets in order to enable trapping of
sludge below the draw-off point. The upper bucket tap is fitted with a tea sieve on
which a piece of cotton cloth is placed, allowing the water to flow directly into
the second clean water bucket.
    Aluminium sulfate and lime are added simultaneously to the raw water
bucket where they are dissolved/suspended by stirring with a wooden paddle.
The villagers are trained to stir fast while counting to 60 (1 minute) and then
slowly while counting to 300 (5 minutes). The flocs formed are left to settle for
about one hour. The treated water is then run from the tap through the cloth into
the treated water bucket from where it is stored for daily drinking and cooking.
    It has been shown (Dahi et al., 1997) that the fluoride is only loosely bound to
the aluminium hydroxide flocs. That is why the treated water must be removed
not later than a couple of hours after initiating the flocculation, and why the
precipitate should be discarded between batches.

5.4.3 Design criteria
The batch treatment described above is suitable for a daily routine, where one
bucket of water is treated for one day’s water demand. If a 20 litre bucket is used,
the bucket should be filled with only 18 litres to allow for efficient mixing with
chemicals. An estimate of the amounts of alum required may be calculated using
the Freundlich based equation as developed by Dahi et al. (1997):
                                       ( Fr − Ft ) ×V
                                  A=               1
                                                    β
                                          α × Ft
Where:
     A        is the amount of aluminium sulfate required, g
     Fr       is the fluoride concentration in the raw water, mg l–1
     Ft       is the residual fluoride concentration in the treated water, mg l–1
     V        is the volume of water to be treated in batch, litres
     α        is the sorption capacity constant (1(1–1/β) × mg2/β) g–1
     β        is the sorption intensity constant (dimensionless).
                         Removal of Excessive Fluoride                           65

    Any resulting pH between 6.2 and 7.6 is close to optimum. For pH = 6.7 and
required residual fluoride between 1 and 1.5 mg l–1, α = 6 and β = 1.33. The
amount of lime required to achieve the optimum pH is difficult to estimate theo-
retically because it depends on the quality of lime, the alkalinity and pH of the
raw water and the fluoride removal itself. According to Dahi et al. (1997) lime
addition may be 20–50 per cent of the alum dosage.

5.4.4 Cost
According to COWI (1998) the price of one of the above buckets in the United
Republic of Tanzania was about TZS 3,000 or about US$ 3.3 at 1995 prices. The
tap would cost about US$ 1.7. Seven pairs of aluminium sulfate and lime bags
cost US$ 0.15. Of this price, 20 per cent represents the purchase of chemicals.
Aluminium sulfate is purchased on a tax-free wholesale basis, as for water
works.

5.4.5 Sludge disposal
Discarding the sludge from the Nalgonda process is often thought of as a serious
environmental health problem. The sludge is quite toxic because it contains the
removed fluoride in a concentrated form. The sludge retained in the empty raw
water bucket is to be discarded in a pit or a soakaway:
+  inaccessible to children;
+  inaccessible to animals;
+  away from the kitchen garden; and
+  remote from wells which may be used for drinking.

    Once these precautions are taken, the sludge would be of low or no environ-
mental health significance, provided only drinking and cooking water is treated.
In nature the fluoride would be expected to immobilize rapidly due to weathering
processes. The free fluoride ion would then be subject to infiltration or run off.

5.4.6 Experience
The aluminium sulfate and lime process was proposed for defluoridation of
water when fluoride in water became a health concern in the USA as the agent
behind mottling of teeth (Boruff, 1934). Four decades later the process was
adopted by NEERI as the Nalgonda technique and developed for low cost use at
all levels in India (Nawlakhe et al., 1975). Figures 5.7 and 5.8 illustrate configu-
rations of the Nalgonda technique at village community and water works levels.
At the community level, the Nalgonda process can be linked to a single tubewell
using a “draw and fill” method as shown in Figure 5.7. In larger systems (for
instance where tubewells are linked to a distribution system) the Nalgonda

process can be incorporated into a treatment train using flash mixing before floc-
culation as in Figure 5.8. The comprehensive studies on the Nalgonda technique
at NEERI have resulted in three main achievements:
+   The widespread knowledge about the possibilities of solving the treatment
    problems at different levels, even at very low cost.
+   Understanding of the non-stoichiometric co-precipitation mechanisms for
    removal of fluoride in the flocculation process.
+   The dosage design given as a simple table nomogram, indicating the required
    dosage of aluminium sulfate for given values of water alkalinity and fluoride
    concentrations. The dosage of lime is fixed at 5 per cent of the added
    aluminium sulfate (Bulusu et al., 1993).

    The mixing of the alum may be manual or using electronic paddles,
depending on the size of the supply and skill of the operators. Although there are
some favourable comments about the application of the Nalgonda process at
community supply levels, there appears to be an increasing move towards
promotion of household units in India. It has been noted by UNICEF that,
although in principle community units fixed to hand pumps result in lower-costs
per capita of de-fluoridation, sustainability is often problematic. Commu-
nity-level water treatment of any sort is difficult to sustain because the skills
required are often significant and, in the case of a process such as Nalgonda,
treatment requires a significant time commitment by operators to ensure that it is
effective. In community settings, ensuring such commitments may be difficult.
    Household treatment options appear to offer greater potential for sustained
use, in part because overall time commitments may be lower and also because
the benefits to the user are more directly obvious. However, such approaches are
not without problems, for instance the need for an efficient and effective service
network to ensure that filters can be replaced or regenerated. UNICEF now
promotes household rather than community-treatment. Although there have
been references to the effectiveness of Nalgonda at a household level, there is a
need for further evaluation of its effectiveness. In India there has been some
move towards the use of activated alumina, although the household Nalgonda
process is still promoted.
    The above-mentioned design was not found to be useful for African waters of
relatively high fluoride content and low alkalinity. Furthermore, for African
waters it was found that lime should be added at a much higher dosage in order to
achieve the pH for optimum removal. Accordingly, a more appropriate mathe-
matical tool for the design was developed (Dahi et al., 1997).
    In spite of the fact that the Nalgonda technique has been introduced in many
places, it has not yet been demonstrated to be the method of choice. It certainly
has the great advantages of being cheap, simple and based on widely available
chemicals and materials. Yet experience has shown that the following may play a
role as negative factors:
+   The treatment efficiency is limited to about 70 per cent. Thus the process
    would be less satisfactory in case of medium to high fluoride contamination
    in the raw water.
+   A large dose of aluminium sulfate, up to 700–1,200 mg l–1, may be needed.
    Thus it reaches the threshold where the users start complaining about residual
    sulfate salinity in the treated water. The large dose also results in a large
    sludge disposal problem in the case of water works treatment.
+   When the users are not properly instructed, this can result in a large effort in
    terms of unnecessarily long mixing times.

    It is often stated that much care has to be taken to avoid the presence of
aluminium in the treated water. This is because the WHO guideline value for
aluminium of 0.2 mg l–1 is adopted as a compromise between the technical use in
drinking-water treatment and the discolouration of distributed water. Experience
has demonstrated that the risk of water contamination has been highly over-
stated. Practically speaking it is only necessary to avoid the escape of flocs. This
is easily done by careful draining of the supernatant water in combination with
simple filtration as a second barrier.


5.5      Activated alumina

5.5.1 Description
Activated alumina is aluminium oxide (Al2O3) grains prepared to have a sorptive
surface. When the water passes through a packed column of activated alumina,
pollutants and other components in the water are adsorbed onto the surface of the
grains (see Equation (1), section 5.1.3). Eventually the column becomes saturated:
first at its upstream zone and later, as more water is passed through, the saturated
zone moves downstream with the column eventually becoming totally saturated.
    Total saturation means that the concentration of fluoride in the effluent water
increases to the same value as the influent water. Total saturation of the column
must be avoided. The column should only be operated to a break point, where the
effluent concentration is, for example, 2 mg l–1 at normal saturation. The time
between the start of operation and reaching the break point of the column is
represented by V, the accumulated volume of treated water. When dividing V by
the bulk volume of the packed activated alumina, a standard operational param-
eter is obtained; i.e. the number of Bed Volumes, BV. BV is an expression of the
capacity of treatment before the column medium needs to be renewed or regener-
ated and is highly dependent on the raw water fluoride concentration.

5.5.2 Technical configuration
The activated alumina process is carried out in sorption filters as shown in
Figure 5.3. In order to avoid the monitoring of the water quality, the unit is
supplied with a water meter allowing for direct indication of the cumulative
water flow. After treatment of, for example, 2,000 litres equivalent to 250 BV of
water containing about 5 mg l–1, the unit is opened for renewal of the 8 kg of
medium. Alternatively the unit is dismounted for regeneration by the dealer.
70                           Fluoride in Drinking-water

5.5.3 Regeneration
Regeneration of the saturated alumina is carried out by exposing the medium to
4 per cent caustic soda (NaOH) either in batch or by flow through the column,
resulting in a few BV of caustic wastewater contaminated with fluoride.
Residual caustic soda is then washed out and the medium is neutralized with a
2 per cent sulfuric acid rinse.
    During this process about 5–10 per cent of the alumina is lost, and the
capacity of the remaining medium is reduced by 30–40 per cent. After 3–4
regenerations the medium has to be replaced. Alternatively, in order to avoid
on-site regeneration, the saturated alumina can be recycled to a dealer, who can
adjust the capacity of the activated alumina to the desired value by using an
appropriate mixture of fresh and regenerated media.
    Where the process is operated at domestic level, the regeneration cannot be
left to the users. Instead, a central chemical store is set up in each village, where
the users can get the regeneration done along with motivation and encourage-
ment to continue the fluorosis prevention.
    Regeneration may result in the presence of aluminium at a concentration
greater than 0.2 mg l–1 if the pH is not readjusted to normal.

5.5.4 Design criteria
The alumina process is designed as a sorption process according to the same
principle as bone charcoal (see Table 5.4). Similar considerations about the
flow and the mix are valid. Also in the case of alumina the key design parameter
is the operational defluoridation capacity, which may deviate from the
theoretical capacity.
    According to Hao and Huang (1986) the fluoride removal capacity of
alumina is between 4 and 15 mg g–1. Experience from the field, however, shows
that the removal capacity is often about 1 mg g–1 (COWI, 1998). Thus there
seems to be a large difference in the degree of “activation” of alumina products.
One of the explanations may be due to variation in pH. The capacity of alumina is
highly dependent on pH, the optimum being about pH 5. While it may be easy to
adjust pH for maximum removal at a waterworks, it is necessary to depend on the
actual pH of the raw water in domestic and small community treatments. Other
explanations are the brand or source of the product. This variability demonstrates
the importance of carrying out field trials. For the design the capacity of the
available alumina has to be established through testing under authentic condi-
tions. As a preliminary qualified guess, the removal capacity of 1 mg l–1 and the
bulk density of 1.2 kg l–1 may be used.

5.5.5 Cost
It was previously considered that the activated alumina process, due to high
chemical cost and non-availability in markets, was not a consideration for most
developing countries. This is no longer the case. Experience, mainly from India,
Thailand and China, indicates that activated alumina may under certain condi-
tions be affordable for low income communities. Table 5.6 compares the costs of
activated alumina treatment with those of the Nalgonda process.

5.5.6 Experience
Activated alumina was proposed for defluoridation of water and a drum filter
(see Figure 5.3) was patented for domestic use as early as 1936 (Fink and
Lindsay, 1936). Since then activated alumina has become the subject of several
patents and, due to commercial interests, one of the most advocated
defluoridation methods.
    The activated alumina process was evaluated for fluoride removal from an
underground mine water in South Africa in the early 1980s and it was found that
potable water could be produced from an underground mine water with a fluo-
ride concentration of approximately 8 mg l–1. Two 500 × 103 litres per day
defluoridation plants were installed as a result of the investigation (Schoeman
1987a,b; Schoeman and Botha, 1985).
    As the ceramic candle domestic filter is well known in some countries, it has
been used as a unit for activated alumina defluoridation, although not specifi-
cally designed for it. In a special modification, the “candles” are replaced with a
connection screen and a wing nut for adjustment of the filtration rate.

    Activated alumina is a widely available industrial chemical. It is, however, not
as widely distributed at the grass roots level as aluminium sulfate. Furthermore, its
use has been limited by the difficulties of regeneration, the low capacity of less
purified technical grade products and the relatively high price. Activated alumina
has become less costly and more popular, especially where it is manufactured.


5.6      Clay

5.6.1 Description
Clay is an earthy sedimentary material composed mainly of fine particles of
hydrous aluminium silicates and other minerals and impurities. Clay is
fine-textured, plastic when moist, retains its shape when dried and sinters hard
when fired. These properties are utilized in manufacture of pottery, brick and
tile. Both clay powder and fired clay are capable of sorption of fluoride as well as
other pollutants from water. The ability of clay to clarify turbid water is well
known. This property is believed to have been known and utilized at domestic
level in ancient Egypt.

5.6.2 Technical configuration
Although clay takes up fluoride as in a sorption process, it may be used as a
flocculent powder in a batch system like the one shown in Figure 5.6. Because
clay has a relatively high density, e.g. compared to bone charcoal, it will settle
and enable decanting or drain off of the supernatant water. The use of clay
powder in columns is possible, but troublesome mainly because of difficulties in
packing the columns and controlling the flow.
    Domestic clay column filters are therefore normally packed using clay chips
found as waste from the manufacture of brick, pottery or tile. Figure 5.9 illus-
trates such a column filter. It resembles the filter used in Sri Lanka and reported
by Padmasiri (1998). The filter is based on up-flow in order to allow for settling
of suspended solids within the filter bed. The filter does not have a clean water
reservoir and the filtration rate is controlled by slow withdrawal through the tap.
    The column described by Padmasiri (1998) is stratified with one layer of
charred coconut shells and another layer of pebbles above the entire bed of brick
chips. Depending on the raw water quality, and on the quality of the brick chips,
such a post-filtration through charcoal may be a precondition to obtain good
water quality. As charcoal has a low specific density, the pebbles stabilize the
stratified bed and are necessary to avoid the escape of charcoal grains with the
treated water.

used in Sri Lanka.


5.6.3 Regeneration
Clay and similar media can be regenerated, at least partially. It would not,
however, be cost effective in most cases.

5.6.4 Design criteria
Based on testing of the capacity of clay to remove fluoride from water, different
studies reach different conclusions about the capacity and usability of the
method in general. Thus, Zevenbergen et al. (1996) conclude that “the Ando soil
appears to be an economical and efficient method for defluoridation of drinking
water” while Bulusu et al. (1979) do not find the clay worth mentioning as a
defluoridation agent.
    According to the study of Zevenbergen et al. (1996) the defluoridation
capacity of the Ando soil of Kenya was 5.5 mg g–1 while Moges et al. (1996)
found that the capacity of ground and fired clay pot of Ethiopia was no more than
0.2 mg g–1. It could be concluded that the Ando soil of Kenya was more efficient
74                           Fluoride in Drinking-water

in defluoridating the water than the clay pot powder of Ethiopia. Examination of
the data indicated that this was not the case. If the use of the Ando soil studied by
Zevenbergen et al. (1996) was simulated under authentic field conditions in a
bucket treatment system, it revealed defluoridation capacity of the same order as
studied by Moges et al. (1996), i.e. about 0.2 mg g–1.
    Bårdsen and Björvatn (1997) studied the sorption isotherm of clay calcined at
600 °C. They found that the sorption continues to take place even up to 10 days of
contact time, but the capacity was as low as 0.07 mg g–1 at 1 mg l–1 level. Thus in
order to remove 3.4 mg l–1 of fluoride from water containing fluoride at a level as
high as 12.5 mg l–1, within one hour of contact time, they had to add calcined clay
at a level of 100 g l–1, i.e. batch operational capacity of 0.03 mg g–1. Convincing
field experiments have been reported by Padmasiri (1998) showing an opera-
tional capacity of 0.08 mg g–1 for brick chips used in column defluoridators in Sri
Lanka. According to Jinadasa et al. (1988), the capacity is known to be optimum
when pH is about 5.6.
    For design purposes the operational capacity has to be investigated first. As a
preliminary guideline the capacities of 0.03 and 0.1 mg g–1 may be used respec-
tively for design of batch and column defluoridators using clay materials, as
shown in Table 5.7 for example. Because the clay powder in a bucket system is to
be added at large dosages, the volume of the treated water wasted along with the
sludge has to be considered. From the design examples shown in Table 5.7 it may
be seen that the dosages required are estimated to be 73 and 20 g l–1 respectively.
Thus the dosage is much higher than in the other methods, even though the raw
water fluoride is as low as 3 mg l–1. Furthermore, the removal efficiencies are
expected to be low, i.e. 67 per cent. Probably the clay process would be of no, or
at least much less, use if the water contains higher concentrations of fluoride or if
better removal efficiencies are required.

5.6.5 Hygienic precautions
Clay and most other soil minerals which demonstrate defluoridation capacities
are primarily cation-exchangers. Toxic heavy metals and a wide range of other
pollutants may also be retained in the clay strata when rain water percolates soil.
Care has therefore to be taken in order to ensure that for any soil material to be
used in a defluoridation process:
+   the medium should be calcined and stored hygienically;
+   the medium loses its defluoridation capacity if calcined to dead burnt temper-
    atures, e.g. 1,200 °C;
+   the medium should be tested for potential dissolution of toxic materials; and
+   the medium should not support for microbial growth due to the content of
    organic carbon.

5.6.6 Cost
It has been stated by Padmasiri (1998) that the clay process is only cost effective if
the freshly burnt broken bricks of good quality are available on site or adjacent to
the users and if the filter is prepared using low cost, locally available materials.

5.6.7 Experience
According to Padmasiri (1998) nearly 80 per cent of 600 clay column
defluoridators installed in households in Sri Lanka were found in operating
condition after being monitored for different periods from two years onwards.
The described technology was found to be sustainable, but only if the users were
motivated through information and motivation campaigns (COWI,1998).


5.7      Evaluation and selection of method
The above reporting on the methods of defluoridation reveals that there is not a
universal method which is appropriate under all social, financial, economic, envi-
ronmental and technical conditions. None of the methods has been implemented
successfully at a large scale in many parts of the world. This is quite remarkable,
especially when taking into consideration the fact that several defluoridation
methods have been studied in detail and even reported as appropriate methods,
for a number of years (Bulusu et al., 1979). Apart from contact precipitation, all
the methods were known as early as the mid-1930s when the agent behind “the
Colorado stain” was discovered. This oddity is probably because all available
defluoridation methods do have disadvantages. Some of these are what may be
designated as killer disadvantages, in the sense that the methods turn out to be
unsustainable under the given socio-economical conditions. Such killer disad-
vantages of defluoridation or of some defluoridation techniques in particular
circumstances include:
1. High Cost-Tech; i.e. either the price and/or the technology is high, demand-
    ing imported spare parts, continuous power supply, expensive chemicals,
    skilled operation or regeneration, etc. Reverse osmosis, ion exchange and
    activated alumina may thus be categorized as high cost-tech methods.
2. Limited efficiency; i.e. the method does not permit sufficient removal of the
    fluoride, even when appropriate dosage is used. As in the Nalgonda tech-
    nique, the residual concentration would often be higher than 1 mg l–1, unless
    the raw water concentration itself is relatively low as discussed above in rela-
    tion to the United Republic of Tanzania.
3. Unobserved break through; i.e. the fluoride concentration in the treated
    water may rise gradually or suddenly, typically when a medium in a treat-
    ment column is exhausted or even when the flow is out of control. As in the
Table 5.7    Examples of design of bucket flocculation as illustrated in Figure 5.3 and an up flow column filter.

   case of bone charcoal and other column filters, these techniques necessitate
   frequent monitoring of fluoride residual, or at least the rate and the volume of
   treated water, if unobserved breakthrough or the loss of removal capacity are
   to be avoided.
4. Limited capacity; while the removal capacity of bone charcoal or activated
   alumina may be about 2 mg of fluoride per gram of medium, much higher
   amounts of calcined clay for example have to be used in order to obtain
   appropriate removal.
5. Deteriorated water quality; this would by nature result in excessively high
   pH values, normally above 10. The water quality may also deteriorate due to
   poorly prepared medium (bone charcoal) or due to medium escaping from the
   treatment container, e.g. ion exchange, alumina, Nalgonda sludge, etc.

6. Taboo limitations; in particular, the bone charcoal method is culturally not
   acceptable to Hindus. Bone charcoal originating from pigs may be ques-
   tioned by Muslims. The charring of bones has also been reported to be
   unacceptable to villagers in North Thailand.

    By contrast, all the methods mentioned do have advantages and have been
shown to be capable of removing fluoride under certain conditions. Four criteria
are essential and may contribute to the success of fluorosis prevention through
treatment of drinking-water at a decentralized level:
1. The right method has to be selected to deal with given water quality and
    social acceptability. Table 5.8 may be useful in selection of the method.
2. Proper design and process understanding are required at least among the
    responsible officials.
3. Media and unit spare parts have to be made available though an appropriate
    infrastructure, such as village communities and social and health workers.
4. Motivation and training of users has to be continued through the same, or a
    similar, infrastructure.

    Research and development and experience in this field continues to develop
and care must be taken to seek further information, whether the requirement is
for small scale treatment using cheap, locally available, materials, or for larger
scale systems.

Analytical methods



This chapter gives an overview of the most commonly used primary analytical
methods for laboratory determination of total fluoride in drinking-water. Sample
handling and pre-treatment are covered, on a matrix basis. Several methods are
described in the literature for the analysis of total fluoride, both in water and in
different digested matrices. Preference is given here to widely used international
or national standard methods, which are prescribed for use in many laboratories
and which have been validated prior to issue. Rapid field test kits, ion-selective
electrode (pH meter) method and Complexone method 2 (Nova 60 instrument
made by Merck Co.) are also explained. The possible analytical methods for
fluoride determination include:
+   Ion-chromatography (IC): laboratory test

       ASTM D4327-91 and Standard Methods 4110B, ISO 10359-1)
+   Ion-selective electrode (pH meter): field and laboratory test
    1 Ion-selective Electrode Method (ASTM D1179-93B and Standard

To achieve a sufficiently low detection limit using any of the techniques all of the
reagents must be free of fluoride. The quality of the reagents needs to be care-
fully selected and evaluated to maintain the blank as low as possible. All the
techniques require trained staff, generally analysts experienced in dealing with
trace elements, with facilities to deal with potentially hazardous chemicals. In
addition to any specialized equipment specified for the analysis, all the tech-
niques require the use of standard laboratory equipment.


6.1      Ion-chromatography with chemical suppression
         of eluent conductivity
Determination of the fluoride anion is necessary for the characterization of water
and/or to assess the need for specific treatment and to determine the efficacy of
treatment. This technique of Ion Chromatography (IC) uses non-hazardous
reagents and it effectively distinguishes between halides and oxy-anions. This
method is applicable, after filtration to remove particles larger than 0.2 µm, to
surface waters, groundwaters, wastewaters, and drinking-water.
    The standard conditions of IC when using the Dionex DX500 ion
chromatograph are:
Ion Chromatograph:          Dionex DX500
Columns:                    Dionex AG9-HC/AS9-HC, 2 mm
Detector:                   Suppressed Conductivity Detector, Dionex CD20
Suppressor:                 ASRS-I, external source electrolyte mode, 100 mA current
Eluent:                     9.0 mM Na2CO3
Eluent flow:                0.40 ml per minute
Sample loop:                10 µl
System backpressure:        2,800 psi
Background conductivity: 22 µS

Method and performance characteristics
A small volume of sample is introduced into an ion chromatograph as shown in
Figure 6.1. The anions are separated on the basis of their relative affinities for a
low capacity, strongly basic anion exchanger (guard and separator columns).
The separated anions, in their acid forms after the suppressor, are measured by
conductivity. They are identified on the basis of retention time as compared to
standards (SM4110: 1999). Reproducibility, expressed as relative standard devi-
ations, is found in reagent tests (0.26–8.49 mg l–1) to be 0–15 per cent.

Interference and matrix effects
Interferences can be divided into three different categories: 1) direct chromato-
graphic co-elution, in which an analyte response is observed at very nearly the

same retention time as the target anion; 2) concentration dependent co-elution,
which is observed when the response to higher than typical concentrations of a
neighbouring peak overlap into the retention window of the target anion; and
3) ionic character displacement, where retention times may shift significantly
due to the influence of high ionic strength matrices (high mineral content or
hardness) overloading the exchange sites in the column and significantly short-
ening the analyte’s retention times.
    A direct chromatographic co-elution may be solved by changing columns,
eluent strength, modifying the eluent with organic solvents, changing the detec-
tion systems, or selective removal of the interference with pre-treatment. Sample
dilution may resolve some of the difficulties if the interference is the result of
either concentration dependent or ionic character displacement. Pre-treatment
cartridges can be effective for eliminating certain matrix interferences.

    Usually, fluoride is difficult to quantify at low concentrations because the
water that is eluted first produces a negative peak on the chromatogram, some-
times know as the “water dip”, which cancels the positive peak arising from low
concentrations of fluoride. Simple organic acids (formic, carbonic, etc.) elute
close to fluoride and also cause interference. Fluoride can be determined accu-
rately by using special dilute eluent or gradient elution using NaOH eluent
(Clesceri et al., 1998).

Sample size
Normally a sample volume of at least 1 ml is injected for a 0.1 ml sample loop;
however, it is essential that the sample is representative.
Equipment and consumable requirements
An ion chromatograph equipped with an injection valve, sample loop, guard
column, anion separator column, and fibre or membrane suppressors, a tempera-
ture-compensated small-volume conductivity cell and detector, and a strip-chart
recorder are required. An ion chromatograph capable of delivering 2 to 5 ml
eluent per minute at a pressure of 1,400–6,900 kPa should be used. The price for
an ion chromatograph system is approximately US$ 30,000–60,000. Chemical
consumption, which represents the main running cost, is low.

Throughput
Sample preparation is minimal, the time consuming step being the start up of the
equipment. When using an auto-sampler the daily throughput for the equipment
is in the range 50–70 samples a day.
Sample collection, preservation and storage
The samples should be collected in plastic or glass bottles. All bottles must be
thoroughly cleaned and rinsed with reagent water. The samples collected should
be representative and the volumes collected should be sufficient for replicate
analysis. Sample preservation is not required but it is recommended to keep the
samples cool and to analyse them within 28 days.


6.2     Ion-selective electrode method
Fluoride is determined potentiometrically using a fluoride electrode in conjunc-
tion with a standard single-junction, sleeve-type reference electrode and a pH
meter having an expanded millivolt scale or a selective ion meter having a direct
concentration scale for fluoride. Fluoride ion activity depends on the solution
total ionic strength and pH, and on fluoride complex species. Adding an appro-
priate buffer provides a nearly uniform ionic strength background, adjusts the
pH, and breaks up complexes so that the electrode measures concentration

trode consists of a lanthanum fluoride crystal across which a potential is
developed by fluoride ions. The cell may be represented by Ag/AgCl-(0.3),
F-(0.001) LaF3 | test solution | reference electrode.
Method performance
In general, the quantitation range of fluoride by this method is 0.1–100 mg l–1.
Reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation, is found in proficiency
tests to be 3.6–4.8 per cent with a range of synthetic samples of concentration
0.750–0.900 mg l–1 F. The flow chart for this method is shown in Figure 6.2.

Interference and matrix effects
Extremes of pH interfere; the sample pH should be between 5 and 9. Fluoride
forms complexes with several polyvalent cations such as Si4+, Fe3+ and Al3+. The
degree of interference depends on the concentration of complexing cations, the

concentration of fluoride and complex species. The addition of pH 5.0 buffer
containing a strong chelating agent preferentially complexes aluminium (the
most common interference), silicon and iron, and eliminates the pH problem.
Sample size
Normally a minimum sample volume of 50 ml is needed for the analysis. It is
essential that the sample is representative.

Equipment and consumables requirements
An expanded-scale or digital pH meter or ion-selective meter equipped with
sleeve type reference electrode and fluoride electrode is required. In addition, a
magnetic stirrer with a PTFE-coated stirring bar and timer are needed. Chemical
consumption, which represents the main running cost, is low.
Throughput
Sample preparation is minimal but the time consuming step of the analysis is the
start up of the equipment. When using the manual method the throughput for the
equipment is in the range of 10 samples in 40 minutes.
Sample collection, preservation and storage
The samples should be collected in plastic or glass bottles. All bottles must be
thoroughly cleaned and rinsed with reagent water. The samples collected should be
representative and the volumes collected should be sufficient for replicate anal-
ysis. Sample preservation is not required but it is recommended that samples are
kept cool.

6.3      Complexone method 1 (laboratory test)
The sample is distilled, either automatically or manually. The distillate is reacted
with alizarin fluorine blue-lanthanum reagent. Fluoride ion reacts with the red
chelate formed between lanthanum and alizarin fluorine blue at a pH of 4.5. The
absorbance of the resulting blue ternary complex is measured at 620 nm. The
reaction is carried out in 16 per cent v/v acetone medium, which stabilizes the
colour and can increase sensitivity. If the concentration of interfering ions is
below the allowable concentrations given in Table 6.1, the distillation stage can
be omitted.
Method performance
The automated method is applicable to potable, surface and saline waters as well
as domestic and industrial wastewaters. The range of the manual and automated
methods, which can be modified by using an adjustable colorimeter, is
0.05–2.0 mg l–1 F. Reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation, is
found in proficiency tests to be 3–10 per cent (SM 4500F-E). The flow charts for
this method are shown in Figures 6.3 and 6.4.

Interferences and matrix effects
The method is free from most anionic and cationic interferences, except for
aluminum, which forms an extremely stable fluoro complex, AlF63–. This is
overcome by treatment with 8-hydroxyquinoline to complex the aluminium and
by subsequent extraction with chloroform. At aluminium levels below
0.2 mg l–1, the extraction procedure is not required. However, normally,
interferences are removed by distillation.

Sample size
Normally a minimum sample volume of 200 ml is needed for pre-treatment by
distillation in the manual system. The samples collected should be representative
and the volumes collected should be sufficient for replicate analysis. Sample
preservation is not required but it is recommended to keep the samples cool and
to analyse them within 28 days.

Equipment and consumable requirements
A fluoride manifold (continuous-flow auto-analyser system) equipped with
proportioning pump, continuous filter, colorimeter and recorder is required. The

price of the auto analyser unit is approximately US$ 20,000–40,000. Chemical
consumption, which represents the main running cost, is low.
Throughput
When using an automated system, the throughput is about 12 samples an hour.

Sample collection, preservation and storage
Sample preparation is minimal and the time consuming step of analysis is the
start up of the equipment.


6.4      Complexone method 2 (field test)
Method performance
In a buffered, weakly acidic solution, fluoride ions react with alizarin
complexone and lanthanum (III) to form a blue complex that is determined
photometrically. The method is analogous to EPA 340.3 and Standard Methods
4500-F-E. This method is applicable to surface and mineral waters as well as
wastewaters. The ranges of this method are 0.1–1.5 mg l–1 F and 1.0–20 mg l–1 F.
Reproducibility, expressed as the coefficient of variation of the procedure, is
found in proficiency tests to be ±2.2 per cent ( ISO 1990). The flow chart for this
method is shown in Figures 6.5 and 6.6.

below the limit at which interference occurs.
Sample size
Normally a minimum sample volume of 200 ml is needed for pre-treatment. The
samples collected should be representative and the volumes collected should be
sufficient for replicate analysis. Sample preservation is not required but it is
recommended to keep the samples cool and to analyse them within 28 days.

6.5        SPADNS method
In the SPADNS (sodium 2-(parasulfophenylazo)–1,8–dihydroxy–3,6–naphtha-
lene disulfonate) colorimetric method, fluoride reacts with the dye lake,
dissociating a proportion into a colourless complex anion (ZrF62–) and the dye.
As the amount of fluoride increases, the colour produced becomes progressively
lighter. After preliminary distillation, the distillate is reacted with the zirco-
nium-dye lake and measured colorimetrically at 570 nm in a spectrophotometer
or at 550 to 580 nm in a filter photometer.

Method performance
This method is applicable to potable, surface and saline waters as well as
domestic and industrial wastewaters. Following distillation to remove interfer-
ences, the sample is treated with SPADNS reagent. The loss of colour resulting
from the reaction of fluoride with the zirconyl-SPADNS dye is a function of the
fluoride concentration. The method covers the range from 0.1 mg l–1 to about
1.4 mg l–1 (SM 4500F-D). The flow chart for this method is shown in Figure 6.7.

Interference and matrix effects
The SPADNS reagent is more tolerant of interfering materials than other
accepted fluoride reagents. The addition of the highly coloured SPADNS
reagent must be done with utmost accuracy because the fluoride concentration is
measured as a difference of absorbance in the blank and the sample. A small
error in reagent addition is the most prominent source of error in this test. Care

must be taken to avoid overheating the flask above the level of the solution, i.e.
the top of the flame should be maintained so as to heat just the base of the flask.

Sample size
Normally a minimum sample volume of 50 ml is needed for the distillation
pre-treatment. The samples collected should be representative and the volumes
collected should be sufficient for replicate analysis. Sample preservation is not
required but it is recommended to keep the samples cool and to analyse them
within 28 days.

Equipment and consumable requirements
Spectrophotometer or filter photometer equipped with a greenish yellow filter is
required. The price of the analyser unit is approximately US$ 3,000–10,000.
Chemical consumption, which represents the main running cost, is low.
Throughput
Sample preparation is minimal, the time consuming step of analysis being the
start up of the equipment. The daily throughput for the equipment is in the range
10–12 samples.
Sample collection, preservation and storage
The samples should be collected in plastic or glass bottles. All bottles must be
thoroughly cleaned and rinsed with reagent water. The samples collected should
be representative and the volumes collected should be sufficient for replicate
analysis. Sample preservation is not required but it is recommended to keep the
samples cool and to analyse them within 28 days.

Country data on dental and
skeletal fluorosis associated with
exposure to fluoride through
drinking-water



This chapter provides a synthesis of reported information on fluoride exposure
on a country-by-country basis. It outlines the health effects, fluoride levels
recorded in drinking-water and also, where details are available, mitigation
measures that have been used. Chapters within the main body of the document
are cross-referenced as appropriate.
    The current WHO guideline value for fluoride in drinking-water is 1.5 mg l–1
(WHO, 2004; see also Chapter 4), and levels above this figure have been defined
as elevated for the purposes of this Chapter. However, it should be noted that
fluoride toxicity is dependant upon a number of factors, including the quantity of
water consumed and exposure to fluoride through other routes. Although fluo-
ride in drinking-water is usually the largest contributor to daily intake, there are
other sources of fluoride that may, on occasion, be significant (see Chapter 2).
These include, air pollution as a result of burning fluoride-rich coal, certain
foods or drinks (such as brick tea) and fluoride supplements.

98                          Fluoride in Drinking-water

    Health effects related to the exposure to elevated levels of fluoride include
dental and skeletal fluorosis (see Chapter 3). A number of indices have been
proposed to grade the severity of dental fluorosis and these are outlined in the
Appendix.
    Waters high in fluoride are mostly calcium-deficient groundwaters in base-
ment aquifers, such as granite and gneiss, in geothermal waters and in some
sedimentary basins. Groundwaters with high fluoride concentrations occur in
many areas of the world including large parts of Africa, China, the Eastern Medi-
terranean and southern Asia (India, Sri Lanka). One of the best-known high
fluoride belts on land extends along the East African Rift from Eritrea to Malawi.
There is another belt from Turkey through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India,
northern Thailand and China. The Americas and Japan have similar belts. Where
there is sufficient information, the data for each country is divided under a
number of self-explanatory headings. The literature review was conducted by
searching bibliographic databases (including MEDLINE and POLTOX),
bibliographic lists from the collected references and the Internet. Additional
information was obtained by consulting individual experts and country or
regional representatives. The country-by-country data does not include informa-
tion on countries that artificially fluoridate their public water supplies.


7.1      Argentina
A survey of groundwater fluoride concentrations in the southeast subhumid
pampa of Argentina was conducted by Paoloni et al. (2003). This region, which
includes Coronel Dorrego, has a large rural and suburban population that relies
on groundwater for drinking-water supplies. Fluoride concentrations occurred in
the range 0.9–18.2 mg l–1, with a mean value of 3.8 mg l–1. Only 2.9 per cent of
samples analysed were found to be below the guideline value of 1.5 mg l–1.


7.2      Brazil
Some rural communities in Brazil have elevated fluoride levels in their
drinking-water supplies. In Paraiba State, for example, which is located in the
northeast region, well-derived drinking-water supplies contain 0.1–2.3 mg l–1
fluoride (Whitford et al., 1999). In Olho D’Agua (Ceara State), levels of fluoride
in drinking-water supplies of 2–3 mg l–1 have been recorded, although the
concentration varies according to the time of year and depends on rainfall levels
(Cortes et al., 1996). Over 62 per cent of children examined in Oldo D’Agua had
fluorosis scores of 3 or more based on the Thylstrup-Fejerkov Index
(see Appendix).

7.3      Canada
Elevated levels of fluoride in drinking-water have been reported in some
communities in Alberta (4.3 mg l–1), Saskatchewan (2.8 mg l–1) and Quebec
(2.5 mg l–1) (Droste, 1987; Health Canada, 1993). In Rigolet, Labrador,
“moderate” dental fluorosis has been reported associated with exposure to fluo-
ride levels between 0.1–3.8 mg l–1 (Ismail and Messer, 1996).


7.4      China

Fluoride-related health effects
In China, fluorosis results from consumption of drinking-water containing
elevated fluoride levels, pollution caused by burning fluoride-rich coal and high
levels of consumption of brick tea (Wang and Huang, 1995; Cao et al., 1997,
2000; Jin et al., 2000; Toshikazu et al., 2000). Endemic fluorosis is prevalent in
China occurring in 29 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions (Wang
and Huang, 1995). The main type of endemic fluorosis in China results from high
levels of fluoride in drinking-water (Chen et al., 1997). The geographical distri-
bution is divided into five regions (Sun et al., 2001):
+  North-Eastern region (including Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning prov-
   inces); Northern and Eastern China (including Hebei, Tianjin, Beijing,
   Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and municipalities);
+  North-West region (including Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Qinghai,
   Gansu and Xinjiang provinces and autonomous region);
+  South-Western region (including Sichuan, Yunna, Guangxi, Chongqing and
   Tibet provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions); and
+  other Southern regions (including Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei,
   Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces).

   The highest prevalence of drinking-water-related fluorosis is found in the
North-Eastern region.
Dental fluorosis
Dental fluorosis in China has been recognized for some time (Anderson, 1932).
It has been estimated that over 26 million people in China suffer from dental
fluorosis due to elevated fluoride in their drinking-water, with a further
16.5 million cases of dental fluorosis resulting from coal smoke pollution (Liang
et al., 1997). As can be seen from Table 7.1, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is

   It has been demonstrated that people living in high fluoride drinking-water
regions (>4 mg l–1) and consuming a nutrient deficient diet have the highest inci-
dence of dental (and skeletal) fluorosis (Chen et al., 1997; Liang et al., 1997).
Skeletal fluorosis
Over one million cases of skeletal fluorosis are thought to be attributable to
drinking-water, with a further million cases due to coal smoke pollution (Liang
et al., 1997). Table 7.2 shows the reported distribution of skeletal fluorosis in
China (Sun et al., 2001).

    As shown in Table 7.3, there is a significant correlation between the preva-
lence of skeletal fluorosis and drinking-water fluoride concentration (r = 0.96).
A regression equation between prevalence and fluoride concentration based on
the figures in Table 7.3 (y = 6.55x – 0.48) results in an estimated 0.3 million
cases of skeletal fluorosis in Jiangsu province.

Exposure and fluoride concentrations
Drinking water with high levels of fluoride is widespread in China and has been
seen in all provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions with the exception
of Shanghai, and it has been estimated (Guifan, pers. com.) that there are over
1,200 counties and almost 150,000 villages affected by fluorosis (including coal
pollution derived fluorosis). High fluoride levels in drinking-water are seen
mainly in the arid and semi-arid regions such as Helongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning,
Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu and Xinjiang
provinces or autonomous regions (Zheng and Hong, 1988). High fluoride levels
are also seen in hot and cold springs. Hot springs with elevated fluoride concen-
trations are distributed mainly in Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian and Taiwan
(Zheng and Hong, 1988; Chen et al., 1997). Fluorosis resulting from elevated
fluoride levels in colds springs is reported mainly in Heilongjiang province.
102                         Fluoride in Drinking-water

    Fluoride levels in drinking-water can be high, exceeding 3 mg l–1. In the
suburbs of Tianjin City, for example, the fluoride content of deep well water has
been reported to be 7 mg l–1. In Cangzhou city of Hebei province pressure
confined waters have been reported to have fluoride levels between 3 and
8 mg l–1 (Zheng and Hong, 1988). In Jilin Province, fluoride concentrations up to
10 mg l–1 have been identified and over 50 per cent of samples were found to
contain fluoride levels in excess of 2 mg l–1 (Zhang et al., 2003). In shallow well
water in Pei county (Jiangsu province) levels in excess of 13 mg l–1 have been
reported (Wang et al., 1997), while hot spring water has been shown to have
fluoride levels up to 17 mg l–1 (Zheng and Hong, 1988; Guifan, pers. com.).

Mitigation measures
Preventative measures are reported to have been initiated in the 1960s. The prin-
cipal mitigation strategies include exploitation of deep-seated water, use of river
water, reservoir construction and defluoridation, with the use of deep-seated
water being one of the most important mitigation strategies (Sun et al., 2000).
Since 1980, numerous projects aimed at improving drinking-water quality
through the use of defluoridation techniques have been reported as successful
(Wang and Huang, 1995). Liang (1998) reported an evaluation of 2000 water
engineering projects (amounting to almost 10 per cent of those undertaken)
aimed at reducing drinking-water fluoride concentrations. The results demon-
strated that the projects were successful, with concentrations of fluoride in
drinking-water below 1 mg l–1 and decreases seen in the prevalence of dental
fluorosis. According to Sun et al. (2000) an overall coverage rate of safe water
supplies of 60–70 per cent has been provided using deep-seated wells in the
endemic fluorosis areas.


7.5      Eritrea
Fluoride levels in drinking-water were not considered, generally, to present a
large risk of fluorosis. The mean recorded fluoride levels in Eritrea are
0.99 mg l–1 in the Northern Red Sea, 0.16 mg l–1 in Zoba Gash-Barka, 0.27 mg l–1
in the Southern Red Sea, 2.10 mg l–1 in the Northern Red Sea, 0.16 mg l–1 in Zoba
Anseba and 0.56 mg l–1 in Zoba Debub (Water Resources Department, Eritrea,
unpublished report, 1999). Mottling of the teeth has been observed in children
from eight villages around Keren (Srikanth et al., 2002). This observation led to
an investigation of the fluoride levels in the drinking-water serving the affected
villages. Srikanth et al. (2002) found that, with the exception of Wasdenba (with
a fluoride level of 1.2 mg l–1), all of the sources in the other seven villages
had fluoride levels greater than 1.5 mg l–1 (ranging 2.02–3.73 mg l–1). The

authors estimated from these findings that around 15,000 people were at risk
from high fluoride levels.


7.6     Ethiopia

Fluoride-related health effects
Dental fluorosis
Olsson (1979) reported dental fluorosis in 99 per cent of 239, 6–7 year-old, chil-
dren examined living in Wonji and Awassa in the Rift Valley. The fluoride
concentration in Wonji and Awassa was 12.4 and 3.5 mg l–1, respectively
(Olsson, 1979). A study conducted by Haimanot et al. (1987) found dental
fluorosis in more than 80 per cent of sampled children resident in the Rift Valley
since birth (1,221 out of 1,456). The maximum prevalence was seen in the 10–14
year old age-group and 32 per cent of the children showed severe dental
mottling. Males were affected more than females (Haimanot et al., 1987).
Wondwossen et al. (2004) examined dental fluorosis (and caries) in children
living in two villages in the Wonji Shoa sugar estate. Fluoride levels in the two
villages were markedly different (village A: 0.3–2.2 mg l–1; village K: 10–14
mg l–1). The prevalence of dental fluorosis (a score of 1 or more using the
Thylstrup-Fejerskov index – see Appendix) was 91.8 per cent in village A and
100 per cent in village K. The prevalence of severe dental fluorosis (a score of 5
or greater), however, was 11 per cent in village A and 60 per cent in village K.
Skeletal fluorosis
Skeletal fluorosis was first reported in Ethiopia in 1973 in the Wonji Shoa sugar
estates in the Ethiopian Rift Valley (Lester, 1974). Three areas, Wonji-Shoa,
Alemtena and Samiberta, have been identified as having cases of skeletal
fluorosis. The highest incidence was found at the Wonji-Shoa sugar estates,
where a linear relationship was observed between the development of crippling
fluorosis, fluoride concentration in drinking-water supplies and period of expo-
sure. The first cases of skeletal fluorosis appeared among workers on the estates
(98 per cent males) who had been consuming water with fluoride content of more
than 8 mg l–1 for over 10 years. Between 1976 and 1984, 530 workers were
retired from Wonji-Shoa at the age of 45–50 years because of inability to
perform their physically strenuous jobs. Among these workers, 46 per cent were
found to have skeletal fluorosis. In August 1984, a medical board examined 300
persons from Wonji-Shoa with a presumptive diagnosis of skeletal fluorosis
after complaints of pains and aches in the joints, limitation of movement, and
progressive kyphosis (excessive outward curvature of the spine). Radiological
104                          Fluoride in Drinking-water

evidence of skeletal fluorosis was found in 65 per cent of the 300 persons exam-
ined and 30 (10 per cent) had crippling fluorosis (Haimanot et al., 1987).

Exposure and fluoride concentrations
The region of the Rift Valley in Ethiopia varies between 500 and 1,800 metres
above sea level, and is hot and dry, with a mean temperature of 23 °C (range
15 °C to 38 °C). The Wonji Shoa sugar estates and Metahara Sugar Estate are the
major agro-industrial establishments in the Rift Valley, with a population of
31,000 and 25,000 respectively. A study conducted in 16 large farms, villages
and towns in the Ethiopian Rift Valley between 1977 and 1985 found that the
fluoride level of drinking-water collected from wells there ranged from 1.2 to
36.0 mg l–1 (mean 10.0 mg l–1). The sugar estates, which had the highest popula-
tion densities, generally had fluoride levels far in excess of the WHO guideline
value, with Wonji-Shoa having levels between 3.7 and 17.0 mg l–1, and Metahara
2.4 to 7.0 mg l–1 (Haimanot et al., 1987). Initial results from a programme to
measure fluoride in wells from all over Ethiopia found that, from the 138 wells
tested, 33 per cent had fluoride concentration greater than 1.5 mg l–1; the
maximum level detected was over 11.5 mg l–1 (Reimann et al., 2003). The high
fluoride concentrations were all clustered in wells from the centre of the Ethiopian
part of the Rift valley, which suggests a hydrothermal origin for the fluoride.

Mitigation measures
In the early 1970s, defluoridated water supplies were reported to have been
available in all factories in the area, following the recognition of this problem
(Haimanot et al. 1987). It would seem, however, that the defluoridation plants do
not always operate, because a study looking at fluoride intake in children in the
Wonji Shoa sugar estate found levels of fluoride of 14.4 mg l–1 in well water
from one of the villages (Malde et al., 2004).


7.7      Germany
Two cases of severe dental fluorosis were identified in 1998 in school children
living in the Muenster region of Germany. Both cases occurred in one household
and resulted from excessive fluoride consumption both through supplements and
elevated levels in the drinking-water supply (Queste et al., 2001). The discovery
of these cases led to an examination of other rural wells in the region, a large
number of which were found to have elevated fluoride levels with concentrations
up to 8.8 mg l–1. Grafe and Dominok (1978) reported skeletal fluorosis in an
80-year-old man, whose drinking-water was contaminated by the effluent from a
local fluoride plant.

7.8      India

Fluoride-related health effects
A total of 17 (out of 32) States are reported to have endemic fluorosis in India
(FRRDF, 1999; Yadav et al., 1999). In 1987, it was estimated that 25 million
people were suffering from fluorosis (FRRDF, 1999).

Dental fluorosis
The prevalence of dental fluorosis has been investigated in Rajasthan by
Choubisa et al. (1997). Prevalence rates were observed in 15 tribal villages with
fluoride concentrations of 0.3–10.8 mg l–1. At mean fluoride concentrations of
1.4 and 6 mg l–1, dental fluorosis was seen in 25.6 per cent and 84.4 per cent of
school children (< 16 years) and 23.9 per cent and 96.9 per cent of adults respec-
tively. Kodali et al. (1994) reported dental mottling in 76 per cent of children in
the 5–10 year age group and 84 per cent of children in the 10–15 year age group
in Kodabakshupally, Sarampet and Sivannagudem. Yadav and Lata (2003)
examined the prevalence of dental fluorosis at lower drinking-water fluoride
concentrations (mean concentrations between 1.93 and 2.14 mg l–1) in the Jhajjar
district, Haryana. Over 50 per cent of the children examined were found to be
affected by dental fluorosis. Reddy and Prasad (2003) reported dental fluorosis
levels of 43 per cent in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, where drink-
ing-water fluoride concentrations ranged between 1.2 and 2.1 mg l–1.

Skeletal fluorosis
Endemic skeletal fluorosis was reported from India in the 1930s. It was observed
first in Andhra Pradesh bullocks used for ploughing, when farmers noticed the
bullocks inability to walk, apparently due to painful and stiff joints. Several
years later the same disease was observed in humans (Short et al., 1937).
Choubisa et al. (1997) examined the prevalence of skeletal fluorosis in Rajasthan
in adults exposed to mean fluoride levels of 1.4 and 6 mg l–1. At 1.4 mg l–1 over
4 per cent of adults were reported to be affected, while at 6 mg l–1, 63 per cent of
adults were reported to be affected. The prevalence was found to be higher in
males and increased with increasing fluoride levels and age. In Andhra Pradesh,
Reddy and Prasad (2003) found skeletal fluorosis affecting between 0.2 and
1 per cent of the population examined, where the maximum drinking-water
fluoride concentration was 2.1 mg l–1.

Exposure, fluorosis and fluoride concentrations
At least 17 States are affected by elevated fluoride levels in drinking-water,
namely; Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and
Kashmir, Kamataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab,

Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. These have been
progressively identified since the first report by Short et al. (1937), with Assam
being the most recently identified State with high fluoride levels associated with
endemic fluorosis. Not all States are equally affected and the number of districts
with endemic fluorosis within each State varies (FRRDF, 1999). Nine out of
eighteen districts in West Bengal were recently identified as having fluoride
contaminated groundwater (Ministry of Water Resources, 2004). It has been
estimated that the total population consuming drinking-water containing
elevated levels of fluoride is over 66 million (FRRDF, 1999). The distribution of
fluoride in Indian groundwaters is shown in Table 7.4.
    In Rajasthan, fluoride concentrations have been found to vary between
0.6 mg l–1 and 69.7 mg l–1 (Gupta, 1999). In Haryana, the highest fluoride
concentration was found in the village of Karoli and was recorded at 48 mg l–1
(Kim-Farley, pers. com.). Meenakshi et al. (2004) reported fluoride levels of
between 0.3 and 6.9 mg l-1 in four villages in the Jind district of Haryana.

Mitigation measures
Formal mitigation measures were undertaken from 1987, when the Government
of India made a commitment to provide safe water to the rural community
(i.e. those most affected by fluorosis). Since 1987, numerous programmes aimed
at fully identifying the problem, along with developing fluoride removal tech-
niques have been implemented (FRRDF, 1999). In the Dungarpur district of
Rajasthan, activated alumina and Nalgonda defluoridation are practised.
Defluoridation kits have been distributed at household level under the

sponsorship of UNICEF and active community participation has been observed
with the result that it has been reported that the ongoing Fluorosis Mitigation
Programme is sustainable (Vaish and Vaish, 2000). In Andhra Pradesh the use of
check dams, to dilute fluoride concentrations in groundwater, has been investi-
gated (Bhagavan and Raghu, 2005). The check dams, which are rainwater
harvesting structures, are designed to provide artificial recharge of groundwater.
In over 50 per cent of cases, the check dams were found to reduce fluoride
concentrations in groundwater.


7.9      Indonesia
Fluoride concentrations in drinking-water have been investigated in the
Asembagus coastal plain, in the north-eastern part of Java (Heikens et al., 2005).
Fluoride concentrations in well water were <0.1–4.2 mg l–1. The wells with the
highest fluoride concentrations were those closest to the river Banyuputih, which
is contaminated with effluent from the hyperacid crater lake of the Ijen volcano.
The river water was found to contain an average fluoride level of 9.5 mg l–1,
although this was found to fluctuate between 5.5 and 14.2 mg l–1.


7.10 Israel
Milgalter et al. (1974) found natural fluoride levels in drinking-water of up to
3 mg l–1 in the Negev desert region.


7.11 Japan
Dental fluorosis was observed in children of the Ikeno district in the Aichi
prefecture in the 1970s, following the unintentional supply of drinking-water
containing up to 7.8 mg l–1 fluoride since 1960 (Ishii and Suckling, 1991). On
discovery of the high fluoride levels, an alternative supply with a fluoride level
of 0.2 mg l–1 was provided.
    Tsutsui et al. (2000) examined the prevalence of dental fluorosis in Japanese
communities exposed to naturally occurring fluoride up to 1.4 mg l–1. A total of
1,060, 10–12 year-old, lifetime residents were examined. The prevalence of
dental fluorosis was found to increase as fluoride levels increased, ranging from
1.7 per cent at 0.2–0.4 mg l–1 up to 15.4 per cent in the group exposed to
1.1–1.4 mg l–1.

7.12 Kenya

Fluoride-related health effects
Dental fluorosis
Nevill and Brass (1953) examined 1,202 European children between the ages of
7 and 14 living in Kenya. According to this study, a total of 30 per cent of the
children were showing some degree of dental fluorosis. Williamson (1953) also
examined levels of dental fluorosis and the incidence is shown in Table 7.5.
    Dental fluorosis is reported in the Northern Frontier (Turkana), North-West
Kenya, South Rift Valley and Central and Eastern Regions (Fendall and
Grounds, 1965). A survey of 1,307 Asian and African school children found that
67 per cent of Asian children and 47 per cent of African children were affected.
The degree of dental fluorosis was reported to be more severe among Asian chil-
dren, and it was speculated that this could have been related to their vegetarian
diet (Fendall and Grounds, 1965). Manji et al. (1986a) examined 110 children
living in an area of Kenya with 2 mg l–1 fluoride in the water and found that all
the children examined exhibited dental fluorosis.
    Dental fluorosis has also been identified in an area with a relatively low fluo-
ride concentration. Manji et al. (1986b) examined 160 children living in an area
where the fluoride concentration ranged between 0.54 and 0.93 mg l–1 and showed
that the prevalence of enamel changes was 93.8 per cent. Severe dental fluorosis
(TFI 5 or more – see Appendix) was seen in over 33 per cent of the children.
    Altitude may have an effect on the level of dental fluorosis. According to
Manji et al. (1986c) in low fluoride drinking-water zones (<0.5 mg l–1) 36 per
cent of the children at sea level had dental fluorosis, compared with 78 per cent at
                                  Country Data                                109

1,500 m and 100 per cent at 2,400 m. In higher fluoride zones (0.5–1.0 mg l–1),
71 per cent had dental fluorosis at sea level as compared to almost 94 per cent
at 1,500 m.
Skeletal fluorosis
Fendall and Grounds (1965) reported a single case of skeletal fluorosis in a
European living in Kenya. He had been exposed to borehole water containing
18–29 mg l–1 fluoride for a period of six years.

Exposure and fluoride concentrations
The fluoride content of borehole water varies considerably across different bore-
holes (even when in close proximity) and may also show temporal variations
between the same borehole (Nair and Manji, 1982). The highest concentrations
of fluoride in groundwater are reported to occur in the peri-urban areas of
Nairobi, in the Rift Valley around Nakuru, Naivasha and Mount Kenya, and near
the northern frontier. Local pockets of intermediate concentrations of
2–20 mg l–1 have been reported throughout the country. According to Fendall
and Grounds (1965) excess fluoride in surface water occurs in Lakes Rudolph
(12 mg l–1), Hannington (1,100 mg l–1), Baringo (6 mg l–1), Nakuru (2,400
mg l–1), Magadi and elsewhere. Nair et al. (1984) reported concentrations of
fluoride up to 1,640 mg l–1 and 2,800 mg l–1 in lakes Elmentaita and Nukuru
respectively. In a study of over 1,000 groundwater samples taken nationally over
60 per cent exceeded 1 mg l–1, 20 per cent exceeded 5 mg l–1 and 12 per cent
exceeded 8 mg l–1. The volcanic areas of the Nairobi Rift Valley and Central
Provinces had the highest concentrations, with maximum groundwater fluoride
concentrations reaching 50 mg l–1 (Nair et al., 1984).


7.13 Mexico

Fluoride-related health effects
Fluorosis is considered to be a largely unrecognized environmental health
problem in Mexico (Díaz-Barriga et al., 1997a).
Dental fluorosis
In the city of San Luis Potosi, 98 per cent of children exposed to fluoride drink-
ing-water concentrations of greater than 2 mg l–1 were reported to exhibit signs
of dental fluorosis (Grimaldo et al., 1995). Bottled juice and bottled water
containing high levels of fluoride were also felt to contribute to the levels of
dental fluorosis in San Luis Potosi, and help explain the high levels of fluorosis
110                         Fluoride in Drinking-water

in children not exposed to elevated levels in their drinking-water supply
(Díaz-Barriga et al., 1997b).

Skeletal fluorosis
No references could be found documenting cases of skeletal fluorosis although,
as pointed out by Díaz-Barriga et al. (1997a), the exposure to elevated levels of
fluoride began in the late 1960s. Results of X-ray and densitometry tests
conducted on cases possibly showing early signs of skeletal fluorosis were
inconclusive (Calderón et al., 1995).

Exposure and fluoride concentrations
Diaz-Barriga et al. (1997a) estimated that approximately 5 million people may
be exposed to elevated levels of fluoride in their drinking-water supplies. Mean
fluoride concentrations in urban locations ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 mg l–1,
although individual sources were recorded as having concentrations up to
7.8 mg l–1 (Hermosillo in Sonara State). In rural locations a similar pattern
occurred with mean levels between 0.9 and 4.5 mg l–1 and the highest recorded
concentration of 8 mg l–1 (Abasolo in Guanajuato State). States with elevated
fluoride levels included Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango,
Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi and Sonora (Díaz-Barriga et al., 1997a). In the city
of Durango, it has been estimated that almost 95 per cent of the residents were
exposed to fluoride concentrations in drinking-water greater than 2 mg l–1 (Ortiz
et al., 1998). Hurtado and Gardea-Torresdey (2004) reported high levels of fluo-
ride from drinking-water from the Los Altos de Jalisco region. Over 40 per cent
of the municipalities had fluoride concentrations greater than 1.5 mg l–1. Three
of the cities in the region had particularly elevated levels, most notably
Teocaltiche (up to 18.5 mg l–1).


7.14 Niger
Over 400 children, ranging in age from 15 months to 14 years were reported to
have skeletal fluorosis in Tibiri, with 68 per cent of the illness being seen in
5 year-olds. Bony lesions were first observed in 1988. This led to analysis of the
water and the discovery of high fluoride levels (4.7–6.6 mg l–1). Mitigation
measures were undertaken, with water being brought in from a neighbouring
area, and Niger’s water company confirmed that the level of fluoride had fallen
to 1.6 mg l–1 (Arji, 2001; Ziegler, 2002).
                                  Country Data                                 111

7.15 Nigeria
A literature search revealed only one study into the occurrence of dental fluorosis
in Nigeria (Wongdem et al., 2000). A total of 475 people aged 5 and over, who
were either born in Langtang town or had lived there for a minimum of 5 years,
were examined. Enamel status was assessed for mottling using a modified version
of Dean’s classification (see Appendix). There was a 26.1 per cent prevalence rate
of enamel fluorosis in the Langtang town area, with 20.6 per cent of the cases
classified as mild and 5.5 per cent as severe. The highest prevalence was seen
among 10 to 19 year olds. A follow-up study to determine the fluoride concentra-
tions in Langtang town, found that levels ranged between 0.5 and 3.96 mg l–1 with
the highest levels being found in stream sources (Wongdem et al., 2001).


7.16 Norway
In Norway more than 80 per cent of the population presently receive
drinking-water from surface water sources. As surface water fluoride concentra-
tions are very low, Norway has traditionally been considered a low-fluoride area,
and dental fluorosis was not considered to be a problem. However, due to
increasing regional environmental pollution and microbiological problems,
Norwegian authorities have been looking for alternative drinking-water sources
and the Norwegian Geological Survey has been actively promoting the use of
groundwater, estimating that by the year 2000 about 30 per cent of the population
would have been supplied from underground water sources.
    Approximately 100,000 private drinking-water wells were reported to be in
use in Norway and several thousand new wells were being drilled every year
(Bardsen and Bjorvatn, 1998; Bardsen et al., 1999). Investigations showed that
groundwater could contain high concentrations of fluoride. A study from the
county of Hordaland, for example, reported fluoride concentrations in ground-
water in the range of 0.02–9.48 mg l–1 (Bardsen et al., 1999). Dental fluorosis
has been reported among lifelong consumers of moderate to high
fluoride-containing groundwater (0.5–8.0 mg l–1) (Bardsen et al., 1999).


7.17 Pakistan
Generally, the majority of drinking-water sources in Pakistan are reported to
contain acceptable levels of fluoride, with 84 per cent containing less than
0.7 mg l–1 (Ayyaz et al., 2002). However, this may not be true in areas of
112                         Fluoride in Drinking-water

northern Pakistan, as has been shown for Kheshki and Naranji, northeast of
Peshawar (Shah and Danishwar, 2003). Levels of fluoride in spring and stream
sources of between 8 and 13.52 mg l–1 have been reported for Naranji and the
surrounding area (Shah and Danishwar, 2003).
    Fluoride Action Network (2001) reported an incident in a village close to
Lahore, where skeletal fluorosis was seen in a number of children as a result of
fluoride in factory waste contaminating the local water supply.


7.18 Saudi Arabia
In the Hail region, over 90 per cent of 2,355 rural children examined and aged
12–15 years were reported to show dental fluorosis, and a strong association
(p < 0.001) was seen between fluoride level (0.5–2.8 mg l–1) in well water used
for drinking and the severity of dental fluorosis (Akpata et al., 1997). Mecca
(with a fluoride concentration up to 2.5 mg l–1) was also reported to be an area
with endemic fluorosis (Al-Khateeb et al., 1991; Akpata et al., 1997).


7.19 Senegal
Fluoride concentrations in drinking-water at Kaffrine, Gossas, Guinguinéo,
Foundiougne (in the Sine Saloum region) and Darou Rahmane Fall (in the
Diourbel region) were found to be 1.1, 2.6, 3.9, 4.6, and 7.4 mg l–1, respectively.
Prevalence of dental fluorosis among the children at Kaffrine, Gossas,
Guinguinéo, and Foundiougne was 68.5, 85.3, 93.7 and 100 per cent, respec-
tively. About 30 per cent and 60 per cent of the children in Guinguinéo and
Darou Rahmane Fall, respectively, were reported to have severely discoloured
brownish-black teeth (Brouwer et al., 1988).


7.20 South Africa

Fluoride-related health effects
Mauguhan-Brown (1935), Staz (1938) and Abrahams (1946) reported the
presence of fluorosis amongst children in high fluoride areas of South Africa.
Ockerse (1944, 1949) identified 803 endemic fluorosis areas in South Africa,
mostly the North Western, Western and Karoo Regions of Cape Province,
Western and Central Free State, and Northern, Eastern and Western areas of
Transvaal.
                                  Country Data                                113

Dental fluorosis
In the Western Bushveld areas, which are known to have endemic dental
fluorosis, about 300,000 people drink water with fluoride concentrations above
0.7 mg l–1. Dental fluorosis in both children and adults is clearly manifested in
many villages (McCaffrey and Willis, 1997). A study on the perceptions of
fluorosis conducted in the northern Cape (Chikte et al., 2001) demonstrated that
fluoride concentrations should be kept below 0.7 mg l–1 in order to minimize the
risk of dental fluorosis. This was based on a study of teeth from 694 children
living in three areas with differing fluoride concentrations categorized as
suboptimal (0.4–0.6 mg l–1), optimal (0.99–1.1 mg l–1) and supra-optimal
(1.70–2.70 mg l–1). Even in the suboptimal fluoride area children showed signs
of dental fluorosis, with 19 per cent of the group considered to be experiencing
moderate or severe fluorosis. In the supra-optimal category, 45 per cent of chil-
dren exhibited severe fluorosis. Grobler et al. (2001) examined the level of
dental fluorosis in 282 children living in Sanddrif (0.19 mg l–1 fluoride), Kuboes
(0.48 mg l–1 fluoride) and Leeu Gamka (3 mg l–1 fluoride). The prevalence of
fluorosis (scores greater than 2 using Deans index – see Appendix) was 47 per
cent in Sanddrif, 50 per cent in Kuboes and 95 per cent in Leeu Gamka. Except
for one child in Kuboes, severe fluorosis (a score of 5 or greater) was only
observed in Leeu Gamka with 30 per cent of the children affected. Ncube and
Schutte (2005) reported levels of dental fluorosis in Free State, Western Cape,
KwaZulu-Natal and North-West Provinces. The highest level of fluorosis (clas-
sified as slight to heavy) was in the North-West Province, where up to 73 per cent
of children were affected.

Skeletal fluorosis
Cases of severe skeletal fluorosis in adults have been reported in villages in the
Western Bushveld area (McCaffrey and Willis, 1997).

Exposure and fluoride concentrations
High fluoride groundwater is found inside the Pilanesberg Alkaline Igneous
Complex (mean 3.7 mg l–1) and very high fluoride concentrations (mean
57 mg l–1) are found around the perimeter. High fluoride concentrations in
groundwater are also found in the Nebo Granite and the mineralized Lebowa
Granite. It is suggested that the cause of most high fluoride concentrations in
groundwater is the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in bedrock and soil.
Microscopic study of thin sections of common rock types from the area showed
that fluorite, mica and hornblende were the most common fluoride bearing
minerals (McCaffrey, 1995). A large part of the population in the Karoo,
Northern Cape and North West Province drink water from boreholes due to the
114                         Fluoride in Drinking-water

low level of annual rainfall (Moola, 1996). Grobler et al. (2001) noted that heavy
rainfall could markedly decrease the fluoride levels in drinking-water in
South Africa.


7.21 Spain
Areas in Tenerife, mainly in the north of the island, have high levels of fluoride
in drinking-water and cases of fluorosis have been observed. In the affected areas
of La Guancha, San Juan de la Rambla and Icod de los Vinos mean fluoride
concentrations varied between 2.50 and 4.59 mg l–1 (Hardisson et al., 2001).


7.22 Sri Lanka
Problems relating to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking-water in Sri Lanka
are relatively recent and reflect the increase in the number of tubewells, particu-
larly in the “Dry Zone” in the North Central Province, where levels of fluoride up
to 10 mg l–1 have been reported (Dissanayake, 1996). Defluoridation, using char-
coal and charred bone meal, has been introduced in some areas (Dissanayake,
1996; Saparamadu, 2000).


7.23 Sudan
Fluorosis was reported in the course of an investigation into health and nutrition
at Abu Deleig in the Butana desert, 105 miles east of Khartoum, in December
1952. Many cases were seen also at Jevel Geili, an encampment 30 miles to the
south, but none at Wad Hssuna, a large village about 30 miles west of Abu
Deleig. The fluoride content of drinking-water in Abu Deleig and Jebel Gaili was
recorded as between 0.65 and 3.20 mg l–1. Examination of 134 schoolboys living
in Abu Deleig showed the total incidence of dental fluorosis to be 60.4 per cent
(Smith et al., 1953).


7.24 Thailand
Drinking water fluoride levels have been found to exceed 10 mg l–1 in some parts
of Thailand. Northern and western Thailand were considered the most likely to
have high fluoride levels and it has been estimated that approximately 1 per cent
of natural water sources contain levels greater than 2 mg l–1 (Prasertsom, 1998).
In northern Thailand high fluoride levels may be associated with geothermal
sources of water (Noppakun et al., 2000). The highest level of fluoride recorded
                                   Country Data                                 115

by Chuckpaiwong et al. (2000) was 0.92 mg l–1 and groundwater sources were
found to contain the highest levels of fluoride.


7.25 Turkey
There are a number of areas in Turkey where drinking-water fluoride concentra-
tions can be very high, especially in the middle and eastern part of Turkey. In
Denizli-Sarayköy and Çaldiran Plain levels can reach 13.7 mg l–1, while in
Eskiºehir and Isparta levels from 1.9 to 7.5 mg l–1 and from 3.8 to 4.9 mg l–1
respectively, have been reported (Azbar and Türkman, 2000).


7.26 Uganda
Dental fluorosis has been seen in the Rift Valley area of western Uganda
(Rwenyonyi et al., 1998). A number of studies (Rwenyonyi et al., 1998, 2000)
have examined the determinants of dental fluorosis in children in this region,
comparing low fluoride areas (0.5 mg l–1) with high fluoride areas (2.5 mg l–1).
Altitude was found to affect both the prevalence and severity of fluorosis in both
high and low fluoride areas. In the high fluoride area, the severity of fluorosis
was also found to increase with age.


7.27 United Republic of Tanzania

Fluoride-related health effects
Dental fluorosis
Grech (1966), reported that all the 119 children examined in Maji ya Chai aged
between 9 and 13 years were found to have dental fluorosis; 87.4 per cent of them
to a severe degree. They had lived their entire lives in this area, consuming only
the local spring or river water. The river fluoride concentration was found to be
18.6 mg l–1. Of people examined around Arusha and Moshi, between 83 and 95
per cent exhibited dental fluorosis. Awadia et al. (1999) found that in Arusha the
prevalence and severity of fluorosis was greater in non-vegetarians (fluorosis –
95 per cent, severe fluorosis – 35 per cent) than in vegetarians (fluorosis – 67 per
cent, severe fluorosis – 21 per cent).

Skeletal fluorosis
Skeletal manifestations have been reported around Arusha (Grech, 1966; Mosha,
1984). Endemic fluorosis is a public health problem in some parts of the United

Republic of Tanzania, namely: Arusha, Moshi, Singida and Shinyanga regions.
According to Mosha (1984), it is particularly severe around Arusha situated in
the Rift Valley (on the foot hills of Mount Meru, which has approximately
135,000 inhabitants) and Moshi (on the foot hills of Mount Kilimanjaro).

Exposure and fluoride concentrations
In the African Rift System, fluoride-rich waters are associated with volcanic
activity. Due to high temperatures and high pH levels, surface waters (as well as
groundwater) contain high fluoride concentrations. The fluoride levels recorded
from some water sources in the United Republic of Tanzania are shown in Table
7.6. The majority of the Tanzanian population obtain their drinking-water from
lakes, rivers or springs (Mosha, 1984).
    Awadia et al. (2000) reported similar levels of dental fluorosis in two areas
with marked differences in fluoride drinking-water levels (0.2 mg l–1 and
3.6 mg l–1). It was suggested that the high level of fluorosis seen in the low fluo-
ride area may be at least partly explained by the use of high fluoride foods, such
as magadi, in weaning preparations.

Mitigation measures
The Nalgonda technique (as outlined in section 5.4) was first adopted for
defluoridation in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1974 (Mosha, 1984).


7.28 United States of America
Historically, dental fluorosis was quite widespread in the USA. Originally the
problem was termed “mottled enamel” or, local to Colorado Springs, as
                                       Country Data                                       117

“Colorado brown strain”. In 1930, the link was made between mottled enamel
and high levels of fluoride in drinking-water supplies (2.0–13.7 mg l–1) and the
term fluorosis was adopted (MMWR, 1999). A system for estimating the
severity of dental fluorosis (see Appendix) known as Deans Index was devel-
oped (Dean and Dixon, 1935; Dean and Elvove, 1939). Dean also conducted
extensive observational studies to assess the prevalence of fluorosis in the USA
(Dean, 1933). Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Virginia
were also reported to have areas with endemic fluorosis (Dean, 1933). These
studies also led to the realization of the link between low levels of fluoride and
high prevalence of caries (Dean, 1938, 1945), which culminated in the recom-
mendation that levels of fluoride in water be adjusted to between 0.7–1.2 mg l–1
(Public Health Service, 1962) and the adoption of widespread fluoridation.
    Driscoll et al. (1983) noted that more than 700 communities in the USA were
thought to have water supplies that contained at least twice the recommended
optimum level of fluoride (i.e. 2.4 mg l–1 and above). They found mean fluoride
concentrations in Illinois between 1.06 and 4.07 mg l–1. In a study in Texas
(Segreto et al., 1984), fluoride concentrations varied between 0.3 and 4.3 mg l–1.
At the highest fluoride concentration only 5.2 per cent of children were consid-
ered to have normal teeth or questionable mottling.

Appendix

Indices of severity of dental
fluorosis



The following are some examples of the more commonly used indices of dental
fluorosis.


Dean’s Index
After Dean et al. (1935)

1. Normal
2. Questionable
   A few white flecks to occasional white spots.
3. Very Mild
   Less than 25 per cent of the tooth surfaces covered by small white opaque
   areas.
4. Mild
   Fifty per cent of the tooth surfaces covered by white opaque areas.



 2006 World Health Organization (WHO). Fluoride in Drinking-water by J. Fawell, K. Bailey,
J. Chilton, E. Dahi, L. Fewtrell and Y. Magara. ISBN: 1900222965. Published by IWA
Publishing, London, UK.
126                         Fluoride in Drinking-water

5. Moderate
   Nearly all the tooth surfaces are involved, with minute pitting and brown or
   yellowish stains.
6. Severe
   Smoky white appearance of all the teeth with hypoplasia, chipping and large
   brown stains, which vary from chocolate brown to black. There is discreet
   and confluent pitting, often accompanied by attrition.


DDE (Developmental Defects of Enamel) Index
After Fédération Dentaire Internationale (1992)

A simplified version of this Index categorizes three broad types of defect: diffuse
opacities, demarcated opacities and hypoplasias.

Terminology used to describe enamel defects
After Holloway and Ellwood (1997)
1. Diffuse opacity
   Opacity with poorly defined boundary, which merges into the surrounding
   enamel.
2. Demarcated opacity
   Opacity with clearly defined boundary from adjacent enamel.
3. Hypomineralized enamel
   Incompletely mineralized enamel.
4. Developmental defects of enamel
   Disturbance in hard tissue matrices and their mineralization during
   odontogenesis.
5. Hypoplasia
   Quantitative defect in enamel, reduced thickness of enamel.
6. Opacity
   Qualitative defect in enamel, abnormality in translucency of enamel.


Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) Index
After Thylstrup and Fejerskov (1978)

Score 0
   Normal translucency of enamel remains after prolonged air-drying.
Score 1
   Narrow white lines located corresponding to the perikymata.
                                   Appendix                                 127

Score 2
   Smooth surfaces
   More pronounced lines of opacity which follow the perikymata. Occasional
   confluence of adjacent lines.
   Occlusal surfaces
   Scattered areas of opacity <2 mm in diameter and pronounced opacity of
   cuspal ridges.
Score 3
   Smooth surfaces
   Merging and irregular cloudy areas of opacity. Accentuated drawing of
   perikymata often visible between opacities.
   Occlusal surfaces
   Confluent areas of marked opacity. Worn areas appear almost normal but
   usually circumscribed by a rim of opaque enamel.
Score 4
   Smooth surfaces
   The entire surface exhibits marked opacity or appears chalky white. Parts of
   surface exposed to attrition appear less affected.
   Occlusal surface
   Entire surface exhibits marked opacity. Attrition is often pronounced shortly
   after eruption.
Score 5
   Smooth and occlusal surfaces
   Entire surface displays marked opacity with focal loss of outermost enamel
   (pits) <2 mm in diameter.
Score 6
   Smooth surfaces
   Pits are regularly arranged in horizontal bands <2 mm in vertical extension.
   Occlusal surfaces
   Confluent areas <3 mm in diameter exhibit loss of enamel. Marked attrition.
Score 7
   Smooth surfaces
   Loss of outermost enamel in irregular areas involving <½ of entire surface.
   Occlusal surfaces
   Changes in the morphology caused by merging pits and marked attrition.
Score 8
   Smooth and occlusal surfaces
   Loss of outermost enamel involving >½ of surface
Score 9
   Smooth and occlusal surfaces
   Loss of main part of enamel with change in anatomic appearance of surface.
   Cervical rim of almost unaffected enamel is often noted.
128                           Fluoride in Drinking-water

TSIF (Tooth Surface Index of Fluorosis)
After Horowitz et al. (1984)

Score 0
   Enamel shows no evidence of fluorosis.
Score 1
   Enamel shows definite evidence of fluorosis, namely areas with parch-
   ment-white colour that total less than one-third of the visible enamel surface.
   This category includes fluorosis confined only to incisal edges of anterior
   teeth and cusp tips of posterior teeth (“snowcapping”).
Score 2
   Parchment-white fluorosis totals at least one-thirds of the visible surface, but
   less than two-thirds.
Score 3
   Parchment-white fluorosis totals at least two-thirds of the visible surface.
Score 4
   Enamel shows staining in conjunction with any of the preceding levels of
   fluorosis. Staining is defined as an area of definite discolouration that may
   range from light to very dark brown.
Score 5
   Discrete pitting of the enamel exists, unaccompanied by evidence of staining
   of intact enamels. A pit is defined as a definite physical defect in the enamel
   surface with a rough floor that is surrounded by a wall of intact enamel. The
   pitted area is usually stained or differs in colour from the surrounding
   enamel.
Score 6
   Both discrete pitting and staining of the intact enamel exist.
Score 7
   Confluent pitting of the enamel surface exists. Large areas of enamel may be
   missing and the anatomy of the tooth may be altered. Dark-brown stain is
   usually present.
