XII Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The World Health Organization’s (WHO) water quality guidelines recommend a preventive, risk-based approach to
water quality management from source to exposure for the management of microbial hazards. Risk assessment
therefore plays a central role in implementing the guidelines through the development of water safety plans (WSPs)
and sanitation safety plans (SSPs). Several risk assessment approaches are available, ranging from risk scoring
in sanitary inspections and risk matrices to quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). Guidance is available
for sanitary inspections1 and for the use of risk matrices in WSPs2,3 and SSPs.4 However, although much academic
literature is available on QMRA, limited documentation exists to facilitate the consistent application of QMRA in the
practice of water supply, water reuse or water recreation.

The purpose of this document is therefore threefold:
1) to present a harmonized framework for the application of QMRA to evaluate risks associated with faecal
   pathogens for the drinking-water, wastewater and recreational water pathways;
2) to provide guidance on the interpretation of scientific data (pathogen concentrations in different water matrices,
   data on pathogen removal by different barriers under different conditions, data on exposure volumes and dose–
   response relationships) for application in QMRA; and
3) to provide guidance on how to set up and interpret the results of QMRA in order for it to be an effective support
   for water safety management.

The intended audience for this document is regulators, water supply and sanitation system engineers and
managers, as well as scientists working to ensure that water-related health risks are minimized in a particular
setting. The document serves to support an understanding of how QMRA works, the value of QMRA for water safety
management and considerations in applying QMRA. By capturing QMRA methods and application in one document,
the intention is to achieve crossover and understanding for readers from different backgrounds.

The four steps of the harmonized QMRA framework are:
1) problem formulation;
2) exposure assessment;
3) health effects assessment; and
4) risk characterization.

Each step of the QMRA is presented in detail within the document. Briefly, in problem formulation, the scope and
purpose of the risk assessment are carefully defined in consultation with risk managers. In order for the QMRA to
be useful, it is critical that there is a transparent dialogue between the risk manager and risk assessor throughout
the assessment process. This begins at the scoping, planning and problem formulation stage to ensure that the
risk assessment addresses the needs of the risk manager. It is essential that the assessment is defined in such a
way to ensure that the calculations (including uncertainty analysis) are targeted towards the objectives and needs
of the risk manager.

Relying on the scope defined during problem formulation, the exposure assessment is undertaken to quantify the
magnitude and frequency of exposure to reference pathogens via the defined exposure pathways and hazardous
events. The exposure assessment involves three steps. Firstly, the exposure pathway is defined in terms of
pathogen sources (the point of initial pathogen quantification), barriers or control measures, and mechanisms of
exposure. Secondly, each component of the exposure pathway is quantified based on the best available scientific
data and an understanding of the expected variability and uncertainty associated with the model variables (Chapter
6 and Annex C contain detailed discussion and resources to support this quantification). Thirdly and finally, the
magnitude and frequency of exposure are quantified for the range of defined scenarios.

Similarly relying on the scope defined during problem formulation, the health effects data are compiled for each
reference pathogen. This will include a dose–response relationship and any subsequent health outcomes, sequelae
or disease burden estimates. Appropriate selection of these values to represent the pathogen of interest and the
exposed population is important to the outcome of the risk assessment. More detailed discussion of these factors
and supporting information for dose–response is included in Chapter 7 and Annex D.

Finally, the exposure and health effects information is combined by calculating the risk for the defined conditions
and scenarios during risk characterization. The outcome of the risk characterization must feed directly back to
the risk management questions defined during problem formulation. Uncertainty analysis and/or sensitivity
analysis can be extremely valuable for testing the robustness of the risk calculations to support the risk
management decision.

In undertaking a QMRA, the following overarching principles need to be considered so that the QMRA is useful for
risk management:
• The QMRA is driven by the risk management need; the decision (and the required level of certainty for that
    decision) has driven the problem formulation.
• The QMRA is fit-for-purpose in terms of scope and level of detail.
• The QMRA is based on exposure scenarios consistent with the risk management options, local context and
    data constraints.
• Factors influencing variability associated with each component of the exposure are considered and documented.
• The data and information used to quantify exposure are the most appropriate for use and weighed against the
    information in the scientific literature.
• The representativeness of published dose–response models is evaluated.
• The QMRA is focused on the population exposed. As appropriate, it will give consideration to susceptible
    population subgroups and life stages.
• The quantities of risk calculated are driven by the problem and directly relate to the risk management decision.
• The influence of uncertainties on the outcome of the assessment is evaluated.

These principles, combined with documentation, model verification and review, can result in a transparent
assessment that enables peers, risk managers and other stakeholders to understand the basis for model
development, data selection and processing, and assumptions. This will help to increase confidence that the QMRA
approach taken is adequate for the risk management questions that it addresses and that the conclusions about
risk management options are credible.

Using this framework, QMRA can be of great value for water safety management at both the regulatory and site-
specific levels. Many examples of the application of QMRA for water safety management in different settings and
for different purposes are given in Chapter 9 and the case-studies in Annex A. Specific applications to support
WSPs and SSPs include determining whether microbial health-based targets are achieved, evaluating monitoring
requirements and establishing critical limits to support system planning and development, choosing between
potential interventions and cost–benefit analysis.

1           INTRODUCTION: THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR
            ADEQUATE RISK MANAGEMENT

1.1 Moving towards preventive, risk-based water safety management
According to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 842 000 diarrhoeal deaths in low- and
middle-income countries are caused by inadequate drinking-water, sanitation and handwashing practices (WHO,
2014a). Although this number represents a large drop in water, sanitation and hygiene–related diarrhoeal disease
in the last decade, the burden is still unnecessarily large. In addition, outbreaks of waterborne disease continue
to occur in both developed and developing countries, leading to loss of life and significant disease and economic
burden for individuals and communities (e.g. Craun et al., 2010; Collier et al., 2012).

These findings highlight the importance of ensuring the microbial safety of water and sanitation services. The
WHO water quality guidelines therefore emphasize that primary attention should be given to managing microbial
hazards in the water cycle. In controlling these, there has traditionally been great emphasis on the examination of
faecal indicator bacteria. At the turn of the millennium, it was increasingly recognized that this basis for the risk
management of microbial hazards was:
• too little – viruses and parasites are significant microbial hazards in water; their fate and transport in the
   environment and water treatment processes are very different from those of (faecal indicator) bacteria;
   and outbreaks of waterborne disease have occurred while the water complied with the guidelines for faecal
   indicator bacteria; and
• too late – by the time the faecal indicator bacteria examination highlighted a potential health problem, the
   exposure to the water had already occurred.

For these reasons, the WHO water quality guidelines recommend a preventive, risk-based approach to water
quality management, covering source to exposure. The risk-based approach was first adopted by WHO in 1999
as the Stockholm Framework. The framework provides a common conceptual approach to assessing water
quality hazards and managing associated risks (Fig. 1.1). Although it was developed for the control of waterborne
infectious diseases, it also serves as a basis for the control of toxic chemicals and other health hazards. This
framework involves a systematic assessment of risks, definition of health-based risk management objectives
and planning the appropriate risk management response (Fig. 1.1; see also Fewtrell & Bartram, 2001; WHO, in
preparation). The systematic risk assessment advocated in this framework provides an evidence base to guide
appropriate risk management decisions. The WHO water-related guidelines have been structured in line with the
Stockholm Framework.

The instruments to make the framework and guidelines operational are preventive risk management plans for
drinking-water, recreational water and sanitation. WHO has published step-by-step guidance documents for
developing and implementing water safety plans (WSPs) for piped water supply systems (Bartram et al., 2009) and
for water supply systems for small communities (WHO, 2012, 2014b), as well as for developing and implementing

1.2 Purpose of this document
Risk assessment plays a central role in the WHO water quality guidelines and in WSPs and SSPs. Several risk
assessment approaches are available, ranging from risk scoring in sanitary inspections through use of sanitary
inspection forms to risk matrices, which are often the risk assessment approach used in WSPs and SSPs, to
quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) (see Box 1.1). Guidance is available for sanitary inspections (WHO,
1997, 2014b) and for the use of risk matrices in WSPs (Bartram et al., 2009) and SSPs (WHO, 2015a). However,
although much academic literature is available on QMRA, limited documentation exists to facilitate the consistent
application of QMRA in the practice of water supply, water reuse or water recreation.

The purpose of the document is therefore threefold:
1) to present a harmonized framework for the application of QMRA to evaluate risks associated with faecal
   pathogens for the drinking-water, wastewater and recreational water pathways;
2) to provide guidance on the interpretation of scientific evidence (pathogen concentrations in different water
   matrices, data on pathogen removal by different barriers under different conditions, data on exposure volumes
   and dose–response relationships) for application in QMRA; and
3) to provide guidance on how to set up and interpret the results of QMRA in order for it to be an effective support
   for water safety management.

 Box 1.1 Epidemiology and risk assessment
 While risk scoring, risk matrices and QMRA are approaches that assess the potential risk to human health,
 epidemiology is the science that attempts to measure the actual distribution and determinants of health events.
 Epidemiology has particular value in estimating the population incidence of certain diseases and determining
 the proportion of such cases that are attributable to different exposures. As such, epidemiological studies can
 provide estimates of the actual disease burden due to various exposures, including disease associated with
 water exposures (see Blumental et al., 2001; Hunter et al., 2003). However, epidemiological studies are often
 expensive (requiring the recruitment of large numbers of participants) or time consuming (necessitating follow-
 up of study participants for months), or both. Therefore, although epidemiological studies provide an essential
 basis for understanding the actual health outcomes and burden of disease associated with water, such studies
 are often not applicable to individual local supplies and settings, because the population size is not big enough,
 because there are too few cases to give sufficient statistical power or because of the cost and effort needed to
 undertake them. In these contexts, QMRA and other risk assessment techniques are more feasible and may in
 fact be the only approach open to water supply managers to assess any risk to their consumers. Consequently,
 this document focuses on the complementary risk assessment approaches that are available for source-to-
 exposure water safety management.



1.3 Intended audience and reading guide
The intended audience is regulators, water supply and sanitation system engineers and managers, as well as
scientists working to ensure that water-related health risks are minimized in a particular setting. The document
serves to support an understanding of how QMRA works, the value of QMRA for water safety management and
considerations in applying QMRA. Readers who are primarily interested in understanding how QMRA fits within
the risk assessment spectrum, the basics of QMRA and learning how QMRA can support decision-making will find
this information mostly in Chapters 1, 2 and 9 and in the case-studies in Annex A. Readers who are interested in
gaining an in-depth understanding of the QMRA process and considerations for undertaking a QMRA (e.g. how
to work with microbiological data on pathogens, indicator organisms, barrier efficacy, dose–response data,
probabilistic models) will find this information in Chapters 3–8 and Annexes B–D. By capturing QMRA methods
and application in one document, the intention is to achieve crossover and understanding for readers from these
different backgrounds.


1.4 Structure of this document
Introduction (Chapter 1): In Chapter 1, the importance and key elements of preventive, risk-based water safety
management are described.

Spectrum of risk assessment approaches (Chapter 2): This chapter gives an overview of risk assessment
approaches that are in use in water safety management, how they provide an evidence base for risk management
decisions and their strengths and limitations.

Framework for water-related QMRA (Chapter 3): The four-step process (problem formulation, exposure
assessment, health effects assessment and risk characterization) is described to facilitate the harmonized
implementation of QMRA for drinking-water, wastewater and recreational exposures. Initial planning
considerations for conducting QMRA are highlighted, including team characteristics, tools required and how to
work in resource-limited settings. The principles of a QMRA that is relevant for risk management are given.

Variability and uncertainty (Chapter 4): The concepts of variability and uncertainty as they relate to the
quantification of waterborne infectious risks are introduced. Appropriate consideration of these factors is critical
to the overall implementation of the QMRA framework and to ensure that the risk assessment results are useful to
support decision-making.

Chapters 5–8 expand on the content of each of the four steps in the QMRA framework:
1) Problem formulation (Chapter 5): Including how to define the scope and purpose of the QMRA so that it will
   meet the objectives of the study and the needs of risk managers.
2) Exposure assessment (Chapter 6): The process of simplifying a complex environmental system into a defined
   exposure pathway that will meet the objectives of the risk assessment.

2           SPECTRUM OF RISK ASSESSMENT
            APPROACHES

In this chapter, the concept of risk assessment is explained, and the various approaches ranging from sanitary
inspection to QMRA are introduced.

Risk assessment is a key element of the Stockholm Framework and is used in all water-related WHO guidelines.
This chapter introduces the spectrum of risk assessment approaches that are in use in water safety management,
ranging from sanitary inspections to QMRA, in order to provide an overview of the application, information
requirements, strengths and limitations of each approach. All text and examples in this chapter are on drinking-
water systems to avoid repetition and to facilitate a more direct comparison of approaches. The basic principles
are also applicable to recreational water or water reuse.

For drinking-water systems, risk assessment is an integral part of developing and implementing WSPs. The
purpose of the risk assessment is to identify and evaluate the health risks associated with the water supply, to
determine if the health hazards are adequately controlled, to inform operation and management of the water
supply and to identify necessary improvements and upgrades to ensure the delivery of safe drinking-water. Health
hazards can be pathogenic microorganisms, chemicals or radioactive substances in concentrations that have an
adverse health impact. The process of risk assessment is a systematic evaluation of:
1) hazards – in this document, pathogenic microorganisms (pathogens) that may have an adverse impact on the
   health of the people who drink the water;
2) hazardous events – events that may introduce pathogens into the water supply or fail to remove them. These
   events may occur at every step of the water supply chain – for example, at the source (e.g. rain events that flush
   human or animal faecal waste into the water supply), in treatment (e.g. failures in filtration or disinfection), in
   the distribution network (e.g. improper repair work introducing microbial contamination) and in households (e.g.
   handling storage containers with dirty hands);
3) the adequacy of the controls to prevent contamination – control measures that are or could be put in place to
   prevent these hazards from occurring, to remove these hazards from the water supply system or to reduce
   these hazards to an acceptable level. These can be engineered controls, such as a water treatment process,
   as well as non-engineered measures, such as hygiene protocols for repair works on the water distribution
   network.


 Hazard: a biological (or physical, chemical, radiological) agent that can cause harm to public health.

 Hazardous event: an event that introduces a hazard into the water supply or fails to remove it.

 Risk: an assessment of the likelihood that a hazardous event occurs and the severity or consequence of
 the hazard.

There are potentially many hazards, many hazardous events and many control measures. The objective of risk
assessment is to identify those risks that are critical for the safety of a specific water supply system and to help
to select the best steps to improve the safety of the system. Hence, to help risk management focus on the needed
improvements that contribute most to water supply safety, risk assessment needs some form of classification or
quantification of the risks in terms of health impact.

The outcome of the risk assessment process is an evaluation of the safety of the water supply system, based on
an understanding of the hazards, hazardous events and validity of control measures in the water supply system
and their relative significance. Through the risk assessment process, the multidisciplinary team that is preparing
the WSP will understand the hazards and hazardous events that may have an impact on the water supply system
and the adequacy of the barriers and control measures that are in place. The risk assessment may show that
the system is safe and provide the justification for this conclusion, or the risk assessment process may highlight
shortcomings in the current water supply system design, operation or maintenance and support the prioritization
of these shortcomings according to their health risk and thus their priority for management. This provides the
evidence-based justification for an improvement plan for the water supply system, focusing on the priorities
highlighted by the risk assessment process. Risk assessment is therefore a decision support tool that provides
the risk manager with an objective and rational picture of what is known (or assumed, based on expert judgement)
about the risks associated with the water supply. It is imperative that risk assessment is quantified in some
manner; otherwise, the risk manager is faced with all possible risks without an indication of their significance.

A range of approaches to conduct a risk assessment is available:
• Sanitary inspection: An on-site visual evaluation of observable features and conditions at or in the vicinity of
   the water supply that may lead to an unsafe supply. Sanitary inspections are typically based on standardized
   forms/checklists to identify the most common issues that may lead to the introduction of hazards into a system.
   This approach has been developed and promoted as a simple and effective tool for small water supplies (WHO,
   1997) and, more recently, as part of WSPs for small supplies (WHO, 2012b, 2014b). At the local level, sanitary
   inspections will assist operators, as well as water and health officers, in the identification of the most important
   causes and pathways of contamination and control options to prevent or minimize contamination. The approach
   is also useful when applied more broadly to inform regional or national priorities for improving small supplies.
• Risk matrix: The risk assessment approach that makes a qualitative or semiquantitative evaluation of the
   likelihood that a hazardous event will occur and the severity or consequence of the hazard and combines them
   into a risk score or risk rating. The approach relies on expert judgement and can be undertaken at different
   levels of detail. It has been applied as a simple, common approach to evaluate the range of different (water
   quality–associated) risks in the WSP.
• QMRA: A formal, quantitative risk assessment approach that combines scientific knowledge about the presence
   and nature of pathogens, their potential fate and transport in the water cycle, the routes of exposure of humans
   and the health effects that may result from this exposure, as well as the effect of natural and engineered
   barriers and hygiene measures. All this knowledge is combined into a single assessment that allows evidence-
   based, proportionate, transparent and coherent management of the risk of waterborne infectious disease
   transmission. QMRA has developed as a scientific discipline over the last two decades and has been embedded
   in the WHO water-related guidelines (WHO, 2003, 2006a,b, in preparation).

All aforementioned risk assessment approaches are valid – their use is context specific and will depend on,
among others, human resources (personnel, skills, access to support institutions) and type of supply system
(small community-managed supplies versus larger utility-managed supplies). They represent a continuum from
more simple to more detailed and from more expert judgement to more evidence-based assessment of the risks
(Fig. 2.1). In general, risk assessments should be as simple as possible, finding the right balance between more
detail and evidence base and the use of assumptions and expert judgement. The right balance is the one that is
considered adequate to inform on risk management options. Where simplified risk assessments are sufficient to
aid risk management decisions, there is no need to undertake more complicated assessments. The approaches
and their strengths and limitations in supporting adequate water safety management are given in the following
overview of the scale of approaches for (microbial) risk assessment and the increased level of detail in input and
output of the different approaches.

2.1 Sanitary inspection
Sanitary inspection is a powerful and generally applicable tool for the risk assessment of water supply systems.
It is widely used in small water supply settings to support the identification and management of high-priority risk
factors. Sanitary inspections can also support WSP implementation, including the identification of hazardous
events and potential control measures. Results of sanitary inspections can inform more systematic risk
assessments that may be conducted within a WSP (e.g. the risk matrix).

Community and/or health and water officers with knowledge about water supply and health hazards visit the
water supply system and inspect the presence of observable contamination sources and conditions that may
lead to the introduction of hazards into the water system, the potential occurrence of hazardous events and how
these are controlled by control measures. Sanitary inspections are frequently used for point sources (e.g. wells,
springs), focusing on the close vicinity to the source and the integrity and conditions of abstraction or storage
infrastructures. Sanitary inspections can also cover storage tanks/service reservoirs and, to a limited extent,
distribution and treatment systems.

Sanitary inspections typically make use of standardized “sanitary inspection forms” containing a systematic
checklist of a limited number of specific questions. These checklists address the most basic and common factors
that may lead to contamination of the water system. Sanitary inspection forms for a range of small community and
private supplies can be found in Volume 3 of the second edition of the WHO GDWQ (WHO, 1997) and the WHO WSP
field guide for small communities (WHO, 2014b). An example of a checklist for a spring source is given in Box 2.1.

           Note. If there is more than one spring source in your community, or if the community uses other water
           sources (such as dug wells or boreholes), carry out sanitary inspections for these sources too.
           Note. If the spring serves a storage reservoir or directly feeds into a piped distribution system, also carry out
           sanitary inspections using the forms “Storage reservoirs” and/or “Public/yard taps and piped distribution”
           respectively.
           Note. If consumers store water in homes, also regularly inspect water storage and handling in homes using
           the sanitary inspection form “Collection and household containers”.

Sanitary inspection forms should be completed using a mixture of on-site inspection and interviewing of
community operators or members. These forms are generally structured in such a way that the questions can
be answered only by YES or NO. The YES answer indicates the presence of a risk factor, whereas the NO answer
indicates the absence of this factor. Each YES answer should trigger follow-up actions at the local level to address
the identified risk factors (e.g. by rehabilitation and/or putting in place additional control measures).

The checklists also provide a simple quantitative classification of the level of safety of the water supply system (e.g.
very high risk, high risk, medium risk and low risk), by counting the number of YES answers. Such a risk scoring
system is particularly useful when sanitary inspection forms are used more broadly – for example, as part of a
surveillance programme. It can help to determine the status of small water supply systems and inform regional
and national priorities. For instance, results can shed light on which systems are the most “risky” (e.g. based on
supply type or location) and which risk factors fail the most frequently (see Table 2.1).

It is valuable to complement the sanitary inspection with water quality monitoring for key microbial parameters
(Box 2.2). The combination of water quality assessment and sanitary inspection was suggested by Lloyd & Bartram
(1991), was recommended in Volume 3 of the second edition of the WHO GDWQ (WHO, 1997) and is embedded in the
current edition of the WHO GDWQ (WHO, in preparation).


 Box 2.2 Complementing sanitary inspection with microbial water quality monitoring
 Water quality monitoring can pick up contamination events due to risks that were not easily identified or were
 overlooked in a sanitary inspection, and, vice versa, sanitary inspection may identify contamination sources and
 pathways that are not picked up by monitoring. Further, where water quality monitoring results are available,
 these should feed into the sanitary inspection process. The consideration of sanitary inspection combined
 with microbiological monitoring provides a useful dialogue between water supply and water quality experts.
 Together, they confirm the validity of each other’s findings and support identification of the risk factors that
 are most likely to lead to health risks. In contrast, if limited resources are available to conduct water quality
 monitoring, sanitary inspection alone can provide valuable information to target management actions.

Sanitary inspections with microbiological monitoring can be used as a tool to evaluate individual water systems
and inform the local management about risks and controls and suggest improvements as well as to inform regional
or national priorities, to map the status of the water supply systems and inform regional or national authorities
about priorities for risk management (as shown in Table 2.2).

2.1.1    Strengths
Sanitary inspections are simple and require few resources. A sanitary inspection requires a qualified individual to
visit the water supply site and thoroughly review the local situation for conditions that may result in contamination.
Sanitary inspections are typically based on standardized forms or checklists with simple and clear questions
about the most important sources, conditions and deficiencies that may lead to hazards entering the water
system. They have been used successfully in many different countries to evaluate water supply systems for small
supplies. Sanitary inspections are a powerful on-site tool to enhance the knowledge about the water supply system
(technical, operations, local conditions and practices), identify potential sources and pathways of contamination
and thus point to required improvements and additional controls. When repeated, the sanitary inspection may
also identify changes in risk that occur over time and evaluate the impact of improvement policies. Results from
sanitary inspection forms are useful at an individual supply level as well as when applied as part of a surveillance
programme, to inform regional and national priorities. At the regional and national levels, sanitary inspection
scores can also be combined with microbial monitoring results, particularly faecal indicator bacteria, therefore
further informing regional and national priorities.


2.1.2    Limitations
Sanitary inspections rely on a limited number of specific questions and therefore do not capture all hazards and
hazardous events. In addition, a single sanitary inspection will not capture the variability in the conditions and
practices that occur over time. Time can be incorporated by interviewing community members and repeated
inspections. The risk factors in the recommended checklists are a necessary simplification and have been based
on expert judgement. Hence, it is important to modify sanitary inspection forms, including risk factors, to reflect
the local context. Similarly, the equal weight of the risk factors in the risk score is a simplification; therefore,
sanitary inspection form results cannot be used to prioritize risk factors.

Although sanitary inspection results can be combined with microbial water quality monitoring results, particularly
faecal indicator bacteria, limitations with the use of Escherichia coli or thermotolerant coliforms as indicators for
the potential presence of faecal pathogens limit the usefulness of this approach. Compared with enteric viruses
and parasitic protozoa, the faecal indicator bacteria are more sensitive to chlorine and survive for a shorter period
in the water environment; compared with enteric viruses, they are more readily removed by filtration processes
and soil passage. Accordingly, the presence of E. coli (or thermotolerant coliforms) is a better indicator of the
potential presence of enteric pathogens than the absence of E. coli is for the absence of enteric pathogens.


2.2 Risk matrix
The WSP guidance manual (Bartram et al. 2009) describes the four steps of the system assessment:
1) Describe the water supply system from catchment to consumer in sufficient detail to allow for steps 2–4.
2) Identify the hazards and hazardous events and assess the risks for each pair of hazard and hazardous event –
   that is, the likelihood of each hazardous event occurring and the severity of each corresponding hazard.
3) Determine and validate control measures, in terms of both long-term performance and potential failures, to
   evaluate how well hazards are under control, and reassess and prioritize the residual risks.
4) Develop, implement and maintain an improvement and upgrade plan for significant risks where control is
   absent or considered inadequate.

The risk assessment is conducted by the WSP team and is a systematic evaluation of the risk posed by each
(relevant) hazard and hazardous event, from catchment to consumer. To determine the magnitude of the risks and
to prioritize the risks, a risk matrix is recommended (Bartram et al., 2009), in which the likelihood of a hazardous
event occurring and the severity or consequence of the hazard are rated separately and subsequently combined
into an overall risk score (Fig. 2.2). In its most basic form, this can be a qualitative assessment based on expert
judgement ranking risks as, for example, significant, uncertain or insignificant (Bartram et al., 2009; WHO, 2012b).
A more extensive approach is a semiquantitative assessment in which a risk matrix is used to derive a final risk
score. The semiquantitative approach also relies on expert judgement and was developed as a simple, common
approach to evaluate the range of different (water quality–associated) risks in the WSP (Deere et al., 2001; Bartram
et al., 2009) and is used in many WSPs worldwide.

Fig. 2.2 Semiquantitative risk matrix (Bartram et al., 2009)

Table 2.3 gives some examples of the semiquantitative approach. Risk matrices can come with different levels of
complexity in terms of the number of categories for assessing the likelihood of a hazard event occurrence and the
severity of the hazard; 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 risk matrices are commonly used in practice. In using a risk matrix, clear
definitions for each of the likelihood and severity categories (e.g. likely, moderate) need to be drawn up and agreed
upon before undertaking the risk assessment. This should aid in consistency in the assessment for all parts of the
water supply system and over time. Similarly, definitions for what is meant by the risk categories (e.g. very high
and high) should be determined to clearly flag the urgency of required attention and to facilitate action.

There are many potential hazards and hazardous events, and this may make risk assessment a labour-intensive
exercise. However, many hazards and hazardous events are not unique for each water supply system. To
facilitate the risk assessment process, typical hazards and hazardous events and/or control measures have been
collected in checklists, databases and tools (e.g. Beuken et al., 2008; Ministry of Health, 2014). Some of these and
additional tools to support risk assessment are available on the WSPortal (www.wsportal.org), an International
Water Association (IWA)/WHO website on WSP resources. There are also some examples of capturing the
general knowledge on hazards and hazardous events in predefined severity scores to facilitate risk assessment,
particularly for small or private supplies (Scottish Executive, 2006; Environmental Protection Agency, 2010).

2.2.1    Strengths
The main strength of this risk assessment approach is that it is a simple matrix that can capture different types of
risk. The assessment would typically cover a more comprehensive set of hazards and hazardous events compared
with sanitary inspections, including existing and potential hazards and hazardous events. The risk scoring can be
used to prioritize remedial actions and to set alert or action levels. Like the sanitary inspections, risk scoring can
be harmonized by using databases, risk scoring tools and predefined risk scores that are available and, in some
countries, provided as guidelines or protocols by the regulator. Assigning risk scores requires expert judgement
that may be facilitated by the databases and tools. However, as for sanitary inspections, the use of risk matrices is
not a desktop exercise but requires the WSP team to collect and evaluate information about hazards and hazardous
events on site.


2.2.2    Limitations
WSP teams find that the risk matrix may lead to extensive discussions over the likelihood of hazardous events
and the severity of hazards. Sometimes it is difficult to apply a consistent method over the different hazards
and hazardous events throughout the water supply chain. In particular, theoretical risks of chronic exposure to
chemical hazards tend to be overrated in comparison with established acute risks of microbial hazards. Developing
and agreeing upon well-defined definitions in advance of the risk assessment should aid in consistency. Evaluating
the efficacy of control measures is not always easy, particularly controls in the catchment of source water for
piped or non-piped distribution systems. The team’s experience is usually dominated by nominal performance
of control measures, unless there is a recent or documented history of hazardous events. Assessment of the
frequency of infrequent hazardous events is therefore difficult. To obtain a robust risk assessment, it is important
that the risk assessment team is knowledgeable about the water system and about hazards and hazardous events
and incorporates the knowledge obtained at similar systems (i.e. via the checklists, databases, tools). Careful
consideration of water quality data adds to the robustness of the risk assessment (see Box 2.3).


 Box 2.3 Water quality monitoring to support the risk matrix
 Water quality monitoring may inform the risk assessment in the WSP. A surface water supply using ozonation
 as the main disinfection process monitored water flow, ozone dose, residual and water temperature. Based on
 these parameters, the expected log removal of bacteria such as E. coli was very high (>5 log). Within the WSP
 risk matrix, the efficacy of this control measure was judged to be high. However, re-evaluation of the weekly
 monitoring data of the influent and effluent of the ozone reactor showed occasional breakthrough of E. coli,
 indicating very low log removal. Careful inspection of the ozone reactor showed a short circuit in the hydraulics
 of the reactor, which meant that a fraction of the water received very little ozone. In response, baffles were
 installed to improve the hydraulics. The water quality data provided the evidence base for the validation of the
 performance of this control measure and allowed for a more reliable risk assessment.



2.3 QMRA
QMRA offers a systematic way to use scientific information to help support water safety management decisions on
a utility or regulatory level and prioritize remedial actions or research efforts (NRC, 2009). The numerical output of
QMRA addresses the risk management questions in finer detail and allows for more precise comparison between
risk management options compared with the qualitative or semiquantitative approaches introduced above. QMRA is
a framework or mechanism that allows for quantitative scientific data to be interpreted in the context of estimated
health outcomes in order to support water safety management (see Fig. 2.3).

QMRA is central in food safety management; the Codex Alimentarius Commission, established by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO, has used it as the basis for international food safety
standards and guidelines (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 1999). WHO has embedded QMRA in its water-related
guidelines. For water safety management, the use of QMRA was first proposed in the early 1990s (Regli et al.,
1991). Since then, QMRA has been used in different levels of detail for drinking-water, recreational water (outdoor
and in pools), reuse of domestic wastewater or excreta in agriculture and many other forms of human water use.
More detail will come with the expense of more time, more data and expertise; however, the outcome will result in
more detailed understanding of the risks and control measures.

support water safety management

QMRA is a formal four-step risk assessment process (Table 2.4), where each component of the assessment is
explicitly quantified. The process of QMRA is described in the following sections, and the framework is described in
detail in Chapter 3.

2.3.1     Problem formulation
In this step, the scope and purpose of the risk assessment are defined. This requires an interdisciplinary team to
reach a balanced, robust and defendable risk assessment outcome that can be used to make decisions. Questions
to be addressed by the team are: What risk management decision is required? What level of detail and what
evidence base are adequate to support this decision? Which hazards (pathogens) and health outcomes should be
considered? And which exposure pathways and hazardous events should be included? Depending on the scope
of the risk assessment, different levels or tiers of QMRA, from screening to in-depth, can be applied. There is
no sharp division between these tiers: they do not differ in nature, only in the level of data quantification and
mathematical sophistication and the time, expertise and data required. The need of the risk manager in terms of
level of detail and evidence base to inform risk management should determine the required level of sophistication.
QMRA is well suited for a tiered approach, starting with a screening-level QMRA to determine the urgency of the
perceived problem, to prioritize the risk of different water supply sites or scenarios and to determine the need
for a more detailed study for a particular situation. This allows the effective allocation of resources to the sites or
situations that give rise to the highest risk.


2.3.2     Exposure assessment
The aim of this step is to determine the frequency and magnitude of exposure to pathogens via the pathways and
hazardous events defined during the problem formulation. On the one hand, quantitative information is needed
– the pathogen concentrations in water sources used and fate of pathogens in barriers (e.g. water treatment
processes) during normal and incident situations. On the other hand, data are needed on the exposure of humans –
for example, 1) the size of the exposed population, 2) the nature of the exposed population (e.g. vulnerable groups)
and 3) how often they are exposed (e.g. daily).

includes the type of health effects (including sequelae, or the severe, secondary and/or chronic health effects that
occur following initial infection), the severity and duration of a disease or illness that may occur after ingestion of
the pathogen and available information on the relationship between ingested dose and the probability that health
effects (infection, illness, sequelae) occur (dose–response relationship). Also, the fraction and vulnerability of the
population exposed may need to be considered.


2.3.4    Risk characterization
This step combines the information from the previous steps into an assessment of the probability of occurrence
and severity of adverse health effects in the exposed population. This should be framed to address the risk
management question defined at the outset of the QMRA – for example, the relative risk of different risk
management scenarios or whether the water system meets a health-based target. Although calculated risks can
be compared against a health target, users of QMRA should keep in mind that QMRA does not calculate actual
disease outcomes, but provides a probability that disease may occur through the water system.

The time scale in which the risk is expressed may differ, from single-exposure events to all exposures in a year.
The risk may be quantified in different end-points, including the probability of infection, probability of illness,
expected number of illness cases and measures for burden of disease, such as disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) (see section 7.2). The DALY is the metric used in WHO guidelines for overall community health burden
(WHO, in preparation). DALYs have the advantage that they allow weighting to be given to illnesses that lead to more
serious health outcomes and comparison of different types of health risks.

It is important to include the variability (natural dispersion in a system, such as pathogen concentrations in a river)
and uncertainty (lack of understanding and/or inability to measure) in all steps of the risk characterization. Sources
of uncertainty in QMRA include extrapolation from dose–response data (although, unlike with toxic chemicals,
many dose–response data are from human exposure), limitations of pathogen detection methods and estimates
of exposure. To determine how the variability and uncertainty in the information at individual steps of the risk
assessment affect the overall risk estimate, sensitivity analysis can be used.

The risk characterization is either deterministic (meaning that single values such as means are used to describe
the variables used in the QMRA model) or probabilistic (meaning that statistical distributions are used to describe
variables used in the QMRA model). In a deterministic QMRA, estimates of each of the QMRA model variables
in the exposure and effects assessment are selected and combined to compute the resulting health risk. In a
probabilistic QMRA, statistical distributions are used to describe the model variables, which reflects the stochastic
(variable/uncertain) nature of most of the model variables more appropriately. The type of distribution selected
considers a combination of knowledge of (pathogens in) water systems and of statistics. The health risk is
computed by combining the statistical distributions, using Monte Carlo methods (Haas, Rose & Gerba, 2014). There
is a wide range of software tools available to support these calculations. Dedicated QMRA models and software
tools are increasingly available to aid this risk characterization step (Bassett et al., 2012). The need to conduct a
deterministic, screening-level QMRA or a probabilistic, in-depth QMRA is primarily determined by what is needed
to determine the best risk mitigation options. Chapter 9 provides more examples to illustrate how QMRA can
support water safety planning and serve risk management and to illustrate the process of QMRA at different levels
of detail.

An example of a (deterministic) QMRA to determine the safety of a surface water supply is given in Box 2.4.

Problem formulation
A drinking-water supply is producing drinking-water from a river, using conventional treatment (coagulation/
filtration) and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. This river flows through a number of large urban centres and
agricultural lands. Looking at the WHO GDWQ, the utility would like to demonstrate that the drinking-water
meets the health outcome target of 10−6 DALY per person per year (pppy). Given the human and animal faecal
sources in the catchment, the utility wants to include enteric bacteria, viruses and protozoa in the QMRA. It was
decided to focus on Campylobacter, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium as reference pathogens for demonstrating
that the target is being met. It was also decided to translate the 10−6 DALY into treatment performance targets,
following the approach in the WHO GDWQ (Table 7.4 in the WHO GDWQ).


Exposure assessment
The utility has no data on the selected reference pathogens Campylobacter, rotavirus or Cryptosporidium in source
water or on pathogen removal by the water treatment processes. Therefore, the utility made an effort to collate
data on the occurrence of these reference pathogens in water systems with similar source water (sewage-
impacted rivers with limited catchment protection) from the scientific literature. As there was uncertainty about
how to translate these literature data to the specific site, the 95th percentile of the literature data from these
source waters was selected as input for the QMRA. Limited data on rotavirus were found, so the utility used
culturable enterovirus data instead. Similarly, data on the removal of the reference pathogens by coagulation/
filtration processes and by UV were taken from scientific literature (review by Hijnen & Medema, 2010). For
coagulation/filtration, the mean removal deduced from all literature data was used; for the UV disinfection, the
local UV fluence setpoint (400 J/m2) was used to translate the literature data to the local system.

For the consumption of (cold) tap water, no local data were available, so 1 L per person per day was used (as
assumed in Table 7.4 of the WHO GDWQ).

 Risk characterization
 The risk management question was to evaluate whether the water supply system was capable of meeting the
 health outcome target of 10−6 DALY pppy. A deterministic QMRA was conducted, based on the data collected from
 the literature. The main uncertainty is the validity of the use of the literature data for this specific water system.
 This led to the selection of the 95th percentiles of the concentrations of the reference pathogens as input values
 for the risk characterization. The treatment performance target was computed from the difference between
 the pathogen concentration in source water and the water quality corresponding to the health outcome target
 of 10−6 DALY pppy (see also above). This was compared with the estimated treatment performance (extracted
 from literature data; Hijnen & Medema, 2010), showing that multiple barriers in the treatment were needed and
 together were capable of producing water that meets the 10−6 DALY pppy target.

2.3.5      Strengths
The main strength of QMRA is that it is an evidence-based, objective and transparent approach to provide, in
greater detail, the quantification and discernment between risks compared with the other risk assessment
approaches presented. QMRA supports system understanding: it considers all components in the water (supply)
system from source to water user, providing valuable information on the effects of each component on the risk
of human disease associated with exposure to waterborne pathogens (Medema et al., 2006; Ashbolt et al., 2010;
Bichai & Smeets, 2012; Payment, 2013; De Keuckelaere et al., 2015). Owing to the inherent uncertainties associated
with quantifying exposure, the greatest value of QMRA may not be in the final quantification of risk, but rather in
the exploration of system variables and risk drivers to support water safety management. The results provide
a scientific basis for evaluation of risk management priorities or control strategies. As such, QMRA can provide
justification for allocation of resources to risk control measures (Bichai & Smeets, 2012). Although other risk
assessment approaches can also provide justification for investments in improvements, QMRA can provide a
more precise justification, which may be particularly useful when significant investments are required. Further
QMRA enables the development of performance and specific technology targets, to determine whether or not
microbial health outcome targets can be met. QMRA has made it possible to evaluate the health risks associated
with waterborne pathogens in a broader context, such as risk trade-offs between pathogens and disinfection by-
products (Havelaar et al., 2000) or arsenic (Howard et al., 2006), and waterborne disease burden estimates from
QMRA are used in cost-of-illness estimates and cost–benefit evaluation of risk control strategies (see Case-study 4
in Annex A).

QMRA can be targeted towards specific risk management questions and be made “fit-for-purpose”, from screening-
level using point estimates to in-depth using probabilistic descriptions for the model inputs.

2.3.6   Limitations




                                                                                                                               Chapter 2
QMRA requires more technical knowledge and resources compared with the risk assessment approaches
presented previously. As noted above, the level of quantification, mathematical sophistication, time, expertise and
data required depend on the level of sophistication of the QMRA. Conducting a comprehensive probabilistic QMRA
requires the most resources in terms of data and specialized personnel. In practice, such comprehensive QMRAs
are conducted mainly in larger utilities in high-income countries where the public health agencies have promoted
the use of QMRA by providing guidance or even direct support (e.g. Anonymous, 2001, 2005; USDA/USEPA, 2012).

A key limitation of QMRA is the limited availability of data on pathogen occurrence, fate and transport and removal
by water treatment processes. Pathogen detection methods are becoming more widely available, but still require
a high level of expertise to produce data of a reliable quality. When data are absent, QMRA has to work with
assumptions. The use of default assumptions is well recognized in risk assessment (NRC, 2009). Where data are
absent and assumptions are used, the tendency is to use conservative or worst-case estimates, to “be on the safe
side”. But worst-case estimates, by nature, may overestimate the risk, and it is not clear to the risk manager what
the uncertainty of the calculated risk is – only that the uncertainty will be towards the lower-risk values (the nature
of a worst-case assumption). To help the risk manager in making well-informed decisions, it is useful to provide
a range of risks (interval estimate) that denote the variability and uncertainty in the risk estimate. This allows
the risk manager to understand the nature and level of uncertainty in the analysis and the factors that drive this
uncertainty. This helps the risk manager to decide whether the uncertainty is significant, or which uncertainties are
significant, for decision-making. In the case of the screening-level QMRA, this can be achieved by using an average,
worst and best case, to illustrate the range of the risks that can be deduced from the available information and the
level of certainty that is embedded in the QMRA. An example of such a QMRA can be found in Medema et al. (2009).
Alternatively, sensitivity analysis can determine the impact of variability and uncertainty in the variables on the
certainty of the overall risk estimate. The nominal range sensitivity analysis method (Frey & Patil, 2002) is relatively
robust; here, the value of each input variable in the QMRA model is varied, one at a time, along the confidence range
of that parameter (e.g. average and maximum concentrations of a pathogen in water) to determine the effect on the
final risk estimate. This procedure generates the range of possible values of the final risk estimate and indicates
which of the variables contribute most to the uncertainty of the final risk estimate.


2.4 Selecting the appropriate risk assessment approach
The risk assessment approaches described in this chapter represent a continuum from simple to detailed and from
expert judgement to evidence-based assessment of the risks (see Fig. 2.1). Table 2.5 summarizes the strengths,
weaknesses, resources and expertise requirements for each of these risk assessment approaches.

A number of factors should be considered when selecting the risk assessment approach. One key consideration is
to select the approach that provides information that is adequate for the risk manager as the basis for informed,
evidence-based risk management decisions or to design risk management policies. Another key factor is to select
the approach that fits in the context of human resources (personnel, skills, access to support institutions). Finally,
the type of information (knowledge of the water supply system, types of hazards and hazardous events, exposure
routes, water quality data on indicator organisms or pathogens, etc.) that is or can reasonably be expected to be
available should be considered.

This does not imply that QMRA is appropriate only in settings with microbial risk assessment experts and systems
with pathogen data. It is not the data that (should) drive the level of detail in the risk assessment; it is the level
of detail required by the risk manager to make evidence-based, proportionate decisions on risk management
measures or strategies. Risk management usually requires delicate trade-offs about the proportionate allocation
of resources or about the level of protection of water safety versus other societal demands – as in the case of
designating land use for riparian buffer zones to protect streams from agricultural runoff versus designating this
land for agricultural use; or in the case of energy input for UV disinfection systems versus energy-saving; or in the
case of chemical disinfection for pathogen control versus disinfection by-product formation.

that required a high level of detail and evidence base can be found in the cost–benefit assessment of a new
drinking-water regulation in the USA in Case-study 4 (see Annex A). Proportionate allocation of resources is also
the basis of risk management questions, such as: which of the more than 1000 water supplies in country X are
(most) at risk of faecal contamination, and thus where should priorities be placed for allocation of resources for
risk reduction? Answering such questions can be done through sanitary inspections when conducted as part of
surveillance as well as by QMRA (see the example from France in Case-study 3 in Annex A, with simple data from
a water supply system survey and from scientific literature), depending on the evidence base required by the
managing body and the availability of resources. More information about the interaction between risk manager
and risk assessor to select, conduct and use the appropriate risk assessment is given in Chapter 9, and the case-
studies in Annex A provide examples of how this has been applied in specific cases.

3            FRAMEWORK FOR
             WATER‑RELATED QMRA

In this chapter, the four-step harmonized framework for undertaking QMRA in the water-related context
is presented.

A range of different frameworks have been presented and applied for undertaking QMRA in water-related exposure
settings. The earliest studies relied primarily on the framework developed for chemical risk assessments (NRC,
1983); subsequent work was undertaken to develop a framework that was specifically suitable for microbial
risks (Soller, Eisenberg & Olivieri, 1999; Teunis & Havelaar, 1999; ILSI, 2000; USDA/USEPA, 2012). There are some
differences in terminology, order and detail of content; however, the essential activities and components are
equivalent. Different frameworks have been presented in each of the water-related guidelines (see Table 7.3 in
the GDWQ [WHO, in preparation]; Table 2.2 in the GWEG [WHO, 2006a,b]; and Table 4.4 in the GREC [WHO, 2003]
for comparison). Therefore, a single framework is now presented to harmonize across these guidelines. The four
essential activities, as presented in Chapter 2, are referred to here as problem formulation, exposure assessment,
health effects assessment and risk characterization (Fig. 3.1).

3.1 Problem formulation
The first step in any QMRA is to define the purpose and scope of the investigation. The purpose will depend on the
broader risk management context, the specific question that the QMRA is intended to address and the required
level of certainty for appropriate risk management (see Chapter 5). The scope of the QMRA is defined by the
identified hazards, exposure pathways and health outcomes to be considered:
• Hazard identification: It is not possible to consider all water-related human pathogens in a QMRA; therefore,
   reference pathogens are chosen that, if controlled, would ideally ensure control of all pathogens of concern.
   Reference pathogens should be selected taking into account local conditions, including relevance to the
   exposure pathway(s), source water characteristics and the incidence and severity of waterborne disease.
• Identify exposure pathways: The overall pathway from pathogen occurrence to human exposure is identified
   with a view to scoping the risk assessment and determining what will be included and excluded. Specific
   hazardous events (i.e. an incident or situation that can lead to the presence of the hazard) or scenarios that are
   to be included within the assessment in order to meet risk management objectives are identified.
• Identify health outcomes: The human health outcomes that are of interest are identified. Depending on the
   purpose of the assessment, the human health outcomes may include infection, illness, illness and sequelae, or
   a measure of disease burden that aggregates the impact of all of these outcomes (e.g. DALYs; see section 7.2).


3.2 Exposure assessment
The objective of the exposure assessment is to estimate the magnitude and frequency of exposure to pathogens via
the identified exposure pathways and during hazardous events defined in the problem formulation.

Exposure assessment involves the following steps:
• Define the exposure pathways identified during problem formulation in detail, including points of quantification
   of pathogen sources; reduction (or recontamination) across natural, engineered and regulatory control
   measures/barriers; and mechanisms of exposure, generally as a set of exposure scenarios. This approach
   (described in more detail in section 6.1) facilitates harmonization of data interpretation and statistical methods
   across drinking-water, recreational water and wastewater reuse pathways.
• Quantify each component of the exposure pathway using the best available scientific evidence and an
   understanding of the expected variability and uncertainty associated with each model variable. This is
   addressed in detail in section 6.2 and Annex C.
• Characterize the exposure by quantifying the magnitude and frequency of exposure for the range of scenarios
   to be considered in the QMRA.


3.3 Health effects assessment
In the health effects assessment, the health impact data for the identified hazards and the specific study population
are compiled. Special consideration may need to be given to vulnerable portions of the population (children,
pregnant mothers, elderly and otherwise immunocompromised individuals) and to the fraction of exposed people
in the total population. Depending on the health outcomes required for the assessment (identified during the
problem formulation), the following components may need to be considered:
• Dose–response: Application of a dose–response model is the critical link between pathogen exposure and
    estimated health outcomes (either infection or illness). A model needs to be selected from the published
    literature that will be appropriate for the particular study. A review of relevant factors is included in section 6.1
    and Annex D.
• Probability of illness: Not all infected individuals will develop symptoms. When using an infection-based dose–
    response model, it may be necessary to estimate the probability of illness once infected.
• Probability of sequelae: Sequelae are severe, secondary and/or chronic health effects that may occur
    following initial infection. Quantifying total disease burden involves giving consideration to the likelihood and
    consequences of these more severe health outcomes for the given population.
• Disease burden: The DALY is the metric used in WHO guidelines for overall community health burden. For
    water-associated diseases, it incorporates the total impact of all health outcomes listed above on the exposed
    population. The advantage of using DALYs is that it allows the consideration of different impacts on both the
    quantity and quality of life. It has been adopted for both the drinking-water and wastewater guidelines as the
    measure of setting health-based treatment targets. To learn more about health-based targets including DALYs,

  the reader should refer to the WHO guidelines for drinking-water (WHO, in preparation), recreational water
  (WHO, 2003) and wastewater (WHO, 2006a,b), the WHO estimates of the global burden of foodborne disease
  (WHO, 2015b) and section 7.2.
• Secondary transmission and immunity: Secondary transmission (additional cases in the community due to
  person-to-person contact) and immunity (inability of an individual to become infected due to protection via his
  or her immune system) are important for the overall evaluation of the health impacts. These factors can be




                                                                                                                            Chapter 3
  assessed within QMRA using what are called dynamic risk models.


3.4 Risk characterization
The exposure and health effects assessments are combined and calculations undertaken in order to quantify and
characterize the risk. The content of the risk characterization is driven by:
• The purpose of the risk assessment as defined during problem formulation: The purpose will drive what
   model conditions are simulated and run for the calculations. In a very simplistic model, this may require only a
   linear quantification of risk. In a more complex model, specific scenarios and conditions need to be selected for
   the calculations in order to meet the purpose of the assessment.
• Quantitative measures of risk: The risk may be quantified in many different metrics from the information
   collected during the exposure and health effects assessments, including the probability of infection, probability
   of illness, expected number of illness cases and DALYs. The time scale of risk may be for a single exposure, a
   series of independent exposures or a year. The population may be the total population or the exposed fraction of
   the population.
• Variability and uncertainty (see Chapter 4): Depending on the scope of the risk assessment, the risk may
   be characterized by a single point estimate, such as the mean, minimum or worst case, or by a probability
   distribution (distribution that takes into consideration the range of likely values and the probability of each of
   those values occurring). When uncertainty (lack of knowledge) and variability (how a value or attribute varies)
   have been explicitly quantified for the model inputs, the risk characterization will involve quantifying the
   distribution of risk. See Chapter 4 for a description of variability and uncertainty concepts and Annex B for an
   example demonstrating the incorporation of variability and uncertainty within QMRA.
• Sensitivity analysis (see Chapter 8): Sensitivity analysis (the investigation of how variability and uncertainty
   in the input parameters influence the variability and uncertainty in the risk output) can be used to explore how
   the model components or variables, such as pathogen concentrations, efficacy of intervention measures, dose–
   response parameters, morbidity ratio, etc., interact and which is most important to the outcome. In particular,
   sensitivity analysis allows the most important sources of variability and uncertainty to be identified, which can
   be used to target where management should focus control measures and additional data collection. A more
   detailed description of sensitivity analysis is given in Chapter 8.

4           VARIABILITY AND
            UNCERTAINTY

Before presenting the individual steps of the QMRA in Chapters 5–8, this chapter describes how variability and
uncertainty can be incorporated into QMRA.

Variability refers to how system elements change over time and space. Additional data collection does not reduce
variability, but can better characterize how elements vary. Uncertainty refers to a lack of knowledge regarding
system elements and, ultimately, risk. Uncertainty forces the risk manager to judge how probable it is that the risks
are overestimated or underestimated and select an appropriate degree of conservatism.

Variability and uncertainty are common elements of all types of risk assessment. An understanding of the impact
of variability and uncertainty in the input parameters on the risk output of the QMRA allows the evidence to be
weighed when designing an appropriate risk management response to the health risk.


4.1 Variability
QMRA models describe natural systems, environmental processes and their interactions with respect to pathogens
from source to exposed people. Each component of the exposure assessment and health effects assessment is
likely to vary both spatially (between locations, individuals or pathogens) and temporally (over time), leading to
variability in the risk to human health. The risk will therefore vary between sites (e.g. bathing may be considered
safe in one context, but unsafe in another), over time (for any given exposure pathway and context, risks will
fluctuate; over the long term – from seasonal fluctuations to climate change trends – and the short term,
particularly in response to specific events such as rainfall or engineering events such as treatment failure/poorer
performance) and between individuals (different subsets of the population may be exposed to different levels of
risk and may show different levels of sensitivity to the pathogens). Examples of common sources of variability in
the context of water safety management are:
• Pathogen concentrations in source water: Pathogen concentration in surface water and groundwater will vary
    between and within sites depending on many factors, including the catchment size, geohydrological conditions,
    topography, climate, land use and the associated faecal sources upstream of the sampling location, and the
    presence of (engineered and non-engineered) interventions to reduce discharge of pathogens to surface water
    and groundwater. For a single site, the concentration will vary over time, depending on the incidence of infection
    in faecal sources, excretion dynamics and quantity (volume/mass); environmental events (e.g. rainfall-induced
    runoff or infiltration) that mobilize pathogens; and environmental conditions (including temperature, sunlight
    and biotic [predator] activity).
• Pathogen concentrations in treated sewage effluent: Pathogen concentration in treated sewage effluent
    will vary between and within sites, depending on the size of the population contributing to the effluent, the
    dilution, the prevalence of infection in that population and the performance of the specific treatment barriers in




                                                                                            Variability and uncertainty   25
     place. For a single site, the concentration will vary over time, depending on the incidence of infection (at times
     seasonal) and fluctuations in hydraulic loading and treatment performance.
•    Performance of engineered treatment barriers: The performance of engineered treatment barriers will vary
     between sites and over time, depending on many factors, including inflow water quality, quantity and variability,
     chemical dosing, specific process design characteristics and operation/management decisions, and within sites,
     as a result of local fluctuations and process events.
•    Performance of natural treatment barriers: The performance of natural treatment barriers will vary between
     sites, owing to the unique local environmental conditions, and within sites over time, as a result of seasonal
     changes and response to specific events such as rainfall or snowmelt.
•    Exposure volumes and frequencies: Exposure volumes and frequencies will vary between and within
     individuals, depending on climate, age, lifestyle and cultural factors, and within sites over time, as a result of
     seasonal changes and participation in exposure activities.
•    Dose–response: Infectivity will vary between and within individuals, depending on immune status, age and
     health factors, and between and within pathogens, owing to differences in strain virulence and exposure
     pathways, the physiological state of the pathogen and other pathogen-specific parameters (e.g. extent of
     microbe aggregation).

These sources of variability lead to variability in health risk. Waterborne outbreaks have occurred because of
the peaks in pathogen concentrations in water systems (Risebro et al., 2007), with the Milwaukee outbreak of
Cryptosporidium as a notorious example (MacKenzie et al., 1994). Variability therefore needs to be considered in the
risk assessment. Section 4.3 explains how variability can be incorporated into QMRA.


4.2 Uncertainty
Uncertainty is inherent in all types of risk assessment (Morgan & Henrion, 1990). Quantifying each of the model
inputs is a challenge, as knowledge about the system is generally imperfect, and sometimes knowledge about
model inputs is limited or absent. The validity of the risk assessment relies on how well each selected value
(or distribution) represents the true value (or distribution) of each of the model variables. In general, the more
information that is available and the more data that are collected, the lower the uncertainty.

Building QMRA models involves subjective choices and assumptions to fill in the gaps of limited data sets. For
this subjective selection of information and assumptions, expert opinion plays an important role in selecting the
best available information and in interpreting potential risk (management) implications. For the risk manager, it
is critical to be able to evaluate the uncertainty associated with these assumptions, even when they cannot be
easily quantified. A precautionary approach to risk management generally drives the selection of conservative or
worst-case model assumptions. It is important that the level of safety and protection required by risk managers
be considered in the problem formulation stage and that the impact of such selections on the risk calculations be
assessed during risk characterization. Transparent evaluation can ensure that assumptions are appropriate to the
purpose of the QMRA and not unreasonably conservative.

Some common uncertainty considerations that arise in water-related QMRA studies include:
• Uncertainty due to absence of specific information: In many instances, data for one or more of the steps in the
  QMRA from the water system under study are missing or inadequate. It is quite common in QMRA to use general
  information (e.g. from national statistics or international literature on microbial data) or data from similar
  systems to fill this gap. Although this allows the risk assessor to perform studies in data-limited situations, it
  comes with potentially greater uncertainty about the validity of the information for the system under study and
  about how representative the data are for the specific study site. Given this uncertainty, conservative values
  are often selected. For example, the 95th percentiles of national and international pathogen concentrations in
  domestic wastewater are used as the basis for QMRA for wastewater reuse in the Australian guidelines for
  water recycling (NWQMS, 2006).
• Uncertainty regarding the representativeness of experimental data: The risk assessor may often have reason
  to question whether the local data are representative. For example, the analyst may have a small data set of
  pathogen counts from the water system of interest, which consists of a series of “non-detects”. Owing to some
  prior experience or knowledge (e.g. the range of pathogen densities expected given catchment sources or data
  on the variability in water quality obtained from microbial indicators), the analyst may question whether the data
  set truly reflects the underlying pathogen concentrations. Alternatively, where microbial surrogates are used to
  describe barrier efficacy, the analyst must question how well the surrogate data are expected to represent the

  pathogen concentration and behaviour for the specific system. The decision to rely on these data, or to rely on
  alternative data, must be justified, and any limitations explicitly defined.
  Consideration of this uncertainty is relevant for understanding what the risk estimates represent. At the same
  time, it helps in the verification of the QMRA by evaluating the (strength of the) information against the available
  scientific knowledge. Ignoring all prior knowledge from literature studies, other data sets or epidemiological
  experience in favour of local data alone is irrational, particularly if the local data set was extremely small or
  from an unknown source. The data themselves are subject to many uncertainties, including influences from
  random sampling, method recovery and the fraction of detected pathogens that may still be human infectious
  (see Annex C). It is therefore desirable to be able to use small local data sets, but then also to consider and
  preferably test the importance of any perceived inadequacies.
• Uncertainty regarding selection of statistical distribution: Probabilistic QMRAs rely on statistical distributions
  to describe model variables; however, microbial data sets are rarely large enough to demonstrate the full




                                                                                                                               Chapter 4
  range of variability. The basis for the selection of statistical distributions (such as the Poisson or lognormal
  distribution) in a probabilistic QMRA should be well understood and explicitly stated. A range of distributions
  may often provide a similar fit. Although the risk assessor may believe that the selected distribution is the
  most appropriate choice given the available data and understanding of the system, there may be equally valid
  alternative choices. In such circumstances, it would be reasonable to undertake the QMRA with each alternative
  distribution so that the influence on the outcome could be assessed. If distribution choice proves to be important
  to the risk outcome, further data collection to understand which distribution is likely to be more representative
  would be justified.

The sources of uncertainty for water-related QMRA can be classified into two categories: model assumption
uncertainty and parametric uncertainty:
• Model assumption uncertainty: In constructing or selecting, adapting and applying an existing QMRA model, it
   is necessary to make simplifying assumptions about the study system. Simplifications may include the selection
   of parametric distributions to describe variability (e.g. the normal distribution defined by the parameters mean
   [µ] and standard deviation [σ]; or gamma distribution defined by scale [λ] and shape [ρ] parameters), barrier
   reduction models (e.g. where the reduction in microbial concentration across a barrier is defined by a single
   log10 reduction or a distribution of log10 reductions; and where the total log10 reduction of a treatment train is
   assumed to be the sum of the log10 of the individual components, where a conservative log10 reduction credit for
   each barrier is selected; see section 6.2.2.3) and dose–response models (e.g. for single-hit models, where the
   probability of an individual microorganism passing all host defences and achieving infection is represented by
   a parameter r). These types of model simplifications and assumptions are necessary, but there is always some
   uncertainty as to how well these models represent the reality of the environmental system.
• Parametric or statistical uncertainty: Once a model is selected, the parameter values are estimated from,
   or fitted to, observational data. Three aspects of the data will influence the uncertainty in the estimated
   parameter values:
   1) Sample size: The number of observations. In general, as the size of the data set increases, the uncertainty in
       the parameter values will decrease.
   2) Measurement uncertainty: Variables that are modelled in QMRA are often difficult to measure and may be
       estimated or inferred rather than directly measured (e.g. interpretation of pathogen data discussed in
       sections C1 and C2 in Annex C).
   3) Data representativeness: The data set will describe only the specific conditions at the time the observations
       were made. It is important to consider how well the data set represents the conditions of the risk
       assessment – for example, considering whether the data set has samples collected under similar conditions
       (e.g. flow, season and climate); whether the sample was random, event driven or directed; and whether the
       sample is representative of the likely exposure pathway under consideration.

Table 4.1 includes a summary of these categories of uncertainty and some examples of the type of factors that
would be identified through a structured consideration of each category.

4.3 Accounting for variability and uncertainty in QMRA
The selected method of accounting for variability and uncertainty in QMRA is a strong driver of the mathematical
complexity of the study. The more factors that are explicitly and quantitatively accounted for, the more detailed
the analysis. Variability and uncertainty can be accounted for within QMRA using point values (deterministic) or
distributions (stochastic). As these different inputs are combined, they will have an impact on the way the risk is
characterized and on what is represented by those risk estimates.

The overriding principle associated with the incorporation of variability and uncertainty in QMRA is to adopt a tiered
approach. The tiered approach to system assessment is illustrated in Fig. 4.1. The level of detail in the analysis
should be as simple as possible, while achieving the objective of the QMRA defined in problem formulation. The
initial screening-level assessment will typically involve point estimates of each input variable at their most likely,
best-case or worst-case value. The limits of the risk outcomes will then inform whether further analysis is needed.




                                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 4
For example, if all input variables are set equal to their worst-case values and the risk is still quantified to be
acceptable relative to the target, then it is reasonable to assume that the pathway is safe and there is no need for
further analysis. If all input variables are at their expected values and the risk is deemed to be very high, then
management action is clearly necessary. Alternatively, if the point value analysis yields a result close to the target,
then a tier 2 analysis is justified to explore in more detail the variability in risk. This is illustrated with a detailed
numerical example in Fig. 4.2. See section 9.2.2 for additional information.

30   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
An illustrative example showing the stepwise incorporation of variability and uncertainty in QMRA is given in Annex
B. There are many ways to account for variability within a risk assessment, but they are simplified here into two
generalized approaches:
1) Point estimates (deterministic): Statistical descriptors of input variables, such as the arithmetic mean, 5th and
    95th percentiles, and minimum and maximum observed values, can be used to explicitly account for variability
    (see Annex B, Part A). Scenario analysis can also be used, where the full range of variability in each of the
    model inputs is broken down to a set of defined conditions, each represented by a point value (Annex B, Part C).
    The risk can then be calculated for each set of conditions and used to provide an overall picture of the range of
    expected risks.
2) Distribution (stochastic): The full distribution of variability in the risk estimates can be quantified by describing
    each model input using a probability density function (PDF) (Annex B, Part D; Annex C, Box C.2). During risk
    characterization, the full probability distribution of risk is then quantified either theoretically or by simulation




                                                                                                                                   Chapter 4
    using Monte Carlo analysis (Annex C, Box C.2).

In the same way, uncertainty within a risk assessment can be described in many ways, which are simplified here
into two generalized approaches:
1) Point estimates (deterministic): Uncertainty can be explored using point estimates for concentration of
    microbes and making assumptions about the available data. For example, what if the peak source water
    concentration was 10 times higher than what was measured? Or what if a different data analysis model were
    to be applied to the same system? Such exploration of the data and consideration of data uncertainty provide
    valuable insight to better understand the estimate of overall risk.
2) Distribution (stochastic): In addition to describing variability in model inputs, probability distributions can also
    be used to describe the uncertainty in model parameters (Annex B, Part E). The overall risk estimates and
    associated uncertainty can then be calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation (referred to as “second-order
    Monte Carlo”, as parameters are randomly sampled first, followed by the model variable).

Although variability assessment and uncertainty assessment are undertaken during risk characterization, it is
essential to note that they need to be considered for each of the model inputs. All scientific data and associated
inferences carry different sources of uncertainty. Understanding the nature of these variabilities and uncertainties
is important for the interpretation of calculated measures of risk. A particular emphasis is placed on these factors
in Chapters 6 and 7.

In practice, there is great diversity in published studies regarding which sources of variability and uncertainty
are considered and how they are accounted for in water-related QMRA. Even within a given study, the extent to
which variability and uncertainty are accounted for is often not consistent throughout the model. For example,
variability in source water concentration may have been considered, but not variability in treatment or each barrier
in treatment. Also, the assessor may have considered parameter uncertainty for dose–response but not for source
water pathogen distribution. Any calculations are a factor of the input assumptions, and the uncertainty and
variability in the calculated risk (and any associated sensitivity analysis) are representative only of those factors
that were defined in the inputs. Although it is not possible (or necessarily beneficial) to quantitatively account for all
sources of variability and uncertainty in the QMRA, and sometimes it is not easy to distinguish them, it is important
to consider those factors that are relevant to the objective of the study.

             FORMULATION

In problem formulation, the overall context of the risk assessment is defined and constrained in order to
successfully target the specific risk management question that must be addressed.


5.1 Interaction between risk manager and risk assessor
The first principle to keep in mind is that in order for the QMRA to be useful, it is critical that there is a transparent
dialogue between the risk manager and the risk assessor throughout the assessment process. This begins with
scoping and planning during the problem formulation stage to ensure that the risk assessment addresses the
needs of the risk manager. In this interaction, it is important to acknowledge that there is a clear distinction
between the role of the risk assessor and the role of the risk manager. The outcome of the risk assessment
process should in no way be influenced by the preference of the risk manager. The important elements of the
planning and scoping phase are presented in Box 5.1 as a series of questions to be pursued. Increased emphasis
on planning and scoping has been shown to lead to risk assessments that are more useful and better accepted by
decision-makers (USEPA, 2003, 2004). In the problem formulation phase, the scope is translated into a conceptual
model and analysis plan. Technical limitations, such as limited availability of data and the need for assumptions
and for process simplifications, will arise in this phase. It is important for the risk manager to be involved in
this scoping phase to check the plan and perceived outcomes against the risk management needs. Also, during
the process of the QMRA, as the information develops, the analysis plan may evolve. Therefore, communication
between the risk assessor and the risk manager remains important to ensure that the utility for risk management
“remains the major impetus” (NRC, 2009).


 Box 5.1 Questions to help scope and plan a useful QMRA

     a. What is the problem to be investigated, and what is its source?
     b. What are the possible opportunities for managing risks associated with the problem? Has a full array of
        possible options been considered, including legislative requirements?
     c. What types of risk assessments and other technical and cost assessments are necessary to evaluate
        existing conditions, and how do the various risk management options alter the conditions?
     d. What impacts other than health threats will be considered?
     e. How can the assessments be used to support decisions?
     f. What is the required time frame for completion of the assessments?
     g. What resources are needed to undertake the assessments?

5.2 Fit-for-purpose
An essential consideration at the initial stage is the required level of complexity needed to support the intended
risk management outcome. Will a screening-level, deterministic risk assessment generate adequate information,
or will a probabilistic risk assessment provide the information needed to support the risk management decision?
It may be that an initial screening-level risk assessment is done to highlight a problem or eliminate a concern
or that the screening-level risk assessment is a first crude test of the level of risk. The requirements of the risk
manager may suggest the use of worst-case scenarios or more plausible upper bounds or representative central
estimates, or perhaps even several of these, to gain an understanding of the effect on the uncertainty of the final
risk estimate. If such a screening-level risk assessment indicates a low risk, even in the worst-case estimate,
steps to further mitigate the risk are not justified (see Fig. 4.1 in Chapter 4). Often screening begins with worst-
case estimates and then moves to increasingly more realistic point estimates as warranted. Conversely, if the risk
estimate is unacceptably high, immediate remedial actions are appropriate, especially if the costs of these actions
are low (Cullen & Small, 2004). However, in many cases, the costs of actions are substantial and the risk estimate
is based on assumptions of which the validity is uncertain. This calls for more advanced information collection and
risk assessment to support adequate decision-making. An in-depth QMRA requires further information collection
and incorporation of the variability and uncertainty of the information into a comprehensive QMRA model. Using
such a probabilistic approach allows a good understanding of the drivers of the risk and the most significant
contributors to the overall variance in the risk estimate. This helps to weigh the feasibility and costs of collecting
further information against the feasibility and costs of interventions. Table 5.1 gives the general characteristics of
the different levels of QMRA. This may suggest a clear distinction between different levels of QMRA, but in practice
it is a continuum, as represented by Fig. 4.1.

34   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
The usefulness of pursuing a more sophisticated QMRA depends on several factors. Reasons for not conducting
further QMRA modelling include the following (Cullen & Small, 2004):
• immediate action is needed in response to an immediate concern;
• the results of the screening-level QMRA indicated that the risk is insignificant;
• the cost of assessment is higher than the costs of remediation; and
• the estimates/assumptions are highly uncertain, and more sophisticated analyses could further compound
   errors and incorrect results.

In contrast, reasons for conducting further QMRA modelling include the following (Cullen & Small, 2004):
• to avoid costs of remedial actions or other consequences based on poor or biased estimates;
• to increase objectivity and reduce dependency on assumptions;
• to support more sensitive cost–benefit analysis;
• to allow more rigorous comparison of alternatives;
• to provide a systematic consideration of all sources of variation and uncertainty; and
• to conduct sensitivity analysis and determine the validity of the outputs.

5.3 Including risk management options in the QMRA
A useful approach to facilitate the use of QMRA to guide decision-making is to include several alternative risk
management options in the risk assessment and evaluate their impact on the estimated risk. The risk manager
could specify these different options in the scoping and planning phase of the risk assessment. These could
be alternatives within a specific risk management option, such as different levels of dosing (e.g. chlorine or UV
fluence) in a water disinfection process. They could also be a comparison of different risk management scenarios,
such as comparing the impact of wastewater treatment options with different irrigation systems and various
withholding periods for irrigated crops. Given the current state of the art and knowledge, QMRA is particularly
applicable for scenario evaluation and relative risk assessments. After evaluating the various options to reduce
risk, the risk manager can select the preferred option. The value of this approach is demonstrated in Case-study 2
in Annex A (Weir et al., 2011). Pathogen risks can then be weighed alongside other important economic, social and
cultural factors to support an overall cost–benefit analysis for selection of the best option.


5.4 Defining the scope of the QMRA

5.4.1   Hazard identification
Hazard identification is predominantly a qualitative process intended to identify microorganisms of concern (FAO/
WHO, 2003). It is not possible to consider all human enteric pathogens in a QMRA; therefore, reference pathogens
are chosen that are of particular relevance to the exposure pathways and context of the individual risk assessment.
Reference pathogens are intended to provide a conservative model for the risk assessment: that is, if the reference
pathogen is controlled, it is assumed that other important pathogens within each class would also be controlled.
When considering human enteric pathogens, at least one bacterium, one virus and one protozoan are typically
recommended in order to cover the range of behaviours in the main enteric pathogen groups. Inclusion of a
representative helminth (e.g. Ascaris) is recommended for wastewater reuse and sanitation–based scenarios.
Specific studies may require more detailed consideration of variability between pathogens within a particular
group, in which case more than one reference organism should be selected (e.g. it may be relevant to model the
highly chlorine-resistant oocysts from the parasitic protozoan Cryptosporidium alongside the less resistant but
more numerous Giardia cysts in freshly contaminated waters). Both the GDWQ (WHO, in preparation) and the GWEG
(WHO, 2006b) rely primarily on rotavirus, Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium as reference pathogens. However, the
guidelines recommend that local considerations need to be accounted for, including the following:
• Epidemiological information on disease prevalence and outbreaks via the local water pathway(s): Which
   organisms are of most relevance for the population that is exposed? In many situations, the specific microbial
   agents responsible for disease may be unknown; however, it is reasonable (for the purpose of selecting
   appropriate reference pathogens) to infer the predominant etiological agent from disease symptoms.
• Scientific evidence on pathogen persistence and infectivity: which organisms are likely to be the biggest threat
   for the particular exposure pathway?




                                                                                              Problem formulation   35
• Severity of disease outcomes: Which organisms are likely to be the most significant in contributing to overall
  disease burden?

Characteristics of reference pathogens commonly used in QMRA are summarized in Table 5.2. The availability
of dose–response and disease burden data may also be a reason for the selection of the reference pathogens.
In studies where no specific dose–response data were available for the selected reference pathogen, the
conservative assumption has been to apply the dose–response data for the most infectious representative of the
pathogen group (e.g. to use the dose–response data from rotavirus to describe the infectivity of enteroviruses, as is
done in the Dutch Drinking Water Act in the Netherlands; see Box 9.1 in Chapter 9).


5.4.2    Exposure pathways
The overall exposure pathway is identified systematically from source to exposure, including pathogen sources,
environmental fate and transport barriers, environmental or engineered barriers, and human activities that may
lead to different levels of exposure. In settings where raw sewage and raw faecal waste are still widely prevalent,
they should be addressed as pathogen sources. It is important to include any potential hazardous events or
scenarios that are to be considered in the assessment within the overall exposure pathway in order to meet the
identified risk management objectives. It may be helpful to construct a diagram identifying all system components
that need to be quantified in the risk assessment.


5.4.3    Health outcomes
The human health outcomes that are of interest are identified. Depending on the purpose of the risk assessment,
the human health outcomes may include infection, illness, illness and sequelae, or overall measures of disease
burden that aggregate the impact of all of these outcomes (e.g. DALYs, see section 7.2). The health outcomes to be
included in the analysis will depend on the purpose – for example, if the objective is to compare the calculated risk
with a regulatory target, the requirements of the regulation (annual probability of infection or DALYs) will drive the
selected health outcomes. In the case of a recreational water study undertaken by Soller et al. (2010a), the objective
was to better understand the results from epidemiological studies conducted on the Great Lakes in the USA during
2003 and 2004 by identifying pathogens that could have caused the observed illnesses in those studies. Therefore,
the selected health outcome for that study was gastrointestinal illness.

reference pathogen via the identified exposure pathways and hazardous events defined during problem
formulation. This requires simplifying the environmental system to a defined, quantifiable exposure pathway.

In exposure assessment, the magnitude and frequency of exposure to each reference pathogen via each identified
exposure pathway during each combination of event conditions are estimated. The frequency of exposure is defined
in exposure assessment, but applied within risk characterization (Chapter 8) to quantify the overall probability
of one or more infections/illnesses for a given time interval (e.g. per year), as a higher level of exposure may be
tolerated for very rare exposure events, in comparison with daily exposure pathways. Exposure frequency can
vary from daily (e.g. unboiled tap water [exposure within 24 hours is assumed to comprise a single event]) to a few
days per week (e.g. certain food crops) to weekly (e.g. household garden watering with reclaimed effluent) or even
sporadically (e.g. emptying a septic tank). The exposed population may vary from the vast majority (e.g. tap water)
to a small subset (e.g. professional divers) of the total population.

As outlined in section 3.2, exposure assessment involves three steps: defining the exposure pathway(s); quantifying each
component of the exposure pathway(s); and characterizing exposure, giving consideration to the units of dose (Box 6.1).


 Box 6.1 Units of dose
 The objective of the risk assessment is to combine the exposure dose with a dose–response model in order to
 estimate health risk outcomes. It is therefore important that the units of dose are consistent with the selected
 dose–response model. The majority of commonly applied dose–response models rely on the mean dose per
 exposure event, quantified as:

    Exposure dose = C∙q		                                                               Eq. 6.1

 where:
    C is the concentration of pathogens in the exposure medium; and
    q is the amount of material ingested or inhaled per event.
 The units of both C and q depend on the exposure pathway and may be based on mass for ingestion of soil or
 food (mg, g) and volume for water consumption (mL, L) or inhalation (m3) per exposure.

 The mean dose is a variable that may take any value greater than or equal to 0; however, microorganisms are
 discrete units, and the number of organisms to which an individual is exposed will always be a discrete number
 (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3…). The microbial enumeration units (e.g. by culture or molecular methods; see section 6.2.1 and
 Annex C) are also an important consideration to test for harmony with those applied in the development of the
 dose–response model. This is discussed in more detail in section 7.1 and Annex D.




                                                                                                  Exposure assessment   39
6.1 Defining the exposure pathway
The available data and the purpose of the risk assessment will drive how the exposure pathway is defined.
Table 6.1 includes examples of different approaches for defining the exposure pathway. Any exposure pathway can
be defined in terms of sources, controls and mechanisms of exposure (Fig. 6.1):
• Sources: The initial point of pathogen quantification. It may not always be possible or appropriate to quantify
   the concentration directly at the point of exposure. For example, for QMRA of drinking-water, the source could
   be the treated drinking-water (Borchardt et al., 2012), untreated source water (Signor et al., 2005) or even
   upstream faecal sources (Ferguson et al., 2007; Ferguson, Charles & Deere, 2009). For wastewater reuse
   scenarios, pathogens have been quantified in faecal sources (Ottoson & Stenström, 2003), raw sewage (Gale,
   2005), treated effluent (Westrell et al., 2003) and irrigation water (Seidu et al., 2008).
• Control measures (barriers): Any environmental (e.g. residence time, sunlight, overland transport) (Muirhead,
   Collins & Bremer, 2006a,b; Sinton et al., 2007), engineered (drinking-water or wastewater treatment barriers)
   (Hijnen & Medema, 2010) or regulatory (e.g. withholding periods for crops) controls that are expected to lead to a
   loss or inactivation of pathogens (Hamilton et al., 2006) are identified and can be quantified. It is also important
   to note that recontamination from a secondary source (e.g. intrusion of groundwater to distribution networks;
   waterfowl on open ponds; human handling of food) may also occur.
• Mechanisms of exposure (intake): The pathway by which human exposure may result, which, depending on the
   context, may include intentional drinking (unboiled tap water) (Mons et al., 2007), unintentional ingestion (e.g.
   during recreational swimming) (Dufour et al., 2006; Suppes et al., 2014), aerosol ingestion (Schoen & Ashbolt,
   2011) and food consumption (Hara-Kudo & Takatori, 2011).

It is helpful to construct a diagram identifying all system components that need to be quantified in the
risk assessment.

Fig. 6.1 Conceptual components for quantifying exposure (adapted from Petterson & Ashbolt, 2015)

As illustrated in Table 6.1, for a given exposure pathway, there may be several options for where to begin the
quantification for the QMRA. The most straightforward option would be to quantify C, the concentration of
pathogens in the exposure medium, and q, the amount of medium ingested per exposure event, directly. However,
modelling pathogen reduction across barriers (rather than quantifying pathogen concentration directly in the
exposure medium) may be preferred either 1) because of the limitations of enumeration data or methods (typically
small and uncertain data sets, along with often large fluctuations in pathogen concentrations; e.g. Quintero-
Betancourt, Peele & Rose, 2002; Eyles et al., 2003; Girones et al., 2010) or 2) to meet the purpose of the risk
assessment (e.g. to evaluate different types of barriers or inform barrier management):
1) Limitations with enumeration data: Pathogen enumeration data may be unavailable for the exposure medium
   due to either resource constraints (financial or capacity) or methodological or sampling limitations.
   Pathogen concentration in the exposure medium may be too low to allow a consistent detectable concentration
   to be obtained. In the case of drinking-water, pathogen concentrations may be well below the limit of detection
   and yet still pose a risk to public health (Signor & Ashbolt, 2006; Smeets et al., 2007). Microbial risks associated
   with drinking-water exposures are therefore often assessed by quantifying the pathogen concentration in raw
   water and modelling reduction across treatment barriers (Teunis, Ever & Slob, 1999; Medema et al., 2006;
   Smeets et al., 2010).



40   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
   Pathogen enumeration data may be too limited (small sample size) to describe the full range of fluctuations
   in the concentration. For example, pathogen monitoring data from surface water sources may exhibit a high
   proportion of zeros even when the water sources are known to be influenced by faecal sources. This is often
   due to the event-driven nature of microbial loading and the limitations of small monitoring data sets to capture
   these events. Modelling the pathogen concentration in faecal sources, followed by hydrologic modelling of
   contamination events, may therefore provide more useful information for QMRA than relying on monitoring
   data alone (Ferguson et al., 2007; Ashbolt et al., 2010; Sokolova et al., 2015); however, this approach can lead to
   overly conservative estimations of pathogen numbers.
2) To meet the purpose of the risk assessment: When the purpose of the assessment is to investigate processes
   and drivers associated with microbial risks, it is necessary to systematically model the environmental
   processes from source to exposure. Owing to the inherent uncertainties associated with quantifying exposure,
   the greatest value of QMRA may be not in the final quantification of risk, but rather in the exploration of system
   variables and risk drivers as a tool to support water safety management. In this case, each step within the
   system that needs to be explored must be included in the exposure pathway.

Therefore, defining an exposure pathway that fits with the available data and the purpose of the QMRA is critical
and involves the following steps:
• Describe the exposure pathway, identifying the sources of pathogens and how they are transported from the
   source to the receptor.
• Target the exposure pathway in light of the available data and the purpose of the risk assessment. What
   scientific data are available? How would one expect the pathogen concentration to fluctuate throughout the
   system? Where is it possible and reasonable to measure the pathogen concentration? What factors and
   environmental processes should be considered within the risk assessment?




                                                                                                                            Chapter 6
• Define a conceptual model that simplifies the exposure pathway as much as possible in order to allow
   quantification and to achieve the goal of the risk assessment. Define the scope of the exposure assessment by
   identifying the sources and processes/barriers that will be considered.


6.2 Quantifying each component of the exposure pathway
Once the exposure pathway is defined, each component needs to be quantified based on the best available scientific
evidence. To ensure that the inputs are appropriate and representative, it is important to give consideration to
the underlying nature of the scientific data, including site-specific data and data reported in the literature. This
will include the applicability to the current setting, factors driving variability and uncertainty associated with the
model and analytical methods, and the implications of the statistical analysis approach behind the reported values.
Further detail regarding the interpretation and statistical modelling of microbial data is included in Annex C.


6.2.1   Source: concentration of pathogens in environmental media
In order to undertake the QMRA, the concentration of each reference pathogen (identified for the assessment
during problem formulation; see Chapter 5) in the source material needs to be quantified. In many situations,
pathogen enumeration data will be unavailable, and the assessment must be based on indicator data or
expectations from the literature. Nevertheless, the following key principles relate to the evaluation of reference
pathogen concentration in environmental media for QMRA:
• Quantitative concentration estimates need to draw on a systematic understanding of the individual site
    characteristics, including pathogen sources and events that may lead to fluctuations in pathogen concentration.
• All forms of scientific evidence that are available need to be brought together (sanitary survey, faecal
    indicators, microbial source tracking [MST] markers, pathogen enumeration data and information from the
    literature) to build an overall picture of the expected pathogen concentration in the environmental media for
    the individual site. Reliance on pathogen enumeration data alone, when other information is also available, is
    not recommended.
• Data on faecal indicator organisms (FIO) provide important and valuable information for risk assessment;
    however, the site-specific context and sources of FIO and pathogens need to be considered (e.g. role of sanitary
    survey and supplementary MST data) (see Annex C, section C4).
• The methods that were used for the enumeration of microorganisms must be known, including the implications
    for quantification, infectivity and viability (see Annex C, sections C1 and C3).

• The steps involved in the processing of the environmental samples and the implications for quantifying method
  recovery must be understood (see Annex C, section C1).
• The uncertainty in the quantified concentration must be explicitly considered; how representative are the
  data for the pathogens of interest? What conditions are not represented by the data, and are these conditions
  important for the QMRA?
• Quantified units of pathogens must be comparable with the units used in the dose–response assessment.
• Although statistical simplifications are often necessary (and appropriate for a screening-level or tier 1 analysis),
  the implications of these simplifications need to be considered (see examples in Annex C).


6.2.1.1 Variability in pathogen concentration
The true, underlying concentrations of pathogens and indicators in environmental media will vary both temporally
(with time) and spatially (between sites) because of many factors summarized in Table 6.2. Several of these listed
factors can exhibit considerable fluctuations and may be event driven; examples of events or incidents that may
lead to significant fluctuations in pathogen concentration are also provided in Table 6.2.

Each of these factors will influence the magnitude of and variability in the pathogen and indicator concentrations at
a particular site, and hence generalizing pathogen concentrations in environmental media is difficult. A summary
of indicative pathogen concentration ranges in environmental media (i.e. water and sewage) is included in each of
the guidelines: GDWQ Table 7.6 (WHO, in preparation); GWEG Table 3.2 (WHO, 2006a); and GREC Table 4.1 (WHO,
2003). Note that the reported concentrations span several orders of magnitude as a result of true variability in
concentration, differences in contamination levels between locations and systems, and the influence of method
uncertainties (see section C1 in Annex C). Given the considerable differences between studies, site-specific
information is very important for reducing uncertainty in quantifying pathogen concentrations.


6.2.1.2 Site-specific evaluation of pathogen sources
The first stage in gathering information for quantifying pathogen and indicator concentrations is a site-specific
evaluation of pathogen sources and their variability. Some of this information should be collected as part of
the system description and hazard identification steps of the safety plan process. The objective is to create a
quantitative expectation of the magnitude of and variability in pathogen concentration by undertaking the following
steps, in essence undertaking a sanitary survey from source(s) to point(s) of exposure:
• Identify faecal sources to the environmental media: For wastewater use applications, this may be
   straightforward (sewage or treated wastewater); for surface water sources used for drinking-water or for
   recreational waters, a watershed-based sanitary survey of faecal sources associated with surface and
   subsurface water hydrodynamic models can be used to collect this information.
• Identify factors driving the pathogen concentration in the faecal sources (including events): How the pathogen
   concentration within identified faecal sources is expected to vary should be determined. The impacts of the
   important factors driving pathogen concentration for each exposure scenario should be identified and estimated
   (Table 6.1). Disease surveillance records may provide insights regarding prevalence rates (and seasonal
   fluctuations) for the specific region.
• Identify factors driving the contribution of the faecal sources to the point of quantification (including events):
   The factors leading to transport of pathogens from their source to the point of exposure (quantification) should
   be identified and evaluated.
• Compare the study site with published information in the literature or through modelling: Either through
   direct review of published results from other similar sites or through numerical modelling of faecal sources, an
   understanding of reference pathogen concentrations in comparable environmental media should be developed.

a   A faecal sample from a single individual would be expected to exhibit different characteristic variability compared with that from a large
    human wastewater source. Pathogens would be expected to be present only if the individual is infected; concentration as excreted would
    depend on the severity and stage of infection; and likelihood is based on a particular pathogen’s prevalence in a community, which may well
    exhibit (seasonal) fluctuations for a specific pathogen.

The site-specific pathogen data can be checked against the sanitary survey, indicator data and pathogen data from
published studies in comparable water systems. When monitoring results provide consistent values between
indicators and pathogens and with expectations, including when comparing against the published literature, there
is added confidence in the pathogen estimates; alternatively, when the monitoring results are inconsistent with
the expectations (e.g. no detection of pathogens from a highly faecally impacted catchment or high results with no
known pathogen sources), the need for further investigation is triggered.


6.2.1.3 Microbiological monitoring data
Following the initial site assessment, and provided they are available, the monitoring (routine and/or research) data
need to be interpreted and analysed. Data sets from microbiological monitoring programmes may include results
for FIO and/or human pathogens:
• Faecal indicator organisms (FIO): FIO, such as E. coli, are usually not human pathogens, but rather are selected
    for enumeration owing to their ease of analysis (relative to pathogens) and their ability to represent the potential
    presence of pathogens in faecally contaminated environmental media, among other factors (e.g. see section
    7.4 of GDWQ; WHO, in preparation). The relationship between pathogens and FIO depends on how specifically
    faecal in origin the particular indicator is, how host specific it is and how environmentally persistent it is in
    comparison with the targeted human pathogens in a QMRA. Interpretation of indicator data therefore requires
    careful consideration of likely faecal sources from the sanitary survey data. A full discussion of FIO and their
    application for predicting pathogen concentrations for QMRA is included in section C4 in Annex C.
• Pathogen data: Analysis of human pathogens from environmental samples is complex, prone to highly variable
    analytical results and costly. Understanding of the methods associated with the processing, isolation and
    identification of pathogens is extremely important for quantitative interpretation of the results for QMRA (see
    Annex C). Important factors for consideration include:
    -- How many samples were collected, and how many individual observations are there per sample?
    -- Were grab samples collected at one point in time, or were composite samples collected incrementally over a
        duration of time (e.g. 24 hours)?
    -- What characteristics of the target organism were identified, and how specific are these characteristics for
        the reference pathogen of interest (see Annex C, section C1)?
    -- What was the quantification principle of the method (e.g. most probable number [MPN], colony-forming units
        [CFU], plaque-forming units [PFU], copies per volume unit)? What is the uncertainty associated with the
        quantified value (see Annex C, section C2)?
    -- How specific was the method for targeting pathogens infectious to humans (see Annex C, sections C1
        and C3.3)?
    -- What was the recovery efficiency of the method? Were there quantitative controls for method recovery
        efficiency (see Annex C, section C3.2)?
    -- What do the results mean regarding the infectivity of the identified organisms (see Annex C, sections C1
        and C3.3)?

Unless there is a local capacity for pathogen analysis in water and/or wastewater using the preferred analytical
methods for which sample sizes are larger, the capacity for analysis of faecal indicator microbes, typically E. coli/
enterococci bacteria, is often greater, and larger numbers of samples can often be analysed to better characterize
central tendencies and variability.


6.2.1.4 Statistical descriptors and statistical models
Inferring quantitative values for the exposure assessment from the monitoring data requires consideration of the
representativeness of the sample and the most appropriate descriptors to be estimated:
• Choosing a representative sample: For waterborne pathogens, sample numbers are often small (<20) and
    sometimes very small (<5). Consequently, a critical question for analysis of any microbial data set is: what
    conditions do the data represent? Review of the sampling regime in comparison with the site-specific evaluation
    of variability (discussed above) provides information regarding what conditions are represented by the samples.
    It is important to know if the samples were collected randomly (e.g. following a defined procedure that is
    independent of environmental conditions, such as on the first Monday of a month), in response to a perceived
    risk (hazardous event) or under conditions where the pathogen loads during sampling were expected to be




46   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
  particularly high (e.g. following rainfall/snowmelt event or a sewer bypass event), relatively low (e.g. during
  low-flow conditions) or perhaps average.
• Choose which descriptors or parameters are to be estimated: The value to be estimated depends on the
  purpose of the assessment (Chapter 5), the exposure scenarios and how the risk will be characterized (Chapter
  8). Point estimates may include the mean, median, 95th quantile or maximum (i.e. worst-case) pathogen
  concentration. Alternatively, a parametric probability distribution may be fitted to the data to describe the
  variability in concentration (see Annex B and section C3 in Annex C for more examples). Considerations in the
  selection of statistical descriptors or fitting of parametric distributions include the following:
  -- Do the monitoring data represent the original observations (see Annex C, section C2)?
  -- What are the characteristics of the data? The data may be qualitative (presence or absence in a given
      volume); discrete (only contains integers [0, 1, 2, 3…]); categorical (can hold one of a range of distinct values,
      as in the case of MPNs); or continuous (can hold any value within a set range, such as in the case of reported
      concentrations) (see Annex C, section C1.3).
  -- What should be done about zeros? Microbial count data often include (sometimes many) zeros (see Annex C,
      section C3.1).
  -- What should be done about censored data? Reported microbial concentrations typically contain left-
      censored (less than) and right-censored (greater than or too numerous to count [TNTC]) data (see Annex C,
      section C3.1).
  -- How should MPNs be analysed? Reported concentrations based on MPN inference are predicted
      concentrations from presence/absence data and frequently include left- and right-censored outcomes (see
      Annex C, sections C3.1 and C3.4).




                                                                                                                             Chapter 6
  -- How should the concentrations be corrected for imperfect recovery? Only a fraction of the microorganisms
      originally present will be detected by the analytical method (see Annex C, section C3.2).
  -- How can the concentration be corrected to describe only the human-infectious fraction? Depending on the
      method, only a fraction of the total number of microorganisms detected will be infectious to humans (see
      Annex C, section C3.3).


6.2.1.5 Interpretation of published data
In many cases, site-specific data are not available for quantifying pathogen concentration in source material, and
the assessment must rely on data published in the literature. Firstly, it is important to evaluate how similar the site
from the published study is to the specific study system. All of the factors that drive the true variability in pathogen
concentration in environmental media (listed above) need to be considered, including disease incidence, sanitation,
climate and topography. Differences need to be documented so that the potential impact on the risk results can
be assessed.

Secondly, when drawing on data from the literature, all of the previously mentioned factors related to methodology
and data reporting (listed above) need to be considered. If the specific details are not reported with the published
data, it is necessary to:
• evaluate the magnitude of the unknowns and whether the data are suitable for application in the QMRA;
• make a conservative assumption in the absence of specific information; and
• document the assumption and evaluate its importance on the study outcomes in risk characterization.


6.2.2   Quantifying efficacy of control measures
The second step in quantifying each component of the exposure pathway is to evaluate the performance of each
identified control measure in reducing the concentration of reference pathogens. Depending on the purpose of the
risk assessment, consideration of the variability in performance and the influence of events may be critical to the
analysis. In quantifying reductions in pathogens as a result of control measures, several issues must be carefully
considered. These include the following:
• Quantitative control reduction estimates need to draw on a systematic understanding of the individual barrier,
    including mechanisms of pathogen reduction and events that may lead to fluctuations in performance.
• Engineered barriers are usually operated and controlled; how do operation and control affect barrier
    performance and variability?




                                                                                                  Exposure assessment   47
• All forms of scientific evidence that are available need to be brought together (process and hydrological
  conditions, surrogate data, online monitoring data and information from the literature) to build an overall picture
  of the expected pathogen reduction efficacy for the individual site.
• An empirical approach to quantifying reduction efficacy may not be appropriate for all control measures, and
  the processes and mechanisms of the barrier need to be considered in the quantification.
• Application of data from the literature requires careful consideration regarding the representativeness of
  empirical-based barrier quantification from another site; and the representativeness of parameter values (e.g.
  inactivation coefficient) for mechanistic models.
• Although statistical simplifications are often necessary (and appropriate for a screening-level or tier 1 analysis),
  the implications of these simplifications need to be considered.

The uncertainty in the quantified concentration must be explicitly considered: How representative are the data for
the pathogens of interest? What conditions are not represented by the data, and are these conditions important for
the QMRA?

Microbial reduction in QMRA is most often quantified in terms of log10 reduction (1 log10 = 90%; 2 log10 = 99%;
3 log10 = 99.9%; etc.). Compilations of information on barrier reduction have been included in the relevant
guidelines: drinking-water treatment process technologies for large systems (GDWQ Table 7.7; WHO, in preparation)
and households (GDWQ Table 7.8; WHO, in preparation) and Table A2.4 in WHO (2011); wastewater treatment
technologies (GWEG Table 5.2; WHO, 2006a); and wastewater health protection measures (GWEG Table 4.3; WHO,
2006a). In addition, for drinking-water systems, supporting documentation is available on treatment barrier
performance (LeChevallier & Au, 2004; Hijnen & Medema, 2010). These reviews provide a starting point for
estimating pathogen reduction efficacy for QMRA; however, there is considerable uncertainty associated with
applying these values to a specific system, as the reported efficiency of barriers in the scientific literature is highly
variable. For example, in the review and meta-analysis undertaken by Hijnen & Medema (2010), the mean reported
log10 reduction of viruses by conventional drinking-water treatment (coagulation, flocculation, rapid granular
filtration) across seven published studies varied from 1.2 to 5.3 log10; they calculated a mean elimination capacity,
based on their meta-analysis of studies, of 3 log10. Reference to the GDWQ (Table 7.7; WHO, in preparation) indicates
that the removal of viruses via coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation plus granular high-rate filtration
would be expected to vary between 0.1 and 6.9 log10. This is a very broad range and would lead to very high
uncertainty in the calculated risk; site-specific information on removal performance would be necessary to reduce
this uncertainty, in essence understanding how well the treatment process is designed, operated and controlled
(through validation and monitoring) and the “good” and “bad” days in treatment at the specific site (Gale, 2002).


6.2.2.1 Variability in barrier efficiency
Barrier efficacy will vary both spatially (between sites) and temporally (over time between sampling occasions).
Whereas different types of barriers are grouped together due to their similarity – for example, “conventional drinking-
water treatment”, “activated sludge” or “waste stabilization ponds” – there are often considerable differences
between study sites, including scale (pilot scale/full scale; capacity), details of design and operation (geometry, media,
loading rates, hydrodynamics), water quality characteristics (organic content, pretreatment, temperature) and climate
(temperature, solar radiation, precipitation), that will affect the microbial reduction performance. Although it may be
desirable to generically characterize barriers, variability within categories is to be expected.

For any given barrier, efficacy will also be expected to vary over time. Barrier performance can be dependent on
climatic factors, hydraulic loading, hydrodynamics and water quality characteristics. Therefore, seasonal and
specific event factors (e.g. rainfall, upstream loading) will influence performance. In addition, depending on the
barrier, performance can also be affected by system management decisions or failures (e.g. backwash frequency,
chemical dosage rates). A summary of the factors and associated events influencing the variability in treatment
performance for some barriers is given in Table 6.3. In addition to these factors, treatment interruptions caused
by periodic lack of electricity can lead to pressure changes and potential ingress of contamination within the
distribution system (Krumpel & Nelson, 2013).

6.2.2.2 Site-specific evaluation of pathogen removal
In order to quantify the pathogen removal efficiency of a particular treatment barrier, it is necessary to understand
the pathogen removal mechanisms and how the performance of those mechanisms is likely to vary for a specific
site. The following steps should be performed:
1) Identify the mechanisms of pathogen removal. Why does the barrier result in a reduction in pathogen
    concentration? Some barriers physically remove pathogens from the water column – for example,
    sedimentation tanks, granular filtration, microfiltration and ultrafiltration. Barriers may also rely on inactivation
    either due to exposure to environmental conditions alone (sunlight, temperature, desiccation) or in the presence
    of a disinfectant.
2) Identify the factors that drive the effectiveness of the removal mechanism. Physical removal by filtration
    depends on the medium, pore size and loading rates and may also depend on effective chemical coagulation.
    Barriers dependent on inactivation require that sufficient residence time is achieved under adverse conditions
    or that a sufficient dose of disinfectant is delivered. What are the expected conditions for the study site?
3) Identify the circumstances under which those dependent factors might fluctuate. For filtration, loading rates
    and effective pore size can vary over the filter cycle; failure to deliver appropriate coagulant dose may lead to
    poor coagulation and hence poor removal; residence time of wetlands, ponds and reservoirs can be significantly
    affected by rainfall events, leading to short-circuiting; and seasonal conditions may support pathogen
    persistence, such as cooler temperatures and shorter days in winter. How might the expected conditions vary
    due to short-term (process fluctuations and failures, rainfall) and medium-term (seasonal) events?
4) Compare the study site with published information in the literature. There are many reviews available in
    the literature on a wide range of barriers. How is the study site expected to compare with reported ranges in
    the literature?

Site-specific evaluation not only provides an important first indication of how the barrier performs, but also
informs future data collection and analysis. The evaluation will inform further investigations and which surrogate
organisms are most suitable to describe the mechanism and pathogen of interest.

There are two main approaches to quantify barrier efficiency for QMRA:
1) Empirical approach: An empirical approach to quantify reduction performance is data driven and relies on
   observations of pathogens or surrogates before and after the barrier. The reduction efficiency is calculated as
   the difference in concentration (usually on a log10 scale). More detail is presented in Annex C, section C5.
2) Mechanistic approach: Rather than quantifying a single set of experimental conditions, the objective of the
   mechanistic approach is to characterize specific factors that drive the removal mechanism (e.g. residence
   time of a reservoir; persistence of pathogens during disinfection; hydraulic characterization of disinfection
   chambers). Log10 reduction is modelled based on the quantification of these driving factors. More detail is
   presented in Annex C, section C6.

The selected approach depends on the nature of the barrier, the scientific evidence and site-specific information
available for quantification. The empirical approach is best suited for barriers that operate close to or in
steady state (stable loading conditions) and that exhibit limited variation in operational conditions. If the
process is dynamic (constantly responding to changes in loading or operational conditions) or known to be
driven by measurable factors (e.g. hydraulic residence time), then a mechanistic approach may be more useful
for quantification.


6.2.2.3 Aggregating multiple barriers for water/wastewater treatment performance
Water and wastewater treatment trains often consist of multiple barriers; indeed, a multiple-barrier approach
is recommended to support water safety (WHO, in preparation). When combining multiple treatment barriers
in series, it is common practice in QMRA to sum individual unit log10 credits to estimate the overall removal
efficacy. In reality, however, treatment units do not act independently, but are designed to work in combination,
such as the removal of suspended matter in coagulation/filtration processes, which makes chlorination more
effective. Under nominal conditions, this means that the overall removal is at least as good as the sum of the
removal of the unit processes, and may even be better, owing to synergism between processes. However,
performance of treatment processes can also be negatively impaired by deterioration of water quality or
performance of upstream barriers. For example, an increase in the organic content of surface water caused by a
rainfall event may change the coagulation conditions of conventional drinking-water treatment, leading to poorer
removal performance and higher concentration of particulates in the effluent. These particulates may protect




50   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
pathogens during disinfection, and hence the performance of the disinfection process may be compromised. QMRA
should aim to incorporate the interaction between treatment processes; however, there are limited examples in
the literature to demonstrate how this could be done in practice. According to current practice, a conservative
estimate of treatment performance may be selected in order to account for these potential process interactions;
however, this practice accounts only for the situation where the overall log10 reduction is less than the sum of
the components.


6.2.3   Intake: exposure volumes and frequencies
The final stage in the exposure assessment is to quantify the magnitude and frequency of exposure for a range of
different activities, including voluntary consumption (e.g. drinking-water, food crops) and involuntary consumption
(e.g. accidental ingestion while swimming, aerosol ingestion/inhalation, dermal contact). Two approaches can be
taken in QMRA to quantify exposure:
1) quantify exposure frequency and magnitude based on scientific data; and
2) select reference values for exposure magnitude and frequency.

The selection should be based on the availability of scientific data and the purpose of the risk assessment.
Reported data and selected values for QMRA are summarized in the following sections.


6.2.3.1 Drinking-water
Drinking-water consumption varies between cultures, climates and individuals. For example, in the review of
drinking-water consumption data by Mons et al. (2007), they reported that the mean daily consumption of cold tap




                                                                                                                          Chapter 6
water varied between 0.10 and 1.55 L across different regions (a subset of the data summarized in that review is
included in Table 6.4). In their review, Mons and coworkers (2007) identified many important aspects associated
with the analysis and interpretation of consumption data, including the following:
• The way in which the data were collected influenced the estimated consumption volume. Estimations of
    drinking-water consumption were higher in the questionnaires than in the diaries.
• The fraction of the population that did not drink tap water (non-consumers) varied widely between studies and
    needs to be considered.
• Distributions of drinking-water consumption were generally left skewed, and therefore the mean (being higher
    than the median) was considered a suitable conservative point estimator for QMRA.
• When defining a distribution of consumption, whereas the lognormal distribution has often been used to
    describe daily consumption volume, tap water consumption data are typically discrete in nature (number of
    glasses consumed per day); therefore, the Poisson distribution was considered more appropriate and, when
    non-consumers were accounted for, provided a suitable fit to the reviewed data sets.
• When no country-specific data are available, Mons and coworkers (2007) recommended the application of
    data from the Melbourne (Australia) diary study (Poisson, λ = 3.49 glasses·d−1) as a conservative input, as the
    consumption level for this study was relatively high.

Despite the availability of drinking-water consumption data, it is common in QMRA to use a reference value for
exposure – for example, many drinking-water QMRAs have relied on an assumption of 2 L per person per day (Regli
et al., 1991; Rose, Haas & Regli, 1991; Asano et al., 1992) or 1 L per person per day (Masago et al., 2004; Howard,
Pedley & Tibatemwa, 2006; WHO, in preparation). The advantage of a reference value is that it is transparent in the
magnitude of exposure that is being represented by the risk calculations, which can be helpful, particularly when
the true magnitude of exposure for the particular population is unknown.

6.2.3.2 Wastewater reuse
There are a few examples of QMRA studies that have sought to draw on scientific data to support input
assumptions, such as the application of the upper limit of daily soil ingestion for children for sludge application
studies (Westrell et al., 2004); vegetable consumption data (Gale, 2005; Hamilton et al., 2006); and plume modelling
for aerosol dispersion of wastewater used for spray irrigation of crops (Höglund, Stenstroöm & Ashbolt, 2002). The
most common approach for wastewater reuse QMRA is to use reference values for exposure. In the guidelines,
examples of reference values include 1–10 mg of soil ingested per person per day for 100 days per year for
workers involved with highly mechanized agriculture (Table 3.14 GWEG); 10–100 mg soil ingested per person
per day for 300 days per year for labour-intensive agricultural workers (Table 3.15 GWEG); 100 g of wastewater-
irrigated lettuce consumed per person every 2 days (Table 3.17 GWEG); and 100 g of onions consumed per person
once per week for 5 months (Table 3.18 GWEG) (WHO, 2006a). These values are assumed to conservatively
represent the exposure scenario being modelled. For consumption of food crops, many countries have national
statistics that may be useful. Further examples of reference values for wastewater reuse are included in Case-
study 5 in Annex A.


6.2.3.3 Recreational water
For recreational studies involving primary (swimming, bathing) contact, Dufour and coworkers (2006) investigated
the volume of water consumed by pool swimmers, providing observational data that have subsequently been used
for QMRA (Schoen & Ashbolt, 2010; Soller et al., 2010b). Fifty-three recreational swimmers participated using a
community swimming pool disinfected with cyanuric acid–stabilized chlorine. The swimmers were asked to
actively swim for at least 45 minutes and to collect their urine for the next 24 hours. The predicted median volume
of water swallowed by all participants combined was approximately 19 mL. Results of the study indicated that non-
adults ingest slightly more water than adults during swimming activity (Fig. 6.2). The average amounts of water
swallowed by non-adults and adults were 37 mL and 16 mL, respectively. There is some evidence to suggest that
risks may be different for surfers (Stone et al., 2008; Tseng & Jiang, 2012).

  Secondary contact recreational activities (boating, fishing, etc.) can also lead to unintentional ingestion of water.
  The likelihood and volume of consumption are assumed to be lower in comparison with primary contact; however,
  there are limited quantitative data available. Dorevitch et al. (2011) estimated the volume of water consumption for
  a range of limited-contact recreational activities, including canoeing, kayaking and fishing, based on self-reporting
  of water consumption by category (“drop”, “teaspoon”, “mouthful”) among 2705 participants. Mean and upper
  confidence limit estimates of water ingestion were about 3–4 mL and 10–15 mL, respectively. The frequency of
  swallowing at least a teaspoon of water during limited-contact recreation was around 1% of study participants.

7           HEALTH EFFECTS
            ASSESSMENT

Dose–response relationships describing the relationship between exposure and the probability of infection or
illness are identified and evaluated for each reference pathogen. The likelihood and consequence of various health
outcomes (potentially including infection, illness and/or long-term health impacts) are assessed.


7.1 Dose–response relationships




                                                                                                                             Chapter 7
Most risk assessments use dose–response information from the published literature. Care must be taken that
the selected model and parameter values are appropriate for the risk study and that when interpreting the
calculations, the implications of the assumptions underlying the selected numbers are considered. The following
key principles need to be considered for application of dose–response models in QMRA:
• The dose–response parameters from published studies need to be evaluated in light of the observational data
   on which they are based; some models are based on stronger scientific evidence than others.
• The dose–response data also need to be evaluated in light of the population from which they have been
   collected and how representative this population is of the general population and any sensitive subpopulations
   within the general population.
• Although parameter uncertainty associated with the dose–response model is an important consideration within
   QMRA, many other forms of uncertainty (e.g. suitability of the model, representativeness of the cohort and of the
   pathogen) also need to be explicitly addressed.
• Low-dose approximations need to be evaluated for their suitability in a given exposure context.
• The units of dose (e.g. 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50], oocysts, genome copies, focus-forming units
   [FFU]) are different between pathogens and need to be considered in the practical application of the models for
   risk assessment. In particular, were the same assay methods used for the dose–response data collection as for
   the exposure assessment? If not, what assumptions were made?


7.1.1   Variability in infectivity
The infectivity of a pathogen depends on its ability to pass host defences, find a site for colonization and cause an
infection within the human host. Variability in infectivity can exist as a result of:
• variability between pathogen strains in their virulence and human infectivity; and
• variability between hosts in the strength of their immune response. Susceptible portions of the population
    include children, the elderly and the immunocompromised, who are more easily infected. In addition, short- or
    long-term immunity following an infection may protect portions of the population from future enteric infections.




                                                                                            Health effects assessment   55
7.1.2    Dose–response models
Various models exist for the dose–response relationship for infection and the dose–response relationship for
illness when infected (the conditional relation for illness given infection). The most commonly applied models
within QMRA are based on the single-hit theory: where every ingested pathogen particle is assumed to act
independently and has an individual probability of causing infection (Haas, 1983; Teunis & Havelaar, 2000). These
models consist of two components:
1) Part 1. Given the mean concentration in the exposure medium (i.e. dose), estimate the number of
    microorganisms ingested (a discrete number, i.e. 0, 1, 2, etc.). Usually a Poisson distribution is assumed
    (meaning that the microorganisms are well dispersed).
2) Part 2. Given the discrete number of microorganisms ingested, estimate the probability of infection. Each
    microorganism may be assumed to have the same probability (r) of causing infection (e.g. exponential dose–
    response model), or the probability of infection may be assumed to vary between microorganisms or hosts
    (e.g. if variability in infectivity is assumed to be beta distributed, the overall single-hit dose–response model
    becomes the Beta-Poisson model).

A useful property of the single-hit model is that there is an upper bound referred to as the maximum risk curve
(Teunis & Havelaar, 2000). This curve describes the probability of infection when every ingested organism is
assumed to be successful in causing an infection (exponential model with r = 1). In the absence of pathogen-specific
infectivity information or to estimate the worst case for a particularly virulent pathogen strain, the maximum risk
curve can be used as an upper bound.

When the dose is calculated as the discrete number of pathogens ingested (rather than the mean dose in the
exposure medium), it is appropriate to use a conditional dose–response model (Haas, 2002) rather than the
frequently used exponential or Beta-Poisson model, as only Part 2 (above) is needed.

Alternative approaches to dose–response modelling exist and are being increasingly proposed. For example,
Messner, Berger & Nappier (2014) proposed a fractional dose–response model for describing norovirus infectivity
in which an individual’s probability of infection (Part 2 above) is assumed to be either exactly 0 or exactly 1. Based
on the existing observational data for norovirus, and applying the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the fractional
Poisson model was preferred over the Beta-Poisson model. Such alternative model structures may prove
successful in describing the infectivity and immune response behaviour associated with different pathogens.

In the implementation of dose–response models within QMRA, it is often desirable to apply a low-dose
approximation in order to simplify the calculations. In the low-dose region, the relationships are close to linear, and
in many cases a linear approximation is reasonable. In the application of dose–response models in the drinking-
water guidelines (GDWQ Table 7.4; WHO, in preparation), a low-dose simplification to the single-hit model has been
adopted. Only the probability of infection from a single organism is considered; the probability of exposure to more
than one organism per day is assumed to be so low that it is ignored in the dose–response relationship. At very low
concentrations, this simplification is valid; however, it is important that at higher pathogen concentrations (mean
dose approximately 0.3 microorganisms), the full single-hit (exponential or Beta-Poisson) model should be used to
account for the risk of infection associated with exposure to more than one organism.


7.1.3    Published dose–response relationships
Many studies have been undertaken in which dose–response models have been fitted to experimental data.
Published parameter values from these studies have been widely applied within QMRA in a diverse range of
contexts. Each of these models has different sources of uncertainty, as they are based on different data (different
doses, different measures of dose, different hosts and different sample sizes), and modelling studies have applied
a range of different assumptions to produce an acceptable fit. An appreciation of these details is valuable for
selecting a dose–response model and subsequently interpreting the representativeness of the resulting risk
calculations. Further details of the dose–response relationships for the following pathogens are provided in

7.2 Disability-adjusted life years
Whereas all of the enteric pathogens considered in the context of this document may lead to gastroenteric
symptoms, the duration and severity of illness (and likelihood of long-term sequelae) vary between pathogens.
For managing water safety, it is desirable to give priority to pathogens that lead to the greatest burden of disease.
The DALY is a summary measure of population health that incorporates the different severities and durations
associated with different illnesses. The DALY has been applied as a metric within the WHO guidelines in order to
provide a different relative weight to pathogens based on severity of disease outcomes (Havelaar & Melse, 2003).

One DALY represents the loss of one healthy life year. For each health outcome, DALYs are calculated as the sum
of the years lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability for incident
cases of ill-health conditions. The DALY is an indicator of the time lived with a disability and the time lost due to
premature mortality:

    DALY = YLL + YLD			                                                               Eq. 7.1

		        = Years of life lost + Years living with a disability

For each hazard or health risk, the following is needed:
• identification of disease outcomes to be considered (construct the outcome tree);
• number of cases for each outcome in the population (estimate the probability associated with each outcome);
• duration of response (years of life lost); and




                                                                                                                                 Chapter 7
• severity of response (1 for death).

DALY weightings for a selection of reference pathogens developed for the guidelines are summarized in Table 7.1.
Detailed examples demonstrating the calculation of DALYs for several pathogens in the Netherlands are given in
Kemmeren et al. (2006). Labite et al. (2010) applied QMRA to evaluate the health impact associated with a range of
potential interventions for an urban water system in Accra, Ghana. They applied the DALY metric for five reference
pathogens for the local context. The assumptions and calculation of disease burden per case are summarized in
Table 7.2.

7.3 Secondary transmission and immunity
Secondary transmission and immunity are more advanced QMRA inputs that give the most comprehensive look
at disease burdens on the population from waterborne exposure. Secondary transmission refers to secondary
infections that occur in the population due to human-to-human contact with persons infected by a waterborne
pathogen. Immunity refers to the ability of humans to not become ill following exposure to a disease agent if they
have been exposed to that agent previously. These factors have been demonstrated in QMRAs of sewage sludge
risks, but remain relatively limited (Eisenberg et al., 1996, 2002, 2004). Secondary transmission and immunity
are not considered within WHO risk-based guidelines for setting health-based targets and have not yet been
demonstrated in QMRA for water safety planning (Medema et al., 2006; Medema & Smeets, 2009; Smeets et
al., 2010).

Immunity is an important consideration for excreta-borne and waterborne pathogens for which there is now
widespread use of immunization with vaccines to prevent infection and illness. Such vaccines are now widely
used for polioviruses, rotaviruses and, in developed countries, hepatitis A virus. The use of such vaccines results
in some members of the exposed population in some settings being more resistant to infection or protected
completely from infection. Such vaccine-derived immunity in the population should be considered in selecting
reference or target pathogens.

8           RISK
            CHARACTERIZATION

In risk characterization, the information from the exposure assessment and the health effects assessment is
combined to generate a quantitative measure of risk.

The calculations performed during risk characterization need to be driven by the purpose and scope of the
assessment, as defined during problem formulation (Chapter 5). Simply combining all the information into a
single distribution of risk (encompassing a range of sources of variability and uncertainty) may not be informative.
Alternatively, the careful modelling of scenarios can be extremely valuable for teasing out risk drivers and
identifying opportunities for risk management. Scenarios can also facilitate the uncertainty and variability analyses
and the sensitivity analysis to be undertaken during risk characterization (discussed below in section 8.3).

When combining the information from the exposure and health effects assessments, it is essential to consider
consistency. Are the exposure and health effects assessments focused on the same hazards, the same population
or population subgroups and the same time frame? Given (from Chapters 6 and 7) the strong reliance within




                                                                                                                             Chapter 8
QMRA on the measurement of indicators and surrogates and the application of dose–response data drawn from
healthy adults or outbreak situations, consistency issues can be easily overlooked. In addition, as highlighted in
section 7.1, it is important to ensure that the units of exposure are consistent with those used in the dose–
response relationship.


8.1 Quantitative measures of risk
Quantitative measures of risk must combine, in some form, an expression of the two quantitative components of
risk – namely, some measure of the probability of risk occurring; and the size of the impact should that risk occur.
Quantitative measures of risk can be either deterministic (meaning single values or point estimates) or probabilistic
(meaning that probability distributions are used to describe model variables and outcomes). Depending on the
purpose of the assessment, different statistics may be applied for quantifying risk. Some considerations related to
different statistics for describing risk are given in Table 8.1.

The risk can be defined by a range of outcomes, including infection, illness and DALYs (see Chapter 7), and may
be defined for different time scales, including a single exposure or exposure over a year. Health targets are
frequently defined in terms of an annual risk, which may seem unusual, given that each exposure event in QMRA
is assumed to be independent, and hence microbial risks are not cumulative (unlike the assumption for chemical
risks). The annual measure of risk has two clear advantages over a single exposure or daily risk measure. Firstly,
when exposures are less frequent (e.g. a few times per year as opposed to daily exposure), a higher probability of
infection can be tolerated per event. Secondly, an annual target acknowledges the variability in risk and allows for
a higher risk to be tolerated on some occasions (e.g. due to seasonal or event-driven factors) as long as the overall
risk for the year is below the health target. Nonetheless, if the management goal is to contain potential outbreaks, a
daily health target could be advantageous (Signor & Ashbolt, 2009).

8.2 Probability of infection: multiple exposure events
Dose–response models typically estimate the probability of infection (or, in some cases, illness) associated with a
single-exposure event. In order to consider multiple events over a longer time frame, it is necessary to combine the
individual probability using the following equation:

Pinf/combined = 1 − (1 − Pinf/single)N                                                       Eq. 8.1

where Pinf/combined is the probability of one or more infections over N exposure events and Pinf/single is the single-
event probability of infection. When considering the annualized probability of infection associated with drinking-
water exposure, N is typically set equal to 365 to represent daily exposure.

When combining infection probabilities associated with different event conditions, the following equation is used:

Pinf/combined = 1 − ∏mi=1(1 − Pinf/i)Ni                                                      Eq. 8.2

where Pinf/i is the probability of infection associated with event i (of a total of m events to be considered in the
analysis), which occurs Ni times over the period for which the combined risk Pinf/combined is calculated.

62   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
Box 8.1 Identification of the factors that drive risk: example of reliability
Evidence suggests that many improved drinking-water supplies in low-income regions suffer from poor
reliability (Wang & Hunter, 2010). Hunter, Zmirou-Navier & Hartemann (2009) investigated what impact poor
reliability may have on achieving health improvement targets, using a QMRA to assess the potential impact of
interruptions in water supplies that forced people to revert to drinking raw (untreated) water.

Relying on data from the literature (building on the case-study reported by Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa [2006]),
models were constructed for three waterborne pathogens common in Africa: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium and
enterotoxigenic E. coli. Infection risk was calculated for consumption of raw water (probability of infection on
bad days when treatment is interrupted, Pinf/badd) and treated water (probability of infection when treatment is
operational, Pinf/day) separately. To assess the impact of failure in supply for N days over the year, the annual risk
of one or more infections per year (Pinf/year) was calculated using the equation:

Pinf/year = 1 − (1 − Pinf/day)365−N (1 − Pinf/badd)N                                          Eq. 8.3

Selected results are given in Tables 8.2 and 8.3. Risk of infection by the target pathogens was substantially
greater on days when people revert to raw water consumption. Over the course of a few days of raw water
consumption, the annual health benefits attributed to consumption of water from an improved supply will be
almost lost.

for arguing that agencies responsible for implementing improved drinking-water provisions will not make
meaningful contributions to public health targets if those systems are subject to poor reliability.

When calculating the mean or mode probability of infection associated with multiple exposure events, it is
suitable to use the mean or mode Pinf as an input to equations 8.1 and 8.2. When the individual event probability
of infection is not a constant value, percentiles of risk cannot be directly applied with equation 8.1 to calculate the
same percentile associated with the combined risk. For example, assume that the upper or 95th percentile of the
combined risk (Pinf/combined) was of interest. Applying the 95th percentile of Pinf/single in equation 8.1 would assume
that the 95th percentile occurred for every single-exposure event; this would overestimate the 95th percentile
of the combined risk. To overcome this, the combined probability of infection can be quantified using a random
sampling approach. A single random sample of the combined probability is estimated using the equation:

Pinf/combined = 1 − ∏Nj=1(1 − Random[Pinf/single])                                     Eq. 8.4

where Random[Pinf/single] is a random sample from the distribution of Pinf/single. A sample from the full distribution
of the Pinf/combined can be estimated by repeating the simulation many thousands of times, such as by Monte
Carlo simulation. The upper (95th) quantile of the random sample will then represent the 95th percentile of
the Pinf/combined.


8.3 Evaluate the impact of uncertainty and variability
The concepts of uncertainty and variability were introduced in Chapter 4. The key principle within risk
characterization is to evaluate the impact of uncertainty and variability in the input parameters on the overall
risk estimate – in particular, how they may influence the recommendations for risk management that ensue from
the assessment.

An important step is to ensure that the relevant sources of uncertainty and variability are identified, including the
extent to which each factor is quantitatively accounted for in the calculations. For those factors that have not been
incorporated quantitatively, it is important to review if and how they may be expected to influence the result. In
reporting a result that incorporates both variability and uncertainty, it is important to consider if:
• the distribution is describing the variability in risk over time (e.g. regarding a distribution of annual risk, the
   95th percentile would be exceeded once every 20 years; or regarding daily risk, the 95th percentile would be
   exceeded on approximately 18 days per year);
• the distribution is describing the variability in risk between individuals (e.g. five in every 100 people would be
   exposed to a risk level higher than the 95th percentile); and
• the distribution is describing uncertainty in risk (e.g. the confidence level that the annual risk is lower than the
   95th percentile is 95%).

Even though their nature is different, it can be practical to characterize uncertainty and variability in the same
process, provided that they are identified clearly, because of their different implications for risk management.


8.3.1    Uncertainty analysis
There is no universal method for uncertainty analysis. Annex B provides an example of how to incorporate
variability and uncertainty in deterministic and probabilistic QMRA. It addresses risks associated with a water
supply system that relies on surface water prone to occurrence of Cryptosporidium. Parts A–C of Annex B describe
a deterministic assessment of a linear QMRA model. This approach lends itself best for the evaluation of the
impact of individual parameters, and less for the evaluation of multiple, interrelated parameters. Consider, for
instance, the possibility of a peak event in source water leading to high Cryptosporidium concentrations, coinciding
with highly turbid water that leads to a low recovery efficiency of the Cryptosporidium detection method and a
reduced efficiency of the coagulation/filtration process. To address such combinations, a plausible upper-bound
or worst-case analysis is possible, combining the upper or extreme bounds of each input parameter into the risk
model. This is a relatively simple approach, but it also reduces all available information about variability and
uncertainty to a point estimate, leads to very high risk estimates and may imply costly risk management options.
Therefore, although such approaches are useful to explore the upper boundaries of the risk scenarios, worst-case
analysis is less valuable for selecting the most appropriate risk management options. Probabilistic methods are
preferred, as they incorporate most of the available information and knowledge and allow the assessment of the
relative contributions of uncertainty and variability to the risk estimate. Annex B (Parts D–F) shows how to apply
probabilistic methods to account for variability and uncertainty by fitting probability distributions to the input
parameter data and how to combine these distributions in the risk characterization with methods such as Monte
Carlo analysis (Annex B; Haas, Rose & Gerba, 1999; Haas & Eisenberg, 2001) or second-order Monte Carlo analysis,
in which variability and uncertainty can be separated (Nauta, 2000).



64   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
Assumptions are needed where knowledge is too limited or even absent. It is therefore difficult to objectively
assess the impact of assumptions on the outcome of the QMRA. In any case, the assumptions and the rationale
for the choices that were made should be documented. When possible, their impact on the overall outcome of
the QMRA should be explored, particularly on the selection of the alternative risk management options. Ignoring
assumptions in the uncertainty analysis can lead to false confidence. Methods are emerging in climate science (van
der Sluis, 2005) and environmental health science (Kloprogge, van der Sluijs & Petersen, 2011) to systematically
analyse the priority and value of assumptions and their impact on the risk assessment results, using expert and
stakeholder evaluation.


8.3.2   Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is recommended for (Frey, Mokhtari & Zheng, 2004):
• prioritization of potential control points in the system;
• identification of key sources of uncertainty and variability;
• refinement and verification of the QMRA model; and
• conditional analysis of the QMRA model (“what if” scenario analysis and identification of factors contributing to
   high exposure or risk).

Although the objectives of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis are different, the results of these two
types of analysis are usually not independent; an input parameter with a high degree of uncertainty may be
highly influential in the sensitivity analysis. Methods for undertaking sensitivity analysis have been reviewed by
Frey & Patil (2002) and Frey, Mokhtari & Zheng (2004). There are mathematical, statistical and graphical methods
available. The selection of the appropriate method for sensitivity analysis depends on a range of factors, such
as the objective, level of detail required, detail and type of data and information used in the model and available
software/resources. The basic method for sensitivity analysis is to change the input value for individual model
components and determine the magnitude of change of the estimated risk.

For deterministic models and for a crude sensitivity screening in probabilistic models, the nominal range
sensitivity analysis (NRSA) is appropriate in many cases. In NRSA, the value of one model input parameter is varied
over its range of plausible values while all other model inputs are kept at their baseline value, and the magnitude
of change of the calculated model output is recorded. The larger the change in the output, the more sensitive the
model is to the input parameter. Repeating this for each input parameter generates an overview of the relative
sensitivities of the model to each of the inputs. NRSA works best with linear models. This approach is not suitable




                                                                                                                             Chapter 8
to handle variations in multiple parameters when there may be interactions between model inputs. Statistical
methods (analysis of variance, correlation analysis) can identify the effect of simultaneous interactions among
multiple input parameters. Distributions for model inputs can be propagated through a model using a variety of
sampling techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulation, Latin hypercube sampling and other sampling methods
(Cullen & Frey, 1999).

Table 8.4 shows an example of NRSA of a QMRA model developed for the risk of infection of Cryptosporidium
from drinking-water produced from a surface water source (as used in Annex B), with the baseline and plausible
upper bounds for each of the input parameters. The sensitivity value shows the magnitude of change in the risk of
infection. It is clear that in this example, the model is most sensitive to peak concentrations of Cryptosporidium in
source water and the periods of reduced treatment performance. Hence, risk mitigation options focused on source
water protection and improved reliability of treatment.

variability and uncertainty within a model for evaluating the risk of viral infection associated with consumption of
wastewater-irrigated lettuce.


 Box 8.2 Assessment of risk of exposure to enteric viruses via lettuce crops
 Sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool for assessing and developing strategies for the management of risks. In
 most practical situations, it is not enough to simply characterize what the risk is; rather, an understanding of
 the most important data gaps and drivers of risk is needed. Petterson (2002) investigated the risks associated
 with enteric viruses present in irrigation water, which attach to the lettuce during spray irrigation and are able
 to persist on the lettuce crop to consumption. The components of the exposure assessment are illustrated in
 Fig. 8.1. The conceptual pathway was favoured for two reasons. Firstly, data on the occurrence of viruses on
 lettuce crops were unavailable; however, enumeration data were available on the concentration of enteric
 viruses in secondary treated effluent. Secondly, the model would allow for the risk drivers, risk management
 options (including irrigation practices and crop withholding periods) and the most important sources of
 uncertainty in the model to be identified.

  q is the quantity of crops consumed per event.

The quantification of model components was undertaken based on scientific data; a summary is given in Table
8.5. A best estimate and an extreme (reasonable worst-case) estimate for each of the model parameters were
made. Two measures of sensitivity were applied for the exposure assessment:

1) Step characteristic (SC) is applied to quantify the main determinants of risk. The SCk indicates the log10
   reduction or increase in the number of organisms at step k relative to the previous step in the model and is
                         N
   given by: SCk = log ( k ) where Nk is the number of organisms per unit mass/volume at step k
                        Nk-1
2) Factor sensitivity (FS) is applied to identify the importance of uncertainty and/or variability at each step k in
                                          N extreme

 The SC and FS were calculated for each component of the process (the volume of irrigation water applied was
 kept constant at 1 mL·g−1, and consumption was assumed to occur at 14 days following last irrigation). The
 results are included in Table 8.6. The SC indicates the importance of each component in the model for driving the
 exposure. For the current model assumptions, virus inactivation was the most important barrier for reducing
 exposure to infectious viruses, identifying the importance of climatic conditions and crop withholding periods for
 controlling risk.

 The FS quantifies the influence of variability and/or uncertainty associated with each component of the model.
 Virus concentration in the irrigation water is uncertain and subject to wide fluctuations and therefore was the
 most important driver of uncertainty in the model outcomes (FS = 5.49). The second most sensitive factor was
 the quantification of virus survival (FS = 2.20), whereas the uncertainty in virus attachment (FS = 0.45) and crop
 consumption (FS = 0.48) had a comparably smaller effect on the uncertainty in the calculated exposure.

 As an additional measure of sensitivity, the critical limits were determined for each of the exposure variables.
 The critical limit was defined as the value at which the probability of infection exceeds 1 × 10−6 per consumption
 event (based on an annual risk of infection of 1 × 10−4 and an exposure duration of 100 days per year), with all
 other components kept at their best estimates. The results are given in Table 8.7. The risk was below the critical
 limit when all variables were set equal to their best estimates. The results show the magnitude of change in
 each variable that could be tolerated. When all other values were set equal to their best estimates, consumption
 of lettuce would need to exceed 16 kg in order for the tolerable risk limit to be exceeded.

FS was also calculated for the dose–response model by comparing each candidate model against the maximum
risk curve (exponential model with r = 1). The results are shown in Table 8.8. For infectious viruses such as
rotavirus and adenovirus, application of the maximum risk curve (rather than a virus-specific model) would have
a relatively small impact (0.22 and 0.27) in comparison with other factors in the exposure assessment. For less
infectious enteric viruses, such as echovirus, application of the maximum risk curve would overestimate the risk
by nearly 3 log10.

The simple deterministic measures of sensitivity calculated in this example are very informative for
understanding the drivers in the model in terms of the relative importance of the different barriers (SC) and
the most important sources of variability and uncertainty (FS). If additional monitoring or data gathering were
to be undertaken to inform the characterization of exposure, improved understanding of the magnitude of the
virus concentration in irrigation waters would be much more beneficial than improved understanding of virus
attachment behaviour or consumer consumption patterns.

9           HOW CAN QMRA SUPPORT WATER
            SAFETY MANAGEMENT?

In this chapter, the ways in which QMRA can support water safety management both at the broad regulatory level
and for site-specific system management are described, with reference to examples from the peer-reviewed
published literature.

The specific role of QMRA to support water safety management, particularly in the drinking-water context, has
been demonstrated through many and various examples presented in the literature (Medema & Smeets, 2009;
Smeets et al., 2010; Petterson & Ashbolt, 2016). This chapter provides an overview of this work, with examples
expanded to include recreational and wastewater reuse pathways. The application of QMRA for the development
of national regulations or guidelines is first considered, followed by four ways to support the site-specific WSP or
SSP: 1) to support system understanding (“know your system”); 2) to evaluate system or pathway safety (“system
assessment”); 3) to identify control points and define or evaluate monitoring requirements, including critical limits;
and 4) to support system planning and incremental improvement.


9.1 Regulation and health-based treatment targets
In the GDWQ (WHO, in preparation) and the GWEG (WHO, 2006a,b), QMRA is recommended as the framework for
translating a quantitative tolerable health outcome target, such as 1 × 10−6 DALY pppy, to performance targets,
such as required pathogen removal by water treatment or other control measures (the recommended approach



                                                                                                                             Chapter 9
is illustrated in Fig. 9.1). The approach is founded on scientific evidence and provides a transparent process for
identifying the magnitude of treatment and operational control required to achieve an identified health outcome
target. The QMRA method also provides a framework that is analogous to the risk-based approach to setting
guideline values for chemicals (NRC, 2009; WHO, 2010). There are, of course, uncertainties in the translation of
the scientific evidence into the constrained framework, which have been discussed in this document. The Dutch
Drinking Water Act (discussed in Box 9.1) requires that risk assessment be undertaken for waterborne pathogens at
every water supply to demonstrate microbiologically safe water. An example of implementation of the translation of
health outcome targets to operational targets in national guidelines is illustrated in Case-study 5 in Annex A, with
the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (NWQMS, 2006).

 Box 9.1 Role of regulations and application of QMRA in the Netherlands
 The Dutch Drinking Water Act of 2001 set a health-based regulatory target of less than one infection per
 10 000 persons per year and stipulates that risk assessment be undertaken for waterborne pathogens to
 demonstrate microbiologically safe water (Anonymous, 2001). If the assessed infectious risk exceeds this target
 value, the drinking-water company must consult with the national environmental inspector about necessary
 mitigation measures. In the Dutch Drinking Water Act itself, no specific directives were given on how to perform
 the risk assessment. This led to ambiguity regarding which data should be used and assumptions applied in the
 QMRA and which statistic (e.g. mean, 95th percentile) of the risk should meet the regulatory target. Therefore,
 in 2005, the Inspectorate Guideline 5318 was created to define requirements of the QMRA and create a “level
 playing field” for the water utilities (Anonymous, 2005). The introduction of this guideline prescribed how
 uncertainty and variability should be dealt with for quantifying risk in relation to the regulation. The guideline
 includes the following:
 • The risk assessment should be undertaken for the reference pathogens Campylobacter, enteroviruses,
     Cryptosporidium and Giardia.
 • Raw water supplies should be monitored for the reference pathogens (frequency depending on size of
     production) over 3 years.
 • Appropriate surrogate organisms or process models for the assessment of treatment efficacy
     are recommended.
 • Data on consumption of unheated tap water for the Netherlands are prescribed.
 • The dose–response models to be used in the assessment are specified.

 In addition, while the mean infection risk must be below 1 in 10 000, the guideline recommends that at least 95%
 of the time, the infection risk should be below the target. To support the legislative requirements, a software tool
 (QMRAspot) was developed by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) to facilitate
 QMRA calculations using the methods and assumptions recommended in the Inspectorate Guideline 5318
 (Schijven et al., 2011). This guideline and its associated tools have helped water utilities in the Netherlands to
 identify the main hazards and the important barriers to control these. It has prompted the necessity for rigorous
 monitoring of these critical control points and for preplanned remedial actions in the case of barrier failure.
 The development of the Inspectorate Guideline 5318, and how it clarified the interpretation of variability and
 uncertainty within the regulatory QMRA, was a critical component of the successful implementation of the Dutch
 Drinking Water Act of 2001.

WSPs and SSPs are the recommended frameworks for managing risks associated with a specific water supply or

9.2.1      Know your system
The underlying principle of water and sanitation safety planning is to “know your system”, so as to identify the
priority hazards and associated hazardous events and interventions. It can help answer questions such as: Which
drinking-water supply scenario is safest? Is water a significant transmission route for gastrointestinal illness?
Characterizing a system from source to exposure, gathering scientific data, selecting quantitative values (first
with conservative screening-level values) and predicting the implications for public health are of great value
for improving the water manager’s (and WSP or SSP team’s) understanding of their system. When prioritizing
systems or hazards, assumptions should be openly tested against scientific data to aid in understanding the
system. Many examples from wastewater reuse, recreational water and drinking-water have been published
that demonstrate how the systematic approach of QMRA informed an understanding of the water system and its
vulnerabilities, including:




                                                                               How can QMRA support water safety management?            73
• identification of the most hazardous risk pathways for a particular scheme (Westrell et al., 2004; Oesterholt et
  al., 2007; Diallo et al., 2008);
• identification of the factors that drive risk (Signor & Ashbolt, 2006; Hunter, Zmirou-Navier & Hartemann, 2009);
• identification of the most important barriers (Medema et al., 2003; Hamilton et al., 2006; Åström et al., 2007);
• identification of the most sensitive components within the risk model (Petterson & Ashbolt, 2001a; Hamilton et
  al., 2006; Jaidi et al., 2009);
• determining the relative significance of major, well-controlled and minor, less well-controlled routes of
  exposure and the moments of reduced treatment performance (Gale, 2002);
• prioritization of hazards by comparing possible pathogen and disinfection by-product risks with alternative
  water systems for a coastal community in the USA (Schoen et al., 2014);
• evaluation of the relative importance of different faecal sources on the overall risk to the community (Case-
  study 1 in Annex A: Schoen & Ashbolt, 2010, 2011; Soller et al. , 2010b, 2015); and
• demonstration of the importance of compliance on overall consumer risk (Hunter, Zmirou-Navier & Hartemann,
  2009; Enger et al., 2013; Petterson, 2015).


9.2.2    System assessment
QMRA provides a clear and transparent approach for comparing system risks with a health outcome target,
making it possible to evaluate whether a system or pathway is safe. This can be conducted in the format of a
deterministic, screening-level risk assessment. The example in section 2.3 illustrates a deterministic, screening-
level QMRA to assess the safety of a surface water supply system following the approach in the WHO GDWQ (WHO,
in preparation).

Case-study 3 (Annex A) demonstrates the broad application of this approach to a large number of drinking-water
supplies in France. Conservative screening-level risk assessments such as these can be very useful in identifying
low-risk and high-risk scenarios. Cases have been reported where risks were evaluated to be so low in comparison
with targets that the system was concluded to be acceptable (Höglund, Stenström & Ashbolt, 2002; Medema et al.,
2003; van den Akker et al., 2011; Pintar et al., 2012); and, conversely, where risks were so high in comparison with
targets that the system was concluded to be unacceptable and additional controls were identified as necessary
(Medema et al., 2003; Steyn, Jagals & Genthe, 2004; van Heerden et al., 2005; Oesterholt et al., 2007; Schönning et
al., 2007; Hunter et al., 2011; Seidu et al., 2015). However, as the risk approaches the region of the regulatory target,
the decision-making process becomes more complex, and the costs and benefits of acting conservatively (e.g.
constructing or including additional barriers) or undertaking further analysis must be weighed. This is illustrated in
more detail in section 4.3 and the detailed quantitative example in Fig. 4.2.

Closely linked with the system assessment is the identification of the magnitude of additional controls required
to achieve the defined level of safety. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Symonds et al. (2014) applied QMRA to
assess the safety, with respect to enteric viruses, of reusing wastewater effluent from stabilization ponds. When
evaluating the safety of using wastewater for irrigation, they concluded that 1–2 log10 additional treatment would
be needed following the three-pond systems, and 2.5–4.5 log10 additional treatment would be needed for the
upflow anaerobic sludge blanket pond system. If children were to be allowed to play in irrigated fields, then 3–5
log10 additional treatment would be needed. The example from Yang et al. (2015) given in Box 9.2 demonstrates the
application of this principle for evaluating what controls are necessary to maintain safety following a distribution
system failure.




74   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
Box 9.2 QMRA for system assessment and maintaining safety following events: examples of microbial
risk modelling for mains breaks
This QMRA is a summary of Yang et al. (2015), who conducted a QMRA to derive operational performance targets
for cleaning the water distribution network after repair works in the USA setting. Pathogen data were collected
from the literature and pilot studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of flushing and disinfection methods
to remove or inactivate pathogens.


Problem formulation
Given the reports on health risks associated with (repair works of) drinking-water distribution networks, the
water utility wanted to develop evidence-based operational targets for cleaning the network after repair works
on drinking-water distribution networks following mains breaks. A QMRA was designed to determine the
significance of cleaning measures and to derive operational targets for adequate cleaning. Raw sewage was
considered to be the riskiest contamination source, and a meta-analysis was done on pathogen concentration
data in sewage from the scientific literature. Norovirus, E. coli O157 and Cryptosporidium were selected as
reference pathogens on the basis of their incidence in the human population and in sewage and their infectivity
and health effects. The health target that was used to derive the operational targets was the average risk of
infection of 10−4 pppy.


Exposure assessment
Pathogen data from different studies were combined in a meta-analysis. The reported pathogen concentrations
in sewage were variable, and hence statistical (lognormal) distributions were fitted to the collected data. The
second step of the exposure assessment was to determine the amount of material that enters the distribution
network during mains breaks and repair. Evaluation of the break and repair process showed that, in practice,
sewage would be diluted by the potable water, and the dilution would be 99–99.99%. To evaluate the effect of
cleaning the network by flushing, pilot studies were conducted to determine the removal of sand, which was
selected as a conservative material, because higher flushing velocities are needed to fluidize sand particles
compared with other mineral soil materials. The pilot studies produced the relationship between flushing
velocity and log removal of the sand particles. Bench-scale disinfection studies were done to determine the
efficacy of chlor(am)ination on the inactivation of indicator organisms (MS2 as model virus, E. coli as model
bacterium and Bacillus spores as model parasite). The disinfection experiments were conducted in water
matrices such as encountered in practice. For the consumption of unheated water, survey data were used, and a
statistical (lognormal) distribution was fitted to the data.


Health effects assessment
Published dose–response relationships for norovirus, Cryptosporidium and E. coli O157 were used.

Risk characterization
To incorporate the variability and uncertainty in pathogen concentrations in the source, the dilution factor in the
mains, the efficacy of flushing and disinfection and the dose–response parameters, a probabilistic QMRA was
conducted. A Monte Carlo simulation that generated 10 000 samples of each of the model inputs to create 10 000
estimates of the risk of infection was undertaken (Fig. 9.3). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate
the sensitivity of the calculated risk to the different input parameters (pathogen concentration, dilution factor,
efficacy of flushing and disinfection, water consumption and dose–response parameters).

 Fig. 9.3 Risk of infection for the first customer after a main break event after dilution, flushing and disinfection
 (adapted from Kirmeyer et al., 2014)

 For each of the pathogens, the risk of infection was clearly above the health outcome target of 10−4 if no cleaning
 methods were applied. For Cryptosporidium, flushing at a minimum velocity of 3 ft·s−1 (0.9 m·s−1) was sufficient
 to reduce the risk below 10−4. For norovirus and E. coli O157, this was not the case, and additional disinfection
 was needed to further reduce their concentrations. The disinfection experiments indicated that a free chlorine
 concentration × contact time (ct) value of 100 mg·min·L−1 was needed (because of the presence of particulates)
 to achieve sufficient inactivation. The utility used this QMRA to translate the 10−4 risk of infection target to
 operational performance targets of flushing at >3 ft·s−1 (>0.9 m·s−1) and free chlorine disinfection at >100
 mg·min·L−1 to produce safe drinking-water after mains breaks.

9.2.3                 Operational targets and setting critical limits
QMRA can provide a scientific basis for setting operational targets and critical limits for water treatment and
system management. QMRA therefore allows for efficient implementation of control measures so that performance
is adequate but not excessive, so as to balance the allocation of resources and costs against the required health
benefit. This is of particular importance when balancing risks, such as of dosing of chemical disinfectants that lead
to the formation of potentially toxic disinfection by-products, against the benefits of disinfection of drinking-water.

In particular, when a treatment target (i.e. required log10 reduction) has been defined by a regulation or guideline
(e.g. using the approach illustrated in Fig. 9.1), it is necessary to design, monitor and control the operation of any
given control measure so that the required target is achieved. Traditional end-of-pipe testing that relies only on
the absence of faecal indicators is inadequate for verifying the operational integrity of the treatment train, as
mentioned in Chapter 1. Monitoring of control measures therefore predominantly relies on process indicators
(e.g. chlorine residual) rather than microbial sampling where operational targets and critical limits are generally
established. How well these process indicators can be correlated with treatment performance (in terms of log10
reduction) and hence consumer risk will be critical for further application in this area.

The concept and value of using QMRA to define operational and critical limits have been described in the literature
(Westrell et al., 2004; Nilsson et al., 2007; Smeets et al., 2010), although few examples exist. In particular,
defining the chemical dose and/or residence time required to achieve the necessary log10 reduction means that
suboptimal performance can be easily identified through measurable operational criteria, and corrective action
can be subsequently instigated. Box 9.3 gives an example of how QMRA can be used to derive critical limits for
chlorination. In another example, Åström et al. (2007) used QMRA to evaluate the adequacy of an E. coli–driven
operational limit (in collaboration with upstream event notification) on opening/closing a raw water intake at a
drinking-water treatment plant in Sweden.



76                Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
 Box 9.3 Setting critical limits
 A treatment system can be designed to provide exactly the right level of treatment to meet the performance
 targets. However, in practice, the risk manager needs to account for variations and inaccuracies in order to
 run a practical and stable process. A simulated example illustrates how QMRA can be used to set critical
 limits and setpoints for a water disinfection process. The performance target for the disinfection process was
 3 log10 inactivation of viruses. Chlorine concentration, contact time (flow), temperature and pH were monitored
 on-line and translated into virus log10 inactivation levels using an evidence-based disinfection model of the
 relationship between these conditions (including the residence time distribution in the contact chambers) and
 the log10 inactivation of enteroviruses. The required chlorine residual for 3 log10 inactivation was 1.7 mg·L−1, as
 determined by this disinfection model. This level was considered the critical limit: if the process was constantly
 run at exactly this concentration, the performance target would be met; conversely, if there was an exceedance
 of the critical limit, the target would not be met. In practice, the chlorine dose would vary as a result of
 operational variation. Chlorine dosing was controlled by an automatic control loop. The dosing rate was adjusted
 if the measured chlorine concentration deviated from the setpoint. As a result, the chlorine residual level would
 typically vary between the operational limits if the system was working within specifications, as indicated in
 Fig. 9.4. At hour 20, the chlorine dosing pump became clogged, resulting in a chlorine level below the operational
 limit. This triggered an alarm, and the operator was able to clean the pump and restore normal operation. This
 event did not affect the average treatment performance in such a way that the performance target would not be
 met, as the critical limit was not exceeded. At hour 80, the chlorine dosing pump failed again; this time, however,
 the operator was not in time to restore the system before the critical limit was exceeded. The short period of
 time during which disinfection was ineffective reduced the average treatment efficacy, as the critical limit was
 exceeded. Therefore, the operator needed to take corrective actions, such as starting emergency chlorination of
 the distributed water, in order to restore achievement of the performance target.

9.2.4    System planning and development
QMRA can be a valuable planning tool for assessing the next best steps for incremental improvement in health
outcomes. Some examples include the following:
• Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa (2006; see Box 9.4) used a deterministic QMRA for the assessment of
   different sources of drinking-water and subsequent prioritization of infrastructure investment to maximize
   health outcomes.
• In Case-study 2 (Annex A), Weir et al. (2011) used QMRA to evaluate the expected risk reduction associated with
   different interventions at a water spray park.
• In Ghana, QMRA was applied to estimate the risk to human health from various sources of drinking-water and

 Box 9.4 QMRA to determine the health risk associated with different types of water supplies
 This QMRA is summarized from Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa (2006), who conducted a QMRA on the water
 supply of Kampala, Uganda. The source water is Lake Victoria, and the water is treated by conventional
 treatment and chlorination and transported via a piped network to homes (20% of the population) or standpipes
 (52% of the population). Twenty-eight per cent of the population was collecting water from local springs. Data
 on thermotolerant coliforms were available for each of these types of water supply (at the tap and in
 household containers).


 Problem formulation
 The utility wanted to know the health risk associated with the three different types of water supply in Kampala.
 Based on the disease burden in Uganda and human and animal faecal contamination of the source water, E. coli
 O157 was selected as the reference pathogen for enteric bacteria. The end-point of the QMRA was DALYs, and
 local disease data were used to derive a local disease burden in DALYs per case.


 Exposure assessment
 No pathogen data were available. Data on faecal indicators from lake water, from the distribution network taps
 in homes and standpipes, from the springs and from household containers were available and used to estimate
 pathogenic E. coli concentrations in spring water, household containers, taps, standpipes and lake water and to
 estimate removal of the microorganisms through the water treatment processes (Table 9.1). Data on E. coli were
 used for E. coli O157 (using literature data on the fraction [8%] of pathogenic E. coli among total E. coli in water).
 Consumption of water was assumed to be 1 L per day.


 Health effects assessment
 Published dose–response relationships were used. The fraction of the population served by the different
 types of water supply was known and taken into account. The fraction was discounted for the use of water
 from multiple sources. The total population was considered vulnerable because immunity is short-lived. As
 indicated, local disease burden estimates were made based on information about the severity of illness and life
 expectancy in Uganda.

 Box 9.4 QMRA to determine the health risk associated with different types of water supplies (continued)

 Risk characterization
 A deterministic QMRA was conducted, using point estimates for each of the variables. The concentration of E. coli
 was translated to the concentration of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. The concentration in drinking-water was
 combined with the volume of drinking-water consumed (Table 9.1) to calculate the exposure of the population
 using each type of water supply. Using the dose–response and disease burden values (in the same way as in the
 WHO GDWQ Table 7.4 and the example in Chapter 2), the disease burden from enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157
 was calculated for the populations served by each of the water supply types (last row of Table 9.1). The risk was
 below the 10−6 DALY pppy guideline in the water leaving the treatment plant, but in the water arriving in the
 households, the risk was over 400-fold higher and did not meet the DALY guideline anymore. This highlighted the
 need for direct investment in improved operation and maintenance of the network, so this was a priority for risk
 management. In addition, the water from the springs and in the household containers collected at the standpipes
 yielded the highest estimated disease burden and therefore highlighted the need for effective household water
 treatment and safe storage in the interim and in the longer term to increase access to piped water in homes in
 order to protect public health. While another risk assessment approach (e.g. the risk matrix approach) may have
 resulted in the same conclusions, the QMRA provided further reassurance to justify investment priorities to
 maximize health outcomes.

9.3 Principles of QMRA that are relevant to risk management
Many examples have been cited that show the potential value of QMRA; in practice, however, the value of the
outcomes for decision support relies emphatically on the way in which uncertainty and variability have been
considered and accounted for in the overall analysis. Decision-makers need to be provided with an appreciation
of the representativeness of the QMRA results and the magnitude of the uncertainty surrounding any
ensuing recommendations.




                                                                           How can QMRA support water safety management?   79
There are several characteristics associated with QMRA investigations that are useful for risk management. The
following principles relate to each of the steps of the harmonized QMRA framework contained within this document:
• Problem formulation (Chapter 5):
    -- The QMRA is driven by the risk management need – the decision (and the required level of certainty for that
       decision) has driven the problem formulation.
    -- The QMRA is fit-for-purpose in terms of scope and level of detail.
    -- The QMRA is based on exposure scenarios consistent with the risk management options, local context and
       data constraints.

• Exposure assessment (Chapter 6):
  -- Factors influencing variability associated with each component of the exposure are considered and documented.
  -- The data and information used to quantify exposure are the most appropriate for use and weighed against
     the information in the scientific literature.

• Health effects assessment (Chapter 7):
  -- The representativeness of published dose–response models is evaluated.
  -- The QMRA is focused on the population exposed. As appropriate, it will give consideration to susceptible
     population subgroups and life stages.

• Risk characterization (Chapter 8):
  -- The quantities of risk calculated are driven by the problem and directly relate to the risk
     management decision.
  -- The influence of uncertainties on the outcome of the assessment is evaluated.

The following overarching principles support the development of QMRA investigations that provide a reliable and
defensible basis for risk management:
• Transparency: QMRA requires good record-keeping. All assumptions should be referenced and supported by
   the available data and the scientific literature. Procedures that are used for data processing should be explained
   and recorded. All steps, data inputs, key assumptions, limitations and decisions should be documented, along
   with associated rationale and justification. These should be clearly conveyed along with the results of the QMRA,
   and the potential impact on the results should be discussed, wherever possible. It is also good practice to
   construct computer models that clearly follow the structure of the conceptual model. Good documentation of the
   QMRA results in transparency, which enables peers, risk managers and other stakeholders to understand the
   basis for model development, data selection and processing, and assumptions. It is of great value in uncertainty
   analysis, verification, external review and communication of the model and results to the risk manager.
• Verification: The risk assessor should verify all elements of the QMRA to ensure that the model, data used,
   assumptions, calculations and uncertainties are appropriate. Where alternative assumptions could have been
   made, they should be evaluated together with other uncertainties (see also Chapter 8).
• Review: Peer review is an independent, external review of all elements in the QMRA (conceptual model,
   computational model, data, assumptions, uncertainty analysis and conclusions) to ensure that it meets the
   standards of the scientific community (Lammerding, 2007; Boone et al., 2010). It is advisable to start the peer
   review in the early stages of the QMRA, to facilitate proper data and model selection.

This transparency and the implementation of a robust verification and review process will help to increase
confidence that the QMRA approach taken is adequate for the risk management questions that the QMRA addresses
and that the conclusions about risk management options are credible.




80   Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
10                  CONCLUSIONS AND
                    NEXT STEPS

In this document, the following factors for facilitating the effective implementation of QMRA for practical system
management have been identified and explored:
• There is considerable value in adopting a harmonized approach to QMRA across the water-related exposure
    routes: drinking-water, wastewater and excreta reuse, and recreational water. These exposure routes
    should not be considered in isolation, as they are linked within environmental systems, and public health risk
    management actions need to be balanced between these community exposure routes. In addition, scientific
    considerations associated with the occurrence, fate/transport, exposures and health impacts overlap between
    exposure routes, adding to the value of a harmonized approach. Nonetheless, it is understood that current
    jurisdictional issues may hamper such a broad approach.
• The value of the outcomes of any QMRA rests firmly on the appropriate interpretation of the scientific evidence
    and hence the representativeness of the model input assumptions. It is therefore important for risk assessors
    to incorporate variability and uncertainty analyses into risk assessment and communicate clearly with risk
    managers regarding the implications of variability and uncertainty on the risk outcomes.
• QMRA has been shown to support a wide range of water safety management decisions. The case-studies
    included within this document (see Annex A) highlight the value of QMRA for the evaluation of different
    hazards and alternative risk management options, determining risk management priorities, selecting the
    most effective interventions, supporting cost–benefit analysis of risk management actions and setting of
    health-based performance targets. These case-studies also illustrate that QMRA can support different
    levels of risk management – from (supra)national water safety regulations, strategies and policies to utility
    management priorities.
• Overall, QMRA is an aid to provide evidence-based understanding of hazards and their control in water systems
    and therefore provides valuable insight for risk management. Risk management usually requires delicate trade-
                                                                                                                               Chapter 10


    offs: proportionate allocation of resources to the most effective risk management measures or the weighing
    of water safety management against other societal demands. QMRA is the tool to provide the evidence base to
    support proportionate, efficient water safety management. It is essential that risk assessors work together
    with risk managers from the problem formulation stage of the QMRA to ensure that the assessment is fit-for-
    purpose.

To support broader application of QMRA, additional case-study applications from countries or regions with few
resources and high diarrhoeal disease burdens are needed. Although QMRA has been identified to be of value in
the developing country context, particularly for prioritizing interventions and resource allocation, practical case-
studies from such settings are still limited and largely theoretical. The majority of the skills and experience within
QMRA have been developed in resource-rich settings with low disease burdens and cannot give due consideration
to the practical realities of data-limited environments with high disease burdens.




                                                                                             Conclusions and next steps   81
Whereas expert opinion is essential in the selection of model inputs and assumptions, it is increasingly recognized
that a more systematic approach to evaluating data sources may be valuable. Currently, such a system does not
exist for environmental data and QMRA, and therefore development of a suitable system to weigh evidence
associated with environmental data and QMRA would facilitate the robustness of QMRA.

The application of QMRA for water systems would be facilitated by a public, web-based compendium of:
• case-studies that demonstrate the value of QMRA in different settings and for different purposes;
• research studies that provide additional scientific basis and methodology for QMRA;
• input data, such as pathogen concentrations in different water matrices, data on pathogen removal by different
   barriers under different conditions, data on exposure volumes and dose–response data.

Examples of such compendia are available: QMRAwiki (http://qmrawiki.canr.msu.edu/) and for food risk
management (http://www.foodrisk.org). This guidance document has assembled and discussed the three
elements (QMRA science and methodology, input data and case-studies) and can serve as a starting point for such
a compendium.

ANNEX A                                               CASE-STUDIES

A1 Case-study 1: Pathogen risk to swimmers at non-sewage-impacted recreational
   beaches in the USA (Schoen & Ashbolt, 2010)

A1.1   Introduction
The USEPA uses faecal indicator bacterial criteria, based on epidemiological studies from human wastewater–
impacted beaches, to identify bathing waters that exceed thresholds of concern (USEPA, 2012). There is concern,
however, that non-sewage-impacted beaches may receive a different range and magnitude of pathogens from
animal origin and may require an alternative standard to be equally protective of human health. Hence, the faecal
indicator criteria may represent different levels of risk for beaches not impacted by human wastewaters. The high
cost and impracticability of undertaking many epidemiological studies, along with the lack of any clear relationship
between indicator and health outcome for non-human-impacted beaches (Boehm et al., 2009), led the USEPA to
develop QMRA assessments for bathing beaches that are contaminated by different sources. The USEPA used
QMRA to bring together scientific information regarding the relative occurrence of pathogens in different faecal
sources and the infectivity and probability of illness associated with those pathogens to explore the relative
contribution of different faecal sources to swimmers’ health risk. The specific aim of this case-study was to explore
how beaches contaminated by human sewage and by gulls may affect swimmers’ health risk.

This case-study shows how QMRA can be used to derive site-specific bathing water criteria that are scientifically
defensible and protective of human health.


A1.2   Problem formulation
The purpose of the QMRA was to:
• explore the risk to bathers associated with enterococci (i.e. faecal load) from seagulls compared with sewage
   for a water body at the USEPA-recommended water quality limit of culturable enterococci equal to 35
   CFU·100 mL−1; and
• predict when or if a non-sewage source of pathogens (seagulls) may dominate the illness risk in a water body
   affected by a mixture of sources.

The scope was defined by the following:
• Hazard identification: The hazards of concern were those causing gastrointestinal illness, sourced from
   poorly treated sewage and from gull excreta. Seagulls were assumed to contribute two reference pathogens:
                                                                                                                           Annexes




   Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica. Sewage was assumed to contribute four reference pathogens
   commonly reported in wastewater effluent: norovirus, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp. and S. enterica.




                                                                                                          Annex A     91
• Exposure pathway: Unintentional ingestion of surface waters while swimming in waters with enterococci at
  a concentration of 35 CFU·100 mL−1, where the enterococci originated from either seagull excreta or poorly
  treated sewage (or a combination of the two).
• Health outcome: Probability of gastrointestinal illness.


A1.3      Exposure assessment
The exposure pathway and conceptual model applied to predicting exposure are illustrated in Fig. A1.1.

A1.3.1 Source
The exposure dose was estimated based on the enterococci concentration, with consideration given to the source of
the faecal indicator relative to the pathogens, using the formula:
        CENT ∙FS
 S =
µrp                  S ∙pS∙V		
                   ∙Rrp                                                                         Eq. A1.1
         S ∙100
        RENT
where:
   S is the dose of each reference pathogen from each source (sewage or seagulls) (CFU, (oo)cysts or genomes)
  µrp
     CENT is   the surf zone enterococci concentration (CFU·100 mL−1)
     FS is   the fraction of enterococci from source S
      S
     RENT  is the ratio of the count of enterococci to the wet mass of a composite seagull excreta sample (CFU·g−1) or to
           the volume of sewage (CFU·L−1)
      S is the ratio of the count of reference pathogen to the wet mass of a composite gull excreta sample or to the
     Rrp
         volume of sewage
     pS is the fraction of human-infectious pathogenic strains for the reference pathogen from source S
     V is the volume of water ingested (mL)

The quantitative distribution of values applied in the exposure assessment are summarized in Table A1.1. For full

A1.4       Health effects assessment
The dose–response relationships and the probability of illness given infection used in the study are summarized in
Table A1.2.


A1.5       Risk characterization
Variability in the exposure parameters was modelled using Monte Carlo simulation of the defined distributions
(Table A1.1). Point estimates of parameter values were used for dose–response models (Table A1.2). Therefore,
the distribution of gastrointestinal illness risk captured the variability and uncertainty in pathogen dose (based
on the variability in defined model inputs) and did not incorporate the uncertainty from the dose–response
relationships. The influence of the selected dose–response models on the predicted risk was discussed in the
original publication.

The predicted illness risk by pathogen is illustrated in Fig. A1.2, with the median illness risk associated with
                                                                                                                                               Annexes

 Sensitivity analysis provided a useful tool for exploring the interaction between model parameters. The authors
 first undertook a sensitivity analysis of the parameters driving exposure using the Spearman rank correlation
 coefficients of the Monte Carlo simulation (Fig. A1.3). For the risk attributable to seagulls, the volume of water
 ingested (V), the density of faecal indicator bacteria (enterococci) in faeces and the density of C. jejuni in faeces
 were of relative equivalent importance. The density of Salmonella in the faeces and the fraction of human-infectious
 pathogens in the faeces were relatively less important.

 Owing to the lack of data, the authors were specifically concerned with further investigating the sensitivity of the
 calculated risk to the fraction of human-infectious pathogen strains from gulls. The results of the parametric
 sensitivity analysis are illustrated in Fig. A1.4. The illness risk associated with gull excreta further decreased as
 the assumed fraction of the total pathogen strains from gulls that are human infectious decreased below the best
 estimate of 0.2.

 The model was also used to explore the relative importance of the two sources when there is a mixture (Fig. A1.5).
 Considering all possible mixtures along the x-axis, the median predicted probability of gastrointestinal illness from
 gulls was greater than that from a sewage mixture only when gulls represented greater than 98% of the faecal
 indicator load. Therefore, the dominant source of faecal indicators at a recreational beach may not be the dominant
 source of risk. Conversely, a little fresh sewage contamination mixed with non-sewage source(s) may dominate
 risk, and possibly at a level that may exceed the benchmark risk, when more than 20% of enterococci originate
 from sewage.

  A1.6                                         Risk management
  The results of the QMRA provide a quantitative basis to inform the understanding of the dynamics associated with
  pathogen risks from different sources of contamination. It is theoretically considered that the source of the faecal
  indicators will influence the consumer risk, and in this study, the dynamics of different sources were quantitatively
  explored. Firstly, the results confirm, as expected, that, at the same concentration of enterococci, the predicted
  risks to swimmers were lower in waters contaminated by gulls than in waters contaminated by sewage. Secondly,
  the study identified that the dominant source of faecal indicators may not be the dominant source of risk. Site
  evaluation by sanitary survey and MST approaches cannot simply focus on prioritizing faecal sources based on
  size, but must recognize that smaller sources may be important to the downstream risk profile. The USEPA has
  used this and similar studies to develop a QMRA-based approach to derive alternative recreational water criteria
  that are equally protective of human health in non-sewage-impacted beaches.


  A1.7                                         Evaluation of the QMRA
  This study allowed for the quantitative issues associated with faecal indicator sources to be explored and provided
  a quantitative basis for the assumption that non-human-impacted waters may pose a lower risk to consumers
  than human-impacted waters, an issue that could not be easily explored using epidemiological approaches alone.
  Whereas many of the model inputs were uncertain, sensitivity analysis was applied to understand the dynamics
  and inter-relationships between model variables, which proved valuable. The QMRA was considered a strong tool
  to compare the risk of alternative pathogen sources and was used by the USEPA to evaluate agricultural sources as
  well as to inform the near ambient water quality criteria (USEPA, 2012). The study also facilitated the identification
  of research and data gaps, such as the importance of quantifying the probability that a pathogen from different
  animal sources is human infectious.

A2 Case-study 2: Water reclamation redesign for reducing Cryptosporidium risks at
   a recreational spray park in the USA (Weir et al., 2011)

A2.1    Introduction
Outbreaks associated with spray parks, also known as recreational waterparks, are well recognized and may be
partly due to the engineering designs used for their water reclamation systems, which are problematic to control.
Weir and coworkers (2011) undertook this investigation based on an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis linked to a spray
park in New York State, where it had been determined by epidemiological investigation that the spray pad (the main
attraction) was the primary exposure point. The outbreak affected 746 people who reported gastrointestinal illness
after visiting the spray park facility.

After the outbreak, an investigation and risk assessment were launched to determine the likely cause and to
evaluate potential design changes to prevent future outbreaks. This case-study illustrates the use of QMRA to
identify different management strategies that could reduce future outbreaks from spray parks.


A2.2    Problem formulation
The purpose of the QMRA was to evaluate possible gastrointestinal risk due to exposure to water contaminated
with Cryptosporidium oocysts and to evaluate the efficacy of potential combined treatment retrofits aimed at
reducing recreational risks. Two main design changes were proposed: removing the pipe between Tank 2 and Tank
1 (which was likely acting as a bypass) from the treatment system, and the combination of removing this pipe and
adding an ozone contactor.

The scope was defined by the following:
• Hazard identification: The assessment focused on Cryptosporidium oocysts, the source of the outbreak in 2005.
• Exposure pathways: The source of Cryptosporidium oocysts was considered to be associated with oocyst-
   infected individuals contaminating the water during recreation. The contaminated water was then assumed to
   be recirculated through the system, and individuals were exposed by involuntary consumption during
   recreational activities.
• Health outcomes: Probability of infection and probability of illness.


A2.3    Exposure assessment
The exposure was assessed for a 3-hour simulation of the spray pad system following a hypothetical faecal release
incident. The exposure pathway modelled in the QMRA is illustrated in Fig. A2.1.


A2.3.1 Source
A hypothetical faecal release of 2 × 107 oocysts (approximately 2 g of faeces) (Chappell et al., 1996; Yoder & Beach,
2007) was simulated.


A2.3.2 Controls
• Dilution: The treatment system received recreational water from two drains in the centre of the spray pad (Fig.
  A2.2a is a flow chart of the unaltered system). Water is retained from the spray pad in Tank 1, before being
  treated by filtration and free chlorine disinfection. Tank 1 is also used to hold and return treated water to the
  spray pad, which has the unintended effect of bypassing the treatment system.
• Inactivation: The inactivation of oocysts in neutral water was assumed to be 0.000 363·h−1 (Robertson, Campbell
  & Smith, 1992).
• Filtration: The filter was assumed to operate continuously and properly during the season with a sufficient
  schmutzdecke (complex biological scum layer formed at the top of a filter, essentially the main treatment layer
  of the filter) developed for removal of oocysts (and other pathogens). Treatment efficacy = 0.99 (Schuler, Ghosh
  & Gopalan, 1991).
• Ozone: The oocyst inactivation fraction at 2 mg·L−1 for 1 minute was assumed to be 0.79 (Corona-Vasquez et al.,
  2002).

unchanged system; b) configuration-2, which is the first suggested change, with the removal of the bypass pipe;

                                                                                                                                                                                                   Annex A     99
Given the complexity of water flow within the reclamation and treatment system, a Markov chain model was
constructed to simulate the flows and efficacy through the system. A distribution was fitted to the simulated
concentration of oocysts in the water released at the spray pad under the existing configuration (Ca)
(configuration-1) and with the removal of the bypass pipe (Cb) (configuration-2) and the removal of the bypass pipe
with inclusion of ozone (Cc) (configuration-3).


A2.3.3 Intake
The exposure volume was defined using data on accidental ingestion of water during swimming from Dufour et al.
(2006) as an assumed constant value of 0.108 L.


A2.4 Health effects assessment
The dose–response relationship for probability of infection due to ingestion of Cryptosporidium oocysts was
described by the exponential dose–response model (i.e. a single-parameter model, referred to in the original
publication as k, here identified as r for consistency). The parameter used in the analysis was optimized from
human volunteer studies (USEPA, 2005b); r was defined by a triangular distribution (0.0074, 0.0907, 0.3044)
reflecting minimal, average and maximum likely values for r. The probability of illness given infection was assumed
to be 0.5, citing USEPA (2005a).


A2.5    Risk characterization
Monte Carlo simulation was used to characterize the risk (Pinf and Pill) to the population exposed to water
contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocysts with the current treatment system and under each of the two
modifications. The results are illustrated in Fig. A2.3. For the current system, 60% of the infection risks were equal
to or greater than 0.9. When the bypass was eliminated from the water reclamation system and all the water was
filtered, the overall risk levels were reduced (with 44% of the infection risks equal to or greater than 0.9). When the
bypass was removed and an ozone contactor was included, the risk levels were further reduced (with 32% of the
infection risks equal to or greater than 0.9).


A2.6 Risk management
In response to the results of the risk analysis, it was recommended that, at a minimum, the removal of the bypass
pipe would be necessary to reduce the risks associated with waterborne disease. Although the inclusion of the
ozone contactor would be expected to further reduce the risks, this was not at a sufficiently appreciable risk
reduction compared with the less costly retrofit.

The authors also identified that, given the high relative risks still related to this spray park and the exposure
scenario, a risk communication strategy may be a simple and very cost-effective means of mitigating risk to users
– something as simple as a pamphlet warning users of potential pathogen exposure or a staff member who can be
consulted with questions that users may have regarding the potential risks from spray park recreation. This study
illustrates that water treatment for recreational venues such as spray parks demands more attention to protect
public health.


A2.7    Evaluation of the QMRA
The systematic approach of investigating an outbreak and undertaking a QMRA that included a stochastic model to
simulate the treatment system brought to light the relatively high potential risk from the water reclamation system
used at the spray park. Identification of two potential risk mitigation strategies from the problem formulation stage
drove the scope of the risk assessment and allowed for the predicted risks associated with each scenario to be
compared, providing quantitative input for decision support.

A3 Case-study 3: Evaluating Cryptosporidium risk at a large number of drinking-
   water systems in France (Medema et al., 2009)

A3.1    Introduction
Suez Environnement operates, through Lyonnaise-des-Eaux, a large number (>1500) of drinking-water systems
in France. After the waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis reported in the USA and the United Kingdom, Suez
Environnement wanted to develop an approach to evaluate the risk of transmitting Cryptosporidium through their
water systems. This case-study illustrates how QMRA allowed an objective, quantitative and transparent process to
provide management with sufficient information to discriminate Cryptosporidium risk between many water systems
and determine priorities for risk management.


A3.2    Problem formulation
The purpose of the QMRA was to:
• evaluate compliance with the European Union drinking-water directive (which states that drinking-water must
   be free from “parasites … which in numbers or concentrations, … constitute a potential danger to human health”;
   EU, 2014);
• identify whether any of these systems was at risk from Cryptosporidium; and
• prioritize investments (if needed).

The scope of the QMRA was defined by:
• Hazard identification: The assessment was undertaken only for the reference pathogen Cryptosporidium,
   because of its likely presence in source waters and the difficulty to remove or inactivate the pathogen by
   treatment, particularly as a result of its resistance to chemical disinfection.
• Exposure pathways: Surface water from a range of different catchment types and groundwater sources,
   treated by a range of different treatment trains, and exposure via the consumption of unboiled tap water.
• Health outcomes: Annual probability of infection.


A3.3    Exposure assessment
A questionnaire was sent to the operators of each system, inquiring about the volume of water produced, the
type of source water used, including information on the type of environment (urban, rural, presence of cattle,
etc.) and data on general water quality parameters (coliforms, turbidity, ammonium and nitrate), and the type of
treatment processes used. The returned information covered treatment facilities that supply 9 million people
with drinking‑water.


A3.3.1 Source
The information from the survey was used to categorize the different water systems. These included groundwater
systems, groundwater systems under the influence of surface water, surface water systems, and systems with
drinking-water that were a blend of the former systems. Information on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium in
surface water and groundwater was available from the scientific literature (Fig. A3.1). It was assumed that these
data were representative for all systems, and they were used to estimate the concentration of Cryptosporidium in
each of the source water types identified, using a conservative estimation (Fig. A3.2).

A3.3.2 Controls
Information on the removal or inactivation of Cryptosporidium by various treatment processes was obtained from
studies performed by the Centre International de Recherche sur l’Eau et l’Environnement (CIRSEE), the main
research and expertise centre of Suez Environnement, and collected from the scientific literature. Generic log10
removals were assigned to each of the individual treatment processes (Fig. A3.3) under the assumptions that 1)
the generic log10 removals described the treatment performance at each site adequately and 2) performance of

The exponential dose–response model of Cryptosporidium parvum (Iowa strain; see Annex D) was used (r = 0.004)
(DuPont et al., 1995).


A3.5                                           Risk characterization
For each system, a treatment performance target was defined according to the estimated concentration of
Cryptosporidium in source water, in order to achieve one of these three levels of risk:
1) A low level of risk was related to a Cryptosporidium concentration of 0.003 per 100 L of source water. This
   concentration was derived from a health-based target of a probability of infection of 10−4 pppy (Haas et
   al., 1996).
2) A medium level of risk was related to the analytical detection limit of Cryptosporidium, which was determined to
   be 0.3 oocyst per 100 L. The associated probability of infection was 10−2 pppy.
3) A high level of risk was arbitrarily set at 30 oocysts per 100 L. The associated probability of infection was
   0.6 pppy.

The treatment capacity of each treatment facility was compared with these treatment performance targets, and a
level of risk was assigned to each facility accordingly (Fig. A3.4).

A3.6 Risk management
The risk assessment highlighted that the sites at higher risk were primarily small systems (serving <5000 people)
and groundwater systems that were under the influence of surface water. The operating conditions of the treatment
plants located in the medium- and high-risk categories were reviewed in order to check that the recommended
best practices were being applied.

To support the outcome of the risk assessment, a Cryptosporidium monitoring programme was conducted at
selected sites from each of the risk categories. In this monitoring programme, treated water samples were
collected every 2 weeks for a period of at least 6 months and analysed for Cryptosporidium (and Giardia) and other
water quality parameters: turbidity, coliforms, aerobic spores, temperature, pH, conductivity, UV transmission and
ammonium. Additional samples were taken during turbidity peaks.

The results of the Cryptosporidium monitoring were consistent with the risk assessment: high-risk sites showed
the highest frequency of samples positive for Cryptosporidium, and the highest concentrations were observed at
these sites. No Cryptosporidium was found at any of the low-risk sites, and the medium-risk sites gave intermediate
results. There was also a good correlation between the presence of Cryptosporidium and high turbidity. The
verification of the QMRA using the monitoring data was very valuable to convince the risk managers and owners of
the water supplies that the QMRA results are a valid and good basis for setting risk management priorities.




104 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
The main risk factors for Cryptosporidium that were found were the presence of cattle in the catchment area, less
than 99% compliance with the coliform standard and turbidity of greater than 0.2 nephelometric turbidity unit
(NTU) in distributed water. The company has audited the high-risk sites and, where necessary, has upgraded the
treatment facilities in accordance with the local health authority. Furthermore, Suez Environnement has since used
the same risk assessment approach for the waterworks that they operate in other countries.


A3.7    Evaluation of the QMRA
The QMRA provided adequate information for Suez Environnement to underpin the need for further risk control
measures in some of their systems and to prioritize the systems. The QMRA was also a means to demonstrate due
diligence to the customers and regulator. The QMRA guided the next steps: audit of the medium- and high-risk sites
and confirmation of the conclusions by a dedicated Cryptosporidium monitoring programme.

System population size could have been added to inform the prioritization, as larger systems in the high-risk
category have a greater potential overall public health impact compared with smaller systems. It is noted, however,
that smaller systems may not be operated as well as larger systems. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis, wherein
each of the input values is replaced by a value that would represent an extreme event (e.g. peak contamination in
source water, [partial] failure of the treatment process), could provide information about the robustness of the
systems and the relative contribution of each of the steps in the system to overall safety.

A4 Case-study 4: USEPA Long Term Surface Water Treatment Rule – health benefit
   of a new drinking-water regulation in the USA (USEPA, 2005)

A4.1    Introduction
The Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2ESWTR) was developed by the USEPA in 2005 to
strengthen protection against microbial contaminants, especially Cryptosporidium, in drinking-water delivered
by public water supplies that use surface water or groundwater under the direct influence of surface water. As a
result, systems now monitor their public water for Cryptosporidium sources to provide further data to reassess
against the standard treatment requirements set out in the LT2ESWTR for the control of Cryptosporidium via
drinking-water.

This case-study addresses the USEPA’s requirement to demonstrate the health costs and benefits of a new
regulation, here described for Cryptosporidium management to control endemic cryptosporidiosis via drinking-
water. It also provides an example of a probabilistic risk analysis that evaluates both variability and uncertainty at
the same time and includes probabilistic treatments of uncertain dose–response and occurrence parameters.


A4.2 Problem formulation
The purpose of the QMRA was to estimate the number of illnesses and deaths associated with endemic
cryptosporidiosis that would be avoided because of the LT2ESWTR. The quantified health benefits estimated were
derived from calculating the difference between illness and death estimates for the baseline (pre-LT2ESWTR)
condition and illness and death estimates after implementation of the LT2ESWTR. This rule was expected to reduce
health effects associated with other pathogens such as Giardia and other waterborne bacterial or viral pathogens,
although these health benefits were not quantified.

The scope was defined by:
• Hazard identification: Cryptosporidium was selected as a significant concern in drinking-water because it
   commonly occurs in surface waters, is resistant to chlorine-based disinfectants and causes numerous
   waterborne disease outbreaks. Consumption of water containing Cryptosporidium can cause gastrointestinal
   illness, which may be severe and sometimes fatal for people with weakened immune systems (which may
   include very young children, the elderly, and people with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
   immunodeficiency syndrome [HIV/AIDS]).
• Exposure pathways: Drinking-water produced from surface water and groundwater under the direct influence
   of surface water systems.
• Health outcomes: Cases of cryptosporidiosis and associated deaths.


A4.3    Exposure assessment

A4.3.1 Source
To characterize the exposure to infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts in surface waters, the USEPA estimated the
source water contamination levels using each of three data sets:
1) Information Collection Rule (ICR) for all large systems;
2) Information Collection Rule Supplemental Surveys Medium (ICRSSM) for systems serving 10 000–99 999 people; and
3) Information Collection Rule Supplemental Surveys Large (ICRSSL) for large plants serving more than
   100 000 people.

A lognormal distribution was fitted to each data set using the number of oocysts detected (counts), the associated
sample volume analysed and test method recovery rates and assuming that each observed count came from a
Poisson probability distribution.

The percentage of oocysts that were infectious was modelled by a triangular distribution having a lower bound
of 30%, a mode of 40% and an upper bound of 50% for data sets derived from the ICRSSM and ICRSSL (data sets
2 and 3) and a lower bound of 15%, a mode of 20% and an upper bound of 25% for data sets derived from the ICR
(data set 1).




106 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
A4.3.2 Controls
The USEPA used the 2000 Community Water System Survey data to obtain information on the number of
treatment plants per system, the source of water treated at each plant and the type of treatment in place. The
analysis excluded systems whose flow rates per person were unusually high or low and those plants that treated
groundwater or purchased water only. The predicted log10 removal achieved for systems was modelled using a
triangular distribution (defined by minimum, mode and maximum) as follows:
• For small systems (serving fewer than 10 000 people): minimum to maximum range of 2–4 log10 removal
    to capture system-to-system variability. Mode varied between 2.25 and 3.25 log10 removal, intended to
    capture uncertainty.
• For large systems (those serving at least 10 000 people): minimum to maximum range of 2–5 log10
    removal to capture system-to-system variability. Mode varied between 2.5 and 3.5 log10 removal, intended to
    capture uncertainty.


A4.3.3 Intake
The volume of individual daily drinking-water consumption was estimated to be 1.07 L per person per day. To
account for the annual days of exposure, the model assigned exposure days per year for community water systems
at 350, for non-transient non-community water systems at 250 and for transient non-community water systems
at 180.


A4.4 Health effects assessment
In the dose–response assessment, the USEPA utilized the following:
• Infection dose–response function: The USEPA considered results from three human volunteer feeding studies
    – TAMU (collected from a veterinary student exposed during necropsy of an infected foal), Iowa (derived from a
    calf) and UCP (derived from a calf). A variant of the exponential dose–response model was fitted to the data sets
    using a Bayesian approach (mean value of r = 0.036).
• Morbidity following infection: For the purpose of this risk assessment, the morbidity rate was independent of
    dose, with a central tendency (mode) of 50%, a lower bound of 30% and an upper bound of 70%.
• Mortality given that an illness has occurred: Based on the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Milwaukee, USA
    (50 deaths per 400 000 illnesses), this rate was adjusted to reflect changes in rates of illnesses and advanced
    treatments that have lessened mortality among persons living with HIV/AIDS. Further adjustments were used
    to reflect the differences between the populations living in areas served by filtered and unfiltered systems (a
    factor of 11.45 for unfiltered systems and a factor of 6.93 for filtered systems).


A4.5 Risk characterization
The mean annual cases of illness and death using each source water data set are summarized in Table A4.1. The
differences between the pre-rule and post-rule cryptosporidiosis estimates were the basis for obtaining the
“cases avoided”. The USEPA estimated that full implementation of the LT2ESWTR will reduce the incidence of
cryptosporidiosis within the range of 84 609–464 069 mean illnesses per year (90% confidence bound across the
three data sets ranging from 7 778 to 1 324 897 cases avoided; results not shown), with an associated reduction of
14–77 mean deaths (90% confidence bound across the three data sets of 1–219; results not shown). The additional
Cryptosporidium treatment requirements of the LT2ESWTR will also reduce exposure to other microbial pathogens,
such as Giardia, that co-occur with Cryptosporidium.


A4.6 Risk management
The QMRA provides a best estimate of the benefits expected in terms of cases of cryptosporidiosis avoided from
the LT2ESWTR rule, providing a valuable risk communication tool. The assessment was also used to identify
systems that would require corrective action and the nature of the actions likely to be implemented.

A4.7    Evaluation of the QMRA
Microbial risk assessment, comprising a two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation model, was used to characterize
the expected incidence of adverse health effects associated with exposure to Cryptosporidium and to quantify the
benefit estimates of implementing the LT2ESWTR by calculating the difference between illness and death estimates
for the baseline condition (pre-LT2ESWTR) and after implementation of the rule.

The difference between the results for data sets 1, 2 and 3 (Table A4.1) highlights the importance of the assumed
Cryptosporidium source water concentration to the risk assessment results and hence the uncertainty associated
with the selection of the most appropriate data set.

108 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
A5 Case-study 5: Guidelines for water recycling – Setting health-based
   performance targets and safe use of wastewater in Australia (NWQMS, 2006)

A5.1   Introduction
In Australia, the beginning of the 21st century has been characterized by increased pressure on freshwater
supplies in most large cities and in many regional areas. It has been identified that water traditionally seen as
wastewater, such as sewage effluent and stormwater, should be considered as a water resource and should be
used more widely, particularly in situations where water is not required to be of drinking-water quality. As part
of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, guidelines were needed that would provide a nationally
consistent approach to the treatment and recycling of sewage, greywater and stormwater. This case-study
illustrates the use of QMRA to support guidelines on the setting of health-based performance targets for the safe
use of recycled water.


A5.2 Problem formulation
The purpose of the QMRA was to provide national guidelines on the setting of health-based performance targets to
ensure the safe use of recycled water. Following the guidance contained within the GWEG (WHO, 2006), for a given
magnitude of contamination in the source water and a defined use, the required level of treatment was quantified in
order to meet the health-based target of 1 × 10−6 DALY pppy.

The scope of the QMRA was defined by:
• Hazard identification: The guidelines are intended to address all enteric pathogens that may be present in
   sewage and greywater, and therefore three reference pathogens were selected, one to represent each of the
   three pathogen groups:
   -- Bacteria: Campylobacter was selected, as it is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in
      Australia.
   -- Viruses: A reference virus that incorporated a combination of rotavirus and adenovirus characteristics,
      using occurrence data for adenovirus and dose–response data for rotavirus.
   -- Protozoa: Cryptosporidium was selected, as it has high infectivity, is resistant to chlorination and is one of the
      most important waterborne human pathogens in the world.

• Exposure pathways: The source material was sewage and/or greywater, treated and then used for a range of
  purposes, as illustrated in Fig. A5.1. Consideration was given to both intended and unintended uses.
• Health outcomes: After consideration of preventive measures, residual risk should be less than 10 –6 DALY pppy.


A5.3   Exposure assessment

A5.3.1 Source
A deterministic QMRA was recommended, using point values to represent the inflow pathogen concentration. Given
variability in the concentration of pathogens in wastewater and greywater, the upper 95th percentile was selected
as the default point value:
• Sewage concentration: The 95th percentile of data from two Australian schemes (details of data sets not
    given) (unpublished data, South Australia Department of Health and Melbourne Water): Campylobacter = 7000
    organisms·L−1; adenovirus = 8000 organisms·L−1; and Cryptosporidium = 2000 oocysts·L−1.
• Greywater concentration: The arithmetic mean E. coli concentration was used as a surrogate for faecal
    contamination to determine the dilution of sewage in the greywater – that is, 105 E. coli per 100 mL (assumed to
    be equivalent to 1% sewage).

a Shuval, Lampert & Fattal (1997).

b ABS data show that 12% of households grow lettuce and 35% grow some type of produce (ABS, 1995); they also show that Australians eat

  leafy vegetables 140 times per year and eat other vegetables at a similar rate (ABS, 1995). Hence, it can be estimated that “other produce”,
  such as tomatoes, carrots, etc., in combination, are eaten 280 times per year. Watering with recycled water is used to augment rainfall.
  Assuming that watering occurs for 6 months of the year, frequency of consumption of lettuce irrigated with recycled water = 140 × 0.5 × 12%,
  and frequency of consumption of other raw produce = 280 × 0.5 × 35%.
c Using the same ABS data as in note b, frequency of consumption of lettuce irrigated with recycled water = 140 × 0.5 for lettuce, and frequency

  of consumption of other raw produce = 280 × 0.5.
d ABS data show average of 2.6 people per household (ABS, 2001). The amount of washing is estimated at five loads per week; therefore, the

A5.5 Risk characterization
The information from the exposure assessment and health effects assessment was combined to determine the
magnitude of risk and to quantify the required level of treatment in order to meet the health-based target. The risk
was therefore recommended to be assessed on two levels:
1) Maximum risk: risk in the absence of preventive measures;
2) Residual risk: risk that remains after consideration of existing preventive measures.

After consideration of preventive measures, residual risk should be less than 10−6 DALY pppy.

Performance targets for microbial hazards represent the reductions required to achieve a residual risk that
complies with the tolerable level of 10−6 DALY pppy.

log10 reduction = log10 (concentration in source water × exposure × N ÷ DALYd) Eq. A5.1

where N is the frequency of exposure per year and DALYd is the dose equivalent to a DALY of 10−6 (1.6 × 10−2
Cryptosporidium, 2.5 × 10−3 rotavirus, 3.8 × 10−2 Campylobacter). DALYd includes consideration of dose–response
and ratio of infection to illness.

Table A5.4 summarizes example calculations (full details of calculations included in Appendix 2 of NWQMS [2006]).

Table A5.4 shows that viruses require the highest log10 reductions. This reflects the high infectivity of viruses
compared with bacteria and the higher disease burden of viruses compared with protozoa (in rare cases, rotavirus

infections can be fatal, and Cryptosporidium causes self-limiting diarrhoea with no long-term impacts for the
general population). Table A5.4 also shows that the possibility of cross-connections represents a significant
proportion of the exposure associated with dual-reticulation systems. Decreasing the likelihood of cross-
connections would reduce the required log10 reductions.

A5.6 Risk management
Recycled water guidelines commonly specify combinations of treatment processes (Table A5.5) together with
on-site controls (Table A5.6) and use restrictions to provide water of acceptable quality for identified uses. Using
treatment as the primary means of minimizing risk from microbial hazards focuses control within a treatment
plant. However, treatment is relatively expensive, and management of this type of facility requires a high degree of
technical expertise.

Employing on-site controls and use restrictions reduces the focus on treatment. Controls can be used in
combination with standard recycled water treatment processes that are often used for treating sewage (e.g.
secondary treatment, storage lagoons and disinfection), with or without recycling of the final product. In this way,
                                                                                                                                            Annexes




recycling can be introduced at existing facilities without the need for expensive retrofitting or treatment upgrades.
However, when on-site controls and use restrictions are employed, preventive measures are spread over a much

broader area, and some measures might need to be implemented at a local user level. As a result, there is a
greater need for observational monitoring, user education, surveillance and auditing.

The preventive measures chosen will be determined by issues such as:
• cost;
• intended use;
• existing treatment facilities;
• technical expertise;
• availability of land (e.g. if buffer zones are to be used);
• public access (e.g. use in tourist areas within capital cities compared with recycling in rural towns); and
• public perception and requirements.

114 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
A5.7       Evaluation of the QMRA
The approach adopted in the development of the Australian recycled water guidelines was necessarily conservative
because of the many sources of uncertainty in the QMRA assumptions and expected log10 reductions achieved by
different control measures. However, the QMRA provided a structured quantitative framework to allow for a
diverse range of potential recycled water uses to be evaluated. The current level of scientific knowledge could be
incorporated, with the opportunity for local refinement. Most importantly, the approach allowed for appropriate
combinations of treatment options, and preventive measures could be selected to ensure that the water was
fit‑for‑purpose.

116 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
A6 Case-study 6: WHO health-based criteria for evaluating household water
   treatment technologies

A6.1   Introduction
Globally, an estimated 663 million people lack access to improved drinking-water sources (UNICEF/WHO, 2015);
even where improved sources are available, the water supply is not necessarily safe. At least 1.9 billion people
rely on either unimproved sources or improved sources that are faecally contaminated (WHO, 2014). It is in these
settings that household water treatment (HWT) and safe storage (HWTS) can serve as an important interim
measure to make drinking-water safer. Health gains from HWTS can be achieved only when treatment products
are effective in removing pathogens from drinking-water and are used correctly and consistently. A variety of
HWT products – with performance ranging from little to considerable pathogen removal – are available. In order
to determine how well such products protect the health of users, WHO developed globally relevant health-based
performance criteria for HWT using QMRA (WHO, 2011). The assumptions and methodology employed in developing
the health-based performance targets for HWT are a direct application of the preventive risk-based framework
outlined in the GDWQ (WHO, in preparation).

The functional objective of HWT is the removal of pathogens and other contaminants. Thus, QMRA, through the
application of pathogen-specific dose–response information, provides a direct method for linking reductions in
waterborne pathogens as a result of water treatment to health impacts.


A6.2 Problem formulation
The purpose of the QMRA was to inform the evaluation of HWT and to ensure that such technologies reduce
waterborne pathogens sufficiently to protect health.

The scope of the QMRA was defined by:
• Hazard identification: The assessment was undertaken for the three main classes of pathogens (bacteria,
   viruses and protozoa) that cause diarrhoeal disease. For each class, a reference pathogen was selected,
   based on occurrence in human populations and faecally contaminated water, documented dose–response
   relationships and characterization in water. Thus, the three reference pathogens selected were the bacterium
   Campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. In addition, these three are cited in
   the GDWQ as key waterborne reference pathogens (WHO, in preparation).
• Exposure pathways: Contaminated untreated drinking-water; this could include surface water sources (pond or
   river), covered or uncovered communal wells and/or inadequately treated tap water.
• Health outcome: Annual probability of diarrhoeal illness.


A6.3   Exposure assessment
Although, ideally, local water quality data are used to inform QMRA, there is often a lack of reliable data in many
countries where drinking-water is unsafe and unreliable and HWTS is used to improve water quality. Therefore,
it was assumed that untreated, uncharacterized water is 0.01% wastewater. The concentrations of Campylobacter
jejuni, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium in wastewater were derived from published estimates regarding the numbers
of such pathogens excreted daily per infected person in a tropical community in a developing country (WHO, 2011;
see Table A6.1). Finally, it was assumed that each person consumes 1 L of drinking-water each day (WHO, 2011; see
Table A6.1). This resulted in the following daily exposure estimates: 1 (Campylobacter jejuni), 0.1 (Cryptosporidium)
and 1 (rotavirus) (WHO, 2011; see Table A6.1).


A6.4 Health effects assessment
The exponential dose–response models cited in the GDWQ (WHO, in preparation) were used to conduct the health
effects assessment. The probability of infection per organism was r = 0.019 for Campylobacter jejuni, r = 0.20 for
Cryptosporidium and r = 0.59 for rotavirus (WHO, in preparation; see Table A6.1). One limitation of these models is
that they were developed using a population from developed countries where immunity may differ from that of the
populations using HWTS, which largely reside in developing countries.

A6.5 Risk characterization
Treatment targets were defined for each pathogen class for three different levels of performance. The top tier,
designated by three stars, indicates very high removal of pathogens, which represents those technologies that, if
used correctly and consistently over an entire year, will limit the drinking-water diarrhoeal disease burden to 10−6
DALY pppy. The second tier, designated by two stars, defines pathogen removals that achieve a health-based target
of 10−4 DALY pppy. Both three-star and two-star performances provide comprehensive protection against the three
main classes of pathogens. Technologies in these two categories provide the greatest protection, especially in
settings where:
• the burden of diarrhoeal disease is high owing to several classes of pathogens;
• there is no information on the specific pathogens in drinking-water, and a prudent approach is to protect against
    all three classes; and
• there is a lack of safe faecal management and safe piped water supplies.

The one-star classification clearly provides less protection; in general, these products should be used in targeted
situations where there is a pathogen of known concern (e.g. in a cholera outbreak) or in combination with other
products to ensure comprehensive protection.

In order to achieve these performance levels, technologies may be used in combination. For example, using a ceramic
filter followed by chlorination provides a multibarrier approach that achieves a greater level of performance than
either technology could achieve alone.

A6.6 Risk management
Fig. A6.1 illustrates the overall process for establishing health-based performance targets in regards to HWT.
Each step is part of a sequential process to identify performance targets (where the performance level of 10−6
(***) reflects the log10 reduction targets included in the GDWQ, as shown in Table A6.1), conduct testing and, finally,
inform national verification efforts. Step 1, as described, proposes three levels of targets, unless sufficient local
data are available to derive such targets. However, in most countries where drinking-water quality is compromised
and HWT plays a potentially important role, there are neither sufficient data nor the laboratory capacity and
expertise to generate such data.

The actual testing of technologies against the targets is Step 2. Recognizing that many countries have neither the
resources nor the capacity to evaluate HWT performance according to WHO performance criteria, WHO has
established the International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies (WHO, 2016a). WHO
works with an Independent Advisory Committee of experts and designated testing laboratories to consistently
and independently evaluate the performance of HWT products and, in so doing, guide Member States, procuring
agencies and users in product selection. Further, WHO has developed an overall harmonized test protocol as well
as specific test protocols for the main types of technologies (WHO, 2016b). The protocols employ both general test
water and challenge test water, the latter representing highly turbid surface water sources. These protocols are
used by the WHO Scheme’s designated testing laboratories and are being adapted for use in low-income settings,
such as Ethiopia, where laboratory facilities and expertise are limited. Increasingly, WHO, with advice from experts
on the Independent Advisory Committee, is working to identify surrogates for each pathogen class rather than
                                                                                                                                                   Annexes




actual pathogens to assess performance. This is important not only for reducing the cost and time of testing, but
also to allow for a wider range of laboratories and countries to conduct testing.

Finally, in Step 3, testing should be linked to and inform national regulation and technology verification efforts.
This is a critical step for ensuring that both governments and consumers are able to make informed choices about
the protective effect of a range of technologies. WHO is supporting a number of countries to strengthen national
regulations and evaluation in order to ensure that testing results are appropriately considered when selecting HWT
options. In addition, through the WHO/United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) International Network on Household
Water Treatment and Safe Storage, WHO is working with other stakeholders to better understand and address the
enabling environment to support smarter HWT implementation and improved health.

A6.7    Evaluation of the QMRA
The principal objective of the QMRA was to derive health-based performance criteria for HWT systems at different
tier levels. To be able to derive a generic performance target, it was necessary to make an assumption about the
type and appropriate concentration of reference pathogens in source waters for HWT systems.

One critical consideration in utilizing QMRA to develop health-based performance targets is that the predicted
health outcomes depend on the correct and consistent use of HWT, resulting in safe drinking-water. This puts
the onus on the user, as opposed to centralized drinking-water treatment systems, where, assuming adequate
treatment and management, there is less chance of error/non-adherence. Correct and consistent use is a
challenge and one that is somewhat opaque, in part because many of the data do not directly measure use
of HWT and because of the interconnected behavioural and economic factors that influence the use of HWT.
However, monitoring is improving, with implementers increasingly assessing water quality or using remote
sensors to determine correct and consistent use of HWT, for example, filters (WHO/UNICEF, 2012). In studies in
which consistent use (adherence) was measured, it was often less than 70% (Arnold & Colford, 2007). According
to a recent study that applied QMRA in the context of HWT, unless adherence is 90% or greater, tangible health
gains are unlikely to be realized (Brown & Clasen, 2012). This highlights the importance of creating an enabling
environment that supports high adherence. Furthermore, it also indicates that those technologies with a high user
burden, with recurrent costs or that involve substantial behavioural change are unlikely to achieve health gains,
even if they are microbiologically highly efficacious. Meanwhile, implementers are increasingly targeting HWTS
towards those populations most at risk, such as pregnant mothers and those living with HIV. These populations
are particularly aware of the dangers of consuming unsafe water and are more receptive to messages about the
importance of safe drinking-water. In such populations, use is higher than 90% (Peletz et al., 2012; Woods, Foster &
Kols, 2012). In addition, implementers are increasingly using evidence-based behavioural change approaches as an
effective means to increase and sustain use of HWTS (Mosler, 2012).

B1 Hypothetical case‑study
The following example is intended to demonstrate the consideration of variability and uncertainty within a QMRA
of a drinking-water system. A single system is assessed several times using the same framework; however,
the number of data and quantitative effort applied in the variability and uncertainty analysis for the exposure
assessment are incrementally increased. It is intended as an illustrative hypothetical case-study only and is not
intended to be prescriptive.


B1.1   Case description
   Water is drawn from a large river and is treated by conventional treatment (coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation/
   rapid sand filtration) followed by disinfection with free chlorine at 1 mg·L−1. Water is distributed to the consumer by
   a gravity-fed pressurized pipe network. The regulator has stipulated that the annual DALYs to the community from
   Cryptosporidium via drinking-water must not exceed 1 × 10−6 per person per year.

With respect to Cryptosporidium, is the water supply chain able to deliver water of a quality that meets the
regulator’s health-based target?

The application of the QMRA framework to the case-study scenario is illustrated in Fig. B.1.


B1.2   Problem formulation
The purpose of the risk assessment was to evaluate whether or not the risk from Cryptosporidium is greater than or
less than the health-based target of 1 × 10−6 DALY pppy. The scope of the risk assessment is defined by the hazard
identification, the exposure pathways and the health outcomes:
• Hazard identification: The reference pathogen as defined by the regulator is Cryptosporidium.
                                                                                                                               Annexes




• Exposure pathways: The exposure pathway is illustrated in Fig. B.1. Water is drawn from a river draining an
   impacted catchment (unknown magnitude) with many sources of Cryptosporidium (most likely human and




                                                                                                                 Annex B 123
  animal in origin). Water is treated by two engineered treatment barriers: conventional treatment (which could
  be considered as separate subprocesses of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and rapid sand filtration)
  and free chlorine disinfection. A third barrier, and potential site of recontamination, is the distribution system.
  Consumers are potentially exposed to Cryptosporidium via the consumption of unboiled tap water (boiling of tap
  water is assumed to inactivate Cryptosporidium).
• Health outcomes: The health outcome stipulated by the regulator is the annual DALY.

124 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
B1.3   Exposure assessment
The exposure pathway is illustrated in Fig. B.1. Each component of the exposure assessment (c, π1, π2, d and V)
needs to be quantified based on available data. The removal is represented as π (the probability of individual
pathogen passage, which is related to the log10 reduction [LR] of the pathogen population by: π = 10−LR). In each part
of this worked example, a separate exposure assessment will be undertaken using the same basic framework, but
differing levels of detail in quantifying variability and uncertainty.


B1.4   Health effects assessment
The health outcome required by the regulator was the annualized DALY. Two pathogen-specific factors are required
for the risk assessment: the dose–response relationship and the DALY per infection. Based on a review of the
available models, the exact Beta-Poisson model fitted to the combined isolate data (see section 7.1 and Annex D;
Teunis, Chappell & Okhuysen, 2002) was selected. The exact Beta-Poisson model was approximated at low doses
using the exponential model:

Pinf = 1 − er∙D			                                                              Eq. B.1

             α            0.115
with: r =         =                 = 0.4; and D = exposure dose (oocysts)
            α+β       0.115 + 0.176
The DALY weighting used in the GDWQ (WHO, in preparation) was selected. This health effects assessment is
consistent for all parts of the worked example, with the exception of the uncertainty analysis in section B6.


B1.5   Risk characterization
The exposure assessment and the health effects assessment were combined to calculate the probability of
infection for the study system. The annualized DALY benchmark (1 × 10−6 DALY pppy) was transformed using
the number of days of exposure to obtain the acceptable average daily infection probability. Given the assumptions
of the GDWQ (WHO, in preparation), the average daily probability of infection is 2.6 × 10−6. The risk was
characterized separately for each part of the following worked example, depending on the assumptions of the
exposure
assessment.


B2 Part A: Quantifying exposure with no local information – point estimates
The first-tier assessment was undertaken based on limited local information and predictions made using literature
data without any local monitoring data.


B2.1   Data collection
• Source: The first-tier risk assessment was undertaken with only a description of catchment land use: a large
  impacted river with many faecal sources, including large urbanized areas, intensive agriculture and treated
  wastewater discharges. Catchment management practices for agricultural activities were unknown. Drawing
  on a review of information from the literature (Medema et al., 2009), only a vague prediction of Cryptosporidium
  concentration can be made without a thorough sanitary survey and/or microbial data. The river could
  reasonably be classified between the categories of “moderately polluted” (0.1 oocyst·L−1) and “heavily polluted”
  (10 oocysts·L−1).
• Treatment: The drinking-water treatment plant is operated by a water supply company that is subject to tight
  regulatory requirements. Turbidity in finished water prior to chlorination may not exceed 0.2 NTU in the
  combined effluent, and historical online turbidity measurements indicate that this requirement is achieved
  more than 95% of the time. No additional information on plant performance was available. A meta-analysis of
  published data on conventional treatment processes, undertaken by Hijnen & Medema (2007), reported a mean
  elimination capacity (MEC) for conventional treatment of 3.2 log10.
• Distribution: Water is distributed to the consumer by a gravity-fed pressurized pipe network. The system is well
  maintained; when leakages/breakages are identified, repairs are undertaken in accordance with strict quality
                                                                                                                         Annexes




  assurance procedures that have been developed for protection of the water quality. No additional data on the
  distribution system were available.
• Exposure: No local data on the consumption of unboiled tap water were available.



                                                                                                           Annex B 125
B2.2       Quantification of model inputs
• Source: In the absence of any specific local data, a conservative upper bound on the Cryptosporidium
  concentration (10 oocysts·L−1) was selected.
• Treatment: While there were limited data available on the performance of the treatment plant, it was
  concluded that it was reasonable to assume that the conventional treatment process was well operated. The
  MEC from reviewed studies was selected to describe the performance of conventional treatment. Free chlorine
  disinfection was assumed to be ineffective against Cryptosporidium, and therefore the probability of passage
  (see section 6.2.2) for the disinfection step was set equal to 1.
• Distribution: The impact of the distribution system was unknown. For the initial assessment, the distribution
  system was ignored.
• Exposure: In the absence of any local data, a reference value for exposure volume was selected at 1 L per
  person per day.

The inputs for the exposure assessment of Part A (section B2) are summarized in Table B.1.

b   π represents probability of passage.


B2.3       Risk characterization
The daily probability of infection was calculated as:
                               −3
Pinf = 1 − e−0.4 × 6.31 × 10

Pinf = 1.46 × 10−3

The calculated daily probability of infection is well above the daily average target of 2.6 × 10−6. The calculated risk
is very high, around 3 log10 higher than the target, and it is likely that the process train is inadequate to meet the
target. An additional barrier or barriers may be required.

Were the input assumptions reasonable? The risk assessment was not based on any local water quality data
and used very conservative initial oocyst concentration assumptions from the literature. Further analysis
with local water quality data may be worthwhile before concluding that the water is unsafe and investing in
additional treatment.


B3 Part B: Quantifying exposure with some local information – point estimates

B3.1       Data collection
Samples (n = 10) were collected to evaluate the concentration of Cryptosporidium in the river water. The average
concentration of the 10 samples was reported to be 0.2 oocyst·L−1. In addition, a historical data set of E. coli



126 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
concentrations collected over several years at the same location (n = 421) was obtained; the average E. coli
concentration was 54 MPN·100 mL−1. Comparison with literature data (Medema et al., 2009) indicates that these
results suggest that the water source was more likely to be in the lower range of contamination identified in section
B2: “moderately polluted” (0.1 oocyst·L−1).


B3.2       Quantification of model inputs
The microbiological water quality data support the selection of a lower Cryptosporidium concentration for the
source water, and a value of 0.2 oocyst·L−1 was implemented in the QMRA model. All other components of the model
remained unchanged from section B2.

The inputs for the exposure assessment of Part B (section B3) are summarized in Table B.2.

B3.3       Risk characterization
The daily probability of infection is calculated as:
                               −4
Pinf = 1 − e−0.4 × 1.26 × 10

Pinf = 4.99 × 10−5
Recalculation of the Pinf with the new concentration of 0.2 oocyst·L−1 resulted in a much lower probability of
infection, indeed 2 log10 lower; however, it is still approximately 1 log10 above the target of 2.6 × 10−6. When relying
on literature alone without site-specific data, it is often necessary to be conservative, and therefore high numbers
need to be selected. A great deal of benefit can be obtained with local data to verify how realistic those initial
assumptions are. In this case, the oocyst counts combined with the larger E. coli data set provided evidence that the
expected level of faecal contamination was considerably lower than first thought. While the infection probability
is still above the target, it is much closer and within an order of magnitude. The calculated value is the average or
expected risk; however, this will vary between days. Investigation into the nature of that variation may assist with
deciphering what is driving the risk associated with this system and what options may be available to reduce the
risk below the target.


B4 Part C: Accounting for variability in exposure – point estimates
As the average risk was above the target, it was deemed worthwhile to tease out the influences of variability on
the risk calculations. In this example, the variability was investigated using point estimates to describe different
discrete conditions that the system may experience.
                                                                                                                                Annexes

B4.1       Variation in source water concentration

B4.1.1 Data collection
Rather than rely on the average oocyst concentration, the 10 individual reported concentrations were obtained to
investigate the variability in concentration. While on most occasions no oocysts were found (<0.1 oocyst·L−1), on one
occasion, a concentration of 1.9 oocysts·L−1 was reported.


B4.1.2 Quantification of model inputs
The concentration of oocysts was characterized under two conditions: nominal (background) conditions, where the
concentration was assumed to be equal to half the detection limit (0.05 oocyst·L−1), and peak conditions, where the
concentration of 1.9 oocysts·L−1 was applied.

Input values for the exposure assessment are summarized in Table B.3.

B4.1.3 Risk characterization
The daily probability of infection is calculated as:
                                      −5
Pinf nominal = 1 − e−0.4 × 3.15 × 10 = 1.25 × 10−5

                                 −8
Pinf peak = 1 − e−0.4 × 1.20 × 10 = 4.74 × 10−4

Based on the range of measured Cryptosporidium concentrations, the risk varies greatly between days and is
often below the detection limit, which, under the current assumptions of the model, is approximately the value of
the allowable daily probability of infection. It may be that the overall risk to consumers could be most effectively
reduced by managing the peak source water events. However, the risk assessment has not yet considered the
variability in treatment.


B4.2 Variation in source water concentration, treatment and consumption volume

B4.2.1 Data collection
• Treatment: The water utility collected data at the treatment plant on aerobic spore removal across the
  conventional treatment barrier and reported that removal varied from 1.1 log10 to 4 log10 (mean = 2.5 log10). In
  the risk assessment, it was assumed that this reflected the (variation in) removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts by
  conventional treatment.




128 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
• Exposure: A review of a local drinking-water consumption study for the exposed population demonstrated that
  while some individuals consumed up to 1 L per day, the average consumption for the population was 0.15 L per day.


B4.2.2 Quantification of model inputs
The variability in both the treatment and exposure volume was quantified using point values to represent nominal
and peak conditions. For treatment, nominal conditions were assumed equal to the mean log10 reduction based
on the aerobic spore data, with the peak risk removal (i.e. poor removal) equal to the minimum reported removal
= 1.1 log10. For exposure volumes, the nominal exposure volume was reduced to represent the average from the
consumption study, and the 1 L per day was included as the peak (maximum) consumption.

Input values for the exposure assessment are summarized in Table B.4.

B4.2.3 Risk characterization
When undertaking the calculations, the nature of the variability (between individuals or over time) needs
to be accounted for. Source water and treatment performance inputs are variable over time; only one inflow
concentration and treatment removal are assumed to occur. Conversely, variation in consumption volume refers to
variability between individuals across the entire population. For a given quality of water delivered to the tap, some
will consume a small portion of that water, and some will consume more. The combinations of conditions that are
considered in the risk calculations, with the associated risk quantification, are included in Table B.5.

The results in Table B.5 indicate that under baseline conditions, the risk was (just) above the average allowable
daily probability of infection of Pinf = 2.6 × 10−6; under each of the modelled peak conditions, the benchmark was
considerably exceeded. The combination of high pathogen loading, poor plant performance and high consumption
led to an increase in risk of nearly 4 orders of magnitude. It is therefore relevant to ask: for what proportion of time
are baseline conditions representative? How much of the time would the target be expected to be exceeded? What
duration of peak conditions could be tolerated to still meet the target of 1 × 10−6 DALY pppy?


B5 Part D: Accounting for variability – stochastic simulation
Rather than calculating discrete point estimates of risk, it is possible to calculate the probability distribution
of infection risk. This probability distribution takes into consideration the range of likely values of risk and the
probability of each of those values occurring.


B5.1                         Data collection
• Source: The raw counts (as opposed to only the inferred concentrations; see Annex C, section C2) of
  Cryptosporidium oocysts from the source water samples (n = 10) were obtained.
• Treatment: Counts of aerobic spores before and after conventional treatment were obtained from the water
  treatment facility (n = 8).
• Exposure: The original data from the unboiled water consumption survey were obtained.


B5.2 Quantification of model inputs
• Source: A negative binomial distribution was fitted to the counts in order to obtain the gamma distribution
  parameters describing concentration (following the approach presented by Teunis et al. [1997]). The gamma
  distribution is useful for describing concentration because it must be positive (domain > 0) and flexible in shape,
  and, when combined with the Poisson distribution to describe counts, it yields a form of the negative binomial
  distribution (see Annex C, Box C.2). The gamma distribution describing variability in concentration is illustrated
  in Fig. B.2; the 50th percentile was 0.0026 oocyst·L−1, and the 95th percentile was 1.2 oocysts·L−1.
• Treatment: The beta distribution was selected to describe variability in probability of passage (π). The beta
  distribution is useful for describing probabilities, as it can be defined to have a value only between 0 and 1. The
  beta distribution plotted on a log10 scale fitted to the aerobic spore counts is illustrated in Fig. B.3; the 50th
  percentile was a 2.2 log10 reduction, and the 95th percentile was a 1.2 log10 reduction.
• Exposure: A lognormal distribution was fitted to the volume of water (mL) consumed per person per day. This

B5.3                       Risk characterization
These distributions were combined by simulation using Monte Carlo analysis to describe the distribution for the
daily probability of infection. The cumulative distribution of risk is illustrated along with the point estimates from
sections B2, B3 and B4 in Fig. B.5. The calculated cumulative density function (CDF) indicates that under the
assumptions of the model, the health-based target would be exceeded around 55% of the time.


B6 Part E: Accounting for parameter uncertainty – stochastic simulation
In section B5, parametric distributions were fitted to the monitoring data. In most cases, however, the data sets
were small, and therefore there was uncertainty associated with the selection of suitable parameter values – which
means that there was uncertainty in the shape of the distribution. This uncertainty influences the estimates of risk.
The result in Fig. B.5 is the distribution of risk based on combining the most likely shape of each input distribution;
however, it would be informative to know how sure we can be about that distribution, given the observed data and
the selected models.

Fig. B.5 Cumulative probability distribution for the probability of infection from Monte Carlo simulation with
distributions for source water concentration, treatment performance and unboiled water consumption. Point
estimates calculated in sections B2–B4 are also shown.


B6.2 Quantification of model inputs
The uncertainty associated with the selection of parameter values for describing source water concentration,
treatment performance and dose–response was explored using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of the
likelihood function. The 95% credible intervals around the shape of the gamma distribution fitted to the
Cryptosporidium counts from source water (n = 10), the (log10-transformed) beta distribution fitted to the aerobic
spore removal data (n = 10) and the dose–response relationship are illustrated in Fig. B.6.


B6.3    Risk characterization
A second-order Monte Carlo analysis was undertaken; random samples of parameter values were selected,
followed by random samples from each model input distribution, and then the risk was calculated. This was
repeated thousands of times to obtain a representative sample of the probability of infection. This distribution is
illustrated in Fig. B.7. While the best estimate of risk implied that the target would be exceeded approximately 70%
of the time, including the parameter uncertainty means that this could be as high as 85% or as low as 35%.


B7 Accounting for other sources of uncertainty
The credible intervals around the CDF for the daily probability of infection in Fig. B.7 take into consideration only
the parameter uncertainty surrounding the prediction of the gamma distribution for source water concentration,
the beta distribution for treatment performance and the Beta-Poisson dose–response relationship. What about
other sources of uncertainty? There are numerous other sources of uncertainty that are not accounted for in those
predictions; for example:
• The source water concentration was based on a small monitoring data set collected over a period known to be
   particularly dry, and rainfall events during that time were small in comparison with the average year. How well can
   the distribution fitted to those data points be expected to reflect the expected long-term behaviour of the system?
• The distribution system has been ignored; however, the impact of distribution on the consumer risk is an
   important source of uncertainty.
• Although the water consumption study indicated a relatively low level of water consumption (mean = 0.15 L),
   some individuals in the community may drink more water, and this would affect the risk.
• The dose–response relationship was developed based on data from a clinical study in which healthy adult
   volunteers were exposed to laboratory strains of C. parvum oocysts. Individuals more susceptible to
   Cryptosporidium may have a higher risk of infection; indeed, C. hominis may be more infectious than this

Relying on a sophisticated statistical analysis without holistically thinking about data inputs and assumptions would
be an inadequate evaluation of system risks. Quantitatively accounting for these types of uncertainty is a challenge;
however, a transparent approach to scenario analysis with point estimations provides a useful tool.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Annexes




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Annex B 133
The four issues identified could be addressed using point estimates, by conservatively selecting input values to
represent the conditions of concern. For example:
• Source water concentration: Data available over a longer period from another climatically relevant site
   could be analysed to compare the longer-term average and peak concentrations with those in the single
   “dry” year. Based on this analysis, the input value for source concentration (or the entire distribution) could be
   conservatively increased.
• Water consumption data: To consider events not captured by the local data set, a review of consumption data
   from the broader international literature indicates that an upper limit of unboiled water consumption would be
   around 4.5 L per person per day (e.g. Roseberry & Burmaster, 1992). The calculations could be re-run in parallel
   with this higher value for water consumption, and the sensitivity of the water management outcomes to this
   input value could be evaluated.
• Distribution: Quantifying the impact of distribution systems on infection risk is a challenge; however, scenarios
   of intrusion events could be simulated to investigate the sensitivity of the model to the distribution network (e.g.
   van Lieverloo, Blokker & Medema, 2007; Teunis et al., 2010; Besner, Prevost & Regli, 2011).
• Dose–response: The outcome could be compared for different dose–response models, including the model fit to C.
   hominis data. In addition, when using single-hit models based on Poisson dispersed microbes (see Annex D), such
   as the exponential or Beta-Poisson model, the upper limit of infection probability is the probability of exposure.
   This is represented by the maximum risk curve (exponential model with r = 1). The maximum risk curve is a useful
   upper bound on the uncertainty of the dose–response relationship and can be used for susceptible subgroups or
   immunocompromised individuals.

In each case, these scenario calculations should be run in parallel with the “best” estimate calculations – they
should not replace the best estimates. Using the upper limit of uncertainty at every stage of the model would
provide a risk estimate that is unmanageably conservative and not truly representative of the population, and most
likely not very helpful for risk management. Alternatively, comparing uncertainty scenario results with the best
estimates can provide useful inputs regarding model sensitivity and robustness.

Quantitative characterization of environmental variables based on scientific observations is a critical component
of QMRA. For microbial data sets, a background understanding of the methods behind the reported values and an
appreciation of the inherent uncertainties in enumeration are useful for developing representative quantitative
estimates. There are different possible ways to use these data for statistical inference, each of which may lead
to a different quantitative value and, hence, outcome to the QMRA. It is therefore important to ensure that the
statistical approach is appropriate to the data and that the implications of any simplifications or data substitutions
are understood. In this annex, a brief overview of microbial methods and data analysis considerations is provided.
Some examples demonstrating the influence of statistical approach on the quantitative estimates for QMRA are
then given.


C1 Microbial enumeration methods
The approach for enumerating pathogens and indicators from environmental samples varies between organisms
and between environmental media. Appropriate interpretation of the reported results requires an appreciation of
the multiple steps involved in the concentration and purification of samples; the characteristics of the organism
that the enumeration method is designed to target; and the quantitative or qualitative nature of the observations.


C1.1   Multiple steps for concentration and purification
Environmental samples need to be prepared for microbial analysis. The method used for preparation will depend
on the type of sample (e.g. drinking-water, surface water, sewage, faeces), the expected concentration of organisms
present (whether dilution or concentration is required) and which organism is to be targeted. This brief overview
draws on the more detailed text by Maier, Pepper & Gerba (2009). Each step in the process is an opportunity for
organisms or nucleic acid to be lost; quantitative method controls are required to evaluate each step of the
process. Common methodological protocols for different microbial groups are illustrated in Fig. C.1 and described
briefly below:
• Bacteria: Preparation for bacterial analysis typically involves either direct plating or membrane filtration. In
   direct plating, the sample (or dilutions of the sample) is added to petri dishes containing growth media and
   incubated. In membrane filtration (typically used for larger volumes with lower concentrations), the sample is
   filtered through a membrane (selected depending on target bacteria, but often nitrocellulose filter of pore size
                                                                                                                           Annexes




   0.45 µm), which is then placed on growth media and incubated.

• Viruses: Viruses are often present in low concentrations in surface water samples, and therefore large volumes
  (up to 1000 L) need to be concentrated. Owing to the small size of virus particles, filtration relies on adsorption
  of viruses to charged filter media. Viruses are then eluted using fluid (1–2 L) at high pH, which increases the
  negative charge on both the viruses and the filter, leading to desorption. Further concentration is required to
  reduce the volume to 20–30 mL before assay, which can then be used for cell culture. If the target virus is to be
  identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), further processing of the sample is required. The nucleic acid is
  extracted by destruction (lysis) of the cell wall (efficient lysis is a critical step in the process). The sample then
  needs to be purified from compounds that may interfere with or inhibit the molecular analysis (various methods
  are used, including centrifuge and filtration); purification methods can lead to the loss of some nucleic acid. For
  RNA viruses (including norovirus, rotavirus), the RNA must be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) by
  reverse transcriptase prior to PCR amplification (reverse transcription PCR, or RT-PCR).
• Protozoa: Protozoa are also often present in low concentrations, and therefore large volumes often need to
  be concentrated. Filtration methods rely on capturing the (oo)cysts by their size. The (oo)cysts are then eluted
  from the filter using a small volume of elution buffer and shaking for 5 minutes. The protozoa are then pelleted
  by centrifuge and resuspended in buffer. Immunomagnetic separation is used to separate the (oo)cysts from
  the debris in the sample. In this process, cysts and oocysts attach to specific antibodies that are associated
  with magnetic beads and removed from solution. (Oo)cysts are then dissociated from the beads, stained with
  fluorescent monoclonal antibodies and viewed with an epifluorescence microscope. (Oo)cysts identified by their
  fluorescence and morphology are referred to as immunofluorescence assay (IFA) positive.

C1.2       Characteristic of the organism that is being targeted
Microbial methods are targeted towards a specific characteristic of the microorganism and vary in their specificity
for identifying viable (capable of causing infection), human-infectious organisms. Three dominant methods include:



136 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
1) Visual identification under the microscope based on characteristic morphological features (often using specific
   staining techniques). Visual identification methods can verify the integrity of the cell wall and morphological
   features consistent with a viable organism, but cannot confirm whether an organism is viable or not.
2) Ability to reproduce (culture or plaque assay) under a set of specific conditions. Specific organisms can be
   selected from a large microbial population by using selective media and selective incubation conditions. For
   pathogenic bacteria, methods usually involve enrichment (to allow damaged cells time to repair and to increase
   numbers), followed by culture with selective media and/or conditions; a wide range of variations in media and
   culture protocols exist. For viruses, the two most common approaches to cell culture are the inoculation of a
   series of wells containing a host cell line with the concentrated sample and then looking for a cytopathic effect
   where observable changes in the host cells are identified as a result of virus replication. The second approach
   is plaque assay, where the sample is poured onto a host cell monolayer; following incubation, the areas of
   dead cells in the host monolayer are counted. The selection of host cell line will influence which enteric viruses
   are detected, and confirmation (by molecular or immunological methods) of positive cultures is necessary to
   determine which virus type caused the cytopathic effect or plaque. Culture-based methods identify infectious
   organisms only; however, as some microorganisms may be viable but non-culturable (i.e. not able to produce
   a culture in the laboratory, but still infectious to a human host), they can underestimate the number of viable
   organisms in the sample. Furthermore, environmental organisms (as opposed to those grown in the laboratory)
   may struggle to grow under laboratory conditions, and the portion that is viable but non-culturable is not
   well known.
3) Molecular methods (usually with amplification by PCR) are used to identify the presence of a particular
   sequence of genetic material in the sample. Molecular methods are used for pathogens that cannot be cultured
   (or are difficult to culture) and are sometimes favoured in comparison with culture or visual identification owing
   to their specificity and sensitivity. Important drawbacks include the following:
   -- Standard PCR techniques cannot distinguish between viable and dead organisms.
   -- Connecting quantitative results back to the number of microorganisms present is a challenge and depends
       on the number of target sequences per microorganism.
   -- The specificity of the method for targeting the organism of interest depends on the selected probe or
       primer – the longer the sequence, the more specific the probe or primer is expected to be.


C1.3   Quantitative or qualitative observations
Although results are often reported as a concentration, because microorganisms are discrete units, the
concentration cannot be measured directly and is an inference based on one of three types of observations:
1) Quantitative (counted number of organisms, colonies or plaques), where the precision for predicting the original
   concentration depends on the number of organisms counted and the volume (including dilution) of the sample
   (e.g. a count of 2 in 100 mL is less precise than a count of 200 in 10 L).
2) Qualitative (presence or absence of an observed response in a sample volume). Quantitative concentrations are
   frequently reported from a series of qualitative results as the MPN. The precision associated with this MPN in
   quantifying the original concentration depends on the number of observations, which may be small (e.g. three
   10-fold dilutions) or large (Colilert® Quanti-Tray®, with 97 observations per sample). The predicted concentration
   is based on the assumption that organisms are randomly (Poisson) distributed in the sample and is typically
   reported (in standard MPN tables) with a 95% confidence interval.
3) Semiquantitative. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) uses the rate of amplification of the target genetic material in the
   sample to predict the original concentration of genomes or genome equivalents in the environmental sample.
   For QMRA, this approach is currently considered semiquantitative, as the translation of the qPCR result back
   to an absolute concentration of infectious pathogenic units in the original sample is uncertain. As methods for
   quantifying recovery (loss of organisms and nucleic acid), extraction (efficiency of extracting genetic material
   from microbial cells), inhibition (potential suppression of the PCR signal) and the relationship between genome
   units to infectious particles are improved, so too will the quantitative value of qPCR data for QMRA.


C2 Statistical inference
Whereas the observations may be qualitative, semiquantitative or quantitative, monitoring data are typically
reported from the laboratory as microbial concentrations (e.g. MPN·100 mL−1, CFU·100 mL−1, PFU·100 mL−1). In order
                                                                                                                         Annexes




to reach these concentrations, the laboratory applies a set of standard protocols (which vary between organisms,
methods and laboratories) for inferring the concentration from its observations. Quantitative inference for model



                                                                                                           Annex C 137
inputs can be undertaken based on the reported concentrations or on the original observations; however, the
adopted approach has implications for the uncertainty that is explicitly represented and accounted for in the final
risk assessment. The different levels of statistical inference (Box C.1) are illustrated in Fig. C.2.


 Box C.1 Statistical inference
 Statistical inference refers to the process of drawing conclusions from the data. In contrast to description
 statistics, where the purpose is to quantitatively describe a set of data, statistical inference is a systematic
 approach used to draw conclusions from data sets arising from systems affected by random variation.

 Statistical inference will most often use:
 • a model used to describe the random process; or
 • observational data.

 The conclusion of the statistical inference could include:
 • an estimate of a parameter value of the model (e.g. the mean concentration; or two parameters describing
    the gamma distribution); or
 • a confidence interval (frequentist) or credible interval (Bayesian) around the parameter values.

Fig. C.3 Relative precision associated with different methods of enumeration for predicting pathogen and indicator
concentration in environmental media

Concentration predictions based on indicator organisms are the most precise. They are selected as indicators
because of the relative simplicity (in comparison with pathogens) of their methods, and hence there are typically a
larger number of observations associated with each concentration prediction (e.g. Colilert® Quanti-Tray®). Giardia
and Cryptosporidium are included in the next tier, as there are well-characterized protocols for measuring the
recovery efficiency of the methodological process; the results are quantitative (i.e. counts); and there are standard
methods, leading to greater reproducibility between laboratories.

Salmonella is also included in this tier, owing to limited sample processing (and potential for loss), a well-defined
MPN matrix approach for quantification and the existence of well-established standard methods. Predictions
based on the other pathogenic bacteria (Campylobacter and E. coli O157:H7) are less precise, as the organisms are
more difficult to culture, it is more difficult to identify the target organism, and MPN results are often not standard
matrices and consist of fewer observations than the 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 tables. Virus enumeration by culture is included
in the same tier, with concentrations based on the MPN procedure or plaque counts; recovery is rarely accounted
for in viral assays. Results from molecular methods are the least precise, as a result of unquantifiable loss of
genetic material, unknown performance of extraction, unknown magnitude of dampening of PCR signal, unknown
translation of genetic copies to virus particles and the lack of knowledge regarding viability.

For statistical analysis, the uncertainty associated with the reported concentrations increases with distance
from the centre of the circle, and hence the implications (in terms of unaccounted for uncertainty) for the final
concentration predictions also increase with distance from the centre. For example, reported E. coli concentrations
using Colilert® Quanti-Tray® are very precise, and direct analysis of these concentrations is reasonable; however,
simply relying on reported virus concentrations (by culture or PCR) is likely to significantly underestimate the
uncertainty associated with the final concentration estimate.


C2.2   Inference based on original observations (Approach 2 in Fig. C.2)
Statistical inference of the pathogen concentration for QMRA based directly on the laboratory observations (counts,
                                                                                                                           Annexes




presence/absence in a given sample volume) is theoretically preferred, because the assumptions and uncertainties
can be more explicitly incorporated into the analysis. The mathematical complexity associated with the analysis




                                                                                                             Annex C 139
is, however, increased, and appropriate statistical modelling is important. Particularly for drinking-water studies,
quantification of concentration for QMRA is increasingly being based on the actual observations. Many examples
exist for protozoa, for which counts and volumes have been analysed using discrete distributions, including the
Poisson distribution (Makri, Modarres & Parkin, 2004; Åström et al., 2007), the negative binomial distribution
(Teunis et al., 1997; Masago et al., 2002, 2004; Pouillot et al., 2004) and the Poisson lognormal distribution (Masago
et al., 2004; Signor & Ashbolt, 2006). For presence/absence data, concentration estimates have been based
directly on the observations, in many cases including uncertainty bounds (Westrell et al., 2006; Åström et al., 2007;
Petterson et al., 2009).

There are, however, two potential complications associated with this approach:
1) Obtaining the original observations: Owing to standard reporting protocols at laboratories, the original
   observations are usually not included in electronic databases and therefore are often not easily accessible.
   Obtaining the original results (e.g. total sample volume, volume of sample processed, presence/absence per
   tube, count per plate, etc.) may require reference to handwritten laboratory reports.
2) Mathematical complexity: Constructing statistical models that account for the specific nature of the
   observations requires a level of mathematical skill that is often beyond the risk assessor. Contracting specialist
   skills may be of value and should be considered, depending on the scope and purpose of the assessment.


C3 Quantifying pathogen concentration

C3.1    Data considerations
The following factors need to be considered when interpreting pathogen data:
• What type of data? The data may be qualitative (presence or absence in a given volume); discrete (only contains
   integer [0, 1, 2, 3…]; categorical (can hold one of a range of distinct values, as in the case of MPNs); or continuous
   (can hold any value within a set range, as in the case of reported concentrations). It is important to select
   distributions or approaches that are appropriate to the type of data (see Box C.2).
• What to do about zeros? Microbial count data often include (sometimes many) zeros. When using a discrete
   distribution to describe concentration (e.g. Poisson, negative binomial; see Box C.2), the zeros are no problem,
   as a zero is within the domain of the distribution. However, there are many examples in the literature where
   continuous distributions have been used to describe discrete microbial counts (Masago et al., 2002, 2004;
   Smeets et al., 2007; Jaidi et al., 2009). In order to do this, counts must be converted to concentrations
   (concentration = count/volume), and zeros need to be replaced with an alternative assumption. The most
   common approaches include replacing zeros with the detection limit, with half the detection limit or with a
   continuous distribution between zero and the detection limit. Two studies compared the impact of different
   zero replacement assumptions on their risk estimates (Smeets et al., 2007; Jaidi et al., 2009) and concluded
   that assumption choice strongly influenced the risk estimates when overall pathogen concentrations were
   low (Smeets et al., 2007; Jaidi et al., 2009) and when data sets were small (Jaidi et al., 2009). The replacement
   can influence the final concentration estimation, as illustrated in section C3.4.1; therefore, whatever method is
   applied, the impact on the concentration and the subsequent risk assessment results should be tested. This can
   be done within sensitivity analysis (see Chapter 8) by running both options and comparing the impact on the risk
   management outcome of the risk analysis.
• What to do about censored data? Reported microbial concentrations typically contain left-censored (less than)
   and right-censored (greater than or TNTC) data. As for the specific case of zero counts, it is common to replace
   left-censored data with the detection limit, with half the detection limit or with a continuous distribution between
   zero and the detection limit. Similarly, right-censored values are often replaced with the upper limit of detection
   or twice the upper limit of detection. The suitability of replaced values depends on the individual data set and
   the analytical method that has been applied. It is possible to construct likelihood functions for fitting distribution
   parameters using the actual observations of less than or greater than results. It is advisable to investigate the
   sensitivity of the risk assessment results to assumptions applied within risk characterization (Chapter 8) by
   running several options and comparing the results.

 Box C.2 Stochastic simulation

 Probability distributions
 A probability distribution can be used to describe how a model input will vary: the range of expected values,
 and the probability that the input is equal to or less than those values. The probability distribution goes beyond
 simple descriptors (mean, median or upper 95th percentile) and characterizes the entire distribution.

 The cumulative distribution function (CDF) or probability distribution function (PDF) is the mathematical equation
 that describes the probability that a variable X is less than or equal to x. That is,

 F(x) = P(X ≤ x) for all x                                                        Eq. C.1

 A PDF f(x) is the derivative of the CDF and describes how the probability mass varies over the range of the
 variable. The PDF is defined as:
          d
 f(x) =      F(x)			                                                                   Eq. C.2
          dx
 Parametric functions are often used to define probability distributions for risk analysis. The selected
 distribution will depend on the domain of the model input (what values are theoretically possible) and how it is
 expected to vary. Some commonly used distributions in QMRA include:
 • Poisson: A discrete distribution that is often used to describe microbial counts [Domain: x = 0, 1, 2, 3, …].
 • Negative binomial: A discrete distribution that can be used to describe overdispersed (clumped) microbial
    counts [Domain: x = 0, 1, 2, 3, …].
 • Gamma: Often used for describing variability in pathogen concentration due to a convenient relationship.
    When describing microbial counts with a Poisson distribution, if the Poisson parameter is assumed to vary
    according to a gamma distribution, the resulting count distribution is negative binomial [Domain: x ≥ 0].
 • Lognormal: Often used to describe microbial concentrations or exposure volumes [Domain: x ≥ 0].
 • Beta: Can take a wide range of shapes and is often applied to describe probabilities (e.g. probability of
    passage for reduction barriers; probability of recovery by an analytical method) [Domain 0 ≤ x ≤ 1].


 Monte Carlo simulation
 When each model input is described by a probability distribution, quantifying the exact mathematical distribution
 for the risk output (e.g. probability of infection) can be complicated or (depending on the input distributions)
 impossible. Monte Carlo simulation is a random sampling technique that allows the outputs of the risk model
 to be quantified by sampling. Random samples are selected from each input variable distribution, and the risk
 output is quantified; this is then repeated thousands of times to obtain a random sample of the risk output. The
 frequency distribution of output samples is assumed to represent the probability distribution of risk. Typically, in
 QMRA models, all input variables are assumed to be independent. It is important to recognize that this may not
 be the case, and Monte Carlo simulation can overinflate the expected variability and associated uncertainty in
 the risk outcomes.

 For more details on distributions, see Vose (2008).

• How to analyse MPNs? Reported concentrations based on MPN inference are predicted concentrations from
  presence/absence data and frequently include left- and right-censored outcomes. MPNs are often assumed
  to represent continuous data; however, when based on a standard MPN table (e.g. 3 × 3 or 5 × 5), the data
  are categorical (only a discrete number of outcomes are possible, depending on the presence/absence
  observations). The importance of this simplification depends on the context of the risk assessment and the
  accuracy required for the statistical analysis. This is illustrated in section C3.4.2 for Campylobacter enumeration
  data from surface waters.


C3.2      Accounting for method recovery
                                                                                                                          Annexes




When method recovery is not accounted for in the concentration predictions, the concentration will be
underestimated. Although recognized as important, quantitative incorporation of method recovery depends on the



                                                                                                            Annex C 141
availability of observations to describe the recovery. When recovery data are available for analysis, it is necessary
to consider the following:
• It is important to know whether the recovery experiments were undertaken using the same sample. Recovery
    performance is influenced by the sample matrix, and therefore it is important to ensure that the medium used
    in the recovery experiments is comparable with the true environmental samples. Sample-specific internal
    recovery spikes (e.g. ColorSeed™ for Cryptosporidium and Giardia) are ideal in this regard, as the measure of
    recovery relates to each specific sample.
• For culture methods, recovery experiments can be influenced by the type, source and culture conditions of
    the surrogate microbes. For example, laboratory strains of bacteria cultured on artificial media and then used
    in recovery efficiency studies of spiked samples may differ in recovery efficiency from bacteria present in
    environmental samples that were excreted in faecal matter and subjected to environmental stressors that
    induced injury. Such differences in physiological states of microbes in environmental samples compared
    with laboratory-grown positive control microbes used in recovery efficiency studies can produce dramatic
    differences in microbial recovery efficiencies. Such differences in recovery efficiency have been well
    documented in the food microbiology literature and are often not considered or adjusted for in the methods
    used for the analysis of bacteria in water and wastewater.
• Which part of the overall analytical sequence is the recovery data describing? Recovery data may be available
    for some parts, but not all, of the overall analytical sequence. For example, van Heerden and coworkers (2005)
    assumed that adenovirus recovery by PCR was 40%, based on published recovery rates of the adsorption–
    elution method adopted using glass wool.

There are a considerable number of data describing method recovery for Cryptosporidium and Giardia where
(oo)cysts are spiked into the original sample (either a parallel sample or the same sample using labelled oocysts
such as ColorSeed™) and then analysed alongside the native (oo)cysts. Most approaches suffer from the lack of
a “gold” standard, in that the formulation of the spike typically presents microbes in a “cleaned-up” or freshly
cultured state, as well as in a relatively high density, both of which may have an impact on how a method recovers
them in comparison with native target microbes in an environmental matrix. Nonetheless, several approaches have
been used for incorporating these data into concentration estimates for QMRA:

• For independent1 samples:
  a) The binomial probability of recovery (each organism has a certain probability of being counted) has been
     assumed to follow a beta distribution and to be included as an independent random variable in the risk
     model (Teunis et al., 1997; Makri, Modarres & Parkin, 2004; Pouillot et al., 2004; Signor & Ashbolt, 2006). This
     is the most common approach for incorporating recovery into concentration estimates for QMRA. Adopting
     a modification, Jaidi and coworkers (2009) also introduced a coefficient of correlation between counts and
     recovery into their analysis.
  b) Avoiding the need to assume a beta distribution, the recovery data can be incorporated into the concentration
     estimate by random sampling of the recovery estimates to “correct” each count (Medema et al., 2003).

• For sample-specific (paired) recovery estimates: Each count can be directly corrected (Medema et al., 2003;
  Petterson, Signor & Ashbolt, 2007), reducing the between-sample uncertainty.

There are limited examples of including recovery estimates for viral and bacterial concentration estimates;
however, as mentioned previously, van Heerden and coworkers (2005) assumed that adenovirus recovery by PCR
was 40%, based on published recovery rates of the adsorption–elution method adopted using glass wool; and
Petterson and coworkers (2009) incorporated recovery into predicting E. coli O157:H7 concentration in surface
water from presence/absence data.

Unfortunately, in many cases, method recovery data do not exist, and the limitation of this data gap for quantifying
concentration for QMRA cannot be overemphasized. This limitation is particularly relevant for molecular methods,
where many steps are involved in the processing and analysis of samples, and the availability and application
of quantitative controls are often limited. If the loss is unknown, then the prediction of the original concentration
is impossible, except to say that “at least” the estimated concentration based on the observations was originally
present. When no data are available, it is a good idea to conservatively estimate recovery to ensure that the risk is
not underestimated.



1   The recovery results are taken from a set of samples separate from those for which the pathogen was enumerated.




142 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
C3.3   Accounting for viability/infectivity and human infectivity
Confusion exists surrounding the terms viability and infectivity. In the context of this report, the following
definitions are held:
• Viability: obtaining some characteristics (as defined by the viability test) consistent with being capable of
   causing infection;
• Infectivity: capable of causing infection in a host; and
• Human infectivity: capable of causing infection in a human host.

The first concern is whether the organism is capable of causing infection, here referred to as viability/infectivity
(where viability is an approximation for infectivity). The second concern is whether the organism is human
infectious, referring to host specificity and whether the organism is capable of causing infections in humans.
Considerations for the quantification of these factors as related to the methods of detection are outlined below:
• Culture: For culture-based enumeration methods, the identified organisms are clearly still capable of causing
    infection (in fact, culture methods are more likely to underestimate the number of infectious organisms, as
    some organisms may still be infectious to humans yet unable to multiply in artificial growth media or cell
    culture). Quantitative inclusion of viable but not culturable microbes is possible only when observations are
    available to describe the culturability.
• Visual identification: There is no definitive measure of the viability or infectivity of Cryptosporidium or Giardia
    (oo)cysts by visual observation. Measures based on the identification of morphological characteristics
    consistent with viability have been suggested, including visual identification of sporozoites within the oocysts
    (diaminophenylindole [DAPI] staining) and verification of cell membrane integrity with vital staining (e.g.
    propidium iodide; Dowd & Pillai, 1997). These methods are more useful in indicating the presence of dead
    (oo)cysts in the population counted rather than being a reflection of the infectivity. However, viability based
    on these visual observations, even with viability staining methods, is not a reliable predictor of human,
    animal or cell culture infectivity. Data such as these can be included in the concentration estimates in one of
    two ways. Firstly, only the observed potentially viable organisms can be counted, and hence any apparently
    dead organisms are discarded; however, not all “viable” cells may be infectious. Secondly, viability can be
    considered a binomial (two-outcome) process in which each identified (oo)cyst has a certain probability of being
    potentially infectious (P); and the probability of not being infectious is (1 − P). The data can be used to estimate
    the probability of potential infectivity; in a similar manner to the recovery, the probability of being potentially
    infectious can be modelled as an independent (possibly beta-distributed; see Box C.2) random variable in
    the QMRA.
    The above approach was applied by Teunis and coworkers (1997) using data reported by LeChevallier,
    Norton & Lee (1991). For samples collected across the USA and Canada, approximately 32% of the 242
    Cryptosporidium observed in raw water samples contained sporozoites within the oocyst (as a measure of
    viability). The raw data from this study were reanalysed by Teunis et al. (1997) and applied in their QMRA
    of surface waters in the Netherlands, by fitting a beta distribution to the potentially viable proportion. This
    same distribution was subsequently applied in studies in Japan (Masago et al., 2002) and the USA (Makri,
    Modarres & Parkin, 2004). The limitation here is whether the data set collected across the USA and Canada is
    representative of different settings; viability relates to oocyst persistence, which is influenced by numerous
    environmental factors, the combination of which is expected to be site specific. Therefore, site-specific
    consideration of viability is necessary, and when there are concerns that the data are not representative, the
    importance of viability assumptions to the overall risk estimates should be tested during sensitivity analysis
    within risk characterization (see Chapter 8); if important, local data should be obtained, or more conservative
    assumptions adopted.
• Molecular methods: Molecular methods such as qPCR target the genetic material of the pathogen and therefore
    detect both viable and non-viable organisms. Several studies have relied on PCR data for quantifying source
    material for QMRA, including noroviruses in tap water (Masago et al., 2006); noroviruses and rotaviruses
    in household water (Oesterholt et al., 2007); noroviruses and enteroviruses in surface water (Åström et al.,
    2007); and Cryptosporidium and Giardia in canal water in Thailand (Diallo et al., 2008). In each of these studies,
    all identified organisms were assumed to be infectious for the purposes of QMRA. There is clear evidence
    from disinfection studies that all viruses amplifiable by RT-PCR and PCR are not infectious, especially if they
    have been exposed to disinfectants and other stressors (Sobsey et al., 1998; Ko, Cromeans & Sobsey, 2003).
    Therefore, molecular methods still typically overestimate infectious organism concentration.
                                                                                                                           Annexes




Owing to the limitations in available data, infectivity can rarely be quantitatively accounted for in QMRA. However,
whether the identified organisms are still in an infectious state is a critical consideration for assessing the health



                                                                                                             Annex C 143
implications of a measured concentration. In the absence of data, consideration of the sources and transport of
pathogens in environmental samples is important for the assessment of infectivity. For example, it may be
reasonable to assume that genetic material sourced from undisinfected wastewater may still represent infectious
viruses (Åström et al., 2007). However, norovirus RNA in disinfected drinking-water is much less likely to be
infectious (Masago et al., 2006).

Some authors have argued that recovery and infectivity are of similar magnitude and therefore can be assumed to
cancel each another out (Regli et al., 1991; Smeets et al., 2007). Despite the pragmatic advantages, there is no real
scientific justification for this approach.


C3.4    Example: modelling the distribution of concentration from pathogen data
Samples were collected from a surface water source impacted by agriculture and analysed for Cryptosporidium
and Campylobacter. The reported concentrations are included in Table C.1. The objective of the analysis is to
characterize the probability distribution of concentration for each pathogen in the surface water source for QMRA.
The following example demonstrates the practical interpretation of the pathogen data sets and illustrates the
implications of different statistical analysis approaches on quantitative concentration estimates.

C3.4.1 Cryptosporidium: analysis of microbial count data
The objective of the analysis was to fit a PDF for oocyst concentration in surface water to the data. Some factors
associated with the reported Cryptosporidium concentrations were unclear:
• The method for detection of Cryptosporidium is to count the number of oocysts in the volume of sample filtered.
   The reported concentrations of Cryptosporidium in Table C.1 are therefore an inference based on the number of
   organisms counted in each sample volume (see section C1.2).
• It is not clear if the counts were total IFA positive oocysts or confirmed by DAPI (see section C1.3).
• Was the method recovery included in the calculation of the reported concentrations (see section C1.2)?




144 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
To assist with analysing the data, it was necessary to approach the laboratory to obtain the counts and volumes
behind the reported data, information on the methodology and the results from recovery seeding. The observations
behind the reported concentrations were obtained and are included in Table C.2.

a   Number of labelled oocysts recovered from 100 spiked.
b   The daily concentration estimate was given by: (Count/Volume)/(Recovery/100). If the count was zero, then the detection limit was determined
    by setting the count equal to 1.

A gamma distribution was selected to describe the oocyst concentration because of the relationship between the
negative binomial count distribution and the gamma distribution for concentration (see Box C.1). Three different
analysis approaches were applied to the same data set in order to show the difference in the estimated distribution
for describing concentration when the reported concentrations were used versus the observations of counts and
volumes; and, in particular, the impact of zero replacement assumptions (see section C1.1):
1) A negative binomial (Poisson/gamma mixture) distribution was fitted to the reported counts and the volumes. A
    discrete distribution fitted to observations.
2) A gamma distribution was fitted to the daily concentration estimates (n/V), with zeros substituted with the
    detection limit. A continuous distribution fitted to the reported concentrations with zero replacement – option 1.
3) A gamma distribution was fitted to the daily concentration estimates (n/V), with zeros substituted with half the
    detection limit. A continuous distribution fitted to the reported concentrations with zero replacement – option 2.

In each case, a statistical model was constructed both without accounting for recovery and then with accounting for
recovery. The method of maximum likelihood (e.g. Walpole et al., 2011) was used to fit each model to the observed
data in order to estimate the parameters of a gamma distribution. The maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the
gamma distribution parameters, along with the expected value of the concentration and the upper 95th percentile
of the MLE distribution, are given in Table C.3. The CDFs from each approach (accounting for recovery) are
illustrated with the daily concentration estimates in Fig. C.4.

statistical approaches (recovery accounted for within the model)

The following comments relate to the specific pathogen data considerations raised in this section:
• Reported concentrations versus observations: Zero substitution led to less variability in the estimated density
   function, with higher minimum and lower maximum concentrations. The gamma distribution fitted to the actual
   counts had a lower mean, but higher predicted upper 95th percentile concentration. The importance of the
   quantitative difference in concentration depends on the application of the QMRA and the level of detail required
   in the analysis.
• Accounting for method recovery: Accounting for method recovery had a clear impact, leading to a 2- to 3-fold
   increase in the predicted concentrations. When recovery was ignored in the interpretation of pathogen data for
   QMRA, the concentrations were underestimated.
• Accounting for viability/infectivity: The concentrations predicted are for total IFA positive oocysts, and no
   information is provided on the viability or infectivity of the counted oocysts. Undertaking the QMRA based on
   the concentration of total oocysts may provide a first, conservative estimate of the risk. If the conservatively
   estimated risk is of concern, the likelihood of risk of infection should be further considered.

• Accounting for human infectivity: The distribution quantifies the total concentration of oocysts and does not
  distinguish between species, some of which are more infectious to humans than others.


C3.4.2 Campylobacter: analysis of presence/absence data
As for Cryptosporidium, the objective was to describe the PDF for Campylobacter concentration in surface water.
Some factors were unclear:
• The reported concentrations of Campylobacter were an inference based on the presence/absence results
   (MPN·L−1) by enrichment and cell culture with selective media and conditions (42 °C). What were the presence/
   absence observations behind the reported concentrations?
• Was the method recovery accounted for in the reported concentrations?

Further details on the observations associated with the reported concentrations of Campylobacter are given in Table
C.4. The concentration estimates were the MPN based on a 3 × 3 matrix (three replicates at three 10-fold dilutions).
The data were used to fit the parameters of a gamma distribution to describe variability in concentration using two
different approaches:
1) The gamma distribution was fitted to the reported concentrations with the right-censored data substituted with
    the maximum value (2400 MPN·L−1).
2) A hierarchical statistical model was fitted to the presence/absence results for Campylobacter. The model was
    constructed to allow for the daily concentration estimates to be the Poisson parameter and the between-day
    variability to be described by a gamma distribution.

The results are given in Table C.4 and illustrated in Fig. C.5.

The following comments relate to the specific pathogen data considerations raised in this section:
• Reported concentrations versus observations: The reported concentrations and the fitted concentrations
   from the hierarchical model are given in Table C.4 (column 2 and column 6, respectively). The uncertainty in the
   estimated daily concentration is given by a credible interval in Table C.4 (column 7). The MLE gamma distribution
   CDF under each approach is illustrated in Fig. C.5. For this data set, using the reported MPNs resulted in a
   higher, more conservative distribution.
• Accounting for method recovery: There was no quantitative information available on the recovery of the
   method, and therefore recovery has not been accounted for in this distribution.
• Implications for viability: The method of identification was by enrichment and culture, and therefore only
   viable organisms were identified; however, it may be that the predictions are an underestimate of the total
   Campylobacter load, owing to the presence of viable but non-culturable organisms.
• Implications for infectivity: No information regarding the species of Campylobacter in the samples was
   available. Most human infections are caused by C. jejuni followed by C. coli; however, other species, including
   C. upsaliensis, C. lari and C. fetus, are occasionally associated with human infections. Identifying the species is
   therefore relevant to assessing the human health implications of the predicted concentrations.


          Box C.3 Markov chain Monte Carlo and QMRA
          • Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is a random sampling technique that has been applied in many
            QMRA studies for the fitting of statistical models to microbial data sets (e.g. Teunis, Evers & Slob, 1999;
            Petterson, Teunis & Ashbolt, 2001; Petterson, Signor & Ashbolt, 2007; Teunis, Ogden & Strachan, 2008). In
            these studies, MCMC is used to explore the uncertainty in the parameter values for a statistical model or
            parametric distribution. MCMC has been used to define the credible intervals for the gamma distribution
            describing Campylobacter concentration in Fig. C.5 (a 19-parameter hierarchical model).
          • When constructing a likelihood function with multiple parameters, the resulting function is complex and can
            be difficult to investigate. Within the framework of Bayesian inference, MCMC enables the posterior density
            to be explored by random sampling. Using a Markov chain algorithm (Gibbs Sampler or Metropolis-Hastings),
            rather than being a totally random series of independent samples (as in the case of Monte Carlo sampling),
            the chain is a random walk that proposes relatively small changes in location with each new iteration. The
            Markov chain approaches the stationary distribution for the posterior density. The final MCMC sample of all
            parameter values (after a burn-in phase) is assumed to be representative of the joint posterior distribution.
            For details on methodology, see Gilks, Richardson & Spiegelhalter (1996).



C4 Faecal indicators and quantitative prediction of pathogen concentration
Faecal indicator data sets are typically larger in size than pathogen data sets; in many situations, data on indicators
are the only available microbiological data for characterization of local water quality. Not only is the measurement
of indicators more straightforward (often leading to larger data sets), but the precision for enumeration is greater




148 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
than for pathogens (see section C2.1). Indicator data can therefore provide important information regarding the
magnitude of and fluctuations in faecal contamination. Quantitative interpretation of the indicator data for
estimating pathogen concentration requires an appreciation of the theoretical relationship between indicators
and pathogens.

Even when pathogen data are available, it is generally beneficial to also include analysis of indicators alongside
faecal source attribution data, such as via MST (e.g. Gourmelon et al., 2010; Schijven & de Roda Husman, 2011), to
provide stronger evidence for the characterization of pathogen concentrations and likelihoods of human-infective
strains for QMRA.


C4.1   Theoretical relationship between pathogens and FIO
Faecal indicators can originate from several sources; however, pathogens originate from only a subset of these. In
addition, faecal indicators can exhibit very different environmental persistence from pathogens. The quantitative
ratio between FIO and pathogens in a sample depends on:
• Which faecal indicator: Table C.5 summarizes the definitions of and health significance associated with the most
    commonly used FIO.
• From whom the faecal indicators are coming: indicators may be sourced from multiple hosts; however, human-
    infective pathogens are commonly found in only a subset of these.
• Where the sources are located, and how their faeces are deposited: consideration of the fate and transport of
    the indicators relative to the human pathogens will affect the relationship between their concentrations.

The expected relationship between pathogens and faecal indicators depends on how specifically faecal in origin
the particular indicator is, how specifically human it is (i.e. MST value) and how environmentally persistent it is in
comparison with human pathogens. Interpretation of indicator data therefore requires careful consideration of the
faecal sources to the sample. For human sewage, the relationship between pathogens and indicators is much more
consistent than for surface waters, as the who (humans) and the where (e.g. sewage treatment plant) are usually
well defined. For surface waters, defining the who (humans, livestock, wild animals, etc.) and the where (large
treatment plants, agricultural runoff, on-site systems, open defecation on land or from waterfowl, etc.), which can
include numerous diffuse and/or point sources, requires a careful sanitary survey.

The expected relationship between pathogens and faecal indicators in a source will be driven by prevalence and
population size of the contributing hosts. Even for a single, (relatively) well-defined source such as human sewage,
the fluctuations in prevalence of pathogens will lead to considerable temporal variability in the pathogen to
indicator ratio. Indicators such as E. coli are excreted by most people, whereas enteric pathogens are assumed
to be excreted only by infected individuals, which may have a prevalence of much less than 1% (but up to 30%
prevalence, e.g. for noroviruses in some populations). When the incidence of pathogen infections is low, sewage
from a large population will provide a more consistent indicator to pathogen ratio compared with sewage from a
small population or a single household. For example, consider a pathogen with a point prevalence of 0.1%. In
sewage from a large community (100 000), around 100 people would be expected to be excreting the pathogen at
any point in time. Although there will be some fluctuations over time with prevalence, the E. coli to pathogen ratio
would be relatively constant. Conversely, for a single household (six persons) in low disease burden countries most
of the time, no pathogens would be excreted; however, occasionally (approximately one in every 167 households),
there would be one or more people excreting. During this event, pathogen concentration in the waste stream from
that single household would be very high, with 1/6 people excreting. At the same time, however, because of a much
higher prevalence, the indicator concentration would be expected to remain reasonably constant over time, even
for a single household. As a result of this pattern, the pathogen to indicator ratio for the waste stream from a single
household would not be very meaningful for risk assessment (fluctuation from zero to >1 for viruses); it would be
more sensible to consider the likelihood of one or more infections in a single household and predict the pathogen
concentration in the waste stream during that event. Conversely, for a large population with a small proportion
of individuals excreting pathogens, the pathogen to indicator ratio would be much more constant and hence
meaningful for risk assessment.

The expected relationship between indicators and pathogens will also depend on environmental or engineered
barriers between the faecal sources and the sampling point. FIO and pathogens sometimes respond differently
to environmental stressors and treatment barriers. For example, the reduction efficacy of sewage treatment
                                                                                                                          Annexes




barriers is different for bacteria, viruses and protozoa (and sometimes even for pathogen strains within these
groups); hence, the thermotolerant coliform to rotavirus ratio would be expected to be different for raw sewage,
primary treatment sewage and sewage following lagoon treatment. The application of a ratio needs to consider



                                                                                                            Annex C 149
the expected differences in behaviour between pathogens and indicators. In the same way, owing to differences
in environmental persistence, the ratio of thermotolerant coliforms to rotavirus would be expected to change with
time or distance downstream from a sewage source.

It is also important to consider the method of assay, such as culture versus PCR, which can, for example, yield
highly different results for FIO compared with pathogens for sewage coming from different levels of treatment
(Schoen, Soller & Ashbolt, 2011). These relationships in ratios are likely to be different when comparing pathogens
with indicators within the same pathogen class, such as ratios of faecal indicator bacteria (thermotolerant
coliforms or E. coli) to faecal bacterial pathogens (e.g. Salmonella spp.). Here, the ratios may not change as much,
because both may respond similarly to environmental stressors and treatment barriers.

C4.2 Implementation of pathogen to indicator ratios in QMRA
Despite the uncertainty in interpreting pathogen concentrations from indicator results, there are several
examples in the literature of using pathogen to indicator ratios for the purpose of quantifying reference pathogen
concentrations in source material for QMRA. Data availability is the primary driver for using faecal indicators to
quantify pathogen concentrations; even when available (which is rare), pathogen data sets are usually small, and
the reliability of estimated concentrations is often low. When the epidemiology (patterns in prevalence and
microbial sources) and environmental context (relative persistence and transport) are taken into consideration,
faecal indicator data are of great value for QMRA (e.g. Petterson et al., 2015, 2016; Petterson, Stenström & Ottoson,




152 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
2016). In particular, the typically larger data sets of faecal indicators can provide invaluable context for risk
assessment regarding the magnitude and fluctuations of faecal contamination.

Examples of the application of FIO to pathogen ratios from the literature include in drinking-water (Howard, Pedley
& Tibatemwa, 2006; van Lieverloo, Blokker & Medema, 2007; Machdar et al., 2013), recreational waters (Craig,
Fallowfield & Cromar, 2003; Soller et al., 2006) and wastewaters (Shuval, Lampert & Fattal, 1997; Mara et al.,
2007; Bastos et al., 2008; Seidu et al., 2008). For these studies, the ratios applied and the data and assumptions on
which they were based are summarized in Table C.6. In general, two different approaches have been applied in the
development of the ratios:
• Conservative limit: Soller and coworkers (2006) selected a conservative enteric virus to coliphage ratio. From
   a review of eight studies from the literature, the authors noted that F-specific RNA coliphages were always
   present in numbers equal to or greater than the numbers of enteric viruses in ambient waters. The ratio of
   coliphage to viruses reported ranged from approximately 1:1 to approximately 1 000 000:1, with levels most
   commonly reported between 100:1 and 1000:1. A ratio of 1:1 was selected as a conservative value for the risk
   assessment. Similarly, Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa (2006) used somatic coliphages as a conservative indicator
   (1:1) of rotavirus and sulfite-reducing clostridia (SRC) as a conservative indicator (1:1) of Cryptosporidium in
   drinking-water from various sources.
• Average or expected value: In the majority of studies, the ratio was developed based on a comparison between
   the average (specific statistical approaches varied or were not specified) concentration of the pathogens and the
   indicators from a particular data set that was assumed to then be representative for the risk assessment.

The approach taken in developing the ratio (including the size and representativeness of the data on which the
ratio was based) is important for interpreting the risk assessment results. For example, the results from Soller
et al. (2006) are conservative or represent an upper bound on the virus concentration and hence risk, whereas
the risks assessed by Mara et al. (2007) (as argued in their publication) may be higher or lower than the actual
risks, depending on the local fluctuations in pathogen concentration. Other factors will influence the interpretation
of any risk estimates based on FIO, which is discussed in more detail by Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa (2006) in
section C4.3.


C4.3   Example: application of pathogen to indicator ratio in QMRA (Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa,
       2006)
Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa (2006) explored the usefulness of the QMRA framework in developing contexts with
limited data. Their study location was Kampala, Uganda, where water was drawn from the Inner Murchison Bay on
Lake Victoria and passed to one of two treatment works: Gaba 1 and Gaba 2. In this example, no information was
available on the pathogen concentration in raw water; all that was available was limited data on faecal indicator
concentrations at the inflow to each plant. In order to use these data for QMRA, the authors made assumptions
about the indicator to pathogen relationship.

Three reference pathogens were selected for the QMRA: pathogenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium parvum and rotavirus.
FIO were used to estimate the pathogen concentration in raw waters at the Gaba 1 and Gaba 2 treatment plants:
for pathogenic E. coli, 95% of thermotolerant coliforms were assumed to be E. coli, and 8% of E. coli were assumed
to be pathogenic; for Cryptosporidium parvum, the concentration of SRC in the raw water was assumed to equal
the Cryptosporidium concentration; and for rotavirus, the concentration of coliphage in raw water was assumed to
equal the rotavirus concentration; this was argued to represent a worst-case scenario. The indicator data and the
inferred pathogen concentrations are summarized in Table C.7.

The risks from pathogenic E. coli associated with consumption of water leaving the drinking-water treatment plants
(assuming 5 log10 reduction for treatment performance), water from the distribution system, household water and
spring water were compared with a reference level of tolerable risk (10−6 DALY) and with each other. The following
conclusions were drawn:
• Disease burden associated with the water supplies varied between sources. Water leaving the treatment plants
   was comparable with the reference risk level; water in the distribution system was around 2–4 log10 above
   the reference level; and water from household storage and the protected springs was 4–6 log10 above the
   reference level.
• The authors concluded that risks associated with distributed water were higher than risks associated with
   water leaving the treatment plant, identifying the need for improved operation and maintenance of the
   distribution system.
• Risks associated with spring water and stored household water were higher than those associated with piped
   supplies, highlighting the need to increase access to piped supplies.

For Cryptosporidium, the risk from water leaving each treatment plant was compared with the reference level of
tolerable risk and was calculated to be around 1 log10 higher than the reference level at Gaba 1 and 2 log10 higher
than the reference level at Gaba 2. The risk was also calculated for a failure event at Gaba 2, during which there
was a significant 4 log10 increase in comparison with the average. Similarly, for rotavirus, the risk was calculated to
be around 3.5 log10 higher than the reference level from both plants.

For a full discussion of the model inputs and uncertainty associated with the assumed pathogen concentrations, the
reader is referred to the original publication. It is clear, however, that the validity of the QMRA outcomes depends on




                                                                                                                                    Annex C 155
the inferences made regarding the relationship between indicators and pathogens in order to predict the pathogen
concentrations in Table C.7. In particular, for the E. coli analysis, the validity of the conclusions associated with the
comparison of risks between water sources rests on the assumption that the health significance associated with
the presence of E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms in untreated water, distributed water, household water and
spring water is the same. By implication, this assumes that the sources of indicators to untreated water, distributed
water, household water and spring water have identical indicator to pathogen ratios.

In this study, only faecal indicator data were available; although the assumption of “same health significance”
introduced a constraint to the interpretation and a source of uncertainty, it did allow for the water sources to be
quantitatively compared from a disease burden perspective. The results could be used to support decisions
regarding infrastructure development and investment, an important benefit and application of the indicator
monitoring data. If there was compelling evidence to support different faecal sources between water supplies,
whether or not the “same source assumption” could have biased the outcomes of the risk assessment could be
further explored through scenario analysis, assuming different faecal sources to each water supply.


C5 Quantifying pathogen reduction across barriers: empirical approach

C5.1    Data considerations
When adopting an empirical approach, observations are collected before and after the treatment barrier and
statistically analysed to provide a quantification of the treatment efficacy. Regarding the observational data, the
factors described below need to be considered.


C5.1.1 Surrogates
Evaluation of treatment efficacy can rarely be undertaken using observations of human pathogens. This is because
pathogen concentrations are typically too variable and low (particularly after a barrier) to allow for enumeration
and effective evaluation of barrier efficacy. Surrogates (native and spiked) are therefore used to evaluate removal
performance. Where mechanisms of removal are not isolated, the surrogate is assumed to mimic the behaviour
of the pathogen in all aspects; nevertheless, the primary mechanism of removal (e.g. filtration, inactivation) will
influence the selection of a suitable surrogate. Although, historically, faecal coliform bacteria have been most
commonly used to describe pathogen reduction across a barrier, this group of organisms cannot be expected to
behave in the same way as the diverse range of pathogens in terms of physical size of the microbe and persistence.
Microbial size, persistence and surface properties are typical determinants of surrogate selection, and therefore
different surrogates will be selected to represent bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens.

Cryptosporidium removal has been modelled using aerobic spores (Medema et al., 2003; Jaidi et al., 2009); spores
of SRC (Teunis et al., 1997; Havelaar et al., 2000; Medema et al., 2003; Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa, 2006;
Oesterholt et al., 2007; Carlander, Schönning & Stenström, 2009); Clostridium perfringens (Ottoson & Stenström,
2003); particles (1–15 μg) (Westrell et al., 2003); and PRD1 bacteriophage (Medema et al., 2003). Using the same
data sets, some studies also modelled Giardia with SRC (Teunis et al., 1997; Oesterholt et al., 2007; Carlander,
Schönning & Stenström, 2009) and Clostridium perfringens (Ottoson & Stenström, 2003). Physical removal of
viruses has been modelled using somatic coliphages (Ottoson & Stenström, 2003; Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa,
2006; Oesterholt et al., 2007; Carlander, Schönning & Stenström, 2009) and F-specific RNA coliphages (Oesterholt
et al., 2007). Escherichia coli was used to model the removal of Salmonella (Carlander et al., 2009), Campylobacter
(Oesterholt et al., 2007) and pathogenic E. coli (Howard, Pedley & Tibatemwa, 2006) across water treatment.
Enterococci were used to model removal of Campylobacter (Ottoson & Stenström, 2003; Oesterholt et al., 2007)
in greywater and household water treatment and pathogens through superficial aquifers (Roser et al., 2002). It is
important, however, to understand the limitations associated with use of these surrogates (Payment & Locas, 2011).

In wastewater reuse studies, non-microbial surrogates have also been used to estimate the magnitude of
wastewater or faecal contamination. Shuval, Lampert & Fattal (1997) relied on the volume of wastewater attached
to irrigated lettuce in order to estimate microbial contamination of wastewater-irrigated crops. This approach was
extended to broccoli and cabbage by Hamilton and co-workers (2006). Faecal sterols were used as a surrogate for
faecal contamination of urine (Höglund, Stenström & Ashbolt, 2002) and greywater (Ottoson & Stenström, 2003).




156 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
C5.1.2 Sampling regime
When using an empirical approach, observed reductions are representative only for the specific experimental
conditions. Therefore, understanding the conditions under which the samples were collected is critical to
interpreting the results. Three particular factors require consideration:
1) Variability in inflow and outflow concentrations: For real barriers (pilot- and full-scale), the concentrations
    of pathogens and native surrogates are constantly fluctuating in the samples before and after the barrier.
    These fluctuations, particularly at the time of sampling, will influence the interpretation of the results. Note:
    Comparison of a single sample before and after treatment can imply an increase in concentration; however, this
    phenomenon is often the result of random fluctuations in concentration (e.g. a low random sample before, and a
    high random sample after) that can occur even when the overall concentration of organisms is reduced across
    the barrier.
2) Variability in barrier performance: Even for barriers operating under stable (steady-state) conditions, the
    treatment performance may be variable. The time scale of the experimental data is therefore important. Studies
    may collect many samples before and after treatment over a short period (e.g. many samples collected on the
    same day, before and after treatment), or samples may be collected over a longer period (e.g. monthly samples
    before and after treatment over a year).
3) Were samples paired before and after the barrier? Samples are often collected on the same day and at a
    similar time. Whether or not the samples are paired (represent the same water/media before and after the
    barrier) depends on the residence time and dynamics of the individual barrier. When samples are paired, the
    uncertainty in removal performance can be reduced.


C5.1.3 Challenge testing
Challenge testing to characterize treatment efficacy (where the inflow to the treatment barrier is spiked with a
high concentration of microbial surrogates) is often undertaken in order to overcome the problems associated
with relying on native surrogates. Guiding principles for challenge testing of household treatment devices to
characterize efficacy are given in the WHO document on evaluating household water treatment options (WHO, 2011);
and examples of pilot-scale (Hendricks et al., 2005) and full-scale challenge testing of water treatment barriers
have been published in the literature (e.g. Davies et al., 2008).


C5.2 Statistical analysis
The following factors need to be considered in the selection of a suitable statistical approach or model for
quantifying barrier performance. The approach will depend on the value to be inferred, which may include:
• the expected value of the barrier performance;
• the minimum value of the barrier performance;
• the range of expected performance; and
• the probability distribution describing the variability in removal performance.

Do the data represent the original observations or reported concentrations? Monitoring data are typically reported
as concentrations. These concentrations are an inference based on the laboratory observations (see section C2).

What are the characteristics of the data? These characteristics (qualitative, discrete, categorical or continuous) will
influence the selected modelling approach, as the selected distributions must be appropriate to the type of data
(see section C3).

Four statistical approaches have been used within QMRA to quantify microbial reduction efficacy. Each approach
has different assumptions regarding the variability in microorganism concentration (normal, lognormal or another
alternative distribution) and variability in treatment (is it constant or variable?) and the interpretation of microbial
data sets. The four statistical approaches are described below:
1) Single point estimates to describe reduction efficacy for a particular process or treatment train; sometimes
    referred to as the decimal elimination capacity. Barrier efficiency studies in the literature typically report a
    point estimate of reduction that represents the log10 difference in mean concentrations before and after the
    barrier (e.g. for drinking-water treatment processes: Payment & Franco, 1993; Hendricks et al., 2005; Hijnen
                                                                                                                            Annexes




    et al., 2007; and wastewater treatment: Rose et al., 1996; Scott et al., 2003). Using this approach, the method of
    averaging the microbial counts can influence the quantified reduction; this is illustrated in section C5.3.




                                                                                                              Annex C 157
2) Single point estimates by sampling occasion (paired data): A range of point estimates that describe the log10
   reduction in average concentration between sampling occasions (data paired before and after treatment pairs)
   – for example, greywater treatment (Ottoson & Stenström, 2003) and urban stormwater barriers (Davies et al.,
   2008).
3) A ratio between the distributions of inflow and the outflow concentration – for example, the ratio calculated by
   sampling from the Poisson lognormal distributions fitted to counts before and after treatment (Masago et al.,
   2004); and the likelihood function describing the parameters of the distribution of the ratio between two gamma
   variables fitted to virus counts before and after several different treatment barriers (Teunis et al., 2009).
4) Statistical models that describe microbial passage as a binomial (two-outcome) process (Teunis, Evers & Slob,
   1999; Medema et al., 2003; Teunis et al., 2009).

The statistical approach employed will have an impact on the inferred log10 reduction of barrier efficacy. In general,
as more factors are accounted for in the statistical analysis, the mathematical complexity increases. The more
detailed statistical approaches (points 3 and 4 above) have been explored only in the context of drinking-water
QMRA. Section C5.4 illustrates the impact that the analysis approach can have on the quantified log10 reduction. The
influence of the analysis approach is expected to be greater for small data sets.


C5.2.1 Accounting for differences between the surrogate and the pathogen
When a surrogate is used to quantify pathogen reduction efficacy, there is uncertainty regarding how well that
surrogate is able to represent the pathogen of interest. In most cases, quantitative information relating the
pathogen and surrogate performances is not available. The predominant approach within QMRA is to simply
assume that the surrogate behaves identically to the pathogen (which ignores a potentially important source of
uncertainty). However, two exceptions have been published in the literature: Jaidi et al. (2009) attempted to quantify
the relationship between oocyst and aerobic spore removal based on literature data; and Medema et al. (2003) used
MS2 and PRD1 bacteriophage to evaluate Cryptosporidium oocyst removal by soil passage, applying a 1.5- to 3-fold
increase to the estimated phage removal based on the results of Schijven et al. (1999, 2003).


C5.3    Example: quantifying log10 reduction from microbial counts
Microbial counts analysed from samples collected before and after a drinking-water treatment process are
included in Table C.8.

158 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
Three potential approaches for quantifying log10 reduction based on the data in Table C.8 are as follows:

1) Take ratios of concentrations before and after, and average:
       1 3 ki/Wi
R1 =    ∑          = 0.017 78 (log10 reduction = 1.75)
       3 i=1 ni/Vi

2) Average concentrations before and after, and use their ratio:
       1
       3
           ∑ 3i=1 ki/Wi
R2 =   1                  = 0.018 18 (log10 reduction = 1.74)
       3
           ∑ 3i=1 ni/Vi

3) Add counts and volumes before and after, and use their ratios:
        ∑ 3i=1 ki/∑ 3i=1 Wi
R3 =                           = 0.021 43 (log10 reduction = 1.67)
        ∑ 3i=1 ni/∑ 3i=1 Vi
The same data are analysed; however, different estimates of the log10 reduction are obtained. Why are they
different? R1 assigns equal weights to ratios of concentration; R2 assigns equal weights to concentrations; and
R3 weights the concentrations by the counted numbers. In the case of Poisson-distributed counts, R3 is the best
(maximum likelihood) estimator of the ratio of concentrations after/before the barrier. Does the difference matter?
That depends on the purpose of the risk assessment and the required level of precision. The importance of the
difference can be explored through sensitivity analysis during risk characterization (Chapter 8). Of most importance
is to recognize that the assumptions behind the data analysis approach will influence the quantitative prediction of
barrier efficiency.


C5.4 Example: reduction of Giardia across conventional drinking-water treatment
Monthly water samples were collected at the inflow and the outflow of a drinking-water treatment plant over the
period of 1 year and were analysed for Giardia. The counts are summarized in Table C.9.

1) Overall average performance. Barrier performance data are often analysed simply by comparing the average
   inflow and outflow concentrations. In this case: log10 (0.46) − log10 (0.042) = 1.04.
2) Performance paired by sampling occasion. The treatment performance was calculated for each individual
   sampling day. In this case: log10 reduction would be reported as 1.04 (0.22 – 1.22). Using method 2, some
   indication of the variability in the treatment performance between days is given; however, this is limited by
   the assumption of direct correlation between paired samples and the influence of zero counts. When zero
   organisms are counted at the outflow, the reduction can only be estimated to be “at least” the removal of the
   inflow concentration, and the upper limit of the reduction efficacy on that day cannot be estimated. In addition,
   when zero organisms are counted at the inflow and the outflow, no information is available regarding the
   reduction on that particular day.
3) Ratio between distributions of concentrations before and after treatment. The treatment performance can be
   characterized by fitting a distribution to the concentration both before and after treatment and then using Monte
   Carlo simulation to calculate the distribution of the ratio between the two distributions. The distribution for the
   ratio is then an estimator of the barrier efficiency.
   Fig. C.6 illustrates the gamma distributions fitted to the counts from the inflow and the outflow. The ratios
   between these two distributions, assuming both no correlation and complete correlation (random samples of
   inflow and outflow distributions were sorted, forcing complete rank correlation), are reported in Table C.10. The
   expected values of both analyses are similar (−1.33 versus −1.34); however, the variability (and uncertainty, as
   they are not separated in this model) in the distribution for Giardia removal is greatly reduced in the correlated
   model in comparison with the independent model. The true result would be expected to lie somewhere between
   these two unrealistic extremes.
4) Binomial models: Models have been presented in the literature that describe organism passage through
   treatment as a binomial process (Teunis, Evers & Slob, 1999), where each microorganism faces one of two
   possible outcomes: passage or removal. Mean microorganism concentration in the inflow (µ) is assumed to
   follow a gamma distribution. The maximum likelihood beta distribution for removal is illustrated in Fig. C.7.

In the analyses presented, the same data were interpreted to yield different quantitative inputs for the QMRA.
Table C.10 shows the assumptions that are accounted for in each of the methods. The higher the number of factors
accounted for in the analysis, the greater the mathematical complexity. Selection of the most appropriate approach
will depend on the purpose of the QMRA, as defined in problem formulation, and the required level of detail in the
analysis for the QMRA. When applying a tiered approach (Chapter 5), a conservative point estimate can be applied
first, with more detailed analysis to follow, if required.


C5.5 Example: reduction across a full-scale urban wetland
A monitoring programme was undertaken to evaluate the microbial removal performance of a full-scale urban
wetland in Melbourne, Australia (Petterson et al., 2016). The wetland was one component of an overall treatment
system (illustrated in Fig. C.8) designed to collect and reuse urban stormwater for public space irrigation.

Fig. C.8 Overall treatment train for stormwater reuse in Melbourne, Australia (adapted from Mitchell et al., 2008)

Water samples were collected at the inflow and the outflow of the wetland and analysed for three microbial
surrogate organisms: E. coli, intended to represent bacteria, somatic coliphage, to represent viruses, and
Clostridium perfringens, to represent protozoa. Samples were collected under background (baseflow) conditions
and during rainfall events using a flow-triggered auto-sampler. Results are summarized in Table C.11. The log10
reductions were calculated as the log10 difference in the geometric mean before and after the treatment barrier.

The results indicate that higher removals were apparent for all organisms under event conditions in comparison
with background conditions. For C. perfringens and somatic coliphages, the concentrations at the outflow under
event and background conditions were similar; however, the event inflow concentrations were higher. For E. coli, the
inflow concentration was approximately 2 log10 higher under event conditions; however, the outflow concentration




162 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
was only around 1 log10 higher. These results imply that the wetland was effectively providing a buffer for the
retention of microorganisms under event conditions; that is, whereas the geometric mean and range of inflow
concentrations were much higher under event conditions, the geometric mean outflow concentration remained
relatively steady.

The simple comparison between the inflow and outflow concentrations of the wetland does not give the full
picture of the microbial removal performance, as the system is not operating in steady state. Rather, the treatment
process is dynamic and responding to pulses of flow and microbial loading due to rainfall events. Compare the
estimated log10 reductions with the time series plot of a single event in Fig. C.9. For E. coli, the peak concentrations
at the inflow and outflow occurred at the start of the event, with concentrations declining over time. These results
suggest that an initial peak of E. coli was released from the wetland in response to the rainfall event. This peak
could have been caused by one or a combination of two factors: 1) penetration of runoff through the wetland during
high-flow conditions, enabling an initial plume of runoff to reach the outlet with only minimal reduction (peak
inflow = 15 000 MPN·100 mL−1; peak outflow = 7700 MPN·100 mL−1, indicating a peak reduction of 0.29 log10); in this
case, E. coli would represent material from the catchment mobilized during the runoff event; or 2) resuspension of
residual material in the wetland, stored from previous runoff events or generated by waterfowl.

Consideration of the results for C. perfringens and somatic coliphages indicates a similar pattern, although it is less
marked than for E. coli. In fact, for the coliphages, the initial peak exceeded the measured inflow concentration, and
a second peak was apparent around 6 days after the initial rainfall event. It is not possible to determine if these
results are a product of the inherent variability in the concentration or are a process-driven response to the inflows
to the system.

164 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
A simple overall concentration comparison would ignore the potential risks associated with short-term penetration
of pathogen peaks following runoff events. The risk assessment must give consideration to the dynamic nature of
the wetland system as a removal barrier. The resulting risk characterization would not represent the fluctuations
in risk associated with the system. Using the reported data, the short-term risks immediately following a rainfall
event could be characterized separately from the baseline risk. Although this would be conservative, it would
provide an indication of the fluctuations. Alternatively, a process-driven mechanistic approach to modelling the
indicator data may reduce the uncertainty in characterizing the performance of the barrier in response to pathogen
loading events.


C6 Quantifying pathogen reduction across barriers: mechanistic approach
Mechanistic, process-driven models are being increasingly used to describe the fate and transport of pathogens
across barriers. Rather than simply comparing data sets before and after the barrier, process-based models
consider factors driving the pathogen removal or inactivation and, moreover, seek to quantify those factors for the
individual system. The two most common applications of a mechanistic approach in QMRA have been for hydrologic
modelling and modelling pathogen inactivation.


C6.1   Hydrologic models
Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution and quality of water. For water-related QMRA, the vehicle
of disease transmission from source to exposure is water. Hydrologic models can thus be of great value for
quantifying the fate and transport of pathogens under a diverse range of water conditions, including:
• rainfall and runoff models of water catchments, for describing the frequency and magnitude of overland flow
    events that mobilize pathogens to surface waters (Signor et al., 2005);
• hydrodynamic models of rivers, for describing the dispersion (dilution) and advection (transport time) of
    pollutants between an input and a downstream point of exposure or offtake location;
• hydrodynamic models of reservoirs, for describing the variability (in particular, potential for short-circuiting) in
    residence time under the range of inflow (rainfall and runoff) and stratification conditions (Brookes et al., 2004);
• hydraulic models of water and wastewater treatment facilities, for describing variable residence time within
    sedimentation basins, storage ponds and contact chambers;
• hydraulic models of distribution systems, for describing the impact of low-pressure ingress events and the fate
    and transport of introduced pathogens (Teunis et al., 2010b); and
• hydrogeologic models, for describing the fate and transport of waterborne pathogens in the subsurface
    (Schijven & Hassanizadeh, 2000; Schijven et al., 2003, 2006).

Drawing on the tools available for modelling of water movement and combining with an understanding of
microbiological persistence provide a depth of understanding to the drivers of microbial risks that cannot be
ascertained from the microbiological monitoring data alone. In particular, understanding the limits of water
transport provides a boundary around the assessment of microbial risks (e.g. minimum transport times, short-
circuiting, potential impact or travel distance of a contamination event).


C6.2 Pathogen inactivation
Pathogen inactivation outside the host, either as a result of natural environmental stressors or in the presence of
a disinfectant, is an important barrier for the protection of public health. The implications of hydrologic models in
terms of travel times from source to exposure can be interpreted for human health risk only with an appreciation
of microbial persistence. Inactivation models are used to describe pathogen persistence in the environment (e.g.
soil, water, crops), during thermal treatment (e.g. composting, cooking) and during disinfection (e.g. chlorine based,
UV, ozone). For a given set of conditions, the rate of microbial inactivation varies between pathogen groups and
between individual pathogen types.

Microbial persistence within QMRA is commonly modelled as a first-order process related to time: Surviving
Fraction = e−k∙t. Inactivation rates may be directly reported as k values (inactivation rate of a log10 scale) or as T90
(time for 1 log10 reduction) or T99 (time for 2 log10 reduction) values. For environmental inactivation, an overview of
factors influencing pathogen survival and expected survival times (and, in some cases, expected decay rates; Table

For disinfection, inactivation is typically modelled as a first-order process related to the concentration of
disinfectant × time (ct value) for disinfection: Surviving Fraction = e−kc∙t. Indicative required ct99 (ct for 2 log10
inactivation) values for different pathogens and disinfectants are summarized in the GDWQ (Table 7.7; WHO, in
preparation) and supporting documents (Sobsey, 1989; LeChevallier & Au, 2004). There is, however, considerable
variability in the reported ranges for the value of microbial inactivation rates. Using these assumptions of first-
order decay and a known decay rate, the log10 reduction can be estimated for a given set of barrier conditions. In
particular, if the residence time of the contactor and disinfectant dosing is well characterized, then the expected
reduction can be estimated for the specific contactor. Under these mechanistic assumptions and applying
pathogen-specific inactivation data, a screening-level modelling approach to support the QMRA of drinking-water
systems has been presented (Petterson & Stenström, 2015).

In selecting an inactivation rate from the literature, the following factors need to be considered:
• Model organism: Studies are often conducted on surrogate organisms, rather than on pathogens. What was the
    model organism, and what is known about how representative it is for the pathogen of interest?
• Laboratory strains of organisms: Laboratory experiments require a high concentration of target organisms
    to seed. These organisms are grown from laboratory strains. How well do these organisms represent the
    resilience of environmental strains?
• Microbial methods: For pathogens and microbial surrogates, all the methodological issues addressed in
    sections C1 and C2 are also relevant.
• Experimental conditions: Experimental conditions (including media, climatic conditions, disinfectant dosing
    procedure) are necessarily controlled and specific. How representative are these of true environmental
    conditions?
• Definition of microbial inactivation: Inactivation studies must select a criterion to define when a microorganism
    is damaged beyond recovery to an infectious state. Typically, loss of infectivity or culturability is the criterion
    for quantifying microbial inactivation. Possible additional criteria are usually based on the method to detect
    cell viability and include changes in electrical conductivity of cells, changes in the permeability of the cell
    membranes, presence of cell or enzyme activity, changes in the rate of metabolism and changes in the ability
    of the cell to stain with various dyes. For viruses, this can be integrity of the capsid and/or the nucleic acid. For
    protozoa, the ability to excyst (viability) has also been used. The most frequently used criterion for culturable
    organisms (most bacteria, several viruses, some protozoa) is complete loss of reproductive power. Some
    studies have explored the use of molecular methods to identify pathogen inactivation (Li et al., 2002; Shin &
    Sobsey, 2008; Lim, Kim & Ko, 2010). This approach relies on the assumption that genetic material is destroyed
    on pathogen inactivation and cannot be replicated during PCR. In reality, pathogens may be inactivated before
    genetic material is destroyed, and fragments of genes may be amplified during PCR. Therefore, molecular
    methods still typically overestimate infectious organism concentration and therefore underestimate microbial
    inactivation in comparison with cultural methods. However, active or viable but non-culturable (VBNC) states
    exist, meaning that pathogens may be infectious, yet not culturable (Lothigius et al., 2010). This VBNC state is
    also true for FIO (Sobsey et al., 1998; Juhna et al., 2007). Pathogen death or inactivation can also be investigated
    using infectivity studies (e.g. hepatitis A virus and murine norovirus) (Wei et al., 2010).

170 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
ANNEX D                                              DOSE–RESPONSE

Most risk assessments use dose–response information from the published literature. Care must be taken that
the selected model and parameter values are appropriate for the risk study and that when interpreting the
calculations, the implications of the assumptions underlying the selected numbers are considered.

The infectivity of a pathogen depends on its ability to pass host defences, find a site for colonization and cause an
infection within the human host. Variability in infectivity can then exist due to:
• variability between pathogens in their virulence and human infectivity; and
• variability between hosts in the strength of their immune response. Susceptible portions of the population
    include children, the elderly and the immunocompromised, who are more easily infected. In addition, short- or
    long-term immunity following an infection may protect portions of the population from future enteric infections.


D1 Observations
Two types of studies are used to obtain scientific evidence to support the development of dose–response
relationships: clinical studies and outbreaks. In all cases, the following factors need to be considered in
interpreting the data:
• How many subjects (observations) were included in the study?
• Who were the study subjects, and what was their vulnerability to disease (i.e. animals, healthy children and/or
    healthy adults, or immunocompromised or malnourished children and/or adults)?
• What was the history of the organism used for the experiment?
• What were the exposure doses?
• How was infection determined?


D1.1   Clinical studies
In clinical studies, subjects are administered a known dose of a laboratory strain of pathogens, and their response
is then followed over days or weeks following exposure for evidence of infection (excretion, serological response)
and illness. The majority of dose–response data used for QMRA are from healthy adult volunteers, although animal
studies are also used in some specific cases.


D1.2   Outbreaks
                                                                                                                        Annexes




In some cases, real outbreaks have been used to quantify the dose–response relationship for certain pathogens.
The advantages of outbreak studies are that the pathogen is a true environmental strain and the population is a




                                                                                                          Annex D 171
true representative population (often including children). The disadvantages are that the dose is often poorly known
and the response of all exposed subjects is difficult to follow.


D2 Dose–response models
Quantifying infectivity involves selecting a model to describe the process and fitting that model to the observations
in order to obtain best estimates of the parameter values.

Various models exist for the dose–response relationship for infection and the dose–response relationship for
illness when infected (the conditional relation for illness given infection). Most are based on the single-hit theory:
where every ingested pathogen particle is assumed to act independently and has an individual probability of
causing infection (Haas, 1983; Teunis & Havelaar, 2000). Population dose–response models for infection are
summarized in Box D.1. Note that there are two different forms of the Beta-Poisson model, an exact and an
approximate function. Care should be taken that when parameter estimates from the exact model are not valid for
the approximate model (α < β and β > 1), these parameter estimates should not be used for predicting risks with the
approximate model, because they will result in serious errors in the calculated risk.


 Box D.1 Dose–response relationship for infection
 For a Poisson inoculum, the dose-dependent probability of exposure is:

 Pinf (c·V) = 1 − e−c·V		                                                             Eq. D.1

 with dose cV as the concentration of pathogens (c) multiplied by ingested volume (V). If the single-hit probability
 of infection (probability that any single ingested pathogen succeeds in infecting the host) is r, then the dose–
 response model for infection is:

 Pinf (c·V ; r) = 1 − e−rc·V                                                          Eq. D.2

 If r is variable and its variability is described by a beta distribution with parameters (α, β), then:

 Pinf (c·V ; α, β) = 1 − 1 F1(α, α + β; −c·V)                                         Eq. D.3

 in which 1 F1 is a confluent hypergeometric function (Kummer function). Provided that α << β and β >> 1, this
 model, called the “Beta-Poisson” dose–response model, can be approximated by:
                                c·V
 Pinf (c·V ; α, β) = 1 − (1 +         )-α                                             Eq. D.4
                                 β
 This latter approximation is sometimes written as
                                  c·V 1/α
 Pinf (c·V ; α, N50) = 1 − (1 +       (2 − 1))-α                                      Eq. D.5
                                  N50
 in which N50 is the ID50, the 50% infectious dose (Haas et al., 1993). Note that N here is not a discrete number:
 the dose is a Poisson parameter and can be any positive real number.

Several modifications to the dose–response models have been published, allowing for covariables such as
immune status of the host, innate immunity, aggregated pathogens or sexual reproduction of the pathogen. This
(conditional) probability may also depend on dose (Teunis, Nagelkerke & Haas, 1999; Teunis et al., 2005, 2010). This
has consequences for epidemiology, because when a population is exposed to low doses of an enteric pathogen,
some people may become infected, but few of these infected subjects will become ill, so that cases are sporadic.
When the dose is high, not only is there a higher probability of infection, but also those who are infected have a
higher probability of becoming ill, so that a cluster of enteric illness may be detected.


D2.1    Maximum risk curve: the upper limit of the single-hit model
A useful property of the single-hit model is that there is an upper bound, referred to as the maximum risk curve
(Teunis & Havelaar, 2000). This curve describes the probability of infection when every ingested organism is
assumed to be successful in causing an infection (exponential model with r = 1). In the absence of pathogen-specific
infectivity information or to estimate the worst case for a particularly virulent pathogen strain, the maximum risk
curve can be used as an upper bound.



172 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
D2.2 Fractional Poisson model
In the fractional Poisson model proposed by Messner, Berger & Nappier (2014), the individual’s probability of
infection (r) is assumed to be exactly 1 with probability P and exactly 0 with probability 1 − P, and it cannot be
anything in between. The probability of infection (Pinf) is given by:					

                  − dose
Pinf = P∙(1 − e      �     )		                                                         Eq. D.6

where µ is the mean aggregated size (as the model was presented in the context of norovirus). Individuals are
therefore considered to be perfectly susceptible or perfectly immune. The probability of receiving at least one
                                                               − dose
aggregate (and hence at least one virion) is given by (1 − e      �     ) , which may also be referred to as the probability
of exposure.


D2.3    Application of single-hit models in QMRA: adopting a conditional approach
When applying single-hit models, the distribution of pathogens in exposure media is assumed to be random
(Poisson). For human volunteer feeding trial studies, the Poisson distribution may be a reasonable assumption;
however, in most environmental media, some microbial clumping (overdispersion) is expected. When applying
dose–response models for QMRA and using Monte Carlo simulation, rather than using the exponential or Beta-
Poisson models (with input as average dose), it may be preferred to simulate the number of organisms consumed
by each exposed individual within the Monte Carlo and then calculate the probability of infection based on that dose
(Haas, 2002). The probability that each organism is capable of causing infection is given by r (for the exponential
model) or a beta distribution defined by α and β (for Beta-Poisson or hypergeometric models). Using this approach,
the pathogens can be assumed to follow any distribution in environmental media.


D2.4 Application of single-hit models in QMRA: low-dose approximations
In the implementation of dose–response models within QMRA, it is often desirable to apply a low-dose
approximation in order to simplify the calculations. In the low-dose region, the relationships are close to linear,
and, in many cases, an approximation is reasonable. In the application of dose–response models in the drinking-
water guidelines (GDWQ Table 7.4; WHO, in preparation), a low-dose simplification to the single-hit model has been
adopted. Only the probability of infection from a single organism is considered; the probability of exposure to more
than one organism per day is assumed to be so low that it is ignored in the dose–response relationship. At very low
concentrations, this simplification is valid; however, it is important that at higher pathogen doses (approximately
0.3 microorganisms), the full single-hit (exponential or Beta-Poisson) model should be used to account for the risk
of infection associated with exposure to more than one organism.
                                                                                             dose −α
When applying the Beta-Poisson model, the commonly used approximation (Pinf = 1 − (1 +             ) ) (where α and
                                                                                               β
β are parameters of the beta distribution) is appropriate when the parameter values meet the constraints of the
approximation (α << β and β >> 1). As illustrated in Fig. D.1, for parameter values that do not lie in this range, the
common approximation can deviate considerably from the exact Beta-Poisson model and may even (as in the
case of the Campylobacter jejuni model) exceed the theoretical maximum risk. In these cases, a better low-dose
approximation is to use the exponential dose–response function with r equal to the expected value of the beta
                α
distribution (     ).

D3 Published dose–response relationships
Many studies have been undertaken in which dose–response models have been fitted to experimental data.
Published parameter values from these studies have been widely applied within QMRA in a diverse range of
contexts. Each of these models has different sources of uncertainty, as they are based on different data (different
doses, different measures of dose, different hosts and different sample sizes), and modelling studies have
applied a range of different assumptions to produce an acceptable fit. An appreciation of these details is valuable
for selecting a dose–response model and subsequently interpreting the representativeness of the resulting
risk calculations.

Fig. D.1 Comparison of low-dose approximations for rotavirus and Campylobacter models (adapted from Medema et
al., 2006)


D3.1              Campylobacter jejuni
Medema and colleagues (1996) developed a dose–response relationship for Campylobacter jejuni by fitting the
Beta‑Poisson approximation to experimental data published by Black and coworkers (1988). In that study, healthy
adult volunteers were fed doses of between 8 × 102 and 1 × 108 cells prepared with milk. In total, 68 volunteers
were included, with between five and 19 volunteers challenged with each of six doses. Infection was defined as a
positive result from stool culture; a subset of the infected volunteers also developed symptoms of illness.

The dosage and subsequent attack rates associated with the volunteer study were very high, with the lowest
experimental dose at 800 CFU. The subsequent dose–response relationship has been extensively applied for
water-related QMRAs where the mean doses are often very low, much lower than the experimental range. Indeed,
when the objective of the QMRA is to model the annual risk of infection in the range of 1 × 10−4 (with daily exposure),
then the mean daily dose must be approximately 1 × 10−5 CFU, around 7 log10 below the range of the experimental
observations on which the dose–response relationship was based.

In a later study, Teunis and coworkers (2005) combined the experimental data from the volunteer study with
observations of illness from two milk-related outbreaks: one in the United Kingdom and another in the
Netherlands. In both outbreaks, a clear relationship was observed between the attack rate and the amount of milk
consumed; however, the concentration of bacteria in the contaminated milk was not known. A statistical modelling
approach was implemented to estimate the most likely parameter values of the Beta-Poisson distribution, given
both the outbreaks and the volunteer study. The concentration of C. jejuni in the contaminated milk was assumed to
be the same for both outbreaks and was included as a parameter in the model. For a given concentration, all other
parameters in the model could be determined. The authors noted a local peak in likelihood in the region of about
15 CFU·L−1, and therefore α and β values were determined at this concentration. The information from the outbreak
“filled in” the gap in the dose–response relationship from the human volunteer study, providing information at
lower doses, although still much higher than used in application.

The resulting updated model predicts a much higher infectivity at low doses than the previous model (expected
value of r = 0.69 in comparison with r = 0.019), which has important implications for practical implementation. For
example, using the original dose–response relationship, the health-based treatment target for Campylobacter in
the WHO GDWQ is 5.9 log10 removal (WHO, in preparation). However, if the updated model were to be implemented,
the treatment target would increase to approximately 7.5 log10. Would this increase be justified, or is it
overly conservative?

Since publication in 2005, there has been mixed uptake of the updated model, with some authors adopting it
(Åström et al., 2007; van Lieverloo, Blokker & Medema, 2007; Soller et al., 2010) and others favouring the earlier
dose–response relationship developed by Medema et al. (1996) (e.g. Mara et al., 2007; Oesterholt et al., 2007;
Bastos et al., 2008; Smeets et al., 2008). The higher infectivity and the dependency of the predicted model
parameters on the unknown concentration in contaminated milk are both identified as contributing causes to the
lack of uptake. The uncertainty in defining dose is greater in the outbreak studies; however, the strain of C. jejuni
is indeed a true environmental strain (as opposed to a laboratory strain), and the population exposed included

children. Both of these factors may be expected to contribute to a higher prediction of infectivity, and both are
relevant for real populations. While the infectivity of the updated model may appear too high, it is based on a
broader scientific evidence base than is reflected by the volunteer study alone.


D3.2 E. coli O157:H7
Clinical data on the infectivity of E. coli O157:H7 to humans are not available. Dose–response relationships have
been developed from animal studies, surrogate organisms and outbreaks:
• Animal studies: Pai, Kelly & Meyers (1986) studied the infectivity of E. coli O157:H7 in infant New Zealand
    White rabbits. In total, 39 rabbits were fed doses of organisms ranging from 105 to 1010 cells, and 32 rabbits
    were infected. Haas and coworkers (2000) fitted the Beta-Poisson approximation to these data (α = 0.49; N50 =
    5.9 × 105) and concluded that the predictions of the model were concordant with illness rates evidenced in two
    documented outbreaks.
• Surrogate organisms: Powell et al. (2000) combined human feeding study results from two surrogate
    organisms, enteropathogenic E. coli and Shigella dysenteriae. The authors argued that given the biological
    understanding of pathogenesis, the clinical trial data and the epidemiological information, it was reasonable to
    infer that E. coli O157:H7 has an effective dose somewhat higher than that of S. dysenteriae and somewhat lower
    than that of enteropathogenic E. coli. They fitted a model including clinical data for the two surrogates to define
    an uncertainty envelope for the dose–response relationship for E. coli 0157:H7.
• Outbreaks: Teunis et al. (2004) analysed data from a single outbreak in which schoolchildren and teachers ate
    contaminated food (Shinagawa, Hu & Yoshida, 1997). Of the 828 children and 43 adults who were exposed,
    208 and seven, respectively, were found infected. This later study compared their results with the surrogate
    study and animal study and argued that the results from Shigella dysenteriae (analysed by Teunis et al., 1996)
    appeared to have the greatest agreement with the actual outbreak data (Teunis, Takumi & Shinagawa, 2004).
    Teunis, Ogden & Strachan (2008) later extended this approach to examine eight different outbreaks; altogether,
    14 654 individuals were exposed, and 718 became infected. A hierarchical model (a beta distribution fit to
    infectivity within each outbreak; and another beta distribution to describe the distribution between outbreaks)
    was applied to allow for between-outbreak variability separately and incorporated overdispersion (relative to
    the Poisson distribution) in dose, with the resulting beta distribution for infectivity defined by medians of the
    posterior distributions for α = 0.373 and β = 39.71.


D3.3   Enteroviruses

D3.3.1 Echovirus-12
Schiff and coworkers (1984) investigated the infectivity of echovirus-12 on 149 healthy adults (18–45 years of age).
The virus was isolated from a child with erythema infectiosum (also known as fifth disease or slapped cheek
syndrome) and passed twice in primary rhesus monkey kidney cells before each volunteer was exposed to
0–330 000 PFU of virus. Infection was defined as faecal shedding or significant increases in serum antibody titre,
and no subjects developed significant illness. Teunis et al. (1996) fitted both the exponential and Beta-Poisson
approximation models to the clinical data set. The Beta-Poisson approximation provided the better fit (α = 0.401;
β = 227.2). These data have been used for QMRA of drinking-water to represent the infectivity of the enteroviruses
(Regli et al., 1991; Åström et al., 2007; van Lieverloo, Blokker & Medema, 2007).


D3.3.2 Coxsackievirus B4
Suptel (1963) undertook dose–response experiments with mice using coxsackievirus B4. In total, 50 mice were
exposed to doses of 1.3–13 000 PFU, with 31 becoming infected (mouse mortality was taken as the indication of
infection). Mena and colleagues (2003) eliminated the data at the lowest dose of 1.3 PFU (in order to make a model
fit possible) and fitted both the exponential and Beta-Poisson approximations to the data set. No significant
improvement in fit was achieved by the Beta-Poisson model, and therefore the exponential model was selected
(r = 0.0078). Mena and coworkers (2003) applied this model directly to characterize the risk associated with
exposure of humans to coxsackievirus via drinking-water and recreational water.

D3.4 Adenovirus
Clinical data that have been used to model adenovirus infectivity for QMRA were obtained as part of an aerosol
disease transmission study. Subjects were nine healthy adult male inmates who were exposed to doses of 1, 5
or 11 TCID50 of adenovirus type 4 via aerosol particles (0.3–2.5 µm). Seven individuals became infected. The two
individuals who resisted infection were exposed to the lowest dose (1 TCID50), indicating an increasing dose–
response relationship over the range. An exponential dose–response model was fitted to these data (r = 0.4172),
and it has subsequently been used for risk assessment of enteric adenovirus via ingestion for a range of water-
related enteric exposure scenarios (Crabtree et al., 1997; van Heerden et al., 2004; Westrell et al., 2004).


D3.5 Rotavirus
Clinical data for rotavirus infectivity are drawn from a human feeding study published by Ward, Bernstein & Young
(1986), in which 62 adult men were administered doses of 9 × 10−3 to 9 × 104 FFU of rotaviruses sourced from the
faeces of a sick child (8 years old). In total, 30 subjects became infected (excretion of rotavirus or seroconversion,
or both), and 17 showed signs of illness. These data were among the first to be used for QMRA with application of
the Beta-Poisson approximation model (α = 0.26; β = 0.42) (Regli et al., 1991; Haas et al., 1993).

Teunis & Havelaar (2000) identified an important limitation associated with the application of this model – that is,
that the conditions of the Beta-Poisson approximation were not met, leading to a poor approximation at low doses.
Indeed, during uncertainty analysis, Teunis & Havelaar (2000) demonstrated that the credible interval for the dose–
response relationship exceeded the theoretical maximum risk. Teunis & Havelaar (2000) therefore fit the exact
hypergeometric Beta-Poisson model to the clinical data (α = 0.167; β = 0.191).

When applying either of these models for QMRA, it is relevant to consider that the doses for the clinical study
were measured in FFU. It is therefore important to consider the units of exposure – if exposure is quantified in
terms of molecular units (e.g. genome copies or PDU), then a conversion is required before using the dose–
response relationship.


D3.6 Norovirus
Clinical data are available from three separate experiments that were undertaken with two different inocula (Teunis
et al., 2008). Two experiments were undertaken with the first inoculum, which had been stored in a high-protein
(sticky) suspension for more than 25 years and was highly aggregated. The third experiment was undertaken
with the second inoculum, which was extracted from a stool sample of one of the infected subjects from the first
experiment and contained in phosphate-buffered saline. In total, 80 healthy human volunteers (secretor positive
and considered susceptible to infection) were challenged with doses between 3.24 × 10 and 3.24 × 108 genomes, of
which 40 became infected and 24 (±1) became ill.

Teunis et al. (2008) modelled these data to estimate parameter values for the dose–response relationship; however,
a challenge was accounting for the differences in the inocula. The first inoculum was aggregated, and the second
was not; and the second inoculum had passed through a human, which may have influenced its infectivity. As
expected, when the dose–response models were fitted to each of the data sets separately, the resulting dose–
response relationships were (statistically) different.

Teunis and coworkers (2008) hypothesized that the difference between the relationships may have been primarily
due to aggregation state and therefore developed a modified single-hit model that allowed for shared α and β
values (e.g. identical infectivity between data sets), but different aggregation states. Using a likelihood ratio test to
show equivalent fit of the combined model in comparison with the separate models, the authors concluded that the
difference between the two experiments could be explained by aggregation. The implication of this result is that
the observations from all 80 volunteers were used to infer the parameter values of the beta distribution describing
norovirus infectivity (α = 0.04; β = 0.055), and the influence of aggregation on the results was eliminated. These
parameter values can be applied in the exact hypergeometric Beta-Poisson model for QMRA.

In the same manner as for the rotavirus model, it is necessary to ask, what are the appropriate units of “dose”
for this dose–response relationship? The doses for the clinical study were described as the number of genomes;
however, the statistical modelling undertaken by Teunis et al. (2008) accounted for aggregation of genomes
within virus particles. In order to translate a molecular result from an environmental sample (e.g. number of
genome copies per litre of water) to an exposure dose for the dose–response relationship, it is necessary to know




176 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
something about the aggregation state of the sample. In practice, this is not dissimilar from the rotavirus model
that relates probability of infection to the number of virus aggregates (FFU) that were consumed.

More recently, Messner, Berger & Nappier (2014) combined the data reported by Teunis et al. (2008) with three
additional human challenge studies (Seitz et al., 2011; Frenck et al., 2012; Atmar et al., 2013). They fitted the exact
Beta-Poisson model (accounting for aggregation) to the combined data set, providing updated parameter values
(Table D.1). In addition, they proposed a new dose–response model for human norovirus, which they referred to as
the fractional Poisson model. In the fractional model, each individual is assumed to have a probability of exactly 0
or 1 of becoming infected. Comparison with the exact Beta-Poisson model fitted by Teunis et al. (2008) using the
AIC indicated that not only was the fractional Poisson model computationally simpler than the Beta-Poisson, but the
model fit was superior.


D3.7   Giardia
Forty adult male prison inmates were administered one of eight doses containing between 1 and 106 Giardia cysts
and monitored for infection. A positive response was determined as the presence of viable Giardia lamblia cysts in
faeces. The exponential model was fitted to the data set using the method of maximum likelihood, with an MLE for
r = 0.0198 (Rose et al., 1991), and it has been widely used in water-related QMRA (e.g. Regli et al., 1991; Ottoson &
Stenström, 2003; Gale, 2005; Åström et al., 2007; Diallo et al., 2008).


D3.8 Cryptosporidium
A series of human feeding trials using healthy adult volunteers have been undertaken for Cryptosporidium parvum,
C. hominis, C. meleagridis and C. muris. The first, using the C. parvum Iowa isolate propagated in calves, was
published in 1995 (DuPont et al., 1995). Many risk assessments were subsequently undertaken using these data, to
which the exponential model was fitted (r = 0.0042) (e.g. Haas et al., 1996; Teunis et al., 1997; Masago et al., 2002;
Medema et al., 2003).

Subsequent trials were undertaken with the TAMU and UCP (Okhuysen et al., 1999) and Moredun isolates
(Okhuysen et al., 2002), indicating considerable between-isolate variability in Cryptosporidium infectivity. Teunis,
Chappell & Okhuysen (2002) fitted the exponential and Beta-Poisson single-hit models to the Iowa, TAMU and
UCP data sets. The first two data sets were fitted adequately by the exponential model; only the UCP data
set demonstrated a significant improvement in fit with the hypergeometric model. Comparison between the
exponential parameter (r) for the Iowa and TAMU data sets (Table D.1) indicated around a 1 log10 higher probability
of infection from a single organism for TAMU in comparison with Iowa, and around another log10 increase (based on
the expected value of the beta distribution) for UCP in comparison with Iowa. This appears to be a highly significant
difference in infectivity; however, it is important to note that Teunis, Chappell & Okhuysen (2002) identified only
a slight statistically significant improvement in model fit by analysing the three data sets separately, rather than
pooling them together as a combined data set. How is it possible that if the infectivity is so vastly different, it is not
statistically essential to consider the data sets separately? It is possible because of the magnitude of uncertainty
associated with analysing the clinical data, and hence with the predicted parameter values for dose–response. We
cannot be certain that the infectivity is so different between isolates, but, given the clinical observations, it is likely.
This example of Cryptosporidium clearly highlights the scale of the uncertainty that needs to be considered for all
pathogen data sets; the data sets are so small, and there is so much uncertainty underlying the observations, that
quantitative conclusions about the magnitude of infectivity are a challenge.

Since the publication of infectivity results for the TAMU and UCP isolates, some risk assessment studies have used
the parameter values for the hypergeometric model fitted to the combined (Iowa, TAMU and UCP) data sets (Åström
et al., 2007; Smeets et al., 2007; Hunter, Zmirou-Navier & Hartemann, 2009) in order to reflect the higher predicted
infectivity of some Cryptosporidium isolates in comparison with the model fit to the Iowa data set. Other studies (e.g.
Bastos et al., 2008; Diallo et al., 2008; Carlander, Schönning & Stenström, 2009) have continued to use the parameter
value for the exponential model fitted to the Iowa data set (r = 0.004). The concern is that considering only the less
infectious Iowa isolate may lead to an underestimate of infectivity for environmental strains of Cryptosporidium.
Conversely, it may be that the approximately 2 log10 increase in infectivity may be too conservative.

More recently, challenge study results have been published for Cryptosporidium hominis (Chappel et al., 2006).
Schijven et al. (2014) published Beta-Poisson parameter values fitted to these data, which are included in Table D.1.
The expected value of the beta distribution (r = 0.76) is higher than for previous models fitted to C. parvum isolates.
Challenge studies have also been conducted on C. meleagridis (n = 5) (Chappel et al., 2011) and C. muris (n = 6)
(Chappel et al., 2015) at high doses (1 × 105 oocysts). All subjects became infected.

   concentration of a hazard; or fails to remove a hazard from the human environment.
-- Health-based target – A defined level of health protection for a given exposure. This can be based on a measure of disease
   (e.g. 10−6 DALY per person per year) or the absence of a specific disease related to that exposure.

   interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the health protection of consumers and
   promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options.
-- Sanitary inspection – An on-site inspection and evaluation by qualified individuals of all conditions, devices and practices
   in the water supply system that pose an actual or potential danger to the health and well-being of the consumer. Sanitary

   exposed has an equal and independent chance of causing infection.
-- Statistic – A function of a random sample of data (e.g. mean, standard deviation, distribution parameters).
-- Statistical distribution – A probability distribution.
-- Statistical inference – A systematic approach used to draw conclusions from data sets arising from systems affected by

   and accessible for review.
-- Uncertainty – Lack of knowledge regarding the true value of a quantity, such as a specific characteristic (e.g. mean variance)
   of a distribution for variability, or regarding the appropriate and adequate inference options to use to structure a model

   information through research and data collection, such as through research on mechanisms, larger sample sizes or more
   representative samples.
-- Validation – Testing the system and its individual components to prove that it is capable of meeting the specified targets (i.e.
   microbial reduction targets); should take place when a new system is developed or new processes are added.




186 Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment: Application for Water Safety Management
-- Variability – Observed differences attributable to true heterogeneity or diversity in a population or exposure parameter.

   with infectivity.
-- Wastewater – Liquid waste discharged from homes, commercial premises and similar sources to individual disposal
   systems or to municipal sewer pipes, and which contains mainly human excreta and used water. When produced mainly
   by household and commercial activities, it is called domestic or municipal wastewater or domestic sewage. In this context,
   domestic sewage does not contain industrial effluents at levels that could pose threats to the functioning of the sewerage
   system, the treatment plant, public health or the environment.
