     NATIONAL SECONDARY DRINKING WATER REGULATION
     National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations are non-enforceable guidelines regarding contaminants
     that may cause cosmetic effects (such as skin or tooth discoloration) or aesthetic effects (such as taste,
     odor, or color) in drinking water. EPA recommends secondary standards to water systems but does not
     require systems to comply. However, some states may choose to adopt them as enforceable standards.
