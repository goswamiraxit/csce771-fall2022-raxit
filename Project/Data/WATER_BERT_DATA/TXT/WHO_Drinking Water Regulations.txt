A     ccess to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a com-
      ponent of effective policy for health protection.
      The importance of water, sanitation and hygiene for health and development
has been reflected in the outcomes of a series of international policy forums. This
includes, most recently, the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by
countries, in 2015, which include a target and indicator on safe drinking-water.
Further, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly declared in 2010 that safe and
clean drinking-water and sanitation is a human right, essential to the full enjoyment
of life and all other human rights. These commitments build on a long history of
support including the UN Generaly Assembly adopting the Millennium Development
Goals in 2000 and declaring the period 2005–2015 as the International Decade for
Action, “Water for Life”.
      Access to safe drinking-water is important as a health and development issue at
national, regional and local levels. In some regions, it has been shown that investments
in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, because the reductions
in adverse health effects and health-care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking
the interventions. This is true for investments ranging from major water supply
infrastructure through to water treatment in the home. Experience has also shown that
interventions in improving access to safe water favour the poor in particular, whether
in rural or urban areas, and can be an effective part of poverty alleviation strategies.
      The World Health Organization (WHO) published four editions of the Guidelines
for drinking-water quality (in 1983–1984, 1993–1997, 2004, and 2011), as successors to
the previous WHO International standards for drinking water, which were published
in 1958, 1963 and 1971. Since 1995, the Guidelines have been kept up to date through
a process of rolling revision, which leads to the regular publication of addenda that
may add to or supersede information in previous volumes, as well as expert reviews
on key issues in preparation for the revision of the Guidelines.
      Leading the process of the development of the fourth edition was the Water,
Sanitation, Hygiene and Health Unit within WHO Headquarters. The Chemical Safety
Unit and the Risk Assessment and Management Unit provided input on chemical
hazards, and the Radiation Programme provided input on radiological hazards. All six
WHO regional offices participated in the process, in consultation with Member States.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     This version of the Guidelines integrates the fourth edition, which was published
in 2011, with the first addendum to the fourth edition published in 2016. It supersedes
previous editions of the Guidelines and previous International Standards.
     The primary goal of the Guidelines is to protect public health associated with
drinking-water quality. The overall objectives of the Guidelines are to:
•   provide an authoritative basis for the effective consideration of public health in
    setting national or regional drinking-water policies and actions;
•   provide a comprehensive preventive risk management framework for health
    protection, from catchment to consumer, that covers policy formulation and
    standard setting, risk-based management approaches and surveillance;
•   emphasize achievable practices and the formulation of sound regulations that are
    applicable to low-income, middle-income and industrialized countries alike;
•   summarize the health implications associated with contaminants in drinking-
    water, and the role of risk assessment and risk management in disease prevention
    and control;
•   summarize effective options for drinking-water management; and
•   provide guidance on hazard identification and risk assessment.
    This edition of the Guidelines, incorporating the first addendum, further develops
concepts, approaches and information introduced in previous editions, including the
comprehensive preventive risk management approach for ensuring drinking-water
quality that was introduced in the third edition. This edition considers:
•   drinking-water safety, including minimum procedures and specific guideline
    values, and how these are intended to be used;
•   approaches used in deriving the Guidelines, including guideline values;
•   microbial hazards, which continue to be the primary concern in both developing
    and developed countries. Experience has shown the value of a systematic approach
    to securing microbial safety. This edition builds on the preventive principles
    introduced in the third edition on ensuring the microbial safety of drinking-
    water through a multiple-barrier approach, highlighting the importance of
    source water protection;
•   climate change, which results in changing water temperature and rainfall patterns,
    severe and prolonged drought or increased flooding, and its implications for
    water quality and water scarcity, recognizing the importance of managing these
    impacts as part of water management strategies;
•   chemical contaminants in drinking-water, including information on chemicals
    not considered previously (e.g. pesticides used for vector control in drinking-
    water); revisions of existing chemical fact sheets, taking into account new
    scientific information; and reduced coverage in the Guidelines in cases where
    new information suggests a lesser priority;
•   key chemicals responsible for large-scale health effects through drinking-water
    exposure (e.g. arsenic, fluoride, lead, nitrate, selenium and uranium), with the
    Guidelines providing guidance on identifying local priorities and on management;

•   the important roles of many different stakeholders in ensuring drinking-water
    safety; this edition furthers the discussion introduced in the third edition of
    the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders in ensuring drinking-water
    safety; and
•   guidance in situations other than traditional community supplies or managed
    utilities, such as rainwater harvesting and other non-piped supplies or dual-
    piped systems.
     The Guidelines are accompanied by a series of supporting publications. These
include internationally peer-reviewed risk assessments for specific chemicals (see list
of chapter 12 background documents in Annex 2) and other publications explaining
the scientific basis of the development of the Guidelines and providing guidance on
good practice in their implementation (see Annex 1). The publication Guidelines for
drinking-water quality Volume 3—Surveillance and control of community supplies (1997,
revision forthcoming) provides guidance on good practice in surveillance, monitoring
and assessment of drinking-water quality in community supplies.
     The Guidelines are addressed primarily to water and health regulators, policy-
makers and their advisors, to assist in the development of national policies and
regulations. The Guidelines and associated documents are also used by many
others as a source of information on water quality and health, and on effective
management approaches.
     The Guidelines are recognized as representing the position of the UN system on
issues of drinking-water quality and health by “UN-Water”, the body that coordinates
among the 24 UN agencies and programmes concerned with water issues.

1.1 General considerations and principles
Water is essential to sustain life, and a satisfactory (adequate, safe and accessible)
                                                                            accessible) sup-
                                                                                         sup-
ply must be available to all. Improving access to safe drinking-water can result in tan-
gible benefits to health. Every effort should be made to achieve drinking-water
                                                                     drinking-water that

as safe as practicable.
     Safe drinking-water, as defined by the Guidelines, does does not represent any signifi-
cant risk to health over a lifetime of
                                     of consumption, including different sensitivities that

drinking-water. Safe drinking-water is
required for all usual domestic purposes,
including drinking, food preparation and personal hygiene. The Guidelines are ap-
plicable to packaged water and ice intended for human consumption. However, water
of higher quality may be required for some special purposes, such as renal dialysis and
cleaning of contact lenses, or for certain purposes in food production and pharma-
ceutical use. The Guidelines may not be suitable for the protection of aquatic life or for
some industries.
      The Guidelines are intended to support the development and implementation
of risk management strategies that will ensure the safety of drinking-water supplies
through the control of hazardous constituents of water. These strategies may include
national or regional standards developed from the scientific basis provided in the
Guidelines. The Guidelines describe reasonable minimum requirements of safe prac-
tice to protect the health of consumers and derive numerical “guideline values” for
constituents of water or indicators of water quality. When defining mandatory limits,
it is preferable to consider the Guidelines in the context of local or national environ-
mental, social, economic and cultural conditions. The Guidelines should also be part
of an overall health protection strategy that includes sanitation and other strategies,
such as managing food contamination. This strategy would also normally be incor­
porated into a legislative and regulatory framework that adapts the Guidelines to ad-
dress local requirements and circumstances (see also section 2.6).
      The main reason for not promoting the adoption of international standards for
drinking-water quality is the advantage provided by the use of a risk–benefit approach
(qualitative or quantitative) in the establishment of national standards and regula-
tions. Further, the Guidelines are best used to promote an integrated preventive man-
agement framework for safety applied from catchment to consumer. The Guidelines
provide a scientific point of departure for national authorities to develop drinking-
water regulations and standards appropriate for the national situation. In developing
standards and regulations, care should be taken to ensure that scarce resources are
not unnecessarily diverted to the development of standards and the monitoring of
substances of relatively minor importance to public health. The approach followed in
these Guidelines is intended to lead to national standards and regulations that can be
readily implemented and enforced and are protective of public health.
      The nature and form of drinking-water standards may vary among countries and
regions. There is no single approach that is universally applicable. It is essential in the
development and implementation of standards that the current or planned legislation
relating to water, health and local government is taken into account and that the cap-
acity of regulators in the country is assessed. Approaches that may work in one country
or region will not necessarily transfer to other countries or regions. It is essential that
each country review its needs and capacities in developing a regulatory framework.

     The judgement of safety—or what is an acceptable level of risk in particular circum-
stances—is a matter in which society as a whole has a role to play. The final judgement as
to whether the benefit resulting from the adoption of any of the Guidelines or guideline
values as national or local standards justifies the cost is for each country to decide.
     Although the Guidelines describe a quality of water that is acceptable for life-
long consumption, the establishment of these Guidelines, including guideline values,
should not be regarded as implying that the quality of drinking-water may be degrad-
ed to the recommended level. Indeed, a continuous effort should be made to maintain
drinking-water quality at the highest possible level.
     An important concept in the allocation of resources to improving drinking-water
safety is that of incremental improvement towards long-term health-based targets.
Priorities set to remedy the most urgent

terms of its taste, odour and appearance;
see section 1.1.6).

1.1.1 Framework for safe drinking-water
The basic and essential requirements to ensure the safety of drinking-water are a
“framework” for safe drinking-water, comprising health-based targets established by a
competent health authority, adequate and properly managed systems (adequate infra-
structure, proper monitoring and effective planning and management) and a system
of independent surveillance.
     A holistic approach to the risk assessment and risk management of a drinking-
water supply increases confidence in the safety of the drinking-water. This approach
entails systematic assessment of risks throughout a drinking-water supply—from the
catchment and its source water through to the consumer—and identification of the
ways in which these risks
can be managed, including
                                  In Stockholm, in 1999, it was agreed that future guidelines for

impacts on drinking-water supplies. Climate change also needs to be considered in the
light of demographic change, such as the continuing growth of cities, which itself
brings significant challenges for drinking-water supply.
     In support of the framework for safe drinking-water, the Guidelines provide a
range of supporting information, including microbial aspects (chapters 7 and 11),
chemical aspects (chapters 8 and 12), radiological aspects (chapter 9) and acceptability
aspects (chapter 10). Figure 1.1 provides an overview of the interrelationships among
the individual chapters of the Guidelines in ensuring drinking-water safety.
     The Guidelines are applicable to large metropolitan and small community piped
drinking-water systems and to non-piped drinking-water systems in communities
and in individual dwellings. The Guidelines are also applicable to a range of specific
circumstances (chapter 6), including buildings, travellers and conveyances.

1.1.2 Microbial aspects
Securing the microbial safety of drinking-water supplies is based on the use of mul­
tiple barriers, from catchment to consumer, to prevent the contamination of drinking-
water or to reduce contamination to levels not injurious to health. Safety is increased
if multiple barriers are in place, including protection of water resources, proper selec-
tion and operation of a series of treatment steps and management of distribution sys-
tems (piped or otherwise) to maintain and protect treated water quality. The preferred
strategy is a management approach that places the primary emphasis on preventing
or reducing the entry of pathogens into water sources and reducing reliance on treat-
ment processes for removal of pathogens.
     In general terms, the greatest microbial risks are associated with ingestion of
water that is contaminated with faeces from humans or animals (including birds).
Faeces can be a source of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths.
     Faecally derived pathogens are the principal concerns in setting health-based
targets for microbial safety. Microbial water quality
often varies rapidly and over a wide range. Short-term        The potential health conse‑

placed solely on end-product testing, even when fre-
quent, to determine the microbial safety of drinking-
water.
     Particular attention should be directed to a water safety framework and imple-
menting comprehensive water safety plans to consistently ensure drinking-water safe-
ty and thereby protect public health (see chapter 4). Failure to ensure drinking-water
safety may expose the community to the risk of outbreaks of intestinal and other
infectious diseases. Outbreaks of waterborne disease are particularly to be avoided
because of their capacity to result in the simultaneous infection of a large number of
persons and potentially a high proportion of the community.

                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Chemical disinfection of a drinking-water supply that is faecally contaminated will
reduce the overall risk of disease but may not necessarily render the supply safe. For
example, chlorine disinfection of drinking-water has limitations against the protozoan
pathogens—in particular Cryptosporidium—and some viruses. Disinfection efficacy
may also be unsatisfactory against pathogens within flocs or particles, which protect
them from the action of disinfectants. High levels of turbidity can protect microorgan-
isms from the effects of disinfection, stimulate the growth of bacteria and give rise to a
significant chlorine demand. It is essential that an overall management strategy is im-
plemented in which multiple barriers, including source water protection and appropri-
ate treatment processes, as well as protection during storage and distribution, are used
in conjunction with disinfection to prevent or remove microbial contamination.
     The use of chemical disinfectants in water treatment usually results in the for-
mation of chemical by-products. However,
the risks to health from these by-products          Disinfection should not be compromised

tion, and it is important that disinfection
efficacy not be compromised in attempting
to control such by-products.
     Some disinfectants, such as chlorine, can be easily monitored and controlled as
a drinking-water disinfectant, and frequent monitoring is recommended wherever
chlorination is practised.
     Disinfection of drinking-water is considered in more detail in chapter 7 and
Annex 5, with fact sheets on specific disinfectants and disinfection by-products
provided in chapter 12.

1.1.4 Chemical aspects
The health concerns associated with chemical constituents of drinking-water differ
from those associated with microbial contamination and arise primarily from the
ability of chemical con-
stituents to cause ad-
verse health effects after     The great majority of evident water-related health problems are
                               the result of microbial (bacterial, viral, protozoan or other bio‑

of water that can lead
to health problems re-
sulting from a single exposure, except through massive accidental contamination of a
drinking-water supply. Moreover, experience shows that in many, but not all, such
incidents, the water becomes undrinkable owing to unacceptable taste, odour and
appearance.
      In situations where short-term exposure is not likely to lead to health impair-
ment, it is often most effective to concentrate the available resources for remedial ac-
tion on finding and eliminating the source of contamination, rather than on installing
expensive drinking-water treatment for the removal of the chemical constituent.

                                    1. INTRODUCTION


     There are many chemicals that may occur in drinking-water; however, only a few
are of immediate health concern in any given circumstance. The priority given to both
monitoring and remedial action for chemical contaminants in drinking-water should
be managed to ensure that scarce resources are not unnecessarily directed towards
those of little or no health concern (see the supporting document Chemical safety of
drinking-water; Annex 1).
     There are few chemicals for which the contribution from drinking-water to
overall intake is an important factor in preventing disease. One example is the effect
of fluoride in drinking-water in protecting against dental caries. The Guidelines do
not attempt to define minimum desirable concentrations for chemicals in drinking-
water.
     Guideline values are derived for many chemical constituents of drinking-water.
A guideline value normally represents the concentration of a constituent that does
not result in any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption. A number
of provisional guideline values have been established based on the practical level of
treatment performance or analytical achievability. In these cases, the guideline value is
higher than the calculated health-based value.
     The chemical aspects of drinking-water quality are considered in more detail in
chapter 8, with fact sheets on specific chemical contaminants provided in chapter 12.

1.1.5 Radiological aspects
The health risks associated with the presence of naturally occurring radionuclides in
drinking-water should also be taken into consideration, although the contribution of
drinking-water to total exposure to radionuclides is very small under normal circum-
stances.
     Formal guideline values are not set for individual radionuclides in drinking-
water. Rather, the approach used is based on screening drinking-water for gross alpha
and gross beta radiation activity. Although finding levels of activity above screening
values does not indicate any immediate risk to health, it should trigger further inves-
tigation to determine the radionuclides responsible and the possible risks, taking local
circumstances into account.
     The guidance levels for radionuclides recommended in these Guidelines do not
apply to drinking-water supplies contaminated during emergencies arising from ac-
cidental releases of radioactive substances to the environment.
     Radiological aspects of drinking-water quality are considered in more detail in
chapter 9.

1.1.6 Acceptability aspects: taste, odour and appearance
Water should be free of tastes and odours that would be objectionable to the majority
of consumers.
     In assessing the quality of drinking-water, consumers rely principally upon their
senses. Microbial, chemical and physical constituents of water may affect the appear-
ance, odour or taste of the water, and the consumer will evaluate the quality and ac-
ceptability of the water on the basis of these criteria. Although these constituents may
have no direct health effects, water that is highly turbid, is highly coloured or has an

                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


objectionable taste or odour may be regarded by consumers as unsafe and rejected.
In extreme cases, consumers may avoid aesthetically unacceptable but otherwise safe
drinking-water in favour of more pleasant but potentially unsafe sources. It is there-
fore wise to be aware of consumer perceptions and to take into account both health-
related guideline values and aesthetic criteria when assessing drinking-water supplies
and developing regulations and standards.

may signal changes in the quality of the raw water source or deficiencies in the treat-
ment process and should be investigated.
     Acceptability aspects of drinking-water quality are considered in more detail in
chapter 10.

1.2 Roles and responsibilities in drinking-water safety management
Preventive management is the preferred approach to ensuring drinking-water safety
and should take account of the characteristics of the drinking-water supply from
catchment and source to its
use by consumers. As many
                                      A preventive integrated management approach with
aspects of drinking-water             collaboration from all relevant agencies is the preferred
quality management are often          approach to ensuring drinking-water safety
outside the direct responsibil-
ity of the water supplier, it is
essential that a collaborative multiagency approach be adopted to ensure that agencies
with responsibility for specific areas within the water cycle are involved in the manage-
ment of water quality. One example is where catchments and source waters are beyond
the drinking-water supplier’s jurisdiction. Consultation with other authorities will
generally be necessary for other elements of drinking-water quality management, such
as monitoring and reporting requirements, emergency response plans and communi-
cation strategies.
     Major stakeholders that could affect or be affected by decisions or activities of
the drinking-water supplier should be encouraged to coordinate their planning and
management activities where appropriate. These could include, for example, health
and resource management agencies, consumers, industry and plumbers. Appropriate
mechanisms and documentation should be established for stakeholder commitment
and involvement.

1.2.1 Surveillance and quality control
In order to protect public health, a dual-role approach, differentiating the roles and
responsibilities of service providers from those of an authority responsible for in­
dependent oversight protective of public health (“drinking-water supply surveil-
lance”), has proven to be effective.
     Organizational arrangements for the maintenance and improvement of drinking-
water supply services should
therefore take into account         Drinking-water suppliers are responsible at all times for the
the vital and complementary         quality and safety of the water that they produce
roles of the agency respon-

                                               8

sible for surveillance and of the water supplier. The two functions of surveillance and
quality control are best performed by separate and independent entities because of the
conflict of interest that arises when the two are combined. In this:
•   national agencies provide a framework of targets, standards and legislation to
    enable and require suppliers to meet defined obligations;
•   agencies involved in supplying water for consumption by any means should be
    required to ensure and verify that the systems they administer are capable of
    delivering safe water and that they routinely achieve this;
•   a surveillance agency is responsible for independent (external) surveillance
    through periodic audit of all aspects of safety and/or verification testing.
     In practice, there may not always be a clear division of responsibilities between
the surveillance and drinking-water supply agencies. In some cases, the range of pro-
fessional, governmental, nongovernmental and private institutions may be wider and
more complex than that discussed above. Whatever the existing framework, it is im-
portant that clear strategies and structures be developed for implementing water safety
plans, quality control and surveillance, collating and summarizing data, reporting and
disseminating the findings and taking remedial action. Clear lines of accountability
and communication are essential.
     Surveillance is an investigative activity undertaken to identify and evaluate
potential health risks associated with drinking-
water. Surveillance contributes to the protection of        Surveillance of drinking-water
public health by promoting improvement of the               quality can be defined as “the
quality, quantity, accessibility, coverage (i.e. popu-      continuous and vigilant public
lations with reliable access), affordability and            health assessment and review
                                                            of the safety and acceptabil‑
continuity of drinking-water supplies (termed               ity of drinking-water supplies”
“service indicators”). The surveillance authority           (WHO, 1976).
must have the authority to determine whether a
water supplier is fulfilling its obligations.
     In most countries, the agency responsible for the surveillance of drinking-water
supply services is the ministry of health (or public health) and its regional or depart-
mental offices. In some countries, it may be an environmental protection agency; in
others, the environmental health departments of local government may have some
responsibility.
     Surveillance requires a systematic programme of surveys, which may include
auditing, analysis, sanitary inspection and institutional and community aspects. It
should cover the whole of the drinking-water system, including sources and activities
in the catchment, transmission infrastructure, treatment plants, storage reservoirs and
distribution systems (whether piped or unpiped).
     Ensuring timely action to prevent problems and ensure the correction of faults
should be one aim of a surveillance programme. There may at times be a need for
penalties to encourage and ensure compliance. The surveillance agency must therefore
be supported by strong and enforceable legislation. However, it is important that the
agency develops a positive and supportive relationship with suppliers, with the appli-
cation of penalties used as a last resort.

                                            9
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     The surveillance agency should be empowered by law to compel water suppliers
to recommend the boiling of water or other measures when microbial contamination
that could threaten public health is detected.

1.2.2 Public health authorities
In order to effectively support the protection of public health, a national entity with
responsibility for public health will normally act in four areas:
1)   surveillance of health status and trends, including outbreak detection and investi-
     gation, generally directly but in some instances through a decentralized body;
2)   directly establishing drinking-water norms and standards. National public health
     authorities often have the primary responsibility for setting norms on drinking-
     water supply, which may include the setting of water quality targets, performance
     and safety targets and directly specified requirements (e.g. treatment). Normative
     activity is not restricted to water quality but also includes, for example, regulation
     and approval of materials and chemicals used in the production and distribu-
     tion of drinking-water (see section 8.5.4) and establishing minimum standards
     in areas such as domestic plumbing (see section 1.2.10). Nor is it a static activity,
     because as changes occur in drinking-water supply practice, in technologies and
     in materials available (e.g. in plumbing materials and treatment processes), so
     health priorities and responses to them will also change;
3)   representing health concerns in wider policy development, especially health policy
     and integrated water resource management (see section 1.2.4). Health concerns
     will often suggest a supportive role towards resource allocation to those concerned
     with drinking-water supply extension and improvement, will often involve lob-
     bying for the primary requirement to satisfy drinking-water needs above other
     priorities and may imply involvement in conflict resolution;
4)   direct action, generally through subsidiary bodies (e.g. regional and local environ-
     mental health administrations) or by providing guidance to other local entities
     (e.g. local government) in surveillance of drinking-water supplies. These roles
     vary widely according to national and local structures and responsibilities and
     frequently include a supportive role to community suppliers, where local authori-
     ties often intervene directly.
     Public health surveillance (i.e. surveillance of health status and trends) contrib-
utes to verifying drinking-water safety. It takes into consideration disease in the entire
population, which may be exposed to pathogenic microorganisms from a range of
sources, not only drinking-water. National public health authorities may also under-
take or direct research to evaluate the role of water as a risk factor in disease, through
case–control, cohort or intervention studies, for example. Public health surveillance
teams typically operate at national, regional and local levels, as well as in cities and
rural health centres. Routine surveillance includes:
•    ongoing monitoring of reportable diseases, many of which can be caused by
     waterborne pathogens;
•    outbreak detection;


                                            10
                                    1. INTRODUCTION


•   long-term trend analysis;
•   geographic and demographic analysis;
•   feedback to water authorities.
    Public health surveillance can be enhanced in a variety of ways to identify possible
waterborne outbreaks in response to suspicion about unusual disease incidence or fol-
lowing deterioration of water quality. Epidemiological investigations include:
•   outbreak investigations;
•   intervention studies to evaluate intervention options;
•   case–control or cohort studies to evaluate the role of water as a risk factor in
    disease.
     However, public health surveillance cannot be relied upon to provide informa-
tion in a timely manner to enable short-term operational response to control water-
borne disease. Limitations include:
•   outbreaks of non-reportable disease;
•   time delay between exposure and illness;
•   time delay between illness and reporting;
•   low level of reporting;
•   difficulties in identifying causative pathogens and sources.
     The public health authority operates reactively, as well as proactively, against the
background of overall public health policy and in interaction with all stakeholders. In
accounting for public health context, priority will normally be afforded to disadvan-
taged groups. This will generally entail balancing drinking-water safety management
and improvement with the need to ensure access to reliable supplies of safe drinking-
water in adequate quantities.
     In order to develop an understanding of the national drinking-water situation,
the national public health authority should periodically produce reports outlining the
state of national water quality and highlighting public health concerns and priorities
in the context of overall public health priorities. This implies the need for effective
exchange of information between local, regional and national agencies.
     National health authorities should lead or participate in the formulation and im-
plementation of policy to ensure access to some form of reliable, safe drinking-water
supply. Where this has not been achieved, appropriate tools and education should be
made available to implement individual or household-level treatment and safe storage.

1.2.3 Local authorities
Local environmental health authorities often play an important role in managing
water resources and drinking-water supplies. This may include catchment inspection
and authorization of activities in the catchment that may have an impact on source
water quality. It can also include verifying and auditing (surveillance) of the manage-
ment of formal drinking-water systems. Local environmental health authorities will
also give specific guidance to communities or individuals in designing and imple-
menting community and household drinking-water systems and correcting deficien-
cies, and they may also be responsible for surveillance of community and household

                                           11
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


drinking-water supplies. They have an important role to play in educating consumers
where household water treatment is necessary.
     Management of household and small community drinking-water supplies gener-
ally requires education programmes about drinking-water supply and water quality.
Such programmes should normally include:
•   water hygiene awareness raising;
•   basic technical training and technology transfer in drinking-water supply and
    management;
•   consideration of and approaches to overcoming sociocultural barriers to
    acceptance of water quality interventions;
•   motivation, mobilization and social marketing activities;
•   a system of continued support, follow-up and dissemination of the water quality
    programme to achieve and maintain sustainability.
These programmes can be administered at the community level by local health au-
thorities or other entities, such as nongovernmental organizations and the private
sector. If the programme arises from other entities, the involvement of the local health
authority in the development and implementation of the water quality education and
training programme is strongly encouraged.
     Approaches to participatory hygiene and sanitation education and training pro-
grammes are described in other WHO documents (see Simpson-Hébert, Sawyer &
Clarke, 1996; Sawyer, Simpson-Hébert & Wood, 1998; Brikké, 2000).

1.2.4 Water resource management
Water resource management is an integral aspect of the preventive management
of drinking-water quality. Prevention of microbial and chemical contamination of
source water is the first barrier against drinking-water contamination of public health
concern.
      Water resource management and potentially polluting human activity in the
catchment will influence water quality downstream and in aquifers. This will have
an impact on the treatment steps required to ensure safe water, and preventive action
may be preferable to upgrading treatment.
      The influence of land use on water quality should be assessed as part of water
resource management. This assessment is not normally undertaken by health author­
ities or drinking-water supply agencies alone and should take into consideration:
•   land cover modification;
•   extraction activities;
•   construction/modification of waterways;
•   application of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and other chemicals;
•   livestock density and application of manure;
•   road construction, maintenance and use;
•   various forms of recreation;
•   urban or rural residential development, with particular attention to excreta
    disposal, sanitation, landfill and waste disposal;


                                          12
                                    1. INTRODUCTION


•   other potentially polluting human activities, such as industry, mining and military
    sites.
     Water resource management may be the responsibility of catchment manage-
ment agencies and/or other entities controlling or affecting water resources, such as
industrial, agricultural, navigation and flood control entities.
     The extent to which the responsibilities of health or drinking-water supply agen-
cies include water resource management varies greatly between countries and com-
munities. Regardless of government structures and sector responsibilities, it is im-
portant that health authorities liaise and collaborate with sectors managing the water
resource and regulating land use in the catchment.
     Establishing close collaboration between the public health authority, water
supplier and resource management agency assists recognition of the health hazards
potentially occurring in the system. It is also important for ensuring that the protec-
tion of drinking-water resources is considered in decisions for land use or regulations
to control contamination of water resources. Depending on the setting, this may
include involvement of further sectors, such as agriculture, traffic, tourism or urban
development.
     To ensure the adequate protection of drinking-water sources, national authorities
will normally interact with other sectors in formulating national policy for integrat-
ed water resource management. Regional and local structures for implementing the
policy will be set up, and national authorities will guide regional and local authorities
by providing tools.
     Regional environmental or public health authorities have an important task in
participating in the preparation of integrated water resource management plans to
ensure the best available drinking-water source quality. For further information, see
the supporting document Protecting groundwater for health and Protecting surface
water for health (see Annex 1).

1.2.5 Drinking-water supply agencies
Drinking-water supplies vary from very large urban systems servicing large popula-
tions with tens of millions of people to small community systems providing water to
very small populations. In most countries, they include community sources as well as
piped means of supply.
     Drinking-water supply agencies are responsible for quality assurance and quality
control (see section 1.2.1). Their key responsibilities are to prepare and implement
water safety plans (for more information, see chapter 4).
     In many cases, the water supplier is not responsible for the management of the
catchment feeding the sources of its supplies. The roles of the water supplier with
respect to catchments are to participate in interagency water resource management
activities, to understand the risks arising from potentially contaminating activities and
incidents and to use this information in assessing risks to the drinking-water sup-
ply and developing and applying appropriate management. Although drinking-water
suppliers may not undertake catchment surveys and pollution risk assessment alone,
their role is to recognize the need for them and to initiate multiagency collaboration—
for example, with health and environmental authorities.

                                           13
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Experience has shown that an association of stakeholders in drinking-water sup-
ply (e.g. operators, managers and specialist groups such as small suppliers, scientists,
sociologists, legislators and politicians) can provide a valuable non-threatening forum
for the interchange of ideas.
     For further information, see the supporting document Water safety plans (see
Annex 1).

1.2.6 Community management
Community-managed drinking-water systems, with both piped and non-piped distri-
bution, are common worldwide in both developed and developing countries. The pre-
cise definition of a community drinking-water system will vary. Although a definition
based on population size or the type of supply may be appropriate under many condi-
tions, approaches to administration and management provide a distinction between
the drinking-water systems of small communities and those of larger towns and cities.
This includes the increased reliance on often untrained and sometimes unpaid com-
munity members in the administration and operation of community drinking-water
systems. Drinking-water systems in periurban areas—the communities surrounding
major towns and cities—in developing countries may also have the characteristics of
community systems.
     Effective and sustainable programmes for the management of community drink-
ing-water quality require the active support and involvement of local communities.
These communities should be involved at all stages of such programmes, including
initial surveys; decisions on siting of wells, siting of intakes or establishing protec-
tion zones; monitoring and surveillance of drinking-water supplies; reporting faults,
carrying out maintenance and taking remedial action; and supportive actions, includ-
ing sanitation and hygiene practices.
     A community may already be highly organized and taking action on health or
drinking-water supply issues. Alternatively, it may lack a well-developed drinking-
water system; some sectors of the community, such as women, may be poorly repre­
sented; and there may be disagreements or factional conflicts. In these situations,
achieving community participation will take more time and effort to bring people
together, resolve differences, agree on common aims and take action. Visits, possibly
over several years, will often be needed to provide support and encouragement and to
ensure that the structures created for safe drinking-water supply continue to operate.
This may involve setting up hygiene and health educational programmes to ensure
that the community:
•   is aware of the importance of drinking-water quality and its relationship with
    health and of the need for safe drinking-water in sufficient quantities for domestic
    use for drinking, cooking and hygiene;
•   recognizes the importance of surveillance and the need for a community
    response;
•   understands and is prepared to play its role in the surveillance process;
•   has the necessary skills to perform that role;
•   is aware of requirements for the protection of drinking-water supplies from
    pollution.

     For further information, see the 1997 volume entitled Surveillance and control
of community supplies (WHO, 1997); the supporting document Water safety plans
(Annex 1); Simpson-Hébert, Sawyer & Clarke (1996); Sawyer, Simpson-Hébert &
Wood (1998); and Brikké (2000).

1.2.7 Water vendors
Vendors selling water to households or at collection points are common in many parts
of the world where scarcity of water or faults in or lack of infrastructure limits access
to suitable quantities of drinking-water. Water vendors use a range of modes of trans-
port to carry drinking-water for sale directly to the consumer, including tanker trucks
and wheelbarrows or trolleys. In the context of these Guidelines, water vending does
not include bottled or packaged water (which is considered in section 6.14) or water
sold through vending machines.
     There are a number of health concerns associated with water supplied to consum-
ers by water vendors. These include access to adequate volumes and concern regarding
inadequate treatment or transport in inappropriate containers, which can result in
contamination.
     More detailed information on treatment of vended water, undertaking a risk as-
sessment of vended water supplies, operational monitoring of control measures, man-
agement plans and independent surveillance is included in section 6.3.

1.2.8 Individual consumers
Everyone consumes water from one source or another, and consumers often play
important roles in the collection, treatment and storage of water. Consumer actions
may help to ensure the safety of the water they consume and may also contribute to
improvement or contamination of the water consumed by others. Consumers have
the responsibility for ensuring that their actions do not have an adverse impact on
water quality. Installation and maintenance of household plumbing systems should
be undertaken preferably by qualified and authorized plumbers (see section 1.2.10) or
other persons with appropriate expertise to ensure that cross-connections or backflow
events do not result in contamination of local water supplies.
     In most countries, there are populations whose water is derived from household
sources, such as private wells and rainwater. In households using non-piped water sup-
plies, appropriate efforts are needed to ensure safe collection, storage and perhaps treat-
ment of their drinking-water. In some circumstances, households and individuals may
wish to treat water in the home to increase their confidence in its safety. This would
be relevant where community supplies are absent or where community supplies are
known to be contaminated or causing waterborne disease (see chapter 7). Public health
surveillance or other local authorities may provide guidance to support households
and individual consumers in ensuring the safety of their drinking-water. Such guidance
is best provided in the context of a community education and training programme.

1.2.9 Certification agencies
Certification is used to verify that devices and materials used in the drinking-water
supply meet a given level of quality and safety. Certification is a process in which

                                            15
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


an independent organization validates the claims of the manufacturers against a
formal standard or criterion or provides an independent assessment of possible
risks of contamination from a material or process. The certification agency may
be responsible for seeking data from manufacturers, generating test results, con-
ducting inspections and audits and possibly making recommendations on product
performance.
     Certification has been applied to technologies used at household and community
levels, such as hand pumps; materials used by water supplies, such as treatment chem­
icals; and devices used in the household for collection, treatment and storage.
     Certification of products or processes involved in the collection, treatment,
storage and distribution of water can be overseen by government agencies or private
organizations. Certification procedures will depend on the standards against which
the products are certified, certification criteria and the party that performs the
certification.
     Certification can also be applied to the implementation of water safety plans.
This can take the form of an independent organization or party undertaking audits
to verify that plans have been properly designed, are being implemented correctly and
are effective.
     National, local government or private (third-party auditing) certification pro-
grammes have a number of possible objectives:
•   certification of products to ensure that their use does not threaten the safety of
    the user or the general public, such as by causing contamination of drinking-
    water with toxic substances, substances that could affect consumer acceptability
    or substances that support the growth of microorganisms;
•   product testing, to avoid retesting at local levels or prior to each procurement;
•   ensuring uniform quality and condition of products;
•   certification and accreditation of analytical and other testing laboratories;
•   control of materials and chemicals used for the treatment of drinking-water,
    including the performance of devices for household use;
•   ensuring that water safety plans are effective.
     An important step in any certification procedure is the establishment of stan­
dards, which must form the basis of assessment of the products. These standards
should also—as far as possible—contain the criteria for approval. In procedures for
certification on technical aspects, these standards are generally developed in cooper­
ation with the manufacturers, the certifying agency and the consumers. The national
public health authorities should have responsibility for developing the parts of the
approval process or criteria relating directly to public health. For further information
on the control of materials and chemicals used for the treatment of drinking-water,
see section 8.5.4.

1.2.10 Plumbing
Significant adverse health effects have been associated with inadequate plumbing sys-
tems within public and private buildings arising from poor design, incorrect installa-
tion, alterations and inadequate maintenance.

                                          16
                                    1. INTRODUCTION


     Numerous factors influence the quality of water within a building’s piped distri-
bution system and may result in microbial or chemical contamination of drinking-
water. Outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease can occur through faecal contamination
of drinking-water within buildings arising from deficiencies in roof storage tanks
and cross-connections with wastewater pipes, for example. Poorly designed plumb-
ing systems can cause stagnation of water and provide a suitable environment for the
proliferation of Legionella. Plumbing materials, pipes, fittings and coatings can result
in elevated heavy metal (e.g. lead) concentrations in drinking-water, and inappropri-
ate materials can be conducive to bacterial growth. Potential adverse health effects
may not be confined to the individual building. Exposure of other consumers to con-
taminants is possible through contamination of the local public distribution system,
beyond the particular building, through cross-contamination of drinking-water and
backflow.
     The delivery of water that complies with relevant standards within buildings gen-
erally relies on a plumbing system that is not directly managed by the water supplier.
Reliance is therefore placed on proper installation of plumbing and, for larger build-
ings, on building-specific water safety plans (see section 6.9).
     To ensure the safety of drinking-water supplies within the building system,
plumbing practices must prevent the introduction of hazards to health. This can be
achieved by ensuring that:
•   pipes carrying either water or wastes are watertight, durable, of smooth and
    unobstructed interior and protected against anticipated stresses;
•   cross-connections between the drinking-water supply and the wastewater removal
    systems do not occur;
•   roof storage systems are intact and not subject to intrusion of microbial or
    chemical contaminants;
•   hot and cold water systems are designed to minimize the proliferation of Legionella
    (see also sections 6.10 and 11.1);
•   appropriate protection is in place to prevent backflow;
•   the system design of multistorey buildings minimizes pressure fluctuations;
•   waste is discharged without contaminating drinking-water;
•   plumbing systems function efficiently.
     It is important that plumbers are appropriately qualified, have the competence
to undertake necessary servicing of plumbing systems to ensure compliance with
local regulations and use only materials approved as safe for use with drinking-
water.
     Design of the plumbing systems of new buildings should normally be approved
prior to construction and be inspected by an appropriate regulatory body during con-
struction and prior to commissioning of the buildings.
     For more information on the essential roles of proper drinking-water system and
waste system plumbing in public health, see the supporting document Health aspects
of plumbing (Annex 1).

1.3.1 Published documents
These Guidelines are accompanied by separate texts that provide background infor-
mation substantiating the derivation of the Guidelines and providing guidance on
good practice towards their effective implementation. These are available as published

1.3.2 Capacity-building networks
To promote the rapid dissemination of information, improve knowledge exchange,
translate evidence and advice into public health policy and practice and facilitate
implementation of these Guidelines, a number of international networks have been
established. These international networks bring together drinking-water quality spe-
cialists, drinking-water supply managers, health regulators, community managers and
other stakeholders. The focus areas for these networks are water safety planning for
larger systems, including effective operations and maintenance, safe management of
small community water supplies, household water treatment and safe storage and
optimizing drinking-water regulations to protect public health.

1) health-based targets based on an evaluation of health risks (section 2.1 and
   chapter 3);
2) water safety plans (WSPs), comprising (section 2.2 and chapter 4):
   • a system assessment to determine whether the drinking-water supply (from
       source through treatment to the point of consumption) as a whole can deliver
       water of a quality that meets the health-based targets (section 4.1);
   • operational monitoring of the control measures in the drinking-water supply that
       are of particular importance in securing drinking-water safety (section 4.2);
   • management plans documenting the system assessment and monitoring
       plans and describing actions to be taken in normal operation and incident
       conditions, including upgrade and improvement, documentation and
       communication (sections 4.4–4.6);
3) a system of independent surveillance that verifies that the above are operating
   properly (section 2.3 and chapter 5).
Verification to determine whether the performance of the drinking-water supply is in
compliance with the health-based targets and whether the WSP itself is effective may
be undertaken by the supplier, surveillance agencies or a combination of the two (see
section 4.3).

2.1 Health-based targets
Health-based targets are an essential component of the drinking-water safety frame-
work. They should be established by a high-level authority responsible for health in
consultation with others, including water suppliers and affected communities. They
should take account of the overall public health situation and contribution of drink-
ing-water quality to disease due to waterborne microbes and chemicals, as a part of
overall water and health policy. They must also take account of the importance of
ensuring access to water for all consumers.
     Health-based targets provide the basis for the application of the Guidelines to all
types of drinking-water suppliers. Some constituents of drinking-water may cause ad-
verse health effects from single exposures (e.g. pathogenic microorganisms) or long-
term exposures (e.g. many chemicals). Because of the range of constituents in water,
their mode of action and the nature of fluctuations in their concentrations, there are
four principal types of health-based targets used as a basis for identifying safety re-
quirements:
1)   Health outcome targets: Where waterborne disease contributes to a measurable and
     significant burden, reducing exposure through drinking-water has the potential
     to appreciably reduce the risks and incidence of disease. In such circumstances, it
     is possible to establish a health-based target in terms of a quantifiable reduction
     in the overall level of disease. This is most applicable where adverse effects fol-
     low shortly after exposure, where such effects are readily and reliably monitored
     and where changes in exposure can also be readily and reliably monitored. This
     type of health outcome target is primarily applicable to some microbial hazards
     in developing countries and chemical hazards with clearly defined health effects


                                           20
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


     largely attributable to water (e.g. fluoride, nitrate/nitrite and arsenic). In other
     circumstances, health outcome targets may be the basis for evaluation of results
     through quantitative risk assessment models. In these cases, health outcomes
     are estimated based on information concerning high-dose exposure and dose–
     response relationships. The results may be employed directly as a basis for the
     specification of water quality targets or provide the basis for development of the
     other types of health-based targets. Health outcome targets based on information
     on the impact of tested interventions on the health of real populations are ideal,
     but rarely available. More common are health outcome targets based on defined
     levels of tolerable risk, either absolute or fractions of total disease burden, usually
     based on toxicological studies in experimental animals and occasionally based on
     epidemiological evidence.
2)   Water quality targets: Water quality targets are established for individual drink-
     ing-water constituents that represent a health risk from long-term exposure and
     where fluctuations in concentration are small. They are typically expressed as
     guideline values (concentrations) of the substances or chemicals of concern.
3)   Performance targets: Performance targets are employed for constituents where
     short-term exposure represents a public health risk or where large fluctuations
     in numbers or concentration can occur over short periods with significant health
     implications. These are typically technology based and expressed in terms of re-
     quired reductions of the substance of concern or effectiveness in preventing con-
     tamination.
4)   Specified technology targets: National regulatory agencies may establish other
     recommendations for specific actions for smaller municipal, community and
     household drinking-water supplies. Such targets may identify specific permissible
     devices or processes for given situations and/or for generic drinking-water system
     types.
     It is important that health-based targets are realistic under local operating condi-
tions and are set to protect and improve public health. Health-based targets underpin
the development of WSPs, provide information with which to evaluate the adequacy
of existing installations and assist in identifying the level and type of inspection and
analytical verifications that are appropriate.
     Most countries apply several types of targets for different types of supplies and
different contaminants. In order to ensure that they are relevant and supportive,
representative scenarios should be developed, including description of assumptions,
management options, control measures and indicator systems for performance
tracking and verification, where appropriate. These should be supported by general
guidance addressing the identification of national, regional or local priorities and
progressive implementation, thereby helping to ensure that best use is made of lim-
ited resources.
     Health-based targets are considered in more detail in chapter 3.
     For guidance on how to prioritize constituents based on greatest risk to public
health, the reader should refer to section 2.5 and the supporting document Chemical
safety of drinking-water (Annex 1).

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


2.2 Water safety plans
Overall control of the microbial and chemical quality of drinking-water requires the
development of management plans that, when implemented, provide the basis for
system protection and process control to ensure that numbers of pathogens and con-
centrations of chemicals present a negligible risk to public health and that water is
acceptable to consumers. The management plans developed by water suppliers are
WSPs. A WSP comprises system assessment and design, operational monitoring and
management plans, including documentation and communication. The elements
of a WSP build on the multiple-barrier principle, the principles of hazard analysis
and critical control points and other systematic management approaches. The plans
should address all aspects of the drinking-water supply and focus on the control of
abstraction, treatment and delivery of drinking-water.
     Many drinking-water supplies provide adequate safe drinking-water in the ab-
sence of formalized WSPs. Major benefits of developing and implementing a WSP
for these supplies include the systematic and detailed assessment and prioritization
of hazards, the operational monitoring of barriers or control measures and improved
documentation. In addition, a WSP provides for an organized and structured system
to minimize the chance of failure through oversight or lapse of management and for
contingency plans to respond to system failures or unforeseen events that may have
an impact on water quality, such as increasing severe droughts, heavy rainfall or flood
events.

2.2.1 System assessment and design
Assessment of the drinking-water system is applicable, with suitable modifications,
to large utilities with piped distribution systems, piped and non-piped community
supplies, including hand pumps, and individual domestic supplies, including rain-
water. The complexity of a WSP varies with the circumstances. Assessment can be of
existing infrastructure or of plans for new supplies or for upgrading existing supplies.
As drinking-water quality varies throughout the system, the assessment should aim to
determine whether the final quality of water delivered to the consumer will routine-
ly meet established health-based targets. Understanding source quality and changes
throughout the system requires expert input. The assessment of systems should be
reviewed periodically.
     The system assessment needs to take into consideration the behaviour of selected
constituents or groups of constituents that may influence water quality. After actual
and potential hazards, including events and scenarios that may affect water quality,
have been identified and documented, the level of risk for each hazard can be esti-
mated and ranked, based on the likelihood and severity of the consequences.
     Validation is an element of system assessment. It is undertaken to ensure that
the information supporting the plan is correct and is concerned with the assessment
of the scientific and technical inputs into the WSP. Evidence to support the WSP can
come from a wide variety of sources, including scientific literature, regulation and
legislation departments, historical data, professional bodies and supplier knowledge.
     The WSP is the management tool that should be used to assist in actually meeting
the health-based targets, and it should be developed following the steps outlined in

                                          22
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


chapter 4. If the system is unlikely to be capable of meeting the health-based targets, a
programme of upgrading (which may include capital investment or training) should
be initiated to ensure that the drinking-water supply would meet the targets. The WSP
is an important tool in identifying deficiencies and where improvements are most
needed. In the interim, the WSP should be used to assist in making every effort to sup-
ply water of the highest achievable quality. Where a significant risk to public health ex-
ists, additional measures may be appropriate, including notification, information on
compensatory options (e.g. boiling or disinfection at the point of use) and availability
of alternative and emergency supplies when necessary.
      System assessment and design are considered in more detail in section 4.1 (see
also the supporting document Upgrading water treatment plants; Annex 1).

2.2.2 Operational monitoring
Operational monitoring is the conduct of planned observations or measurements
to assess whether the control measures in a drinking-water system are operating
properly. It is possible to set limits for control measures, monitor those limits and
take corrective action in response to a detected deviation before the water becomes
unsafe. Operational monitoring would include actions, for example, to rapidly and
regularly assess whether the structure around a hand pump is complete and undam-
aged, the turbidity of water following filtration is below a certain value or the chlorine
residual after disinfection plants or at the far point of the distribution system is above
an agreed value.
      Operational monitoring is usually carried out through simple observations and
tests, in order to rapidly confirm that control measures are continuing to work. Con-
trol measures are actions implemented in the drinking-water system that prevent,
reduce or eliminate contamination and are identified in system assessment. They in-
clude, for example, management actions related to the catchment, the immediate area
around a well, filters and disinfection infrastructure and piped distribution systems. If
collectively operating properly, they would ensure that health-based targets are met.
      The frequency of operational monitoring varies with the nature of the control
measure—for example, checking structural integrity monthly to yearly, monitoring
turbidity online or very frequently and monitoring disinfectant residual at multiple
points daily or continuously online. If monitoring shows that a limit does not meet
specifications, then there is the potential for water to be, or to become, unsafe. The
objective is timely monitoring of control measures, with a logically based sampling
plan, to prevent the delivery of potentially unsafe water.
      Operational monitoring includes observing or testing parameters such as tur-
bidity, chlorine residual or structural integrity. More complex or costly microbial or
chemical tests are generally applied as part of validation and verification activities
(discussed in sections 4.1.7 and 4.3, respectively) rather than as part of operational
monitoring.
      In order not only to have confidence that the chain of supply is operating prop-
erly, but to confirm that safe water quality is being achieved and maintained, it is
necessary to carry out verification, as outlined in section 4.3.

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     The use of indicator organisms (see section 11.6) in the monitoring of water
quality is discussed in the supporting document Assessing microbial safety of drink-
ing water (see Annex 1), and operational monitoring is considered in more detail in
section 4.2.

2.2.3 Management plans, documentation and communication
A management plan documents system assessment and operational monitoring and
verification plans and describes actions in both normal operation and during “inci-
dents” where a loss of control of the system may occur. The management plan should
also outline procedures and other supporting programmes required to ensure optimal
operation of the drinking-water system.
     As the management of some aspects of the drinking-water system often falls out-
side the responsibility of a single agency, it is essential that the roles, accountabilities
and responsibilities of the various agencies involved be defined in order to coordinate
their planning and management. Appropriate mechanisms and documentation should
therefore be established for ensuring stakeholder involvement and commitment. This
may include establishing working groups, committees or task forces, with appropri-
ate representatives, and developing partnership agreements, including, for example,
signed memoranda of understanding (see also section 1.2).
     Documentation of all aspects of drinking-water quality management is essential.
Documents should describe activities that are undertaken and how procedures are
performed. They should also include detailed information on:
•   assessment of the drinking-water system (including flow diagrams and potential
    hazards);
•   control measures and operational monitoring and verification plans and per-
    formance consistency;
•   routine operation and management procedures;
•   incident and emergency response plans;
•   supporting measures, including:
    —— training programmes;
    —— research and development;
    —— procedures for evaluating results and reporting;
    —— performance evaluations, audits and reviews;
    —— communication protocols;
•   community consultation.
     Documentation and record systems should be kept as simple and focused as pos-
sible. The level of detail in the documentation of procedures should be sufficient to
provide assurance of operational control when coupled with suitably qualified and
competent operators.
     Mechanisms should be established to periodically review and, where necessary,
revise documents to reflect changing circumstances. Documents should be assembled
in a manner that will enable any necessary modifications to be made easily. A docu-
ment control system should be developed to ensure that current versions are in use
and obsolete documents are discarded.

                                            24
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


     Appropriate documentation and reporting of incidents or emergencies should
also be established. The organization should learn as much as possible from an inci-
dent to improve preparedness and planning for future events. Review of an incident
may indicate necessary amendments to existing protocols.
     Effective communication to increase community awareness and knowledge of
drinking-water quality issues and the various areas of responsibility helps consumers
to understand and contribute to decisions about the service provided by a drinking-
water supplier or land use constraints imposed in catchment areas. It can encourage
the willingness of consumers to generate funds to finance needed improvements. A
thorough understanding of the diversity of views held by individuals or groups in the
community is necessary to satisfy community expectations.
     Management, documentation and communication are considered in more detail
in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.

2.3 Surveillance
Surveillance agencies are responsible for an independent (external) and periodic re-
view of all aspects of quality and public health safety and should have the power to
investigate and to compel action to respond to and rectify incidents of contamination-
caused outbreaks of waterborne disease or other threats to public health. The
act of surveillance includes identifying potential drinking-water contamination and
waterborne illness events and, more proactively, assessing compliance with WSPs and
promoting improvement of the quality, quantity, accessibility, coverage, affordability
and continuity of drinking-water supplies.
     Surveillance of drinking-water requires a systematic programme of data collec-
tion and surveys that may include auditing of WSPs, analysis, sanitary inspection and
institutional and community aspects. It should cover the whole of the drinking-water
system, including sources and activities in the catchment, transmission infrastructure,
whether piped or unpiped, treatment plants, storage reservoirs and distribution sys-
tems.
     As incremental improvement and prioritizing action in systems presenting great-
est overall risk to public health are important, there are advantages to adopting a grad-
ing scheme for the relative safety of drinking-water supplies (see chapter 4). More
sophisticated grading schemes may be of particular use in community supplies where
the frequency of testing is low and exclusive reliance on analytical results is particular-
ly inappropriate. Such schemes will typically take account of both analytical findings
and sanitary inspection through approaches such as those presented in section 4.1.2.
     The role of surveillance is discussed in section 1.2.1 and chapter 5.

2.4 Verification of drinking-water quality
Drinking-water safety is secured by application of a WSP, which includes monitoring
the efficiency of control measures using appropriately selected determinants. In addi-
tion to this operational monitoring, a final verification of quality is required.
     Verification is the use of methods, procedures or tests in addition to those used in
operational monitoring to determine whether the performance of the drinking-water


                                            25
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


supply is in compliance with the stated objectives outlined by the health-based targets
and whether the WSP needs modification or revalidation.
    Verification of drinking-water may be undertaken by the supplier, surveillance
agencies or a combination of the two (see section 4.3). Although verification is most
commonly carried out by the surveillance agency, a utility-led verification programme
can provide an additional level of confidence, supplementing regulations that specify
monitoring parameters and frequencies.

2.4.1 Microbial water quality
For microbial water quality, verification is likely to be based on the analysis of faecal
indicator microorganisms, with the organism of choice being Escherichia coli or, al-
ternatively, thermotolerant coliforms (see sections 4.3.1, 7.4 and 11.6). Monitoring
of specific pathogens may be included on very limited occasions to verify that an
outbreak was waterborne or that a WSP has been effective. Escherichia coli provides
conclusive evidence of recent faecal pollution and should not be present in drinking-
water. Under certain circumstances, additional indicators, such as bacteriophages or
bacterial spores, may be used.
     However, water quality can vary rapidly, and all systems are at risk of occasional
failure. For example, rainfall can greatly increase the levels of microbial contamination
in source waters, and waterborne outbreaks often occur following rainfall. Results of
analytical testing must be interpreted taking this into account.

2.4.2 Chemical water quality
Assessment of the adequacy of the chemical quality of drinking-water relies on com-
parison of the results of water quality analysis with guideline values. These Guidelines
provide guideline values for many more chemical contaminants than will actually af-
fect any particular water supply, so judicious choices for monitoring and surveillance
should be made prior to initiating an analytical chemical assessment.
     For additives (i.e. chemicals deriving primarily from materials and chemicals used
in the production and distribution of drinking-water), emphasis is placed on the dir-
ect control of the quality of these commercial products. In controlling drinking-water
additives, testing procedures typically assess whether the product meets the specifica-
tions (see section 8.5.4).
     As indicated in chapter 1, most chemicals are of concern only following long-
term exposure; however, some hazardous chemicals that occur in drinking-water are
of concern because of effects arising from sequences of exposures over a short period.
Where the concentration of the chemical of interest (e.g. nitrate/nitrite, which is as-
sociated with methaemoglobinaemia in bottle-fed infants) varies widely, even a series
of analytical results may fail to fully identify and describe the public health risk. In
controlling such hazards, attention must be given to both knowledge of causal factors
such as fertilizer use in agriculture and trends in detected concentrations, as these
will indicate whether a significant problem may arise in the future. Other hazards
may arise intermittently, often associated with seasonal activity or seasonal conditions.
One example is the occurrence of blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in surface water.


                                           26
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


     A guideline value represents the concentration of a constituent that does not
exceed tolerable risk to the health of the consumer over a lifetime of consumption.
Guideline values for some chemical contaminants (e.g. lead, nitrate) are set to be pro-
tective for susceptible subpopulations. These guideline values are also protective of the
general population over a lifetime.
     It is important that recommended guideline values are scientifically justified,
practical and feasible to implement as well as protective of public health. Guideline
values are not normally set at concentrations lower than the detection limits achiev-
able under routine laboratory operating conditions. Moreover, some guideline values
are established taking into account available techniques for controlling, removing or
reducing the concentration of the contaminant to the desired level. In some instances,
therefore, provisional guideline values have been set for contaminants for which cal-
culated health-based values are not practically achievable.

2.5 Identifying priority concerns
These Guidelines cover a large number of potential constituents in drinking-water in
order to meet the varied needs of countries worldwide. Generally, however, only a
few constituents will be of public health concern under any given circumstances. It is
essential that the national regulatory agency and local water authorities identify and
respond to the constituents of relevance to the local circumstances. This will ensure
that efforts and investments can be directed to those constituents that have the great-
est risk or public health significance.
      Health-based targets are established for potentially hazardous water constituents
and provide a basis for assessing drinking-water quality. Different parameters may
require different priorities for management to improve and protect public health. In
general, the priorities, in decreasing order, are to:
•   ensure an adequate supply of microbially safe water and maintain acceptability to
    discourage consumers from using potentially less microbially safe water;
•   manage key chemical hazards known to cause adverse health effects;
•   address other chemical hazards, particularly those that affect the acceptability of
    drinking-water in terms of its taste, odour and appearance;
•   apply appropriate technologies to reduce contaminant concentrations in the
    source to below the guideline or regulated values.

choosing hazards for which           Many microbial and chemical constituents of drinking-

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


microbial hazards, the setting of targets will be influenced by occurrence and concen-
trations in source waters and the relative contribution of waterborne organisms to
disease. For chemical hazards, the factors to be considered are the severity of health
effects and the frequency of exposure of the population in combination with the con-
centration to which they will be exposed. The probability of health effects clearly de-
pends on the toxicity and the concentration, but it also depends on the period of
exposure. For most chemicals, health impacts are associated with long-term exposure.
Hence, in the event that exposure is occasional, the risk of an adverse health effect is
likely to be low, unless the concentration is extremely high. The substances of high-
est priority will therefore be those that occur widely, are present in drinking-water
sources or drinking-water all or most of the time and are present at concentrations
that are of health concern.
     Guidance on determining which chemicals are of importance in a particu-
lar situation is given in the supporting document Chemical safety of drinking-water
(Annex 1).
     Although WHO does not set formal guideline values for substances on the basis
of consumer acceptability (i.e. substances that affect the appearance, taste or odour
of drinking-water), it is not uncommon for standards to be set for substances and
parameters that relate to consumer acceptability. Although exceeding such a standard
is not a direct issue for health, it may be of great significance for consumer confidence
and may lead consumers to obtain their water from an alternative, less safe source.
Such standards are usually based on local considerations of acceptability.
     Priority setting should be undertaken on the basis of a systematic assessment
based on collaborative effort among all relevant agencies and may be applied at na-
tional and system-specific levels. At the national level, priorities need to be set in order
to identify the relevant hazards, based on an assessment of risk—i.e. severity and ex-
posure. At the level of individual water supplies, it may be necessary to also prioritize
constituents for effective system management. These processes may require the input
of a broad range of stakeholders, including health, water resources, drinking-water
supply, environment, agriculture and geological services/mining authorities, to estab-
lish a mechanism for sharing information and reaching consensus on drinking-water
quality issues.

2.5.1 Undertaking a drinking-water quality assessment
In order to determine which constituents are, indeed, of concern, it will be necessary
to undertake a drinking-water quality assessment. It is important to identify what
types of drinking-water systems are in place in the country (e.g. piped water supplies,
non-piped water supplies, vended water) and the quality of drinking-water sources
and supplies.
     Additional information that should be considered in the assessment includes
catchment type (protected, unprotected), wastewater discharges, geology, topography,
agricultural land use, industrial activities, sanitary surveys, records of previous mon-
itoring, inspections and local and community knowledge. The wider the range of data
sources used, the more useful the results of the process will be.


                                            28
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


     In many situations, authorities or consumers may have already identified a num-
ber of drinking-water quality problems, particularly where they cause obvious health
effects or acceptability problems. These existing problems would normally be assigned
a high priority.
     Drinking-water supplies that represent the greatest risks to public health should
be identified, with resources allocated accordingly.

quences of which mean that its control        The most common and widespread health

water supplies that represent the greatest
public health risk.
     Health-based targets for microbial contaminants are discussed in section 3.2, and
a comprehensive consideration of microbial aspects of drinking-water quality is con-
tained in chapter 7.

2.5.3 Assessing chemical priorities
Not all of the chemicals with guideline values will be present in all water supplies or,
indeed, all countries. If they do exist, they may not be found at levels of concern. Con-
versely, some chemicals without guideline values or not addressed in the Guidelines
may nevertheless be of legitimate local concern under special circumstances.
     Risk management strategies (as reflected in national standards and monitoring
activities) and commitment of resources should give priority to those chemicals that
pose a risk to human health or to those with significant impacts on the acceptability
of water.
     Only a few chemicals have been shown to cause widespread health effects in hu-
mans as a consequence of exposure through drinking-water when they are present in
excessive quantities. These include fluoride, arsenic and nitrate. Human health effects
associated with lead (from domestic plumbing) have also been demonstrated in some
areas, and there is concern because of the potential extent of exposure to selenium and
uranium in some areas at concentrations of human health significance. Iron and man-
ganese are of widespread significance because of their effects on acceptability. These
constituents should be taken into consideration as part of any priority-setting process.
In some cases, assessment will indicate that no risk of significant exposure exists at the
national, regional or system level.
     Drinking-water may be only a minor contributor to the overall exposure to a
particular chemical, and in some circumstances controlling the levels in drinking-
water, at potentially considerable expense, may have little impact on overall exposure.
Drinking-water risk management strategies should therefore be considered in con-
junction with other potential sources of human exposure.


                                           29
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


      The process of “short-listing” chemicals of concern may initially be a simple clas-
sification of high and low risk to identify broad issues. This may be refined using data
from more detailed assessments and analysis and may take into consideration rare
events, variability and uncertainty.
      Guidance on how to undertake prioritization of chemicals in drinking-water is
provided in the supporting document Chemical safety of drinking-water (Annex 1).
This deals with issues including:
•   the probability of exposure (including the period of exposure) of the consumer
    to the chemical;
•   the concentration of the chemical that is likely to give rise to health effects (see
    also section 8.5);
•   the evidence of health effects or exposure arising through drinking-water, as op-
    posed to other sources, and relative ease of control of the different sources of
    exposure.
     Additional information on the hazards and risks of many chemicals not included
in these Guidelines is available from several sources, including WHO Environmental
Health Criteria monographs and Concise International Chemical Assessment Docu-
ments, reports by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Na-
tions (FAO)/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Committee on Food Additives and information from competent national authorities.
These information sources have been peer reviewed and provide readily accessible in-
formation on toxicology, hazards and risks of many less common contaminants. They
can help water suppliers and health officials to decide upon the significance (if any) of
a detected chemical and on the response that might be appropriate.

2.6 Developing drinking-water quality standards
Health-based targets, including numeric guideline values and other targets described
in the Guidelines for drinking-water quality, are not intended to be mandatory limits,
but are provided as the scientific point of departure for development of national or
regional numerical drinking-water quality standards. No single approach is universal-
ly applicable, and the nature and form of drinking-water standards may vary among
countries and regions.
     In developing national drinking-water standards based on these Guidelines, it
will be necessary to take account of a variety of environmental, social, cultural, eco-
nomic, dietary and other conditions affecting potential exposure. This may lead to
national standards that differ appreciably from these Guidelines, both in scope as well
as in risk targets. A programme based on modest but realistic goals—including fewer
water quality parameters of priority health concern at attainable levels consistent with
providing a reasonable degree of public health protection in terms of reduction of dis-
ease or disease risk within the population—may achieve more than an overambitious
one, especially if targets are upgraded periodically.
     To ensure that standards are acceptable to consumers, communities served,
together with the major water users, should be involved in the standards-setting pro-


                                           30
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


cess. Public health agencies may be closer to the community than those responsible
for its drinking-water supply. At a local level, they also interact with other sectors
(e.g. education), and their combined action is essential to ensure active community
involvement.

2.6.1 Adapting guideline values to locally relevant standards
In order to account for variations in exposure from different sources (e.g. water, food)
in different parts of the world, the proportion of the tolerable daily intake allocated
to drinking-water in setting guideline values for many chemicals will vary. Where
relevant exposure data are available, authorities are encouraged to develop context-
specific guideline values that are tailored to local circumstances and conditions. For
example, in areas where the intake of a particular contaminant in drinking-water is
known to be much greater than that from other sources (e.g. air and food), it may be
appropriate to allocate a greater proportion of the tolerable daily intake to drinking-
water to derive a guideline value more suited to the local conditions.
     Daily water intake can vary significantly in different parts of the world, season-
ally and particularly where consumers are involved in manual labour in hot climates.
Local adjustments to the daily water consumption value may be needed in setting lo-
cal standards, as in the case of fluoride, for example.
     Volatile substances in water may be released into the air during showering and
through a range of other household activities. Under such circumstances, inhalation
may become a significant route of exposure. Where such exposure is shown to be im-
portant for a particular substance (i.e. high volatility, low ventilation rates and high
rates of showering/bathing), it may be appropriate to adjust the guideline value. For
those substances that are particularly volatile, such as chloroform, the correction fac-
tor would be approximately equivalent to a doubling of exposure. For further details,
the reader should refer to section 8.2.9.

2.6.2 Periodic review and revision of standards
As knowledge increases, there may be changes to specific guideline values or considera-
tion of new hazards for the safety of drinking-water. There will also be changes in
the technology of drinking-water treatment and analytical methods for contaminants.
National or subnational standards must therefore be subjected to periodic review and
should be structured in such a way that changes can be made readily. Changes may
need to be made to modify standards, remove parameters or add new parameters, but
no changes should be made without proper justification through risk assessment and
prioritization of resources for protecting public health. Where changes are justified, it
is important that they are communicated to all stakeholders.

2.7 Drinking-water regulations and supporting policies and
    programmes
The incorporation of a preventive risk management and prioritization approach to
drinking-water quality regulations, policies and programmes will:



                                           31
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   ensure that regulations support the prioritization of drinking-water quality
    parameters to be tested, instead of making mandatory the testing of every param-
    eter in these Guidelines;
•   ensure implementation of appropriate sanitation measures at community and
    household levels and encourage action to prevent or mitigate contamination at
    source;
•   identify drinking-water supplies that represent the greatest risks to public health
    and thus determine the appropriate allocation of resources.

2.7.1 Regulations
The alignment of national drinking-water quality regulations with the principles out-
lined in these Guidelines will ensure that:
•   there is an explicit link between drinking-water quality regulations and the pro-
    tection of public health;
•   regulations are designed to ensure safe drinking-water from source to consumer,
    using multiple barriers;
•   regulations are based on good practices that have been proven to be appropriate
    and effective over time;
•   a variety of tools are in place to build and ensure compliance with regulations, in-
    cluding education and training programmes, incentives to encourage good prac-
    tices and penalties, if enforcement is required;
•   regulations are appropriate and realistic within national, subnational and local
    contexts, including specific provisions or approaches for certain contexts or types
    of supplies, such as small community water supplies;
•   stakeholder roles and responsibilities, including how they should work together,
    are clearly defined;
•   “what, when and how” information is shared between stakeholders—including
    consumers—and required action is clearly defined for normal operations and in
    response to incidents or emergencies;
•   regulations are adaptable to reflect changes in contexts, understanding and
    technological innovation and are periodically reviewed and updated;
•   regulations are supported by appropriate policies and programmes.
     The aim of drinking-water quality regulations should be to ensure that the con-
sumer has access to sustainable, sufficient and safe drinking-water. Enabling legisla-
tion should provide broad powers and scope to related regulations and include public
health protection objectives, such as the prevention of waterborne disease and the
provision of an adequate supply of drinking-water. Drinking-water regulations should
focus on improvements to the provision and safety of drinking-water through a vari-
ety of requirements, tools and compliance strategies. Although sanctions are needed
within regulations, the principal aim is not to shut down deficient water supplies.
     Drinking-water quality regulations are not the only mechanism by which public
health can be protected. Other regulatory mechanisms include those related to source
water protection, infrastructure, water treatment and delivery, surveillance and re-
sponse to potential contamination and waterborne illness events.

                                          32
               2. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES


      Drinking-water quality regulations may also provide for interim standards, per-
mitted deviations and exemptions as part of a national or regional policy, rather than
as a result of local initiatives. This may take the form of temporary exemptions for cer-
tain communities or areas for defined periods of time. Short-term and medium-term
targets should be set so that the most significant risks to human health are managed
first. Regulatory frameworks should support long-term progressive improvements.

2.7.2 Supporting policies and programmes
Developing and promulgating regulations alone will not ensure that public health
is protected. Regulations must be supported by adequate policies and programmes.
This includes ensuring that regulatory authorities, such as enforcement agencies, have
sufficient resources to fulfil their responsibilities and that the appropriate policy and
programme supports are in place to assist those required to comply with regulations.
In other words, the appropriate supports need to be in place so that those being regu-
lated and those who are responsible for regulating are not destined to fail.
     Implementation or modification of policies and programmes to provide safe
drinking-water should not be delayed because of a lack of appropriate regulation. Even
where drinking-water regulations do not yet exist, it may be possible to encourage,
and even enforce, the supply of safe drinking-water through, for example, educational
efforts or commercial, contractual arrangements between consumer and supplier (e.g.
based on civil law).
     In countries where universal access to safe drinking-water at an acceptable level
of service has not been achieved, policies should refer to expressed targets for in-
creases in sustainable access to safe drinking-water. Such policy statements should
be consistent with achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (http://
www.un.org/millenniumgoals/) of the United Nations Millennium Declaration and
should take account of levels of acceptable access outlined in General Comment 15
on the Right to Water of the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (http://umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/escgencom15.htm) and asso-
ciated documents.

required, health-based targets can be used to support incremental improvement by
marking out milestones to guide progress towards water safety and public health goals.
This normally requires periodic review and updating of priorities and targets. In turn,
norms and standards should also be periodically updated (see section 2.6.2).
     Health-based targets should assist in determining specific interventions appro-
priate to delivering safe drinking-water, including control measures such as source
protection and treatment processes.

3.1 Setting health-based targets
The use of health-based targets is applicable in countries at all levels of development.
To ensure effective health protection and improvement, targets need to be realistic,
measurable, based on scientific data and relevant to local conditions (including eco-
nomic, environmental, social and cultural conditions) and financial, technical and
institutional resources. Health-based targets should be part of an overall public health
policy, taking into account public health status and trends and the contribution of
drinking-water to the transmission of infectious disease and to overall exposure to
hazardous chemicals both in individual settings and within overall health manage-
ment.
     Although water can be a source of microbial, chemical or radiological hazards, it
is by no means the only source. In setting targets, consideration needs to be given to
other sources, including food, air, person-to-person contact and consumer products,
as well as poor sanitation and personal hygiene. Where the overall burden of disease
from multiple exposure routes is very high, there is limited value in setting strict tar-
gets for drinking-water. For example, there is limited value in establishing a strict tar-
get for a chemical hazard if drinking-water provides only a small proportion of the
total exposure to that chemical. The cost of meeting such targets could unnecessarily
divert funding from other, more pressing health interventions and is not consistent
with the public health objective of reducing overall levels of risk from all sources of
exposure to environmental hazards (Prüss et al., 2002; Prüss & Corvalan, 2006).
     It is also important to take account of the impact of the proposed intervention
on overall rates of disease. For some pathogens and their associated diseases, interven-
tions in water quality may be ineffective and may therefore not be justified. This may
be the case where other routes of exposure dominate. For others, long experience has
shown the effectiveness of improving drinking-water supply and quality management
in the control of waterborne diseases such as typhoid and dysentery.
     Meeting health-based targets should be viewed in the context of broader public
health policy, including initiatives to improve sanitation, waste disposal, personal hy-
giene and public education on

resources all contribute to drinking-water safety (Howard et al., 2002). Public health
prioritization would normally indicate that the major contributors to disease should
be dealt with preferentially, taking account of the costs and impacts of potential inter-
ventions. However, this does not mean ignoring lesser targets if they can be easily
achieved for little cost, as long as this does not divert attention from major targets.
      An important concept in the allocation of resources to improving drinking-water
safety is the possibility of establishing less stringent transitional targets supported by
sound risk management systems in order to encourage incremental improvements of
the quality of drinking-water. In this regard, health-based targets can be used as the
basis for supporting and measuring incremental progress in water quality improve-
ment. Improvements can relate to progression through increasingly tighter targets or
evolution through target types that more precisely reflect the health protection goals
(e.g. from specified technology targets to performance targets).
      The processes of formulating, implementing, communicating and evaluating
health-based targets provide benefits to the overall preventive management of drinking-
water quality. These benefits are outlined in Table 3.1.

3.2 Disability-adjusted life years, tolerable disease burden and
    reference level of risk
At a national level, decisions about risk acceptance and tolerable burdens of disease
are complex and need to take account of the probability and severity of impact in
addition to the environmental, social, cultural, economic and political dimensions
that play important roles in decision-making. Negotiations are an important part of
these processes, and the outcome may very well be unique in each situation. Notwith-
standing the complexity of these decisions, definitions of tolerable burdens of disease
and reference levels of risk are required to provide a baseline for the development of
health-based targets and as a point of departure for decisions in specific situations.

                                              37
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


      Descriptions of tolerable burdens of disease relating to water are typically ex-
pressed in terms of specific health outcomes such as maximum frequencies of diar-
rhoeal disease or cancer incidence. However, these descriptions do not consider the
severity of the outcomes. The various hazards that may be present in water are as-
sociated with very diverse health outcomes with different impacts ranging from mild
diarrhoea to potentially severe outcomes such as typhoid, cancer or skeletal fluorosis.
      A common “metric” is needed that can be used to quantify and compare the bu­
rden of disease associated with different water-related hazards, taking into account
varying probabilities, severities and duration of effects. Such a metric should be ap-
plicable regardless of the type of hazard (microbial, chemical or radiological) to en-
able the use of a consistent approach for each hazard. The metric used in these Guide-
lines is the disability-adjusted life year, or DALY (Box 3.1). The World Health
Organization has used DALYs quite extensively to evaluate public health priorities and
to assess the disease burden associated with environmental exposures, particularly for
microbial hazards.
      A key advantage of using
the DALY is its aggregation of            “Tolerable burden of disease” represents an upper

setting. DALYs can be used to
define tolerable burden of disease and the related reference level of risk.
      In these Guidelines, the tolerable burden of disease is defined as an upper limit
of 10−6 DALY per person per year. This upper-limit DALY is approximately equivalent
to a 10−5 excess lifetime risk of cancer (i.e. 1 excess case of cancer per 100 000 people
ingesting drinking-water at the water quality target daily over a 70-year period), which
is the risk level used in these Guidelines to determine guideline values for genotoxic
carcinogens.
      Expressing health-based targets for chemical hazards in DALYs has the advantage
of enabling comparisons with microbial risks. However, use of the DALY approach for
chemicals has been limited in practice due to gaps in knowledge.
      The 10−6 DALY tolerable burden of disease target may not be achievable or real-
istic in some locations and circumstances in the near term. Where the overall burden
of disease by multiple exposure routes (water, food, air, direct personal contact, etc.) is
very high, setting a 10−6 DALY per person per year level of disease burden from water-
borne exposure alone will have little impact on the overall disease burden. Setting a
less stringent level of acceptable risk, such as 10−5 or 10−4 DALY per person per year,
from waterborne exposure may be more realistic, yet still consistent with the goals of
providing high-quality, safer water.

3.3 Types of health-based targets
The nature and typical application of health-based targets are presented in Table 3.2.
Health-based targets differ considerably with respect to the amount of resources

                                  Box 3.1 Disability-adjusted life years
 The various hazards that can be present in water can have very different health outcomes. Some
 outcomes are mild (e.g. diarrhoea), whereas others can be severe (e.g. cholera, haemolytic uraemic
 syndrome associated with Escherichia coli O157 or cancer). Some are acute (e.g. diarrhoea), whereas
 others are delayed (e.g. infectious hepatitis or cancer). Some especially relate to certain age ranges
 and groups (e.g. skeletal fluorosis in older adults often arises from long-term exposure to high levels
 of fluoride in childhood; infection with hepatitis E virus has a very high mortality rate among preg‑
 nant women). In addition, any one hazard may cause multiple effects (e.g. gastroenteritis, Gullain-
 Barré syndrome, reactive arthritis and mortality associated with Campylobacter).
       In order to support public health priority setting, a common metric is required that can be ap‑
 plied to all types of hazard and takes into account different health outcomes, including probabilities,
 severities and duration of effects. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) provides this metric.
       The basic principle of the DALY is to weight each health impact in terms of severity within the
 range of 0 for good health to 1 for death. The weighting is then multiplied by duration of the effect
 and the number of people affected. In the case of death, duration is regarded as the years lost in
 relation to normal life expectancy. Using this approach, a mild diarrhoea with a severity weighting
 of 0.1 and lasting for 7 days results in a DALY of 0.002, whereas death resulting in a loss of 30 years
 of life equates to a DALY of 30.
       Hence, DALY = YLL (years of life lost) + YLD (years lived with a disability or illness). In this context,
 disability refers to a condition that detracts from good health.
 For example, infection with rotavirus (in developed countries) causes:

     •    mild diarrhoea (severity rating of 0.1) lasting 7 days in 97.5% of cases;
     •    severe diarrhoea (severity rating of 0.23) lasting 7 days in 2.5% of cases;
     •    rare deaths of very young children in 0.015% of cases.

 The DALY per case can then be calculated as follows:
   DALY       = (0.1 × 7/365 × 0.975) + (0.23 × 7/365 × 0.025) + (1 × 70 × 0.00015)
 		           = 0.0019 + 0.0001 + 0.0105
 		           = 0.0125
     Infection with Cryptosporidium can cause watery diarrhoea (severity weighting of 0.067) last‑
 ing for 7 days with extremely rare deaths in 0.0001% of cases. This equates to a DALY per case of
 0.0015.
     Further information on the use of DALYs in establishing health-based targets is included in the
 supporting document Quantifying public health risk in the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality
 (Annex 1).


needed for their development and implementation and in relation to the precision
with which the public health benefits of risk management actions can be defined.
The most precise are health outcome targets, which underpin the derivation of the
remaining targets, as shown in Figure 3.1. Each target type is based on those above
it in Table 3.2, and assumptions with default values are introduced in moving down
between target types. The targets towards the top of the table require greater scientific
and technical inputs and are therefore more precisely related to the level of health
protection. Target types at the bottom of Table 3.2 require the least interpretation by
practitioners in implementation, but depend on a number of assumptions (e.g. estab-
lishing specified technology targets in the absence of sufficient source water quality
data to apply performance targets for microbial pathogens). Efforts should be made
to collect additional information when critical data for applying the next stage of tar-
get setting may not be available. This incremental improvement will ensure that the
health-based targets will be as pertinent as possible to local circumstances.

     When establishing health-based targets, care should be taken to account for short-
term events and fluctuations in water quality along with “steady-state” conditions.
This is particularly important when developing performance and specified technology
targets. Short-term water quality can significantly deteriorate, for example, following
heavy rain and during maintenance. Catastrophic events can result in periods of very
degraded source water quality and greatly decreased efficiency in many processes, or
even system failure, greatly increasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak, Events like
these provide additional justification for the long-established “multiple-barrier prin-
ciple” in water safety.
     For chemical hazards, health-based targets most commonly take the form of
water quality targets, using the guideline values outlined in section 8.5. Performance
targets expressed as percentage removals or specified technology targets can also be
applied to chemical hazards.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


3.3.2 Water quality targets
Water quality targets are the most common form of health-based target applied to
chemicals that may be found in drinking-water. The guideline values for individual
chemicals described in section 8.5 provide water quality targets that can be used to
verify that water safety plans have been effective in managing risks from chemicals in
drinking-water.
      Guideline values are established on the basis of international risk assessments of
the health effects associated with exposure to the chemical in water. In developing
national drinking-water standards (or health-based targets) based on these guideline
values, it will be necessary to take into consideration a variety of environmental, so-
cial, cultural, economic, dietary and other conditions affecting potential exposure, as
well as the default assumptions that are used to derive the guideline values. Exposure
from chemicals in drinking-water is typically minor in comparison with that from
other sources (e.g. food, consumer products and air), with a few important exceptions
(e.g. arsenic and fluoride). This may lead to national targets that differ appreciably
from the guideline values. In some cases, it may be appropriate to take action to pre-
vent exposure to a chemical from sources other than drinking-water (e.g. lead from
soldered cans and from petrol).
      One example is that of the health-based target for fluoride in drinking-water. A
guideline value of 1.5 mg/l is recommended in Table A3.3 of Annex 3, with a comment
that “Volume of water consumed and intake from other sources should be considered
when setting national standards.” Thus, in a country with a warm climate year-round
and where piped water is the preferred source of drinking-water, authorities may select
a health-based target for fluoride that is lower than this guideline value, as water con-
sumption is expected to be higher. On a similar note, the health-based target should
be reviewed in terms of its impact on the most vulnerable section of the population.
      Where water treatment processes have been put in place to remove or reduce
specific chemicals (see section 8.4 and Annex 5), water quality targets should be used
to determine appropriate treatment requirements.
      It is important that water quality targets are established only for those chemicals
that, following rigorous assessment, have been determined to be of health concern
or of concern for the acceptability of the drinking-water to consumers. There is little
value in undertaking measurements for chemicals that are unlikely to be in the system,
that will be present only at concentrations much lower than the guideline value or that
have no human health effects or effects on drinking-water acceptability. One example
is that of radionuclides in drinking-water, which may be present in such minute quan-
tities that their contribution to the overall health risks from drinking-water will be
negligible. Analysis of individual radionuclides requires sophisticated and expensive
procedures; hence, in such cases, measurements of gross alpha and gross beta activities
may be adopted as the screening tests for the presence of radionuclides in drinking-
water, as discussed in section 9.3.
      Water quality targets are also used in the certification process for chemicals that
occur in water as a result of treatment processes or from materials in contact with
water. In such applications, assumptions are made in order to derive standards for
materials and chemicals that can be employed in their certification. Generally, allow-

                                           42
                                 3. HEALTH-BASED TARGETS


ance must be made for the incremental increase over levels found in water sources.
For some materials (e.g. domestic plumbing), assumptions must also account for the
relatively high release of some substances for a short period following installation.
      Escherichia coli remains an important indicator of faecal contamination for veri-
fication of water quality, but measurements of E. coli do not represent a risk-based
water quality target. The use of E. coli as an indicator organism is discussed in more
detail in chapter 7.

3.3.3 Performance targets
Although performance targets can be applied to chemical hazards, the most common
application is for control of microbial hazards in piped supplies. Performance targets
assist in the selection and use of control measures that are capable of preventing path-
ogens from breaching the barriers of source protection, treatment and distribution
systems or preventing growth within the distribution system.
     Performance targets define requirements in relation to source water quality.
Ideally, this should be based on system-specific data; more commonly, however, tar-
gets will be specified in relation to broad categories of source water quality and type
(see section 7.2). The derivation of performance targets requires the integration of
factors such as tolerable disease burden (acceptable risk), including severity of dis-
ease outcomes, and, for pathogens, quantitative microbial risk assessment (see section
7.2). There are insufficient data, and it is not realistic, to derive performance targets
for all potentially waterborne pathogens. The practical approach is to derive targets
for reference pathogens representing groups of pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses and
protozoa). Selection of reference pathogens should take into account variations in sus-
ceptibility to treatment as well as local conditions, including prevalence of waterborne
transmission and source water characteristics.
     The most common application of performance targets is in identifying appropri-
ate combinations of treatment processes to reduce pathogen concentrations in source
water to a level that will meet health outcome targets and hence be safe. This is normally
expressed in terms of log reductions. Selection of processes requires evidence that they
will meet required performance targets (i.e. validation; see sections 2.2.2 and 4.1.7).
Examples of treatment processes and pathogen reductions are given in section 7.3.
     Performance targets can be applied to catchment controls that are aimed at re-
ducing pathogen concentrations through preventive measures and to measures to
prevent ingress of contamination through distribution systems. Performance targets
are also important in certification of point-of-use devices and specified technologies
used for drinking-water treatment. Certification of devices is discussed elsewhere (see
section 1.2.9).
     Performance targets can be applied to chemical hazards. In comparison with tar-
gets for microbial hazards, they are typically applied to specific chemicals, with perfor-
mance measured in terms of percentage reduction (see section 8.4).

3.3.4 Specified technology targets
Specified technology targets typically take the form of recommendations concerning
technologies applicable in certain circumstances (e.g. filtration and disinfection of

                                           43
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


surface water). Selection of technologies is usually based on qualitative assessments
of source water type and quality (e.g. impacted surface water, protected groundwater).
Specified technology targets are most frequently applied to small community supplies
and to devices used at the household level. They can be applied to both microbial and
chemical hazards.
     Smaller municipal and community drinking-water suppliers often have limited
resources and ability to develop individual system assessments and health-based tar-
gets. National regulatory agencies may therefore directly specify technology require-
ments or approved options. These may include, for example:
•   specific and approved treatment processes in relation to source types and char-
    acteristics;
•   providing guidance on requirements for protection of well heads;
•   requirements for protection of drinking-water quality in distribution systems.
    It is important to review specified targets on a regular basis to ensure that they are
kept up to date in terms of the prevailing scientific knowledge about the technology
and its application.

     WSPs vary in complexity, as appropriate for the situation. In many cases, they will
be quite simple, focusing on the key hazards identified for the specific drinking-water
supply system. The wide range of examples of control measures given in the following
text does not imply that all of these are appropriate in all cases.
     WSPs should, by preference, be developed for individual drinking-water systems.
For smaller systems, it may be possible to develop generic WSPs by a statutory body
or accredited third-party organization. In these settings, guidance on household water
storage, handling and use may also be required. Plans dealing with household water
should be linked to a hygiene education programme and advice to households in
maintaining water safety.
     A WSP has three key compo-             A WSP comprises, as a minimum, the three key
nents, which are guided by health-          components that are the responsibility of the
based targets (see chapter 3) and           drinking-water supplier in order to ensure that
                                            drinking-water is safe. These are:
overseen through drinking-water                  •  a system assessment;
supply surveillance (see chapter 5).             •  effective operational monitoring;
They are:                                        •  management and communication.

1)   a system assessment to deter-
     mine whether the drinking-water supply chain (up to the point of consumption)
     as a whole can deliver water of a quality that meets identified targets. This also
     includes the assessment of design criteria of new systems;
2)   identifying control measures in a drinking-water system that will collectively
     control identified risks and ensure that the health-based targets are met. For
     each control measure identified, an appropriate means of operational monitoring
     should be defined that will ensure that any deviation from required performance
     is rapidly detected in a timely manner;
3)   management and communication plans describing actions to be taken during nor-
     mal operation or incident conditions and documenting the system assessment,
     including upgrade and improvement planning, monitoring and communication
     plans and supporting programmes.
     The primary objectives of a WSP in ensuring good drinking-water supply prac-
tice are the prevention or minimization of contamination of source waters, the re-
duction or removal of contamination through treatment processes and the preven-
tion of contamination during storage, distribution and handling of drinking-water.
These objectives are equally applicable to large piped drinking-water supplies, small
community supplies (see section 1.2.6) and household systems and are achieved
through:
•    development of an understanding of the specific system and its capability to
     supply water that meets water quality targets;
•    identification of potential sources of contamination and how they can be controlled;
•    validation of control measures employed to control hazards;
•    implementation of a system for operational monitoring of the control measures
     within the water system;
•    timely corrective actions to ensure that safe water is consistently supplied;

•   undertaking verification of drinking-water quality to ensure that the WSP is be-
    ing implemented correctly and is achieving the performance required to meet
    relevant national, regional and local water quality standards or objectives.
     WSPs are a powerful tool for the drinking-water supplier to manage the supply
safely. They also assist surveillance by public health authorities. Key benefits for water
suppliers implementing WSPs include:
•   demonstration of “due diligence”;
•   improved compliance;
•   rationalizing and documenting existing operational procedures, leading to gains
    in efficiency, improvement of performance and quicker response to incidents;
•   better targeted and justification for long-term capital investments based on risk
    assessment;
•   improved management of existing staff knowledge and identification of critical
    gaps in skills for staff;
•   improved stakeholder relationships.
     One of the challenges and responsibilities of water suppliers and regulators is to
anticipate, plan for and provide for climate variations and weather extremes. WSPs are
an effective tool to manage such variations and extremes (see also section 6.1).
     Where a defined entity is responsible for a drinking-water supply, its responsibil-
ity should include the preparation and implementation of a WSP. This plan should
normally be reviewed and agreed upon with the authority responsible for protection
of public health to ensure that it will deliver water of a quality consistent with the
defined targets.
     Where there is no formal service provider, the competent national or regional
authority should act as a source of information and guidance on the adequacy of ap-
propriate management of community and individual drinking-water supplies. This
will include defining requirements for operational monitoring and management. Ap-
proaches to verification in these circumstances will depend on the capacity of local
authorities and communities and should be defined in national policy.
     Many water suppliers may face practical challenges in initiating, developing and
implementing a WSP. These include mistaken perceptions that one prescribed meth-
odology must be followed; that WSP steps must be undertaken with risks managed
from source to tap in a defined order; that developing a WSP always requires external
expertise; that WSPs supersede, rather than build on, existing good practices; and that
WSPs are necessarily complicated and are not appropriate for small supplies.
     Although WSP implementation demands a certain minimum standard in terms
of the steps involved (Figure 4.1), it is a flexible approach that should rely on the water
supplier’s existing practices and fit the way that a supplier is organized.
     The WSP is a vital step in identifying the hazards and risks associated with
the source water catchment, particularly where the water supplier does not man-
age the catchment, or with established treatment and distribution systems. Starting
with existing treatment to ensure that it is operating at its optimum at all times is a
vital component, as this is often the key barrier that prevents hazards from reaching

      It is recognized that it will not be possible to fully establish a WSP all at once, but
the mapping of the system, the identification of the hazards and the assessment of the
risks will provide a framework for prioritizing actions and will identify the require-
ments for continuing improvement as resources become available. They will also iden-
tify and help make the case for resource allocation and investment so that they can be
targeted to provide the greatest benefit, thus optimizing resources and investment.
      In some countries, the regulatory system is relatively complex. A vital component
of WSPs and the delivery of safe drinking-water is proper communication and ex-
change of information between regulators, including environmental authorities, and
between regulators or authorities and water suppliers. This is particularly important if
resources are to be optimized, and shared information can lead to savings on all sides,
while ensuring that drinking-water supplies are improved.
      Small supplies remain a significant challenge for many countries, partly because
human, technical and financial resources are limited. The introduction of WSPs helps
to identify simple and cost-effective steps that can be taken to protect and improve
such supplies. It is important that health authorities emphasize the importance of
safe drinking-water to the local community and raise the status of the operator’s role
in the community. It would also be helpful for the relevant authorities to provide a
resource or point of contact where operators can obtain advice on and help for WSP
implementation.

4.1 System assessment and design
The first stage in developing a WSP is to form a multidisciplinary team of experts with
a thorough understanding of the drinking-water system involved. The team should
be led by the drinking-water supplier and have sufficient expertise in abstraction,
treatment and distribution of drinking-water. Typically, such a team would include
individuals involved in each stage of the supply of drinking-water and in many cases
representatives from a wider group of stakeholders with collective responsibility for
the water supply system from catchment to consumer. Teams could include engineers,
catchment and water managers, water quality specialists, environmental or public
health or hygienist professionals, operational staff and representatives of consumers or
from the community. In most settings, the team will include members from external
agencies, including the relevant regulatory agency. For small water supplies, additional
external expertise may be useful in addition to operational personnel.
     Effective management of the drinking-water system requires a comprehensive
understanding of the system, the range and magnitude of hazards and hazardous
events that may affect the system and the ability of existing processes and infrastruc-
ture to manage actual or potential risks (otherwise known as a sanitary survey). It
also requires an assessment of capabilities to meet targets. When a new system or an
upgrade of an existing system is being planned, the first step in developing a WSP is
the collection and evaluation of all available relevant information and consideration
of what risks may arise during delivery of water to the consumer.
     Assessment of the drinking-water system supports subsequent steps in the WSP
in which effective strategies for control of hazards are planned and implemented.

     The assessment and evaluation of a drinking-water system are enhanced through
an accurate system description, including a flow diagram. The system description
should provide an overview of the drinking-water system, including characterization
of the source, identification of potential pollution sources in the catchment, measures
for resource and source protection, treatment processes, storage and mechanisms for
distribution (including piped and non-piped systems). It is essential that the descrip-
tion and the flow diagram of the drinking-water system are conceptually accurate. If
the description is not
correct, it is possible to

targets if improvements are required.
     To ensure the accuracy of the assess-
ment, including an overall estimate of risk, it is essential that all elements of the drink-
ing-water system (catchment, treatment and distribution) are considered concurrently
and that interactions among these elements are taken into consideration.

4.1.1 New systems
When drinking-water supply sources are being investigated or developed, it is prudent
to undertake a wide range of analyses in order to establish overall safety and to deter-
mine potential sources of contamination of the drinking-water supply source. These
analyses would normally include hydrological analysis, geological assessment and land
use inventories to determine potential chemical and radiological contaminants.
     When designing new systems, all water quality factors should be taken into ac-
count in selecting technologies for abstraction and treatment of new resources. Varia-
tions in the turbidity and other parameters of raw surface waters can be considerable,
and allowance must be made for this. Treatment plants should be designed to take
account of variations known or expected to occur with significant frequency rather
than for average water quality; otherwise, for example, filters may rapidly become
blocked or sedimentation tanks overloaded. The chemical aggressiveness of some

groundwaters may affect the integrity of borehole casings and pumps, leading to un-
acceptably high levels of iron in the supply, eventual breakdown and expensive repair
work. Both the quality and availability of drinking-water may be reduced and public
health endangered.

4.1.2 Collecting and evaluating available data
Areas that should be taken into consideration as part of the assessment of the drinking-
water system include all real or potential hazards and hazardous events associated with
each step in the drinking-water system that could result in contamination or interrup-
tion of supply. In most cases, consultation with public health and other sectors, includ-
ing land and water users and all those who regulate activities in the catchment, will be
required for the analysis of catchments. A structured approach is important to ensure
that significant issues are not overlooked and that areas of greatest risk are identified.
     The overall assessment of the drinking-water system should take into considera-
tion any historical water quality data that may assist in understanding source water
characteristics and drinking-water system performance both over time and follow-
ing specific events (e.g. heavy rainfall). For examples of information to consider in
assessing components of the drinking-water system, see Module 3 in the supporting
document Water safety plan manual (Annex 1).

Prioritizing hazards for control
Once potential hazards and their sources have been identified, the risk associated with
each hazard or hazardous event should be compared so that priorities for risk man-
agement can be established and documented. Although there are numerous contam-
inants that can compromise drinking-water quality, not every hazard or hazardous
event will require the same degree of attention.
     The risk associated with each hazard or hazardous event may be described by
identifying the likelihood of occurrence (e.g. certain, possible, rare) and evaluating the
severity of consequences if the hazard occurred (e.g. insignificant, major, catastrophic).
The aim should be to distinguish between important and less important hazards or
hazardous events. The approach used typically involves a semiquantitative matrix.
     Simple scoring matrices often apply technical information from guidelines, sci-
entific literature and industry practice with well-informed “expert” judgement based
on knowledge and experience of WSP team members, supported by peer review or
benchmarking. Scoring is specific for each drinking-water system, as each system is
unique. Where generic WSPs are developed for technologies used by small drinking-
water systems, the scoring will be specific to the technology rather than the individual
drinking-water system.
     By using risk ranking, control measures can be prioritized in relation to their
significance. A variety of semiquantitative and qualitative approaches to ranking risk
can be applied, and Module 3 of the supporting document Water safety plan manual
(Annex 1) provides a series of practice-based examples. An example of a semiquanti-
tative approach is given in Table 4.1. Application of this matrix relies to a significant
extent on expert opinion to make judgements on the public health risk posed by haz-
ards or hazardous events.

    An example of descriptors that can be used to rate the likelihood of occurrence
and severity of consequences is given in Table 4.2. A “cut-off ” point must be deter-
mined, above which all risks will require immediate attention. There is little value in
expending large amounts of effort to consider very low risks.

Control measures
The assessment and planning of control measures should ensure that health-based
targets will be met and should be based on hazard identification and risk assessment.
The level of control applied to a hazard should be proportional to the associated risk
ranking. Assessment of control measures involves:
•    identifying existing control measures for each significant hazard or hazardous
     event from catchment to consumer;
•    evaluating whether the control measures, when considered together, are effective
     in reducing risk to acceptable levels;
•    if improvement is required, evaluating alternative and additional control measures
     that could be applied.
      Identification and implementation of control measures should be based on the
multiple-barrier principle. The strength of this approach is that a failure of one barrier
may be compensated by effective operation of
the remaining barriers, thus minimizing the         Control measures are activities or

measure and the rapidity with which change may occur (see section 4.2).

4.1.3 Resource and source protection
Effective catchment management has many benefits. By decreasing the contamination
of the source water, the amount of treatment required is reduced. This may reduce the
production of treatment by-products and minimize operational costs.

Hazard identification
Understanding the reasons for variations in raw water quality is important, as it will
influence the requirements for treatment, treatment efficiency and the resulting health
risk associated with the finished drinking-water. In general, raw water quality is influ-
enced by both natural and human use factors. Important natural factors include wild-
life, climate, topography, geology and vegetation. Human use factors include point
sources (e.g. wastewater discharges) and non-point sources (e.g. surface runoff). For
example, discharges of municipal wastewater can be a major source of pathogens;
urban runoff and livestock can contribute substantial microbial load; body contact
recreation can be a source of faecal contamination; and agricultural runoff, including
agrochemicals and manure, can lead to increased challenges to treatment.
      Whether water is drawn from surface or underground sources, it is important that
the characteristics of the local catchment or aquifer are understood and that the scenar-
ios that could lead to water pollution are identified and managed. The extent to which
potentially polluting activities in the catchment can be reduced may appear to be limited
by competition for water and pressure for increased development in the catchment. How-
ever, introducing good practices in land use and in containment of hazards is often pos-
sible without substantially restricting activities, and collaboration between stakeholders
may be a powerful tool to reduce pollution without reducing beneficial development.

                                                 53
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Resource and source protection provides the first barrier in protection of drinking-
water quality. Where catchment management is beyond the jurisdiction of the drink-
ing-water supplier, the planning and implementation of control measures will require
coordination with other agencies. These may include planning authorities, catchment
boards, environmental and water resource regulators, road authorities, emergency ser-
vices and agricultural, industrial and other commercial entities whose activities have
an impact on water quality. It may not be possible to apply all aspects of resource
and source protection initially; nevertheless, priority should be given to catchment
management. This will contribute to a sense of ownership and joint responsibility for
drinking-water resources through multistakeholder bodies that assess pollution risks
and develop plans for improving management practices for reducing these risks.
     Groundwater from deep and confined aquifers is usually microbially safe and
chemically stable in the absence of direct contamination; however, shallow or uncon-
fined aquifers can be subject to contamination from discharges or seepages associated
with agricultural practices (e.g. pathogens, nitrates and pesticides), on-site sanitation
and sewerage (e.g. pathogens and nitrates) and industrial wastes. For examples of haz-
ards and hazardous situations that should be taken into consideration as part of a
hazard analysis and risk assessment, see Module 4 in the supporting document Water
safety plan manual and the supporting documents Protecting groundwater for health
and Protecting surface water for health (Annex 1).

Control measures
Effective resource and source protection includes the following elements:
•   developing and implementing a catchment management plan, which includes
    control measures to protect surface water and groundwater sources;
•   ensuring that planning regulations include the protection of water resources (land
    use planning and watershed management) from potentially polluting activities
    and are enforced;
•   promoting awareness in the community of the impact of human activity on water
    quality.
     Where a number of water sources are available, there may be flexibility in the se-
lection of water for treatment and supply. It may be possible to avoid taking water from
rivers and streams when water quality is poor (e.g. following heavy rainfall) in order to
reduce risk and prevent potential problems in subsequent treatment processes.
     Retention of water in reservoirs can reduce the number of faecal microorgan-
isms through settling and inactivation, including solar (ultraviolet) disinfection, but
also provides opportunities for the introduction of contamination. Most pathogenic
microorganisms of faecal origin (enteric pathogens) do not survive indefinitely in the
environment. Substantial die-off of enteric bacteria will occur over a period of weeks.
Enteric viruses and protozoa will often survive for longer periods (weeks to months)
but are often removed by settling and antagonism from indigenous microbes. Reten-
tion also allows suspended material to settle, which makes subsequent disinfection
more effective and reduces the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs).
     Control measures for groundwater sources should include protecting the aquifer
and the local area around the borehead from contamination and ensuring the physical

                                           54
                                  4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


integrity of the bore (surface sealed, casing intact, etc.); further information can be
found in the supporting document Protecting groundwater for health (Annex 1).
     For examples of control measures for effective protection of source water and
catchments and of water extraction and storage systems, see Module 4 in the sup-
porting document Water safety plan manual and the supporting document Protecting
surface water for health (Annex 1). Further information on the use of indicator
organisms in catchment characterization is also available in chapter 4 of the support-
ing document Assessing microbial safety of drinking water (Annex 1).

4.1.4 Treatment
After source water protection, the next barriers to contamination of the drinking-
water system are those of water treatment processes, including disinfection and
physical removal of contaminants.

Hazard identification
Hazards may be introduced during treatment, or hazardous events may allow con-
taminants to pass through treatment in significant concentrations. Constituents of
drinking-water can be introduced through the treatment process, including chemical
additives used in the treatment process or products in contact with drinking-water.
Sporadic high turbidity in source water can overwhelm treatment processes, allowing
enteric pathogens into treated water and the distribution system. Similarly, suboptimal
filtration following filter backwashing can lead to the introduction of pathogens into
the distribution system.
      For examples of potential hazards and hazardous events that can have an im-
pact on the performance of drinking-water treatment, see Module 3 in the supporting
document Water safety plan manual (Annex 1).

Control measures
Control measures may include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation,
filtration and disinfection.
      Pretreatment includes processes such as roughing filters, microstrainers, off-
stream storage and bankside filtration. Pretreatment options may be compatible with
a variety of treatment processes ranging in complexity from simple disinfection to
membrane processes. Pretreatment can reduce or stabilize the microbial, natural
organic matter and particulate load.
      Coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation (or flotation) and filtration remove par-
ticles, including microorganisms (bacteria, viruses and protozoa). It is important that
processes are optimized and controlled to achieve consistent and reliable performance.
Chemical coagulation is the most important step in determining the removal effi-
ciency of coagulation, flocculation and clarification processes. It also directly affects
the removal efficiency of granular media filtration units and has indirect impacts on
the efficiency of the disinfection process. While it is unlikely that the coagulation pro-
cess itself introduces any new microbial hazards to finished water, a failure or ineffi-
ciency in the coagulation process could result in an increased microbial load entering
drinking-water distribution.


                                           55
                                  4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


      Various filtration processes are used in drinking-water treatment, including granu-
lar, slow sand, precoat and membrane (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration




                                          55a
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


and reverse osmosis) filtration. With proper design and operation, filtration can act
as a consistent and effective barrier for pathogenic microorganisms and may in some
cases be the only treatment barrier (e.g. for removing Cryptosporidium oocysts by
direct filtration when chlorine is used as the sole disinfectant).
     Application of an adequate concentration of disinfectant is an essential element
for most treatment systems to achieve the necessary level of microbial risk reduction.
Taking account of the level of microbial inactivation required for the more resistant
microbial pathogens through the application of the Ct concept (product of disinfect-
ant concentration and contact time) for a particular pH and temperature ensures that
other, more sensitive microbes are also effectively controlled. Where disinfection is
used, measures to minimize DBP formation should be taken into consideration.
     The most commonly used disinfection process is chlorination. Ozonation, ultra-
violet irradiation, chloramination and application of chlorine dioxide are also used.
These methods are very effective in killing bacteria and can be reasonably effective
in inactivating viruses (depending on type), and some may inactivate many proto-
zoa, including Giardia and Cryptosporidium. For effective removal or inactivation of
protozoal cysts and oocysts, filtration with the aid of coagulation and flocculation (to
reduce particles and turbidity) followed by disinfection (by one or a combination of
disinfectants) is the most practical method.
     Storage of water after disinfection and before supply to consumers can im-
prove disinfection by increasing disinfectant contact times. This can be particularly
important for more resistant microorganisms, such as Giardia and some viruses.
     For examples of treatment control measures, see Module 4 in the supporting
document Water safety plan manual (Annex 1). Further information can also be found
in the supporting document Water treatment and pathogen control (Annex 1).

4.1.5 Piped distribution systems
Water treatment should be optimized to prevent microbial growth, corrosion of pipe
materials and the formation of deposits.
     Maintaining good water quality in the distribution system will depend on the de-
sign and operation of the system and on maintenance and survey procedures to prevent
contamination and to prevent and remove the accumulation of internal deposits.

Hazard identification
The protection of the distribution system is essential for providing safe drinking-water.
Because of the nature of the distribution system, which may include many kilometres
of pipe, storage tanks, interconnections with industrial users and the potential for
tampering and vandalism, opportunities for microbial and chemical contamination
exist. For examples of hazards and hazardous events in piped distribution systems, see
Module 3 in the supporting document Water safety plan manual (Annex 1).
     When contamination by enteric pathogens or hazardous chemicals occurs within
the distribution system, it is likely that consumers will be exposed. to the pathogens
or chemicals. In the case of pathogen ingress, even where disinfectant residuals are
employed to limit microbial occurrence, they may be inadequate to overcome the con-
tamination or may be ineffective against some or all of the pathogen types introduced.


                                           56
                                  4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


As a result, pathogens may occur in concentrations that could lead to infection and
illness.
     Where water is supplied intermittently, the resulting low water pressure will allow
the ingress of contaminated water into the system through breaks, cracks, joints and
pinholes. Intermittent supplies are not desirable but are very common in many coun-
tries and are frequently associated with contamination. The control of water quality
in intermittent supplies represents a significant challenge, as the risks of infiltration
and backflow increase significantly. The risks may be elevated seasonally as soil mois-
ture conditions increase the likelihood of a pressure gradient developing from the
soil to the pipe. Where contaminants enter the pipes in an intermittent supply, the
charging of the system when supply is restored may increase risks to consumers, as a
concentrated “slug” of contaminated water can be expected to flow through the sys-
tem. Where household storage is used to overcome intermittent supply, localized use
of disinfectants to reduce microbial proliferation may be warranted.
     Drinking-water entering the distribution system may contain free-living amoe-
bae and environmental strains of various heterotrophic bacterial and fungal species.
Under favourable conditions, amoebae and heterotrophs, including strains of Citro-
bacter, Enterobacter and Klebsiella, may colonize distribution systems and form bio-
films. There is no evidence to implicate the occurrence of most microorganisms from
biofilms (one exception is Legionella, which can colonize water systems in buildings)
with adverse health effects in the general population through drinking-water, with
the possible exception of severely immunocompromised people (see the supporting
document Heterotrophic plate counts and drinking-water safety; Annex 1).
     Water temperatures and nutrient concentrations are not generally elevated
enough within the distribution system to support the growth of E. coli (or enteric
pathogenic bacteria) in biofilms. Thus, the presence of E. coli should be considered as
evidence of recent faecal contamination.
     Natural disasters, including flood, drought and earth tremors, may significantly
affect piped water distribution systems.

Control measures
Water entering the distribution system must be microbially safe and ideally should
also be biologically stable. The distribution system itself must provide a secure bar-
rier to contamination as the water is transported to the user. Maintaining a disinfect-
ant residual throughout the distribution system can provide some protection against
recontamination and limit microbial growth problems. Chloramination has proved
successful in controlling Naegleria fowleri in water and sediments in long pipelines
and may reduce the regrowth of Legionella within buildings.
      Residual disinfectant will provide partial protection against microbial contami-
nation, but it may also mask the detection of contamination through the use of
conventional faecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli, particularly by resistant organ-
isms. Where a disinfectant residual is used within a distribution system, measures to
minimize DBP production should be taken into consideration.
      Water distribution systems should be fully enclosed, and storage reservoirs and
tanks should be securely roofed with external drainage to prevent contamination.


                                           57
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Control of short-circuiting and prevention of stagnation in both storage and distri-
bution contribute to prevention of microbial growth. A number of strategies can be
adopted to maintain the quality of water within the distribution system, including use
of backflow prevention devices, maintaining positive pressure throughout the system
and implementation of efficient maintenance procedures. It is also important that
appropriate security measures be put in place to prevent unauthorized access to or
interference with the drinking-water system infrastructure.
     Control measures may include using a more stable secondary disinfecting chemi-
cal (e.g. chloramines instead of free chlorine), undertaking a programme of pipe re-
placement, flushing and relining and maintaining positive pressure in the distribution
system. Reducing the time that water is in the system by avoiding stagnation in storage
tanks, loops and dead-end sections will also contribute to maintaining drinking-water
quality. For other examples of distribution system control measures, see Module 4 in
the supporting document Water safety plan manual (Annex 1). Further information is
also available in the supporting document Safe piped water (Annex 1).

4.1.6 Non-piped, community and household systems
Hazard identification
For non-piped, community and household drinking-water systems, hazard identifica-
tion would ideally be performed on a case-by-case basis. In practice, however, reliance
is typically placed on general assumptions of hazardous conditions that are relevant
for technologies or system types and that may be defined at a national or regional
level.
     For examples of hazards and hazardous situations potentially associated with
various non-piped sources of water, see Module 3 in the supporting documents Water
safety plan manual and Water safety planning for small community water supplies
(Annex 1). Further guidance is also provided in the supporting document Water safety
plans (Annex 1) and in the 1997 volume entitled Surveillance and control of community
supplies (WHO, 1997).

Control measures
The control measures required ideally depend on the characteristics of the source
water and the associated catchment; in practice, standard approaches may be applied
for each of these, rather than customized assessment of each system.
     For examples of control measures for various non-piped sources, see Module 4
in the supporting documents Water safety plan manual and Water safety planning for
small community water supplies (Annex 1) and the 1997 report entitled Surveillance
and control of community supplies (WHO, 1997).
     In most cases, contamination of groundwater supplies can be controlled by a
combination of simple measures. In the absence of fractures or fissures, which may
allow rapid transport of contaminants to the source, groundwater in confined or deep
aquifers will generally be free of pathogenic microorganisms. Bores should be encased
to a reasonable depth, and boreheads should be sealed to prevent ingress of surface
water or shallow groundwater.


                                          58
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Rainwater harvesting systems, particularly those involving storage in aboveground
tanks, can be a relatively safe supply of water (see section 6.2). The principal sources
of contamination are birds, small mammals and debris collected on roofs. The impact




                                          58a
                                   4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


of these sources can be minimized by simple measures: guttering should be cleared
regularly, overhanging branches should be kept to a minimum (because they can be
a source of debris and can increase access to roof catchment areas by birds and small
mammals) and inlet pipes to tanks should include leaf litter strainers. First-flush
diverters, which prevent the initial roof-cleaning wash of water (20–25 litres) from
entering tanks, are recommended. If first-flush diverters are not available, a detachable
downpipe can be used manually to provide the same result.
     In general, surface waters will require at least disinfection, and usually also filtra-
tion, to ensure microbial safety. The first barrier is based on minimizing contamination
from human waste, livestock and other hazards at the source.
     The greater the protection of the water source, the less the reliance on treatment
or disinfection. Water should be protected during storage and delivery to consumers
by ensuring that the distribution and storage systems are enclosed. This applies to
both community piped systems and vendor-supplied water (section 6.3). For water
stored in the home, protection from contamination can be achieved by use of en-
closed or otherwise safely designed storage containers that prevent the introduction
of hands, dippers or other extraneous sources of contamination.
     For control of chemical hazards, reliance may be placed primarily on initial
screening of sources and on ensuring the quality and performance of treatment chem-
icals, materials and devices available for this use, including water storage systems.
     Model WSPs may be developed generically for the following types of water
supply:
•   groundwater from protected boreholes or wells with mechanized pumping;
•   conventional treatment of water;
•   multistage filtration;
•   storage and distribution through supplier-managed piped systems;
•   storage and distribution through community-managed piped systems;
•   water vendors;
•   water on conveyances (planes, ships and trains);
•   tubewells from which water is collected by hand;
•   springs from which water is collected by hand;
•   simple protected dug wells;
•   rainwater catchments.
     Guidance is available regarding how water safety may be ensured for household
water collection, transport and storage (see the supporting document Managing water
in the home; Annex 1). This should be used in conjunction with hygiene education
programmes to support health promotion in order to reduce water-related disease.

4.1.7 Validation
For the WSP to be relied on for anticipating and managing the hazards and hazard-
ous events for which it was set in place, it needs to be supported by accurate and
reliable technical information. Validation is concerned with obtaining evidence on
the performance of control measures. Depending on the type of control, validation
can be done by site inspection, using existing data and literature or targeted

                                            59
                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


monitoring programmes to demonstrate performance under normal and excep-
tional circumstances.
     Validation of treatment pro-
cesses is required to show that the         Validation is an investigative activity to identify the
treatment processes can operate             effectiveness of a control measure. It is typically an

as required and achieve required

levels of hazard reduction. In the          reliably achievable water quality in preference to
case of microbial hazards, these            assumed values and also to define the operational
required levels commonly take the           criteria required to ensure that the control meas‑

form of performance targets based
on the use of reference pathogens
(see section 7.2). Validation can be
undertaken during pilot stage studies or during initial implementation of a new or
modified water treatment system. It is also a useful tool in the optimization of existing
treatment processes.
     The first stage of validation is to consider data and information that already exist.
Sources include the scientific literature, relevant industry bodies, partnering and
benchmarking with larger authorities, manufacturers’ specifications and historical
data. This stage will inform the testing requirements. It is important that data used
in validation are relevant for system-specific conditions, as variations in water com-
position and quality, for example, may have a large impact on the efficacy of control
measures.
     Validation is not used for day-to-day management of drinking-water supplies;
as a result, microbial parameters that may be inappropriate for operational mon-
itoring can be used, and the lag time for return of results and additional costs from
pathogen measurements can often be tolerated. Parameters should be chosen to re-
flect the microorganisms being targeted by treatment (see section 7.2). Increasingly,
indicator parameters are being used in validation. For example, coliphage can be
used to assess the effectiveness of virus removal by filtration processes or to meas-
ure the effectiveness of disinfection processes, whereas Clostridium perfringens can
be used to measure the effectiveness of the removal of protozoa by filtration pro-
cesses.
     Validation should not be confused with routine operational monitoring, which
is designed to show that validated control measures continue to work effectively (see
section 4.2). The validation process often leads to improvements in operating per-
formance through the identification of the most effective and robust operating modes.
Additional benefits of the validation process may include identification of more
suitable operational monitoring parameters for unit performance.

4.1.8 Upgrade and improvement
The assessment of the drinking-water system may indicate that existing practices and
control measures may not ensure drinking-water safety. In some instances, all that
may be needed is to review, document and formalize these practices and address any
areas where improvements are required; in others, major infrastructure changes may


                                                60
                                 4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


be needed. The assessment of the system should be used as a basis to develop a plan to
address identified needs for full implementation of a WSP.
     Improvement of the drinking-water system may encompass a wide range of
issues, such as:
•   capital works;
•   training;
•   enhanced operational procedures;
•   community consultation programmes;
•   research and development;
•   developing incident protocols;
•   communication and reporting.
     Upgrade and improvement plans can include short-term (e.g. 1 year) or long-
term programmes. Short-term improvements might include, for example, improve-
ments to community consultation and the development of community awareness
programmes. Long-term capital works projects could include covering of water
storages or enhanced coagulation and filtration.
     Implementation of improvement plans may have significant budgetary implica-
tions and therefore may require detailed analysis and careful prioritization in accord
with the outcomes of risk assessment. Implementation of plans should be monitored
to confirm that improvements have been made and are effective. Control measures
often require considerable expenditure, and decisions about water quality improve-
ments cannot be made in isolation from other aspects of drinking-water supply that
compete for limited financial resources. Priorities will need to be established, and
improvements may need to be phased in over a period of time.

4.2 Operational monitoring and maintaining control
Operational monitoring is a planned and routine set of activities used to determine
that control measures continue to work effectively. In operational monitoring, the
drinking-water supplier monitors each control measure in a timely manner with the
objectives to enable effective system management and to ensure that health-based
targets are achieved.

4.2.1 Determining system control measures
The identity and number of control measures are system specific and will be de-
termined by the number and nature of hazards and hazardous events as well as the
magnitude of associated risks.
    Control measures should reflect the likelihood and consequences of loss of control.
Control measures have a number of operational requirements, including the following:
•   operational monitoring parameters that can be measured and for which limits
    can be set to define the operational effectiveness of the activity;
•   operational monitoring parameters that can be monitored with sufficient
    frequency to reveal failures in a timely fashion;


                                          61
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•    procedures for corrective action that can be implemented in response to deviation
     from limits.

4.2.2 Selecting operational monitoring parameters
Operational monitoring can include measurement of parameters or observational ac-
tivities. The parameters selected for operational monitoring should reflect the effec-
tiveness of each control measure, provide a
timely indication of performance, be readily       Operational monitoring assesses the
measured and provide the opportunity for           performance of control measures at
an appropriate response. Examples include          appropriate time intervals. The inter‑
                                                   vals may vary widely—for example,
measurable variables, such as chlorine resid-      from online control of residual chlorine
uals, pH and turbidity, or observable factors,     to quarterly verification of the integrity
such as the integrity of vermin-proof              of the plinth surrounding a well.
screens.
      Enteric pathogens or indicator organisms are often of limited use for operational
monitoring, because the time taken to process and analyse water samples does not
allow operational adjustments to be made prior to supply.
      A range of parameters can be used in operational monitoring:
•   For source waters, these include turbidity, ultraviolet absorbency, algal growth,
    flow and retention time, colour, conductivity, local meteorological events and in-
    tegrity of protective (e.g. fences) or abstraction infrastructures (e.g. well seals)
    (see the supporting documents Protecting groundwater for health and Protecting
    surface water for health; Annex 1).
•   For treatment, parameters may include disinfectant concentration and contact
    time, ultraviolet intensity, pH, light absorbency, membrane integrity, turbidity
    and colour (see the supporting document Water treatment and pathogen control;
    Annex 1).
•   In piped distribution systems, operational monitoring parameters may include
    the following:
    —— Chlorine residual monitoring provides a rapid indication of problems that will
         direct measurement of microbial parameters. A sudden disappearance of an
         otherwise stable residual can indicate ingress of contamination. Alternatively,
         difficulties in maintaining residuals at points in a distribution system or a
         gradual disappearance of residual may indicate that the water or pipework
         has a high oxidant demand due to growth of bacteria.
    —— Oxidation–reduction potential (or redox potential) measurement can also be
         used in the operational monitoring of disinfection efficacy. It is possible to
         define a minimum level of oxidation–reduction potential necessary to ensure
         effective disinfection. This value has to be determined on a case-by-case basis;
         universal values cannot be recommended. Further research and evaluation of
         oxidation–reduction potential as an operational monitoring technique are
         highly desirable.
    —— Heterotrophic bacteria present in a supply can be a useful indicator of
         changes, such as increased microbial growth potential, increased biofilm

activity, extended retention times or stagnation and a breakdown of integrity
of the system. The numbers of heterotrophic bacteria present in a supply may

       reflect the presence of large contact surfaces within the treatment system,
       such as in-line filters, and may not be a direct indicator of the condition
       within the distribution system (see the supporting document Heterotrophic
       plate counts and drinking-water safety; Annex 1).
    —— Pressure measurement and turbidity are also useful operational monitoring
       parameters in piped distribution systems (see the supporting document
       Turbidity: information for regulators and operators of water supplies; Annex 1).
     Guidance for management of distribution system operation and maintenance
is available (see the supporting document Safe piped water; Annex 1) and includes
the development of a monitoring programme for water quality and other parameters
such as pressure.
     Examples of operational monitoring parameters are provided in Table 4.3.

4.2.3 Establishing operational and critical limits
Control measures need to have defined limits for operational acceptability—termed
operational limits—that can be applied to operational monitoring parameters. Oper-
ational limits should be defined for parameters applying to each control measure. If
monitoring shows that an operational limit has been exceeded, then predetermined
corrective actions (see section 4.4) need to be applied. The detection of the deviation
and implementation of corrective action should be possible in a time frame adequate
to maintain performance and water safety.
     For some control measures, a second series of “critical limits” may also be defined,
outside of which confidence in water safety would be lost. Deviations from critical
limits will usually require urgent action, including immediate notification of the ap-
propriate health authority.
     Operational and critical limits can be upper limits, lower limits, a range or an
“envelope” of performance measures.

4.2.4 Non-piped, community and household systems
Generally, surface water or shallow groundwater should not be used as a source of
drinking-water without sanitary protection or treatment.
     Monitoring of water sources (including rainwater tanks) by community oper-
ators or households will typically involve periodic sanitary inspection (for details, see
the 1997 volume entitled Surveillance and control of community supplies; WHO, 1997).
The sanitary inspection forms used should be comprehensible and easy to use; for
instance, the forms may be pictorial. The risk factors included should be preferably
related to activities that are under the control of the operator and that may affect water
quality. The links to action from the results of operational monitoring should be clear,
and training will be required.
     Operators should also undertake regular physical assessments of the water, espe-
cially after heavy rains, to monitor whether any obvious changes in water quality have
occurred (e.g. changes in colour, odour, taste or turbidity).
     Maintaining the quality of water during collection and manual transport is the re-
sponsibility of the household. Good hygiene practices are required and should be sup-


                                           63

ported through hygiene education. Hygiene education programmes should provide
households and communities with skills to monitor and manage their water hygiene.

     If treatment is applied to water from community sources (such as boreholes, wells
and springs) as well as household rainwater collection, then operational monitoring
is advisable. When household treatment is introduced, it is essential that information
(and, where appropriate, training) be provided to users to ensure that they understand
basic operational monitoring requirements.

4.3 Verification
Verification provides a final check on the overall performance of the drinking-water
supply chain and the safety of drinking-water being supplied to consumers. Verification
should be undertaken by the surveillance agency; water suppliers may also undertake
internal verification programmes.

                                                 64
                                      4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


     For microbial verification, testing is typically for faecal indicator bacteria in treat-
ed water and water in distribution. For verification of chemical safety, testing for
chemicals of concern may
be at the end of treatment,       In addition to operational monitoring of the performance of
in distribution or at the         the individual components of a drinking-water system, it is

the concentrations are            or by a combination of these, depending on the administra‑

and haloacetic acids are          as auditing that WSPs are being implemented as intended

the most common DBPs
and occur at among the
highest concentrations in drinking-water. Under many circumstances, they can serve
as a suitable measure that will reflect the concentration of a wide range of related
chlorinated DBPs.
     Frequencies of sampling should reflect the need to balance the benefits and costs of
obtaining more information. Sampling frequencies are usually based on the population
served or on the volume of water supplied, to reflect the increased population risk.
Frequency of testing for individual characteristics will also depend on variability. Sam-
pling and analysis are required most frequently for microbial and less often for chem-
ical constituents. This is because even brief episodes of microbial contamination can
lead directly to illness in consumers, whereas episodes of chemical contamination that
would constitute an acute health concern, in the absence of a specific event (e.g. chem-
ical overdosing at a treatment plant), are rare. Sampling frequencies for water leaving
treatment depend on the quality of the water source and the type of treatment.
     Plans should be developed to respond to results that do not meet water quality
targets. These should include investigation of the cause of non-compliance and, where
necessary, corrective action, such as boil water advisories. Repeated failure to meet
targets should lead to review of the WSP and development of improvement plans.

4.3.1 Microbial water quality
Verification of the microbial quality of drinking-water typically includes testing for Es-
cherichia coli as an indicator of faecal pollution. In practice, testing for thermotolerant
coliform bacteria can be an acceptable alternative in many circumstances. Although
E. coli is useful, it has limitations. Enteric viruses and protozoa are more resistant to
disinfection; consequently, the absence of E. coli will not necessarily indicate freedom
from these organisms. Under certain circumstances, the inclusion of more resistant
indicators, such as bacteriophages and/or bacterial spores, should be considered (see
section 7.4).
     Verification of the microbial quality of water in supply must be designed
to ensure the best possible chance of detecting contamination. Sampling should
therefore account for potential variations of water quality in distribution. This will
normally mean taking account of locations and of times of increased likelihood of
contamination.

                                                65
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Faecal contamination will not be distributed evenly throughout a piped distribution
system. In systems where water quality is good, this significantly reduces the probability
of detecting faecal indicator bacteria in the relatively few samples collected.
     The chances of detecting contamination in systems reporting predominantly
negative results for faecal indicator bacteria can be increased by using more frequent
presence/absence testing. Presence/absence testing can be simpler, faster and less ex-
pensive than quantitative methods. Comparative studies of the presence/absence and
quantitative methods demonstrate that the presence/absence methods can maximize
the detection of faecal indicator bacteria. However, presence/absence testing is ap-
propriate only in a system where the majority of tests for indicator organisms provide
negative results.
     The more frequently the water is examined for faecal indicator organisms, the more
likely it is that contamination will be detected. Frequent examination by a simple method
is more valuable than less frequent examination by a complex test or series of tests.
     The nature and likelihood of contamination can vary seasonally, with rainfall
and with other local conditions. Sampling should normally be random but should
be increased at times of epidemics, flooding or emergency operations or following
interruptions of supply or repair work.
     Recommended minimum sample numbers for verification of the microbial
quality of drinking-water are shown in Table 4.4.

4.3.2 Chemical water quality
Issues that need to be addressed in developing chemical verification include the
availability of appropriate analytical facilities, the cost of analyses, the possible
deterioration of samples, the stability of the contaminant, the likely occurrence of
the contaminant in various supplies, the most suitable point for monitoring and the
frequency of sampling.
     For a given chemical, the location and frequency of sampling will be determined
by its principal sources (see chapter 8) and variability in its concentration. Substan-
ces that do not change significantly in concentration over time require less frequent
sampling than those that might vary significantly.
     In many cases, analysis of source water quality once per year, or even less, may be
adequate, particularly in stable groundwaters, where the concentrations of naturally
occurring substances of concern will vary very slowly over time. Concentrations of
naturally occurring substances are likely to be more variable in surface waters, and
surface waters therefore may require a greater number of samples, depending on the
contaminant and its importance.
     Sampling locations will depend on the water quality characteristic being exam-
ined. Sampling at the treatment plant or at the head of the distribution system may
be sufficient for constituents whose concentrations do not change during delivery.
However, for those constituents whose concentrations can change during distribu-
tion, sampling should be undertaken following consideration of the behaviour or
source of the specific substance. Samples should include points near the extremities of
the distribution system and taps connected directly to the mains in houses and large

multioccupancy buildings. Lead, for example, should be sampled at consumers’ taps,
as the source of lead is usually service connections or plumbing in buildings.
     For further information, see the supporting document Chemical safety of drinking-
water (Annex 1).

4.3.3 Source waters
Verification testing of source waters is particularly important where there is no water
treatment. It will also be useful following failure of the treatment process or as part
of an investigation of a waterborne disease outbreak. The frequency of testing will
depend on the reason for carrying out the sampling. Testing frequency may be:
•       on a regular basis (the frequency of verification testing will depend on several fac-
        tors, including the size of the community supplied, the reliability of the quality of
        the drinking-water or degree of treatment and the presence of local risk factors);
•       on an occasional basis (e.g. random or during visits to community-managed
        drinking-water supplies);
•       increased following degradation of source water quality resulting from predictable
        incidents, emergencies or unplanned events considered likely to increase the poten-
        tial for a breakthrough in contamination (e.g. following a flood, upstream spills).
    Prior to commissioning a new drinking-water supply, a wider range of analyses
should be carried out, including parameters identified as potentially being present
from a review of data from similar supplies or from a risk assessment of the source.

4.3.4 Piped distribution systems
The choice of sampling points will be dependent on the individual water supply. The
nature of the public health risk posed by pathogens and the contamination potential
throughout distribution systems mean that collection of samples for microbial
analysis (and associated parameters, such as chlorine residual, pH and turbidity) will
typically be done frequently and from dispersed sampling sites. Careful consideration
of sampling points and frequency is required for chemical constituents that arise

                                                            67
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


from piping and plumbing materials and that are not controlled through their direct
regulation and for constituents whose concentrations change in distribution, such as
trihalomethanes. The use of stratified random sampling in distribution systems has
proven to be effective.

4.3.5 Community-managed supplies
If the performance of a community drinking-water system is to be properly evalu-
ated, a number of factors must be considered. Some countries that have developed
national strategies for the surveillance and quality control of drinking-water systems
have adopted quantitative service indicators (i.e. quality, quantity, accessibility, cover-
age, affordability and continuity) for application at community, regional and national
levels. Usual practice would be to include the critical parameters for microbial qual-
ity (normally E. coli, chlorine, turbidity and pH) and for a sanitary inspection to be
carried out. Methods for these tests must be standardized and approved. It is recom-
mended that field test kits be validated for performance against reference or standard
methods and approved for use in verification testing.
     Together, service indicators provide a basis for setting targets for community
drinking-water supplies. They serve as a quantitative guide to the adequacy of drink-
ing-water supplies and provide consumers with an objective measure of the quality of
the overall service and thus the degree of public health protection afforded.
     Periodic testing and sanitary inspection of community drinking-water supplies
should typically be undertaken by the surveillance agency and should assess microb-
ial hazards and known problem chemicals (see also chapter 5). Frequent sampling is
unlikely to be possible, and one approach is therefore a rolling programme of visits
to ensure that each supply is visited once every 3–5 years. The primary purpose is to
inform strategic planning and policy rather than to assess compliance of individ-
ual drinking-water supplies. Comprehensive analysis of the chemical quality of all
sources is recommended prior to commissioning as a minimum and preferably every
3–5 years thereafter.
     Advice on the design of sampling programmes and on the frequency of sam-
pling for community supplies is given in the 1997 volume, Surveillance and control of
community supplies (WHO, 1997).

4.3.6 Quality assurance and quality control
Appropriate quality assurance and analytical quality control procedures should be im-
plemented for all activities linked to the production of drinking-water quality data.
These procedures will ensure that the data are fit for purpose—in other words, that
the results produced are of adequate accuracy. Fit for purpose, or adequate accur-
acy, will be defined in the water quality monitoring programme, which will include
a statement about accuracy and precision of the data. Because of the wide range of
substances, methods, equipment and accuracy requirements likely to be involved in
the monitoring of drinking-water, many detailed, practical aspects of analytical qual-
ity control are concerned. These are beyond the scope of this publication.
     The design and implementation of a quality assurance programme for analytical
laboratories are described in detail in Water quality monitoring: A practical guide to the

design and implementation of freshwater quality studies and monitoring programmes (Bar-
tram & Ballance, 1996). The relevant chapter relates to standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005,
General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories, which
provides a framework for the management of quality in analytical laboratories.
     Guidance on sampling is given in the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) standards listed in Table 4.5.

4.3.7 Water safety plans
In addition to testing of water quality, verification should include audits of WSPs
to demonstrate that the plans have been properly designed, are being implemented
correctly and are effective. Factors to consider include the following:
•    all significant hazards and hazardous events have been identified;
•    appropriate control measures have been included;
•    appropriate operational monitoring procedures have been established;
•    appropriate operational limits have been defined;
•    corrective actions have been identified;
•    appropriate verification monitoring procedures have been established.
     Audits can be undertaken as part of internal or external reviews and may form
part of surveillance by independent authorities. Auditing can have both an assessment
and a compliance-checking function. Further information can be found in the sup-
porting document A practical guide to auditing water safety plans (Annex 1).

4.4 Management procedures for piped distribution systems

     A significant deviation in
operational monitoring where a critical limit is exceeded (or in verification) is often re-
ferred to as an “incident”. An incident is any situation in which there is reason to suspect
that water being supplied for drinking may be, or may become, unsafe (i.e. confidence
in water safety is lost). As part of a WSP, management procedures should be defined for
response to predictable incidents as well as unpredictable incidents and emergencies.
     Incident response plans can have a range of alert levels. These can be minor early
warning, necessitating no more than additional investigation, through to emergency.

Emergencies are likely to require the resources of organizations beyond the drinking-
water supplier, particularly the public health authorities.

        Incident response plans typically comprise:
•       accountabilities and contact details for key personnel, often including several
        organizations and individuals;
•       lists of measurable indicators and limit values/conditions that would trigger
        incidents, along with a scale of alert levels;
•       clear description of the actions required in response to alerts;
•       location and identity of the standard operating procedures and required
        equipment;
•       location of backup equipment;
•       relevant logistical and technical information;
•       checklists and quick reference guides.

                                  4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


     The plan may need to be followed at very short notice, so standby rosters, effective
communication systems and up-to-date training and documentation are required.
     Staff should be trained in response procedures to ensure that they can manage
incidents or emergencies effectively. Incident and emergency response plans should
be periodically reviewed and practised. This improves preparedness and provides
opportunities to improve the effectiveness of plans before an emergency occurs.
     Following any incident or emergency, an investigation should be undertaken
involving all concerned staff. The investigation should consider factors such as:
•   the cause of the problem;
•   how the problem was first identified or recognized;
•   the most essential actions required;
•   any communication problems that arose, and how they were addressed;
•   the immediate and longer-term consequences;
•   how well the emergency response plan functioned.
     Appropriate documentation and reporting of the incident or emergency should
also be established. The organization should learn as much as possible from the inci-
dent or emergency to improve preparedness and planning for future incidents. Review
of the incident or emergency may indicate necessary amendments to the WSP and
existing protocols.
     The preparation of clear procedures, definition of accountability and provision
of equipment for the sampling and storing of water in the event of an incident can
be valuable for follow-up epidemiological or other investigations, and the sampling
and storage of water from early on during a suspected incident should be part of the
response plan.

4.4.1 Predictable incidents (“deviations”)
Many incidents (e.g. exceedance of a critical limit) can be foreseen, and manage-
ment plans can specify resulting actions. Actions may include, for example, tempor-
ary change of water sources (if possible), increasing coagulation dose, use of backup
disinfection or increasing disinfectant concentrations in distribution systems.

4.4.2 Unplanned events
Some scenarios that lead to water being considered potentially unsafe might not be
specifically identified within incident response plans. This may be either because the
events were unforeseen or because they were considered too unlikely to justify prepar-
ing detailed corrective action plans. To allow for such events, a general incident re-
sponse plan should be developed. The plan would be used to provide general guidance
on identifying and handling of incidents along with specific guidance on responses
that would be applied to many different types of incident.
     A protocol for situation assessment and declaring incidents would be provided in
a general incident response plan that includes personal accountabilities and categorical
selection criteria. The selection criteria may include time to effect, population affected
and nature of the suspected hazard.


                                           71
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     The success of general incident responses depends on the experience, judgement
and skill of the personnel operating and managing the drinking-water supply. How-
ever, generic activities that are common in response to many incidents can be incor-
porated within general incident response plans. For example, for piped systems, emer-
gency flushing standard operating procedures can be prepared and tested for use in
the event that contaminated water needs to be flushed from a piped system. Similarly,
standard operating procedures for rapidly changing or bypassing reservoirs can be
prepared, tested and incorporated. The development of such a “toolkit” of supporting
material limits the likelihood of error and speeds up responses during incidents.

4.4.3 Emergencies
Water suppliers should develop plans to be invoked in the event of an emergency.
These plans should consider potential natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes, floods, dam-
age to electrical equipment by lightning strikes), accidents (e.g. spills in the water-
shed, interruptions in electricity supply), damage to treatment plant and distribution
system and human actions (e.g. strikes, sabotage). Emergency plans should clearly
specify responsibilities for coordinating measures to be taken, a communication plan
to alert and inform users of the drinking-water supply and plans for providing and
distributing emergency supplies of drinking-water.
     Plans should be developed in consultation with relevant regulatory authorities
and other key agencies and should be consistent with national and local emergency
response arrangements. Key areas to be addressed in emergency response plans
include:
•   response actions, including increased monitoring;
•   responsibilities of authorities internal and external to the organization;
•   plans for emergency drinking-water supplies;
•   communication protocols and strategies, including notification procedures (in-
    ternal, regulatory body, media and public);
•   mechanisms for increased public health surveillance.
     Response plans for emergencies and unforeseen events involving microorgan-
isms or chemicals should also include the basis for issuing boil water advisories (see
section 7.6.1) and water avoidance advisories (see section 8.7.10). The objective of
the advisory should be taken in the public interest.. Therefore, the advisory should be
issued after rapid, but careful, consideration of available information and conclusion
that there is an ongoing risk to public health that outweighs any risk from the advice
to boil or avoid water. The advisory will typically be managed by public health au-
thorities. A decision to close a drinking-water supply carries an obligation to provide
an alternative safe supply and is very rarely justifiable because of the adverse effects,
especially to health, of restricting access to water. Specific actions in the event of a
guideline exceedance or an emergency are discussed in section 7.6 (microbial hazards)
and section 8.7 (chemical hazards); more general considerations are discussed in sec-
tion 6.7. “Practice” emergencies are an important part of the maintenance of readiness
for emergencies. They help to determine the potential actions that can be taken in
different circumstances for a specific water supply.

                                 4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


4.4.4 Preparing a monitoring plan
Programmes should be developed for operational and verification monitoring and
documented as part of a WSP, detailing the strategies and procedures to follow for
monitoring the various aspects of the drinking-water system. The monitoring plans
should be fully documented and should include the following information:
•   parameters to be monitored;
•   sampling location and frequency;
•   sampling methods and equipment;
•   schedules for sampling;
•   references to corrective action procedures, including responsibilities;
•   qualifications and certification requirements for testing laboratories;
•   methods for quality assurance and validation of sampling results;
•   requirements for checking and interpreting results;
•   responsibilities and necessary qualifications of staff;
•   requirements for documentation and management of records, including how
    monitoring results will be recorded and stored;
•   requirements for reporting and communication of results.

4.4.5 Supporting programmes
Many actions are important in ensuring drinking-water safety but do not directly af-
fect drinking-water quality and are therefore not control measures. These are referred
to as “supporting programmes” and should also be documented in a WSP. Supporting
programmes could involve:
•   controlling access to treatment plants, catch-
    ments and reservoirs and implementing the           Actions that are important in
    appropriate security measures to prevent            ensuring drinking-water safety
                                                        but do not directly affect drink‑
    transfer of hazards from people when they do

    enter source water;                                 to as supporting programmes.
•   developing verification protocols for the use of
    chemicals and materials in the drinking-water
    supply—for instance, to ensure the use of suppliers that participate in quality as-
    surance programmes;
•   using designated equipment for attending to incidents such as mains bursts
    (e.g. equipment should be designated for potable water work only and not for
    sewage work);
•   training and educational programmes for personnel involved in activities that
    could influence drinking-water safety; training should be implemented as part of
    induction programmes and frequently updated;
•   research and development to improve understanding of water quality, including
    the quality of source waters, and treatment.
    Supporting programmes will consist almost entirely of items that drinking-water
suppliers and handlers will ordinarily have in place as part of their normal operation.
For most, the implementation of supporting programmes will involve:

                                          73
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   collation of existing operational and management practices;
•   initial and, thereafter, periodic review and updating to continually improve practices;
•   promotion of good practices to encourage their use;
•   audit of practices to check that they are being used, including taking corrective
    actions in case of non-conformance.
     Codes of good operating and management practice and hygienic working prac-
tice are essential elements of supporting programmes. These are often captured within
standard operating procedures. They include, but are not limited to:
•   hygienic working practices in maintenance;
•   attention to personal hygiene;
•   training and competence of personnel involved in drinking-water supply;
•   tools for managing the actions of staff, such as quality assurance systems;
•   securing stakeholder commitment, at all levels, to the provision of safe drinking-
    water;
•   education of communities whose activities may influence drinking-water quality;
•   calibration of monitoring equipment;
•   record keeping.
    Comparison of one set of supporting programmes with the supporting pro-
grammes of other suppliers, through peer review, benchmarking and personnel or
document exchange, can stimulate ideas for improved practice.
    Supporting programmes can be extensive, be varied and involve multiple or-
ganizations and individuals. Many supporting programmes involve water resource
protection measures and typically include aspects of land use control. Some water
resource protection measures are engineered, such as effluent treatment processes and
stormwater management practices that may be used as control measures.

4.5 Management of community and household water supplies
Community-managed drinking-water supplies worldwide are more frequently con-
taminated than larger drinking-water supplies, may be more prone to operating
discontinuously (or intermittently) and break down or fail more frequently.
     To ensure safe drinking-water, the focus in small supplies should be on:
•   informing the public;
•   assessing the water supply to determine whether it is able to meet identified
    health-based targets (see section 4.1);
•   monitoring identified control measures and training operators to ensure that all
    likely hazards can be controlled and that risks are maintained at a tolerable level
    (see section 4.2);
•   operational monitoring of the drinking-water system (see section 4.2);
•   implementing systematic water quality management procedures (see section 4.4),
    including documentation and communication (see section 4.6);
•   establishing appropriate incident response protocols (usually encompassing
    actions at the individual supply, backed by training of operators, and actions
    required by local or national authorities) (see sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.3); and

                                           74
                                 4. WATER SAFETY PLANS


•   developing programmes to upgrade and improve existing water delivery (usu-
    ally defined at a national or regional level rather than at the level of individual
    supplies) (see section 4.1.8).
     For small point sources serving communities or individual households, the em-
phasis should be on selecting source water of the best available quality and on pro-
tecting its quality by the use of multiple barriers (usually within source protection)
and maintenance programmes. Whatever the source (groundwater, surface water or
rainwater tanks), communities and householders should assure themselves that the
water is safe to drink. Generally, surface water and shallow groundwater under the dir-
ect influence of surface water (which includes shallow groundwater with preferential
flow paths) should receive treatment.
     The parameters recommended for the minimum monitoring of community sup-
plies are those that best establish the hygienic state of the water and thus the risk of
waterborne disease. The essential parameters of water quality are E. coli—thermotol-
erant (faecal) coliforms are accepted as suitable substitutes—and chlorine residual (if
chlorination is practised). These should be supplemented, where appropriate, by pH
adjustment (if chlorination is practised) and measurement of turbidity.
     These parameters may be measured on site using relatively unsophisticated testing
equipment, and improved and relatively low cost systems continue to be developed.
On-site testing is essential for the determination of turbidity and chlorine residual,
which change rapidly during transport and storage; it is also important for the other
parameters where laboratory support is lacking or where transportation problems
would render conventional sampling and analysis impractical.
     Other health-related parameters of local significance should also be measured.
The overall approach to control of chemical contamination is outlined in chapter 8.

4.6 Documentation and communication
Documentation of a WSP should include:
•   description and assessment of the drinking-water system (see section 4.1), in-
    cluding programmes to upgrade and improve existing water delivery (see
    section 4.1.8);
•   the plan for operational monitoring and verification of the drinking-water system
    (see sections 4.2 and 4.3);
•   water safety management procedures for normal operation, incidents (specific
    and general) and emergency situations (see sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2 and 4.4.3),
    including communication plans; and
•   description of supporting programmes (see section 4.4.5).
     Records are essential to review the adequacy of the WSP and to demonstrate
the adherence of the drinking-water system to the WSP. Several types of records are
generally kept:
•   supporting documentation for developing the WSP, including validation;
•   records and results generated through operational monitoring and verification;
•   outcomes of incident investigations;

                                          75
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   documentation of methods and procedures used;
•   records of employee training programmes.
     By tracking records generated through operational monitoring and verification,
an operator or manager can detect that a process is approaching its operational or
critical limit. Review of records can be instrumental in identifying trends and in mak-
ing operational adjustments. Periodic review of WSP records is recommended so that
trends can be noted and appropriate actions decided upon and implemented. Rec-
ords are also essential when surveillance is implemented through auditing-based ap-
proaches.
     Communication strategies should include:
•   procedures for promptly advising of any significant incidents within the drinking-
    water supply, including notification of the public health authority;
•   summary information to be made available to consumers—for example, through
    annual reports and on the Internet;
•   establishment of mechanisms to receive and actively address community
    complaints in a timely fashion.
     The right of consumers to health-related information on the water supplied to
them for domestic purposes is fundamental. However, in many communities, the
simple right of access to information will not ensure that individuals are aware of
the quality of the water supplied to them; furthermore, the probability of consum-
ing unsafe water may be relatively high. The agencies responsible for monitoring
should therefore develop strategies for disseminating and explaining the significance
of health-related information. Further information on communication is provided in
section 5.5.

4.7 Planned review
4.7.1 Periodic review
WSPs should not be regarded as static documents. They need to be regularly reviewed
and revised to ensure that they are functioning correctly and that they are kept up to date
in light of changes in water systems or new developments. Reviews should consider:
•   data collected as part of monitoring processes;
•   changes to water sources and catchments;
•   changes to treatment, demand and distribution;
•   implementation of improvement and upgrade programmes;
•   revised procedures;
•   emerging hazards and risks.

4.7.2 Post-incident review
WSPs should also be reviewed following incidents and emergencies to ensure that,
where possible, incidents do not recur and, where this is not possible (e.g. floods), to
reduce impacts. Post-incident reviews may identify areas for improvement and the
need for revision of WSPs.

is little to be gained from surveillance of piped water supplies alone if these are avail-
able to only a small proportion of the population or if they represent a minority of
supplies.
       Information alone does not lead to improvement. Instead, the effective manage-
ment and use of the information generated by surveillance make possible the rational
improvement of water supplies—where “rational” implies that available resources are
used for maximum public health benefit.
       Surveillance is an important element in the development of strategies for incre-
mental improvement of the quality of drinking-water supply services. It is important
that strategies be developed for implementing surveillance, collating, analysing and
summarizing data and reporting and disseminating the findings and that the strat-
egies are accompanied by recommendations for remedial action. Follow-up will be
required to ensure that remedial action is taken.
       Surveillance extends beyond drinking-water supplies operated by a discrete
drinking-water supplier to include drinking-water supplies that are managed by com-
munities and includes assurance of good hygiene in the collection and storage of
household water.
       The surveillance agency must have, or have access to, legal expertise in addition
to expertise on drinking-water and water quality. Drinking-water supply surveillance
is also used to ensure that any transgressions that may occur are appropriately inves-
tigated and resolved. In many cases, it will be more appropriate to use surveillance as a
mechanism for collaboration between public health agencies and drinking-water sup-
pliers to improve drinking-water supply than to resort to enforcement, particularly
where the problem lies mainly with community-managed drinking-water supplies.
       The authorities responsible for drinking-water supply surveillance may be the
public health ministry or other agency (see section 1.2.1), and their roles encompass
four areas of activity:
1)   public health oversight of organized drinking-water supplies;
2)   public health oversight and information support to populations without access to
     organized drinking-water supplies, including communities and households;
3)   consolidation of information from diverse sources to enable understanding of
     the overall drinking-water supply situation for a country or region as a whole
     as an input to the development of coherent public health–centred policies and
     practices;
4)   participation in the investigation, reporting and compilation of outbreaks of
     waterborne disease.
     A drinking-water supply surveillance programme should normally include pro-
cesses for approval of water safety plans (WSPs). This approval will normally involve
review of the system assessment, of the identification of appropriate control measures
and supporting programmes and of operational monitoring and management plans.
It should ensure that the WSP covers normal operating conditions and predictable in-
cidents (deviations) and has contingency plans in case of an emergency or unplanned
event.


                                           78
                                     5. SURVEILLANCE


     The surveillance agency may also support or undertake the development of WSPs
for community-managed drinking-water supplies and household water treatment
and storage. Such plans may be generic for particular technologies rather than specific
for individual systems.

5.1 Types of approaches
There are two types of approaches to surveillance of drinking-water quality: audit-
based approaches and approaches relying on direct assessment. Implementation of
surveillance will generally include a mixture of these approaches according to supply
type and may involve using rolling programmes whereby systems are addressed pro-
gressively. Often it is not possible to undertake extensive surveillance of all community
or household supplies. In these cases, well-designed surveys should be undertaken in
order to understand the situation at the national or regional level.

5.1.1 Audit
In the audit approach to surveillance, assessment activities, including verification test-
ing, are undertaken largely by the supplier, with third-party auditing to verify compli-
ance. It is increasingly common that analytical services are procured from accredited
external laboratories. Some authorities are also experimenting with the use of such
arrangements for services such as sanitary inspection, sampling and audit reviews.
     An audit approach requires the existence of a stable source of expertise and cap­
acity within the surveillance agency in order to:
•   review and approve new WSPs;
•   undertake or oversee auditing of the implementation of individual WSPs as a
    programmed routine activity;
•   respond to, investigate and provide advice on receipt of reports on significant
    incidents.
    Periodic audit of the implementation of WSPs is required:
•   at intervals (the frequency of routine audits will be dependent on factors such as
    the size of the population served and the nature and quality of source water and
    treatment facilities);
•   following substantial changes to the source, the distribution or storage system or
    treatment processes;
•   following significant incidents.
    Periodic audit would normally include the following elements:
•   examination of records to ensure that system management is being carried out as
    described in the WSP;
•   ensuring that operational monitoring parameters are kept within operational
    limits and that compliance is being maintained;
•   ensuring that verification programmes are operated by the water supplier (either
    through in-house expertise or through a third-party arrangement);


                                           79
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   assessment of supporting programmes and of strategies for improving and up-
    dating the WSP;
•   in some circumstances, sanitary inspection, which may cover the whole of the
    drinking-water system, including sources, transmission infrastructure, treatment
    plants, storage reservoirs and distribution systems.
    In response to reports of significant incidents, it is necessary to ensure that:
•   the event is investigated promptly and appropriately;
•   the cause of the event is determined and corrected;
•   the incident and corrective action are documented and reported to appropriate
    authorities;
•   the WSP is reassessed to avoid the occurrence of a similar situation.
      The implementation of an audit-based approach places responsibility on the
drinking-water supplier to provide the surveillance agency with information re-
garding system performance against agreed indicators. In addition, a programme of
announced and unannounced visits by auditors to drinking-water suppliers should
be implemented to review documentation and records of operational practice in or-
der to ensure that data submitted are reliable. Such an approach does not necessarily
imply that water suppliers are likely to falsify records, but it does provide an important
means of reassuring consumers that there is true independent verification of the activ-
ities of the water supplier. The surveillance agency will normally retain the authority
to undertake some analysis of drinking-water quality to verify performance or enter
into a third-party arrangement for such analysis.

5.1.2 Direct assessment
It may be appropriate for the drinking-water supply surveillance agency to carry out
independent testing of water supplies. Such an approach often implies that the agency
has access to analytical facilities with staff trained to carry out sampling, analysis and
sanitary inspection.
     Direct assessment also implies that surveillance agencies have the capacity to as-
sess findings and to report to and advise suppliers and communities. A surveillance
programme based on direct assessment would normally include:
•   specified approaches to large municipality/small municipality/community sup-
    plies and individual household supplies;
•   sanitary inspections to be carried out by qualified personnel;
•   sampling to be carried out by qualified personnel;
•   tests to be conducted using suitable methods by accredited laboratories or using
    approved field testing equipment and qualified personnel;
•   procedures on reporting findings and follow-up to ensure that they have been
    acted on.
    For community-managed drinking-water supplies and where the development of
in-house verification or third-party arrangements is limited, direct assessment may be
used as the principal system of surveillance. This may apply to drinking-water supplies

                                           80
                                     5. SURVEILLANCE


in small towns by small-scale private sector operators or local government. Direct as-
sessment may lead to the identification of requirements to amend or update the WSP,
and the process to be followed when undertaking such amendments should be clearly
identified.
     Where direct assessment is carried out by the surveillance agency, it comple-
ments other verification testing of the water supplier. General guidance on verification
testing, which is also applicable to surveillance through direct assessment, is provided
in section 4.3.

5.2 Adapting approaches to specific circumstances
5.2.1 Urban areas in developing countries
Drinking-water supply arrangements in urban areas of developing countries are typ-
ically complex. There can often be one or more large piped supplies with household
and public connections, in combination with a range of alternative drinking-water
supplies, including point sources and vended water. In these situations, the surveil-
lance programme should take account of the different sources of drinking-water and
the potential for deterioration in quality during collection, storage and use. Further-
more, the population will vary in terms of socioeconomic status and vulnerability to
water-related disease.
      In many situations, zoning the urban area on the basis of vulnerability and
drinking-water supply arrangements is required. The zoning system should include
all populations within the urban area, including informal and periurban settlements,
regardless of their legal status, in order to direct resources to where greatest improve-
ments (or benefits) to public health will be achieved. This provides a mechanism
to ensure that non-piped drinking-water sources are also included within drinking-
water supply surveillance activities.
      Experience has shown that zoning can be developed using qualitative and quan-
titative methods and is useful in identifying vulnerable groups and priority commun-
ities where drinking-water supply improvements are required.

5.2.2 Community drinking-water supplies
Small community-managed drinking-water supplies are found in most countries
and may be the predominant form of drinking-water supply for large sections of the
population. The precise definition of a “community drinking-water supply” will vary,
but administration and management arrangements are often what set community
supplies apart, especially in developing countries. Community-managed supplies may
include simple piped water systems or a range of point sources, such as boreholes with
hand pumps, dug wells and protected springs.
     The control of water quality and implementation of surveillance programmes for
such supplies often face significant constraints. These typically include:
•   limited capacity and skills within the community to undertake process control
    and verification; this may increase the need both for surveillance to assess the
    state of drinking-water supplies and for surveillance staff to provide training and
    support to community members;

                                           81
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   the very large number of widely dispersed supplies, which significantly increases
    overall costs in undertaking surveillance activities.
Furthermore, it is often small community-managed water supplies that present the
greatest water quality problems.
      Experience from both developing and developed countries has shown that sur-
veillance of community-managed drinking-water supplies can be effective when well
designed and when the objectives are geared more towards a supportive role to en-
hance community management than towards enforcement of compliance.
      Surveillance of community drinking-water supplies requires a systematic pro-
gramme of surveys that encompass all aspects of the drinking-water supply to the
population as a whole, including sanitary inspection (including catchment inspec-
tions) and institutional and community aspects. Surveillance should address variabil-
ity in source water quality, treatment process efficacy and the quality of distributed or
household-treated and household-stored water.
      Experience has also shown that the role of surveillance may include health edu-
cation and health promotion activities to improve healthy behaviour towards man-
agement of drinking-water supply and sanitation. Participatory activities can include
sanitary inspection by communities and, where appropriate, community-based test-
ing of drinking-water quality using affordable field test kits and other accessible test-
ing resources.
      In the evaluation of overall strategies, the principal aim should be to derive over-
all lessons for improving water safety for all community supplies, rather than relying
on monitoring the performance of individual supplies.
      Frequent visits to every individual supply may be impractical because of the very
large numbers of such supplies and the limitations of resources for such visits. How-
ever, surveillance of large numbers of community supplies can be achieved through a
rolling programme of visits. Commonly, the aim will be to visit each supply periodic-
ally (once every 3–5 years at a minimum) using either stratified random sampling or
cluster sampling to select specific supplies to be visited. During each visit, sanitary
inspection and water quality analysis will normally be done to provide insight to con-
tamination and its causes.
      During each visit, testing of water stored in the home may be undertaken in a
sample of households. The objective for such testing is to determine whether con-
tamination occurs primarily at the source or within the home. This will allow evalua-
tion of the need for investment in supply improvement or education on good hygiene
practices for household treatment and safe storage. Household testing may also be
used to evaluate the impact of a specific hygiene education programme.

5.2.3 Household treatment and storage systems
Where water is handled during storage in households, it may be vulnerable to contam-
ination, and sampling of household-stored water is of interest in independent surveil-
lance. It is often undertaken on a “survey” basis to develop insights into the extent and
nature of prevailing problems. Surveillance systems managed by public health author-



                                           82
                                      5. SURVEILLANCE


ities for drinking-water supplies using household treatment and household storage
containers are therefore recommended.
      The principal focus of surveillance of household-based interventions will be as-
sessment of their acceptance and impact through sample surveys so as to evaluate
and inform overall strategy development and refinement. Systematic determination
of continued, correct and effective use and management is recommended so that
deficiencies in use and management can be identified and corrected by those respon-
sible.

5.3 Adequacy of supply
As the drinking-water supply surveillance agency has an interest in the population at
large, its interest extends beyond water quality in isolation to include all aspects of the
adequacy of drinking-water supply for the protection of public health.
     In undertaking an assessment of the adequacy of the drinking-water supply, the
following basic service parameters of a drinking-water supply should normally be
taken into consideration:
•   Quality: whether the supply has regularly verified water quality and an approved
    WSP (see chapter 4) that has been validated and is subject to periodic audit to
    demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations (see chapters 3 and 4);
•   Quantity (service level): the proportion of the population with access to different
    levels of drinking-water supply (e.g. no access, basic access, intermediate access
    and optimal access) as a surrogate for health impacts in relation to quantity of
    water used;
•   Accessibility: the percentage of the population that has reasonable access to an
    improved drinking-water supply;
•   Affordability: the tariff paid by domestic consumers;
•   Continuity: the percentage of the time during which drinking-water is available
    (daily, weekly and seasonally).

5.3.1 Quantity (service level)
The quantity of water collected and used by households has an important influence
on health. There is a basic human physiological requirement for water to maintain
adequate hydration and an additional requirement for food preparation. There is a
further requirement for water to support hygiene, which is necessary for health.
     Estimates of the volume of water needed for health purposes vary widely. In
deriving World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values, it is assumed that
the daily per capita consumption of drinking-water is approximately 2 litres for
adults, although actual consumption varies according to climate, activity level and
diet. Based on currently available data, a minimum volume of 7.5 litres per capita
per day will provide sufficient water for hydration and incorporation into food for
most people under most conditions. In addition, adequate domestic water is needed
for food preparation, laundry and personal and domestic hygiene, which are also
important for health. Water may also be important in income generation and amen-
ity uses.

     The quantities of water collected and used by households are primarily a func-
tion of the distance to the water supply or total collection time required. This broad-
ly equates to the level of service. Four levels of service can be defined, as shown in
Table 5.1.
     Service level is a useful and easily measured indicator that provides a valid sur-
rogate for the quantity of water collected by households and is the preferred indicator
for surveillance. Available evidence indicates that health gains accrue from improving
service level in two key stages: the delivery of water within 1 km or 30 minutes of to-
tal collection time; and when supplied to a yard level of service. Further health gains
are likely to occur once water is supplied through multiple taps, as this will increase
water availability for diverse hygiene practices. The volume of water collected may also
depend on the reliability and cost of the water. Therefore, collection of data on these
indicators is important.

5.3.2 Accessibility
From the public health standpoint, the proportion of the population with reliable ac-
cess to safe drinking-water is the most important single indicator of the overall success
of a drinking-water supply programme.
     There are a number of definitions of access (or coverage), many with qualifica-
tions regarding safety or adequacy. Access to safe drinking-water for the Millennium
Development Goals is currently measured by the WHO/ United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation
through a proxy that assesses the use of improved drinking-water sources by house-
holds. An improved drinking-water source is one that by the nature of its construction
and design adequately protects the source from outside contamination, in particular
by faecal matter. The underlying assumption is that improved sources are more likely
to supply safe drinking-water than unimproved sources. Improved and unimproved
water supply technologies are summarized below:
•      Improved drinking-water sources:
       —— piped water into dwelling, yard or plot
       —— public tap or standpipe
       —— tubewell or borehole
       —— protected dug well
       —— protected spring
       —— rainwater collection.
•      Unimproved drinking-water sources:
       —— unprotected dug well
       —— unprotected spring
       —— cart with small tank or drum provided by water vendor
       —— tanker truck provision of water
       —— surface water (river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal, irrigation channel)
       —— bottled water.1
      Determining the proportion of a population with reliable access to drinking-
water is an important function of a drinking-water surveillance agency. This task can
be facilitated by establishing a common defi nition for reasonable access, appropriate
to a local context, which may describe a minimum quantity of water supplies per
person per day together with a maximum tolerable distance/time to a source (e.g. 20
litres, and within 1 km/30 minutes, respectively, for basic access).

5.3.3 Affordability
The affordability of water has a significant influence on the use of water and selec-
tion of water sources. Households with the lowest levels of access to safe water supply
frequently pay more for their water than do households connected to a piped water
system. The high cost of water may force households to use alternative sources of
water of poorer quality that represent a greater risk to health. Furthermore, high costs

    Bottled water is considered to be improved only when the household uses drinking-water from an
    improved source for cooking and personal hygiene.


                                                 85
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


of water may reduce the volumes of water used by households, which in turn may
influence hygiene practices and increase risks of disease transmission.
     When assessing affordability, it is important to collect data on the price at the
point of purchase. Where households are connected to the drinking-water supplier,
this will be the tariff applied. Where water is purchased from public standpipes or
from neighbours, the price at the point of purchase may be very different from the
drinking-water supplier tariff. Many alternative water sources (notably vendors) also
involve costs, and these costs should be included in evaluations of affordability. In
addition to recurrent costs, the costs for initial acquisition of a connection should also
be considered when evaluating affordability.

5.3.4 Continuity
Interruptions to drinking-water supply, either because of intermittent sources or re-
sulting from engineering inefficiencies, are a major determinant of the access to and
quality of drinking-water. Analysis of data on continuity of supply requires the con-
sideration of several components. Continuity can be classified as follows:
•   year-round service from a reliable source with no interruption of flow at the tap
    or source;
•   year-round service with frequent (daily or weekly) interruptions, of which the
    most common causes are:
    —— restricted pumping regimes in pumped systems, whether planned or due to
         power failure or sporadic failure;
    —— peak demand exceeding the flow capacity of the transmission mains or the
         capacity of the reservoir;
    —— excessive leakage within the distribution system;
    —— excessive demands on community-managed point sources;
•   seasonal service variation resulting from source fluctuation, which typically has
    three causes:
    —— natural variation in source volume during the year;
    —— volume limitation because of competition with other uses, such as irriga-
         tion;
    —— periods of high turbidity when the source water may be untreatable;
•   compounded frequent and seasonal discontinuity.
     These classifications reflect broad categories of continuity, which are likely to affect
hygiene in different ways. Any interruption of service is likely to result in degradation of
water quality, increased risk of exposure to contaminated water and therefore increased
risk of waterborne disease. Daily or weekly discontinuity results in low supply pressure
and a consequent risk of in-pipe recontamination. Other consequences include reduced
availability and lower volume use, which adversely affect hygiene. Household water
storage may be necessary, and this may lead to an increase in the risk of contamination
during such storage and associated handling. Seasonal discontinuity often forces users
to obtain water from inferior and distant sources. As a consequence, in addition to the
obvious reduction in quality and quantity, time is lost in water collection.

5.4 Planning and implementation
For drinking-water supply surveillance to lead to improvements in drinking-water
supply, it is vital that the mechanisms for promoting improvement are recognized and
used.
     The focus of drinking-water supply-related improvement activities (whether these
are establishment of regional or national priorities, hygiene education programmes or
enforcement compliance) will depend on the nature of the drinking-water supplies
and the types of problems identified. A list of mechanisms for drinking-water supply
improvement based on the output of surveillance is given below:
•   Establishing national priorities: When the most common problems and shortcom-
    ings in the drinking-water system have been identified, national strategies can
    be formulated for improvements and remedial measures; these might include
    changes in training (of managers, administrators, engineers or field staff), rolling
    programmes for rehabilitation or improvement or changes in funding strategies
    to target specific needs.
•   Establishing subnational/regional priorities: Regional offices of drinking-water sup-
    ply agencies can decide in which communities to work and which remedial activities
    are priorities; public health criteria should be considered when priorities are set.
•   Establishing hygiene education programmes: Not all of the problems revealed by
    surveillance are technical in nature, and not all are solved by drinking-water sup-
    pliers; surveillance also looks at problems involving community and household
    supplies, water collection and transport and household treatment and storage.
    The solutions to many of these problems are likely to require educational and
    promotional activities.
•   Auditing of WSPs and upgrading: The information generated by surveillance can
    be used to audit WSPs and to assess whether these are in compliance. Drink-
    ing-water systems and their associated WSPs should be upgraded where they are
    found to be deficient, although feasibility must be considered, and enforcement
    of upgrading should be linked to strategies for progressive improvement.
•   Ensuring community operation and maintenance: Support should be provided by a
    designated authority to enable community members to be trained so that they are
    able to assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of community
    drinking-water supplies.
•   Establishing public awareness and information channels: Publication of informa-
    tion on public health aspects of drinking-water supplies, water quality and the
    performance of suppliers can encourage suppliers to follow good practices, mo-
    bilize public opinion and response and reduce the need for regulatory enforce-
    ment, which should be an option of last resort.
•   Implementing programmes for household water treatment and safe storage: If infor-
    mation from surveillance reveals no or only basic access to water service, as de-
    fined in Table 5.1, or unsafe supplied water, the implementation of programmes to
    promote household water treatment and safe storage may be advised to improve
    water quality and promote hygienic water management at the household level.
    These may be effective interim measures for provision of safer water supported
    by appropriate outreach, education and training activities and creating supply

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


    chains for appropriate household water treatment and safe storage technologies.
    Further information is available in section 7.3.2 and the 1997 volume, Surveil-
    lance and control of community supplies (WHO, 1997).
     In order to make best use of limited resources where surveillance is not yet prac-
tised, it is advisable to start with a basic programme that develops in a planned man-
ner. Activities in the early stages should generate enough useful data to demonstrate
the value of surveillance. Thereafter, the objective should be to progress to more ad-
vanced surveillance as resources and conditions permit.
     The activities normally undertaken in the initial, intermediate and advanced stages
of development of drinking-water supply surveillance are summarized as follows:
•   Initial phase:
    —— Establish requirements for institutional development.
    —— Provide training for staff involved in the programme.
    —— Define the role of participants (e.g. quality assurance/quality control by
         supplier, surveillance by public health authority).
    —— Develop methodologies suitable for the area.
    —— Commence routine surveillance in priority areas (including inventories).
    —— Limit verification to essential parameters and known problem substances.
    —— Establish reporting, filing and communication systems.
    —— Advocate improvements according to identified priorities.
    —— Establish reporting to local suppliers, communities, media and regional
         authorities.
    —— Establish liaison with communities; identify community roles in surveillance
         and means of promoting community participation.
•   Intermediate phase:
    —— Train staff involved in the programme.
    —— Establish and expand systematic routine surveillance.
    —— Expand access to analytical capability (often by means of regional laboratories,
         national laboratories being largely responsible for analytical quality control
         and training of regional laboratory staff).
    —— Undertake surveys for chemical contaminants using wider range of analytical
         methods.
    —— Evaluate all methodologies (sampling, analysis, etc.).
    —— Use appropriate standard methods (e.g. analytical methods, fieldwork
         procedures).
    —— Develop capacity for statistical analysis of data.
    —— Establish national database.
    —— Identify common problems and improve activities to address them at regional
         and national levels.
    —— Expand reporting to include interpretation at the national level.
    —— Draft or revise health-based targets as part of a framework for safe drinking-
         water.
    —— Use legal enforcement where necessary.
    —— Involve communities routinely in surveillance implementation.

                                     5. SURVEILLANCE


•   Advanced phase:
    —— Provide further or advanced training for staff involved in the programme.
    —— Establish routine surveillance for all health and acceptability parameters at
       defined frequencies.
    —— Use a full network of national, regional and local laboratories (including
       analytical quality control).
    —— Use national framework for drinking-water quality.
    —— Improve water services on the basis of national and local priorities, hygiene
       education and enforcement of standards.
    —— Establish regional database archives compatible with national database.
    —— Disseminate data at all levels (local, regional and national).
    —— Involve communities routinely in surveillance implementation.

5.5 Reporting and communicating
An essential element of a successful surveillance programme is the reporting of results
to stakeholders. It is important to establish appropriate systems of reporting to all
relevant bodies. Proper reporting and feedback will support the development of ef-
fective remedial strategies. The ability of the surveillance programme to identify and
advocate interventions to improve water supply is highly dependent on the ability to
analyse and present information in a meaningful way to different target audiences.
The target audiences for surveillance information will typically include:
•   public health officials at local, regional and national levels;
•   water suppliers;
•   local administrations;
•   communities and water users;
•   local, regional and national authorities responsible for development planning and
    investment.

5.5.1 Interaction with community and consumers
Community participation is a desirable component of surveillance, particularly for
community and household drinking-water supplies. As primary beneficiaries of im-
proved drinking-water supplies, com-
munity members have a right to take part
in decision-making. The community            The right of consumers to information on
                                             the safety of the water supplied to them for

upon for local knowledge and experi-
ence. They are the people who are likely
to first notice problems in the drinking-water supply and therefore can provide an
indication of when immediate remedial action is required. Communication strategies
should include:
•   provision of summary information to consumers (e.g. through annual reports or
    the Internet);
•   establishment and involvement of consumer associations at local, regional and
    national levels.

                                           89
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     In many communities, however, the simple right of access to information will not
ensure that individuals are aware of the quality or safety of the water supplied to them.
The agencies responsible for surveillance should develop strategies for disseminating
and explaining the significance of results obtained.
     It may not be feasible for the surveillance agency to provide feedback informa-
tion directly to the entire community. Thus, it may be appropriate to use community
organizations, where these exist, to provide an effective channel for providing feed-
back information to users. Some local organizations (e.g. local councils and com-
munity-based organizations, such as women’s groups, religious groups and schools)
have regular meetings in the communities that they serve and can therefore provide a
mechanism of relaying important information to a large number of people within the
community. Furthermore, by using local organizations, it is often easier to initiate a
process of discussion and decision-making within the community concerning water
quality. The most important element in working with local organizations is to ensure
that the organization selected can access the whole community and can initiate discus-
sion on the results of surveillance (see sections 7.6.1 and 8.7).

5.5.2 Regional use of data
Strategies for regional prioritization are typically of a medium-term nature and have
specific data requirements. While the management of information at a national level is
aimed at highlighting common or recurrent problems, the objective at a regional level
is to assign a degree of priority to individual interventions. It is therefore important
to derive a relative measure of health risk. Although this information cannot be used
on its own to determine which systems should be given immediate attention (which
would also require the analysis of economic, social, environmental and cultural fac-
tors), it provides an extremely important tool for determining regional priorities. It
should be a declared objective to ensure that remedial action is carried out each year
on a predetermined proportion of the systems classified as high risk.
     At the regional level, it is also important to monitor the improvement in (or de-
terioration of) both individual drinking-water supplies and the supplies as a whole.
In this context, simple measures, such as the mean sanitary inspection score of all
systems, the proportion of systems with given degrees of faecal contamination, the
population with different levels of service and the mean cost of domestic consump-
tion, should be calculated yearly and changes monitored.
     As shown in Table 7.10 in section 7.4, the aim should be to provide drinking-
water that contains no faecal indicator organisms, such as Escherichia coli. However, in
many developing and developed countries, a high proportion of household and small
community drinking-water systems, in particular, fail to meet requirements for water
safety, including the absence of E. coli. In such circumstances, it is important that
realistic goals for progressive improvement are agreed upon and implemented. It is
practical to classify water quality results in terms of an overall grading for water safety
linked to priority for action, as illustrated in Table 5.2.
     Grading schemes may be of particular use in community supplies where the
frequency of testing is low and reliance on analytical results alone is especially in-
appropriate. Such schemes will typically take account of both analytical findings

and results of the sanitary inspection through matrices such as the one illustrated
in Table 5.3.
     Combined analysis of sanitary inspection and water quality data can be used to
identify the most important causes of and control measures for contamination. This
is important to support effective and rational decision-making. For instance, it will
be important to know whether on-site or off-site sanitation could be associated with
contamination of drinking-water, as the remedial actions required to address either
source of contamination will be very different. This analysis may also identify other
factors associated with contamination, such as heavy rainfall. As the data will be non-
parametric, suitable methods for analysis include chi-square, odds ratios and logistic
regression models.
     Combined analysis of sanitary inspection and water quality data is especially use-
ful in assessing household water management systems. Microbial water quality data

consideration in assessing household water systems, their management and priority
for remedial actions. An example of a combined system to assess risk and prioritize
remedial actions for household water systems is shown in Table 5.4.

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


impact on a local or even subregional level. Nevertheless, it is expected that all types of
supply will be affected, including the specific circumstances discussed below.

6.1 Climate change, water scarcity and heavy rainfall
Regional or localized droughts and heavy precipitation events and floods have always
occurred, but they appear to be increasing in frequency, and greater extremes of cli-
mate should be expected. Anticipating and planning for these events, such that suf-
ficient quantities of safe water can be delivered to consumers without disruptions, are
not only key responsibilities of water suppliers, but a growing challenge. The effects of
these climate extremes on water quality and quantity will be especially acute in areas
with growing populations. In such areas, existing water supplies typically are already
stressed, and there is little, if any, water supply margin available to them in the event
of a major or extended duration weather event. This is especially true in regions with
desert-like climates, such as parts of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Australia and
the south-western United States of America.
     Over an extended period of time, climate change may foster greater extremes in
weather, including more frequent and longer spells with much higher peak temper-
atures, droughts, greater frequency of heavy precipitation and violent storms. Changes
in sea level from melting ice can affect coastal groundwater, causing salination, which
may also occur as a result of over-abstraction. With changes in water quantity come
changes in water quality: greater or lesser runoff affects the sediment loading, chem-
ical composition, total organic carbon content and microbial quality. These changes
require modifications in water storage capacity and water treatment to ensure safe
drinking-water. Changes in groundwater levels may also lead to altered mineral com-
position, and moves to deeper groundwater may tap into aquifers with high mineral
content or high levels of specific constituents of concern for health.
     To provide for adequate water quantity and quality in the event of these changes
and extremes, natural supplies may need to be augmented in some areas, together
with use of more climate-resilient technologies and processes. Water treatment sys-
tems may need to be upgraded and obtain greater storage capacity to be able to cope
with greater microbial, turbidity and chemical loadings. New sources of water may
need to be developed, such as recycled wastewater or desalinated brackish water or
seawater, and new strategies may need to be implemented, such as aquifer storage and
recovery.

6.2 Rainwater harvesting
Rainwater harvesting is widely practised at a household level but is increasingly be-
ing used on a larger community scale. Rainwater can provide an important source of
drinking-water in some circumstances as well as a useful source of water for blending
with other sources to reduce the levels of contaminants of health concern, such as
arsenic and fluoride.
      The development of formal WSPs at the household level may not always be prac-
tical, but promotion of sanitary inspection with simple good practice is important.
Well-designed rainwater harvesting systems with clean catchments, covered cisterns


                                            94
                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


and storage tanks, and treatment, as appropriate, supported by good hygiene at point
of use, can offer drinking-water with very low health risk.
      Rainwater is initially relatively free from impurities, except those picked up by the
rain from the atmosphere. However, the quality of rainwater may subsequently deteri-
orate during harvesting, storage and household use. Wind-blown dirt, leaves, faecal
droppings from birds and other animals, insects and litter on the catchment areas,
such as roofs and in cisterns, can contaminate rainwater, as can particles from the
atmosphere, such as soot from burning materials such as old tyres. Regular cleaning of
catchment surfaces and gutters should be undertaken to minimize the accumulation
of debris. Wire meshes or inlet filters should be placed over the top of downpipes to
prevent leaves and other debris from entering storage containers and cleaned regularly
to prevent clogging.
      Materials used in the catchment and storage tank should be approved for use in
contact with drinking-water and should not leach contaminants or cause taste, odour
or discoloration. As rainwater is slightly acidic and very low in dissolved minerals, it
can dissolve metals and other impurities from materials of the catchment and stor-
age tank, resulting in unacceptably high concentrations of contaminants in the water.
Most solid roof materials are suitable for collecting rainwater, but roofs with bitumen-
based coatings are generally not recommended, as they may leach hazardous substan-
ces or cause taste problems. Care should be taken to ensure that lead-based paints are
not used on roof catchments. Thatched roofs can cause discoloration or deposition of
particles in collected water.
      Poor hygiene in water storage and abstraction from storage containers or at the
point of use can also represent a health concern, but risks can be minimized by good
design and practice. Faecal contamination is quite common, particularly in samples
collected shortly after rainfall, but can be minimized by good practice. Higher mi-
crobial concentrations are generally found in the first flush of rainwater, decreasing as
the rain continues; therefore, microbial contamination is less in rainy seasons when
catchments are frequently washed with fresh rainwater. A system to divert the contam-
inated first flow of rainwater from roof surfaces is necessary, and automatic devices
that prevent the first flush of runoff from being collected in storage are recommended.
If diverters are not available, a detachable downpipe can be used manually to provide
the same result.
      Storage tanks can present breeding sites for mosquitoes, including species that
transmit dengue virus (see section 8.6). Covers discourage mosquito breeding and
help to prevent faecal contaminants and sunlight, which will promote algal growth,
from reaching the water. Covers should be fitted, and openings need to be protected
by mosquito-proof mesh. Cracks in the tank can result in contamination of stored
water, whereas water withdrawal using contaminated containers is a potential cause
of both faecal and chemical contamination. Storage containers should preferably be
fitted with a mechanism such as a tap or outlet pipe that enables hygienic abstraction
of water.
      Further treatment at the point of consumption may be applied to ensure better
quality of drinking-water and reduce health risk. Solar water disinfection and point-
of-use chlorination are examples of low-cost disinfection options for the treatment


                                            95
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


of stored rainwater. These and other household water treatment technologies are dis-
cussed in more detail in sections 7.3.2 (microbial) and 8.4.4 (chemical).

6.3 Vended water
Vended water is common in many parts of the world where scarcity of supplies or lack
of infrastructure limits access to suitable quantities of safe drinking-water. Although
water vending is more common in developing countries, it also occurs in developed
countries.
     In the context of these Guidelines, water vending implies private vending of
drinking-water, but does not include bottled or packaged water (which is considered
in section 6.14) or water sold in bottles through vending machines.
     Water vending may be undertaken by formal bodies, such as water utilities or
registered associations, by contracted suppliers or by informal and independent sup-
pliers. Where formal vending is practised, the water typically comes from treated util-
ity supplies or registered sources and is supplied in tankers or from standpipes and
water kiosks. Informal suppliers tend to use a range of sources, including untreated
surface water, dug wells and boreholes, and deliver small volumes for domestic use,
often in containers loaded onto small carts or tanker trucks.
     Both the quality and adequacy of vended supplies can vary significantly, and
vended water has been associated with outbreaks of diarrhoeal disease (Hutin, Luby
& Paquet, 2003). Water supplied to users should be suitable for drinking and comply
with national or regional guidelines and regulatory requirements. The chemical and
microbial quality of untreated or private sources of water should be tested to deter-
mine their suitability for use and to identify appropriate control measures, including
treatment requirements. Surface water and some dug well and borehole waters are not
suitable for drinking without treatment; disinfection is the minimum requirement,
and filtration is often required when surface water is used.
     In many developing countries, consumers purchase water from kiosks and then
carry the water home in a variety of containers of varying size. Measures should be
taken to protect vended water from contamination during transport as well as storage
in the home, including transporting and storing water in containers that are clean,
free from both faecal and chemical contamination and either enclosed or with narrow
openings, ideally fitted with a dispensing device such as a spigot that prevents hand
access and other sources of extraneous contamination. Good hygiene is required and
should be supported by educational programmes.
     In other cases, particularly in developed countries, vendors transport and deliver
the water to users in tanker trucks. If large volumes are being transported, the addition
of chlorine to provide a free residual concentration of at least 0.5 mg/l at the point of
delivery to users is desirable. Tankers should also be used solely for water or, if this is
not possible, should be thoroughly cleaned prior to use.
     All components of systems associated with supplying and delivering vended
water need to be designed and operated in a manner that protects water quality. Water
storage containers, pipework and fittings should not include defects such as structural
faults that allow leakage and permit the entry of contaminants. Cleanliness of storage
containers, standpipes, taps and hoses needs to be maintained. Hoses used to transfer

                                            96
                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


water at kiosks or used on carts and tanker trucks should be protected from contam-
ination (e.g. by preventing contact of the ends with the ground) and drained when
not in use. The area around standpipes should include drainage or be constructed in
a manner to prevent pooling of water. Materials used in all components, including
pipework, containers and hoses, need to be suitable for use in contact with drinking-
water and should not result in contamination of the water with hazardous chemicals
or with substances that could adversely affect its taste.
     All components of water vending, including sources, methods of abstraction and
transport, should be incorporated into a WSP. Where vendors are registered or have
a contract with a water utility, implementation and operation of the WSP should be
regularly checked by the utility. WSPs and the operation of water vendors should also
be subject to independent surveillance.

6.4 Bulk water supply
Bulk water supplies can be either untreated or treated water, but usually there is lim-
ited or no choice in the provision of such supplies. They may be provided where one
agency or company controls a large raw water source, usually surface water, and pro-
vides water to one or several other water suppliers. Bulk water supplies can be deliv-
ered by pipeline or tanker or using ships or fleets of road or rail tankers.
     In all cases, it is important that the bulk supply is incorporated into the WSP of
the receiving supply and treated as another source. Where bulk supplies of treated
water have been used to provide support during a drought or emergency, it is vital that
the receiving supplier takes steps to ensure that the water is safe before it is introduced
into the receiving distribution system. At all stages, it is important that there is close
communication between all parties involved and that the procedures and require-
ments are documented, understood and carried out with appropriate monitoring and
verification.
     The potential hazards from bulk water are similar to those from any water supply,
but there are additional sources of contamination, such as inappropriate containers
and materials and lack of sanitation and hygiene at bulk water filling connections or
transfer points. Pipelines may be vulnerable to contamination along the transmis-
sion route, particularly if there is the potential for unapproved connections into the
system.
     Many of the requirements for bulk supply are the same as for any piped supply,
such as using approved materials that will not adversely affect water quality. Where
tankers are used, these should be of a suitable material and be clean and free from
microbial and chemical contamination. To minimize contamination during filling of
bulk water containers or water tankers and charging of water transmission pipelines,
sanitary inspections and maintenance of sanitary conditions for water filling stations
are necessary. These sites should have proper drainage to avoid standing water and
flooding, should not be exposed to sources of contamination and should be secure,
with access restricted to authorized personnel. At water filling and delivery points,
nozzles and couplings should be protected from sources of contamination, including
animals. Installation of protective coverings for filling and receiving connectors would
help in this respect. Some plastic pipe materials are permeable to organic chemicals,

                                            97
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


and transfer of substances such as petroleum hydrocarbons could diminish the struc-
tural integrity of the pipe materials or render the water unpalatable to consumers.
Such piping is most likely to be found in transfer hoses, so the cleanliness of the trans-
fer points where tankers are used is vital, as is protection of the transfer area from spills
of petroleum fuels.
     Implementation of security measures to guard against intentional contamination
and theft may also be warranted.

6.5 Desalination systems
Desalination is used to remove salts from brackish or saline surface water and ground-
water in order to render it acceptable for human consumption or other uses. It is
increasing employed to provide drinking-water because of a growing scarcity of
fresh water driven by population growth, overexploitation of water resources and cli-
mate change. Desalination facilities exist all over the world, particularly in the eastern
Mediterranean region, with use increasing on all continents. Small-scale desalination
is used to supply fresh water on ships and to provide additional fresh water in some
hot and arid regions.
     These Guidelines are fully applicable to desalinated water supply systems; how-
ever, desalination presents certain differences in emphasis, as summarized below.
     Desalinated water has a very low total organic carbon content and low disinfect-
ant demand, so disinfection by-products are generally of little concern, although bro-
minated organics may occur owing to the presence of bromide in seawater. Membrane
and distillation desalination processes are very efficient at removing higher molecular
weight organic chemicals and virtually all inorganic chemicals, and volatile organic
compounds are vented during thermal desalination processes. Where membranes are
used, boron and some smaller molecular weight organic substances may not be exclud-
ed, so it is important to establish the membrane capability. Because of the apparently
high effectiveness of some of the processes used (especially distillation and reverse os-
mosis) in removing both microorganisms and chemical constituents, these processes
may be employed as single-stage treatments or combined with only a low level of
residual disinfectant. For further information, see the supporting document Water
treatment and pathogen control (Annex 1). Pretreatment is largely in place to protect
the desalination process, but it will also remove certain hazards present in brackish or
saline waters.
     Water produced by desalination is low in minerals and usually aggressive towards
materials with which it comes into contact, such as materials used for distribution pipes,
storage and plumbing. During post-treatment, the water must be stabilized or remin-
eralized prior to distribution to reduce its corrosive nature. Stabilization is commonly
achieved by adding chemical constituents such as calcium and magnesium carbonate
along with pH adjustment or through blending with small volumes of mineral-rich wat-
ers. Seawater and spent seawater that has undergone electrolysis to form hypochlorite
have been used for this purpose, but the latter practice has essentially ended because of
the formation of bromate in the distributed water. Blending waters should be pretreated
to ensure their microbial safety, because the post-desalination residual disinfectant level
may be insufficient to control pathogens present in the blending water.

                                             98
                6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


     Desalinated water contains lower than usual concentrations of dissolved solids
and essential elements such as calcium and magnesium, which are commonly found
in water (see the supporting document Calcium and magnesium in drinking-water;
Annex 1). Drinking-water typically contributes a small proportion to the recom-
mended daily intake of essential elements, with most of the intake occurring through
food. Fluoride would also be missing from desalinated water unless it were added
prior to distribution, which may be considered by countries in which sugar consump-
tion is high (WHO, 2005b).
     High temperatures of distributed water in warm climate areas and difficulty in
maintaining disinfectant residuals during transport over long distances may lead to
microbial aftergrowth, depending on nutrient availability. Although such growth is
likely to be without health significance (see the supporting document Heterotrophic
plate counts and drinking-water safety; Annex 1), it can contribute to problems of ac-
ceptability. The use of chloramines constitutes an advantageous alternative to free
chlorine in distribution systems with long residence times and elevated temperatures,
although nitrite formation by organisms in biofilms needs to be considered where
chloramination is practised and excess ammonia is present.
     Extensive information on desalination for safe drinking-water supply is available
in the book Desalination technology: Health and environmental impacts (Cotruvo et al.,
2010) and the supporting document Safe drinking-water from desalination (Annex 1).

6.6 Dual piped water supply systems
In some locations, households and buildings served with a piped drinking-water sup-
ply may also receive piped water from an alternative source for non-potable purposes,
creating a dual piped water supply system. The alternative water source is usually pro-
vided to reduce the use of high-quality water resources for non-potable uses (e.g. toi-
lets, washing clothes, irrigation) or simply to conserve scarce water resources.
      Non-potable piped supplies can potentially introduce health hazards, commonly
through accidental cross-connections between potable and non-potable piped sup-
plies. Measures to control health risks from dual piped supply systems include:
•   use of good design practices that prevent cross-connections;
•   unambiguous labelling of both systems to ensure that the non-potable supply is
    not mistaken for the potable supply;
•   installation of the non-potable piped system only by qualified plumbers;
•   regulation of non-potable piped systems by the authority responsible for drink-
    ing-water surveillance;
•   public communication about the potential health risks from exposure to non-
    potable water through cross-connections and the dangers of modifying systems
    by inexperienced and non-certified individuals.
     Increasingly in developed countries, dual systems are being installed at a house-
hold level or in public buildings. Guidance should be provided on installation, par-
ticularly where this is by non-certified individuals. Potable water supplied into the
building should be fitted with a non-return valve in order to prevent backflow into
the public water supply.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


6.7 Emergencies and disasters
Safe drinking-water is one of the most important public health requirements in most
emergencies and disasters, along with adequate sanitation. The greatest waterborne
risk to health comes from the transmission of faecal pathogens as a result of inadequate
sanitation, hygiene and protection of drinking-water sources. Some disasters, includ-
ing those caused by or involving damage to chemical or nuclear industrial installations,
spillage in transport or volcanic activity, may result in contamination by chemical or
radiological hazards of concern. The circumstances of most large-scale emergencies
will vary, and each will present its own peculiar problems and challenges.
      Where a number of agencies are involved in disaster relief or overseeing an emer-
gency, it is vital that there is good communication between the agencies and coordina-
tion of their activities. It is also important that the overall coordinators take advice
from the experts in a particular field, such as water supply and sanitation. This sec-
tion considers primarily large-scale disasters and emergencies, although much of the
information will apply to smaller-scale emergencies as well. For microbiological and
chemical emergencies on a smaller scale in piped supplies, the relevant sections in
chapters 7 and 8 should be consulted.
      When people are displaced by conflict and natural disaster, they may move to an
area where unprotected water sources are contaminated. When population density is
high and sanitation is inadequate, unprotected water sources in and around the tem-
porary settlement are highly likely to become contaminated. A displaced population
with low immunity due to malnutrition as a consequence of food shortages or the
burden of other diseases is at an increased risk of an outbreak of waterborne disease.
      Emergency planning initiatives should include three phases:
1)   vulnerability assessments (which should be part of a WSP for any large supply) to
     identify the critical elements of the existing systems that, if compromised, would
     result in major disruption of basic services;
2)   mitigation plans to identify feasible actions to prevent or reduce the disruptive
     effects related to the loss of the vulnerable elements or facilities;
3)   emergency preparedness plans to facilitate managing the crisis and the restora-
     tion of service should disruptions occur.
The key is to anticipate probable events, have plans in place, prepare to respond when
needed, have backup materials and facilities and have conducted simulations so that
the organization and its staff will be effective in the event of an emergency.
     Available sources of water are limited in most emergency situations, and pro-
viding a sufficient quantity of water for personal and domestic hygiene as well as
for drinking and cooking is important. National drinking-water quality standards
should therefore be flexible, taking into consideration the risks and benefits to
health in the short and long term, and should not excessively restrict water avail-
ability for hygiene, as this would often result in an increased overall risk of disease
transmission.
     There are a number of factors to take into consideration when providing drinking-
water for a population affected by a disaster, including the following:


                                          100
                6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


•   The quantity of water available and the reliability of supply: These are likely to
    be the overriding concerns in most emergency situations, as it is usually easier
    to improve water quality than to increase its availability or to move the affected
    population closer to another water source.
•   The equitability of access to water: Even if sufficient water is available to meet min-
    imum needs, additional measures may be needed to ensure that access is equi-
    table. Unless water points are sufficiently close to their dwellings, people will not
    be able to collect enough water for their needs. Water may need to be rationed to
    ensure that everyone’s basic needs are met.
•   Protecting the water source against contamination: This should always be a prior-
    ity in emergencies, whether or not disinfection of the water supply is considered
    necessary.
•   The need for disinfection: Disinfection, maintaining an adequate disinfectant re-
    sidual and, where necessary, pretreatment to reduce turbidity to as low as feasible
    in order to ensure the efficiency of disinfection are essential components in en-
    suring a safe drinking-water supply. The information in Table 6.1 in section 6.11,
    on drinking-water disinfection methods that can be used by travellers, may be
    applied to temporary uses in emergency situations.
•   Longer-term planning for continuing emergency situations: When the first phase
    of an emergency or disaster is over and the cleanup is in progress, consideration
    needs to be given to the longer-term provision of safe water and sanitation. In this
    case, pre-planning can be invaluable.
•   Acceptability: It is important to ensure that drinking-water provided in emergen-
    cies is acceptable to the consumers in terms of taste, odour and appearance, or the
    consumers may resort to water from unprotected or untreated supplies.
•   The need for containers to collect and store water: Containers that are hygienic and
    appropriate to local needs and habits are needed for the collection and storage of
    water to be used for washing, cooking and bathing.
•   The availability of bottled or packaged water: Provision of bottled or packaged
    water from a reliable source is often an effective way to quickly provide safe, pot-
    able water in emergencies and disasters. Brewers and soft drink producers, if they
    are part of the emergency response plan, are often capable of converting their
    processes to produce bottled or packaged water in emergencies. This is particu-
    larly valuable if they have water treatment plants for ensuring the quality of water
    used as an ingredient in their processes.
     In many emergency situations, water is collected from central water collection
points, stored in containers and then transferred to cooking and drinking vessels by
the affected people. It is important that people be aware of the risks to health from
contamination of water from the point of collection to the moment of consumption
and have the means to reduce or eliminate these risks. Detailed information may be
found in Wisner & Adams (2003).
     Water quality should be monitored during emergencies, including sanitary in-
spection and microbial water sampling and analysis; monitoring of water treatment
processes, including disinfection; monitoring of water quality at all water collection


                                           101
                6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


points and in a sample of homes; and water quality assessment in the investigation of
disease outbreaks or the evaluation of hygiene promotion activities, as required.




                                          101a
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Monitoring and reporting systems should be designed and managed to ensure
that action is swiftly taken to protect health. Health information should also be mon-
itored to ensure that water quality can be rapidly investigated when it is suspected of
contributing to a health problem and treatment processes, particularly disinfection,
can be modified as required.
     Where large numbers of water samples need testing or analysis of a broad range
of parameters is of interest, laboratory analysis is usually most appropriate. If the
drinking-water supplier’s laboratories or laboratories at environmental health offices
and universities no longer function because of the disaster, a temporary laboratory
may need to be set up. Where samples are transported to laboratories, appropriate
handling is important to ensure meaningful results. Portable testing kits allow the
determination in the field of key water quality parameters, such as thermotolerant
coliform count, free residual chlorine, pH, turbidity and filterability.
     Workers should be trained in the correct procedures for collecting, labelling,
packing and transporting samples and in supplying supporting information from
the sanitary survey to help interpret laboratory results. For guidance on methods of
water sampling and testing, see Bartram & Ballance (1996), WHO (1997) and APHA,
AWWA & WEF (2005).

6.8 Temporary water supplies
A number of waterborne disease outbreaks have occurred as a result of poor manage-
ment and design of temporary water supplies, which are distributed water supplies for
planned seasonal or time-limited events (e.g. festivals, markets and summer camps).
Water supplies for holiday towns are not covered, because they are permanent sup-
plies, although substantial seasonal variations in demand bring specific problems.
     A systematic approach to drinking-water safety, including adequate quantity and
quality, is needed for temporary water supplies. A WSP is an essential requirement in
identifying the hazards and risks and developing good management procedures to
deal with them. Chapter 4 and other sections in chapter 6 provide additional useful
information. Where water is supplied through tankers, the requirements are the same
as for vended water (section 6.3) and bulk water supplies (section 6.4).
     A temporary water supply may be independent (i.e. not connected to any other
water supply system and with its own facilities from source to tap) or dependent (i.e.
receiving treated water from an existing water supply system but with independent
distribution facilities). The risk of drinking-water contamination is usually lower in
dependent systems, provided there is access to the technologies, expertise and man-
agement of the permanent system. A contract is often made between the organizer
of an event (e.g. a festival) and a water supply entity, which should include the water
quantity and quality supplied by the entity, the roles and responsibilities of each party
in water quality management, the locations and frequency of water quality monitor-
ing, sanitary inspection and surveillance by a health authority and the provision of
adequate and properly sited sanitation. Coordination between an event organizer, a
water supply entity and the relevant health authority is very important for ensuring
drinking-water safety.


                                          102
                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


      Temporary water supply systems can vary substantially in terms of their scale, per-
iod of operation, water use and fluctuations in demand, and these variations should
be taken into consideration during the planning and design stages. In the case of an
independent system, adequate consideration should also be given to the selection of
a water source in terms of quantity, quality and treatment processes, and care should
be taken not to adversely affect any other supply or water source. Where a temporary
system is directly connected to a mains water supply, it is important to prevent the
accidental contamination of the mains water supply through backflow during con-
struction and operation of the temporary system. Water consumption for firefighting,
hand washing and toilet flushing should be taken into account in estimating total and
predictable variations in water demand where there are no other water sources avail-
able for such purposes.
      Water quality targets for temporary supplies should be the same as those for
permanent water supplies. Disinfection should be considered indispensable in a tem-
porary supply, and it is preferable to maintain a certain level of disinfectant (e.g. chlor-
ine) residual at service taps. If the supply is not for potable uses, appropriate action
should be taken to ensure that it is not used for drinking.
      If a temporary water supply is used recurrently, it is essential to fully flush the
entire system with water containing a higher than normal disinfectant residual before
restarting. When planning installation on site, positioning of pipes, hoses and con-
nections should take risks of contamination into account—for example, by avoid-
ing the placement of hosing and fittings on the ground near sites of potential faecal
contamination or storage tanks in direct sunlight where rising temperatures support
microbial growth. It is also important to ensure that the facility has no defects, includ-
ing leakage, that could cause the deterioration of water quality and that water quality
at every service tap satisfies the required quality target. Important control measures
during dismantling and transport of installations include emptying hoses, preferably
drying them and storing them so that ingress of contamination is avoided. In all cases,
the materials should be approved for use in contact with potable water.
      Care should be taken in planning and designing wastewater management and
disposal facilities, particularly to ensure that lavatories and disposal facilities are lo-
cated so as to avoid any risk of adversely affecting source water quality or stored water.
It is also important to prevent runoff from other areas, such as livestock pens, from
entering the source. The source, treatment facilities and distribution reservoirs should
be well protected from access by animals (e.g. bird faeces) and humans by covers or
roofs.
      A temporary system is usually more vulnerable to accidental and deliberate con-
tamination than an existing permanent water supply system, and attention needs to
be paid to security. All water treatment facilities should be thoroughly inspected at
least every day. All of these procedures and requirements should be included in the
operational management documents that are at the core of the WSP.
      Signs are an important part of ensuring that water from taps is used appro-
priately and the protection of water sources and drinking-water infrastructure. The
signs should be easily understood and used in conjunction with other barriers, such
as fences.

                                  GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


      Water quality and appearance should be routinely monitored at the service taps
of a temporary water supply system. At the very least, water temperature and disinfect-
ant residual should be monitored every day as simple rapid tests that act as indicators
of possible problems. Other basic parameters that should be regularly monitored, if
possible, include pH, conductivity, turbidity, colour and Escherichia coli (or, alterna-
tively, thermotolerant coliforms). Routine sanitary inspection of a temporary water
supply by the appropriate health authority is very important. If any problem related to
water quality arises, remedial actions that are included in the management documents
supporting the WSP should be taken promptly. If a temporary water supply system is
to be used for a period of more than a few weeks, regular surveillance by the appropri-
ate health authority should be implemented.

6.9 Buildings1
Drinking-water systems in buildings can be a significant source of contamination, and
poor management of these systems has contributed to outbreaks of disease and illness.
One of the challenges in ensuring water safety is that responsibility for many actions
essential to the control of drinking-water quality in buildings is often outside the man-
date of the drinking-water supplier. Roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders
relating to the safe management of drinking-water systems within buildings can be
influenced by a number of factors, including ownership of assets and rights of access.
WSPs established for management of public water supplies are not typically extended
to buildings, although the water supplier WSP may include a number of initiatives to
ensure that backflow prevention is in place or to provide information to consumers on
protecting their own water quality. In many cases, owners, managers or maintenance
personnel are responsible for managing building water supplies, but awareness and
application of drinking-water guidelines are often limited, and so educational sup-
porting programmes may be required.
     The design of water networks in buildings is variable, as influenced by the divers-
ity of building types (e.g. schools, child-care facilities, residential buildings, hotels,
sports facilities, factories, office blocks, museums, transport terminals), designs and
water uses. Drinking-water systems in buildings are typically divided into hot and cold
water networks and may be connected to water-based devices (e.g. cooling towers,
boilers, swimming pools) or point-of-use equipment (e.g. washing machines).
     General drinking-water safety is ensured by good management practices, includ-
ing sound design, routine maintenance protocols, regular cleaning, temperature man-
agement and flow management (avoidance of stagnation). These practices should be
incorporated in WSPs developed by building owners or managers. WSPs for buildings
should address cold and hot drinking-water networks and consider water-based de-
vices and point-of-use equipment. Regulatory or other appropriate authorities may
provide guidance on the development and application of WSPs for drinking-water
systems in buildings.

    Hospitals, nursing care homes and other health-care facilities are discussed in section 6.10.


                                                       104
                6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


      The regulator can specify compliance requirements for buildings in general or
for specific types of buildings based on the level of risk. Schools, hotels and some
other large buildings are high-risk environments because of both the complex nature
of their drinking-water systems and the vulnerability of some users, occupants and
visitors, and heightened vigilance in terms of operational monitoring, validation of
control measures and verification is generally justified. Compliance may require that
maintenance and monitoring programmes be carried out through a building-specific
WSP. It may be appropriate to display maintenance and monitoring programmes and
certification of compliance at a conspicuous location within the building. Compliance
could be verified and certified by an independent auditor.
      The principal hazard that may threaten drinking-water systems of buildings is
ingress of contamination from external water supplies or through faults in the distri-
bution system (including storage tanks). Unapproved and inappropriate fittings and
materials can lead to the release of chemical substances from tanks, piping, jointing
and plumbing materials. The release may vary with the age of the material and the
contact period; for example, first-draw water contains higher concentrations of lead or
copper. Cross-connections with chemical storage containers, backflow from point-of-
use equipment and cross-connections with non-potable supplies can lead to a range of
contaminants entering drinking-water.
      Where water is supplied directly to equipment in buildings, the potential for
backflow into the mains network exists. This may be driven by high pressures gener-
ated in equipment connected to mains water supplies or by low pressures in the mains,
but it can be prevented by fitting appropriate backflow prevention devices.
      An additional problem not directly related to drinking-water is microbial growth
(e.g. Legionella) on surfaces and in water-based devices that may lead to an inhalation
hazard from spray droplets. Growth of such bacteria can be controlled through basic
measures (e.g. maintaining water outside the range at which Legionella proliferate, i.e.
> 50 °C for hot water and < 25 °C for cold water, or maintaining a suitable disinfectant
residual). Poor temperature control can occur in cold water systems through inad-
equate insulation and separation from hot water systems and in hot water systems in
heating devices and storage containers, inappropriate location of tempering devices,
long branch mains and dead ends (i.e. lengths of pipe, closed at one end, through
which no water passes). In large buildings, there is increased potential for growth of
Legionella in long water distribution systems, and maintenance of these systems needs
particular attention. For further information on Legionella in drinking-water, see sec-
tion 11.1 and the supporting document Legionella and the prevention of legionellosis
(Annex 1).
      Effective assessment of potential health hazards and risks requires documenta-
tion of the physical structure of water systems in buildings. This should be kept up
to date and include hot and cold water networks, including materials used; point-of-
entry treatment; point-of-use treatment, equipment and systems (e.g. for firefight-
ing) connected to the drinking-water supply; and water-based devices supplied by the
drinking-water system.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     In undertaking an assessment of the building’s distribution system, a range of
specific issues must be taken into consideration that relate to ingress, introduction and
proliferation of contaminants, including:
•   the quality and management of external supplies;
•   use of independent water supplies;
•   intermittent supplies;
•   pressure of water within the system;
•   temperature of water (in both cold and hot water systems);
•   integrity of storage tanks;
•   areas subject to intermittent or seasonal use (e.g. hotels with seasonal occupancy,
    schools);
•   cross-connections, especially in mixed systems;
•   backflow prevention;
•   system design to minimize dead/blind ends and other areas of potential stagna-
    tion;
•   the use of materials and coatings approved for use with drinking-water.
     The aim of a distribution system within a large building is to supply safe drink-
ing-water at adequate pressure and flow. The quality of water entering building sup-
plies will be ensured by a water utility or by the installation of point-of-entry devices
typically managed by the building owner or operator. To maintain drinking-water
quality, it is important to minimize transit times, low flows and low pressures.
     Procedures should be established for repairs, renovations or extensions of systems
to ensure that water safety is maintained, and all work, including changes to water sys-
tems, should be documented. Following work on the system, it would be appropriate
to disinfect and flush.
     Monitoring should focus on ensuring that control measures are working effect-
ively. Where possible, this should include monitoring by maintenance personnel using
field kits for parameters such as temperature, pH and disinfectant residuals. The fre-
quency will vary depending on the size and use of the building, but it should be weekly
in large buildings. Monitoring of drinking-water quality will be more frequent when
the building is new or recently commissioned.
     Independent surveillance is a desirable element in ensuring continued water safe-
ty within buildings and should be undertaken by the relevant health agency or other
independent authority.
     To ensure the safety of drinking-water within buildings, supportive activities of
national regulatory agencies include:
•   specific attention to application of codes of good practice (e.g. at commissioning
    and in contracting construction and rehabilitation);
•   suitable education and training programmes for building owners and managers,
    engineers, plumbers and operators of water-based devices (e.g. cooling towers
    and evaporative condensers);
•   regulation of the plumbing community and use of certified professionals;
•   effective certification and use of materials and devices in the marketplace;
•   codes of practice for design and operation of water-based devices;

                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


   For further guidance, see the supporting document Water safety in buildings
(Annex 1).

6.10 Health-care facilities
Health-care facilities include hospitals, health centres and hospices, residential care,
dental surgeries and dialysis units. Drinking-water in such facilities should be suit-
able for human consumption and for all usual domestic purposes, including personal
hygiene. However, it may not be suitable for all uses or for some patients, and further
processing or treatment or other safeguards may be required.
     Although microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacteria,
Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and Aspergillus species do not appear to represent a health
concern through water consumption by the general population, including most pa-
tients in health-care facilities, they may be of concern for severely immunosuppressed
persons, such as those with neutrophil counts below 500 per microlitre (see the sup-
porting document Heterotrophic plate counts and drinking-water safety; Annex 1).
Some of these microorganisms also have the potential to cause infections if drinking-
water is used to wash burns or medical devices such as endoscopes and catheters.
Water used for such purposes may require additional processing, such as microfiltra-
tion or sterilization, depending on use.
     Health-care facilities may include environments that support the proliferation and
dissemination of Legionella (see section 11.1 and the supporting document Legionella
and the prevention of legionellosis; Annex 1). Some equipment, such as water-cooled
high-speed drills in dental surgeries, is of particular concern for both inhalation of
droplets and infection of wounds.
     Renal dialysis requires large volumes of water that is of higher quality than
drinking-water. Water used for dialysis requires special processing to minimize the
presence of microorganisms, endotoxins, toxins and chemical contaminants. There
are special requirements regarding aluminium, which, in the past, has caused dialysis
dementia, and dialysis patients are also sensitive to chloramines, which needs to be
considered when chloramination is used to disinfect drinking-water supplies, particu-
larly in areas where there are home dialysis patients.
     All health-care facilities should have specific WSPs as part of their infection con-
trol programme. These plans should address issues such as water quality and treatment
requirements, cleaning of specialized equipment and control of microbial growth in
water systems and ancillary equipment.

6.11 Safe drinking-water for travellers
The most common sources of exposure to disease-causing organisms for travellers
are contaminated drinking-water and food that has been washed with contaminated
water. Diarrhoea is the most common symptom of waterborne infection, affecting
20–50% of all travellers or about 10 million people per year. Cases can occur even
among people staying in high-quality resorts and hotels. In some parts of the world,
tap or bottled water that has not been produced under proper conditions may not be
safe, even if it is clear and colourless.


                                            107
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


    No vaccine is capable of conferring general protection against infectious diar-
rhoea, which is caused by many different pathogens. It is important that travellers be
aware of the possibility of illness and take appropriate steps to minimize the risks. Pre-
ventive measures while living or travelling in areas with questionable drinking-water
quality include the following:
•   Drink only bottled water or other beverages (carbonated beverages, pasteurized
    juices and milk) provided in sealed tamper-proof containers and bottled/canned
    by known manufacturers (preferably certified by responsible authorities). Hotel
    personnel or local hosts are often good sources of information about which local
    brands are safe.
•   Drink water that has been treated effectively at point of use (e.g. through boiling,
    filtration or chemical disinfection) and stored in clean containers.
•   Drink hot beverages such as coffee and tea that are made with boiled water and
    are kept hot and stored in clean containers.
•   Avoid brushing teeth with unsafe water.
•   Do not use ice unless it has been made from safe water.
•   Avoid salads or other uncooked foods that may have been washed or prepared
    with unsafe water.
      Water can be treated in small quantities by travellers to significantly improve its
safety. Numerous simple treatment approaches and commercially available technolo-
gies are available to travellers to disinfect drinking-water for single-person or family
use. Travellers should select a water treatment approach that removes or inactivates all
classes of pathogens. Technologies should be certified by a credible organization, and
manufacturers’ instructions should be followed carefully.
      Bringing water to a rolling boil is the simplest and most effective way to kill all
disease-causing pathogens, even in turbid water and at high altitudes. The hot water
should be allowed to cool without the addition of ice. If the water is turbid and needs
to be clarified for aesthetic reasons, this should be done before boiling.
      If it is not possible to boil water, chemical disinfection of clear, non-turbid water
is effective for killing bacteria and most viruses and some protozoa (but not, for ex-
ample, Cryptosporidium oocysts). Certain chlorine-based or iodine-based compounds
are most widely used for disinfection of drinking-water by travellers. Following chlor-
ination or iodination, an activated carbon (charcoal) filter may be used to remove
excess taste and odour from the water. The use of iodine is not recommended for long-
term use by infants, pregnant women, those with a history of thyroid disease and those
with known hypersensitivity to iodine unless treatment includes an effective post-
disinfection iodine removal device (e.g. activated carbon). Travellers intending to use
iodine treatment daily for all water consumed for more than 3–4 weeks should consult
a physician beforehand and not use it in excessive amounts. Silver is sometimes pro-
moted as a disinfectant, but it is not recommended, as its efficacy is uncertain and it
requires lengthy contact periods.
      Suspended particles in water can reduce the effectiveness of disinfectants, and
turbid water should be clarified or filtered before disinfection. Chemical products that


                                           108
                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


combine clarification (coagulation and flocculation to remove particles) with chlorine
disinfection are available.
     Portable point-of-use filtration devices tested and rated to remove protozoa and
some bacteria, such as ceramic, membrane (mainly reverse osmosis) and activated
carbon block filters, are also available. A pore size rating of 1 µm or less is recom-
mended to ensure the removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts. These filters may require a
pre-filter to remove suspended particles in order to avoid clogging the final filter.
     Unless water is boiled, a combination of techniques (e.g. clarification and/or fil-
tration followed by chemical disinfection) is recommended. This combination pro-
vides a multiple treatment barrier that removes significant numbers of protozoa in
addition to killing bacteria and viruses.
     For people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and infants, extra
precautions are recommended to reduce the risk of infection from water contam-
inated with Cryptosporidium, for example. Boiling and storing water in a protected
container are recommended, although internationally or nationally certified bottled
or mineral water may also be acceptable.
     The treatment methods described here, with the exception of carbon filtration
and reverse osmosis, will generally not reduce levels of most chemical contaminants in
drinking-water. However, these are not usually of health concern in the short term.
     Further information on household water treatment of microbial and chemical
contaminants of water can be found in sections 7.3.2 and 8.4.4, respectively. Table 6.1
provides a summary of drinking-water disinfection methods that can be used by
travellers.

6.12 Aircraft and airports
The importance of water as a potential vehicle for infectious disease transmission on
aircraft has been well documented. In general terms, the greatest microbial risks are
those associated with ingestion of water that is contaminated with human and animal
excreta. If the source of water used to replenish aircraft supplies is contaminated and
adequate precautions are not taken, disease can be spread through the aircraft water if
it used for drinking or tooth cleaning. It is thus imperative that airports comply with
the International Health Regulations (2005) and be provided with potable drinking-
water from a source approved by the appropriate regulatory agency (WHO, 2005a).
Airports usually have special arrangements for managing water after it has entered the
airport.
      A potable water source is not a safeguard if the water is subsequently contamin-
ated during transfer, storage or distribution in aircraft. A WSP covering water man-
agement within airports from receipt of the water through to its transfer to the aircraft
(e.g. by water servicing vehicles or water bowsers), complemented by measures to en-
sure that water quality is maintained on the aircraft (e.g. safe materials and good prac-
tices in design, construction, operation and maintenance of aircraft systems), provides
a framework for water safety in aviation.
      In undertaking an assessment of the general airport/aircraft water distribution
system, a range of specific issues must be taken into consideration, including:

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   quality of source water and the need for additional treatment;
•   design and construction of airport storage tanks and pipes;
•   design and construction of water servicing vehicles;
•   use of materials and fittings approved for contact with drinking-water at all stages;
•   water loading techniques;
•   any treatment systems on aircraft (e.g. ultraviolet disinfection);
•   maintenance of on-board plumbing;
•   prevention of cross-connections, including backflow prevention.
      The airport authority has responsibility for safe drinking-water supply, including
operational monitoring, until water is transferred to the aircraft operator. The pri-
mary emphasis of monitoring is to ensure that management processes are operating
efficiently—for example, the source water quality is not compromised; all parts of the
system, including hydrants, hoses and bowsers, are clean and in good repair; backflow
prevention is in place; and any filters are clean. In addition, the system should be dis-
infected and flushed after maintenance or repairs, and the microbiological quality of
the water should be checked, preferably before the system is returned to service.
      Transfer of water into the aircraft and the aircraft drinking-water system also
has the potential to introduce hazards, even if the water is of good quality up to this
point. It is therefore important that staff involved be properly trained and under-
stand the reasons for the precautions to be taken and the care required in preventing
contamination. The precautions described in previous sections regarding transfer of
drinking-water from a piped supply or from bowsers and tankers are essential, includ-
ing maintaining the cleanliness of vehicles and transfer points. There is a significant
potential for aviation fuel to contaminate the system, and only small quantities of low
molecular weight hydrocarbons can cause the water to be unacceptable. In addition,
staff employed in drinking-water supply must not be engaged in activities related to
aircraft toilet servicing without first taking all necessary precautions (e.g. thorough
hand washing, change of outer garments). All of these requirements and procedures
should be properly documented as part of the WSP for the airport water transfer
system and should be made clear to airlines using the airport to ensure that they play
their part as key stakeholders.
      Independent surveillance is an important part of the WSP, because circumstances
and equipment or staff may change, and the weakening of barriers or the introduc-
tion of new risks may not be noticed. This would include initial review and approval
of the WSP, periodic review and direct assessment of the provisions and operation of
the WSP, paying specific attention to the aircraft industry’s codes of practice, the sup-
porting document Guide to hygiene and sanitation in aviation (Annex 1) and airport
health or airline regulations. It is also important that the response to any incident is
recorded and reviewed and any lessons learnt incorporated into the WSP.

6.13 Ships
The importance of water as a vehicle for infectious disease transmission on ships has
been clearly documented. In general terms, the greatest microbial risks are associated
with ingestion of water that is contaminated with human and animal excreta. However,


                                          112
                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


chemical contamination could also occur on ships as a result of contaminated bulk
water being brought aboard in port, cross-connections on board or improper on-board
treatment. The supporting document Guide to ship sanitation (Annex 1) describes the
factors that can be encountered during water treatment, transfer, production, storage
or distribution in ships and specific features of the organization of the supply and the
regulatory framework. To this end, it is vital that all staff responsible for working with
the potable water system are properly trained.
      The organization of water supply systems covering shore facilities and ships dif-
fers considerably from conventional water transfer on land but is similar to that for
airports. The port authority has responsibility for providing safe potable water for
loading onto vessels. If water is suspected to have come from an unsafe source, the
ship’s master may have to decide if any additional treatment (e.g. hyperchlorination or
filtration) is necessary. When treatment on board or prior to boarding is necessary, the
treatment selected should be that which is best suited to the water and which is most
easily operated and maintained by the ship’s officers and crew.
      Water is delivered to ships by hoses or transferred to the ship via water boats or
barges. The transfer from shore to ship is a potential source of microbial or chem-
ical contamination. In addition to shore-to-ship transfer of water and bulk storage
on board ship, many ships use desalination (see section 6.4) to produce their own
drinking-water.
      In contrast to a shore facility, plumbing aboard ships consists of numerous piping
systems carrying potable water, seawater, sewage and fuel and fitted into a relatively
confined space. Piping systems are normally extensive and complex, making them dif-
ficult to inspect, repair and maintain. A number of waterborne outbreaks on ships
have been caused by contamination of potable water after it had been loaded onto
the ship—for example, by sewage or bilge water when the water storage systems were
not adequately designed and constructed. Potable water should be stored in one or
more tanks that are constructed, located and protected so as to be safe against con-
tamination. Potable water lines should be protected and located so that they will not
be submerged in bilge water or pass through tanks storing non-potable liquids. It
is important to design the system to prevent deterioration of water quality during
distribution by minimizing stagnation and dead ends and to take into account ship
movement, which increases the possibility of surge and backflow.
      An overall assessment of the operation of the ship’s water supply should be made,
for which the final responsibility lies with the ship’s master, who must ensure that all
of the management processes in place are functioning efficiently. An important part
of this process is ensuring that those crew who are responsible for the fresh drinking-
water supply are properly trained and receive refresher training as appropriate. In de-
veloping a WSP and ensuring that the system is capable of supplying safe water, the
following need to be considered:
•   quality of source water if this is from a shore-based source along with the equip-
    ment and method of transfer from shore to ship;
•   desalination equipment and processes where these are used, taking into consider-
    ation the points raised in section 6.5;


                                            113
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•   design and construction of storage tanks and pipework, including the use of ap-
    proved materials and chemicals and clear colour coding of pipes for different
    purposes;
•   minimization of dead ends and areas of stagnation, which may be managed by
    periodic flushing;
•   filtration systems and other treatment systems on board the ship, including dis-
    infection and delivery of residual disinfection;
•   prevention of cross-connections and presence of working backflow prevention
    devices;
•   maintenance of adequate water pressure within the system;
•   presence of a disinfectant residual throughout the system.
      The system needs to be checked regularly for cleanliness and repair, and param-
eters such as pH and disinfectant residual need to be checked daily. Where possible,
checks on microbiological quality such as plate counts and faecal coliforms, even if
only in port, help to ensure that the supply continues to deliver safe water. There also
need to be suitable procedures in place to ensure safety after maintenance or repair,
including specific disinfection of the system or the affected zone. Any indication of a
problem, such as illness or taste or odour problems, should be immediately investi-
gated and the system corrected if it is shown to be the source. In confined commun-
ities such as on ships, person-to-person spread of infectious disease is a major issue.
Someone who has been working on the latrines and sanitation system on ships should
not transfer to work on the drinking-water system without thorough hand washing
and a change of outer clothing.
      Independent surveillance is a desirable element in ensuring drinking-water safety
on ships. This implies that there will be periodic audit and direct assessment and the
review and approval of the WSP. Specific attention should be given to the shipping in-
dustry’s codes of practice, the supporting document Guide to ship sanitation (Annex 1)
and port health and shipping regulations. Independent surveillance should also include
ensuring that any specific incidents that affect or might have affected water quality have
been properly investigated and the lessons to be learnt are incorporated in the WSP.

6.14 Packaged drinking-water
Bottled water and water in containers are widely available in both industrialized and
developing countries. Consumers purchase packaged drinking-water for reasons such
as taste, convenience or fashion, but safety and potential health benefits are also im-
portant considerations.
      Water is packaged for consumption in a range of vessels, including cans, lamin-
ated boxes and plastic bags, but it is most commonly supplied in glass or plastic bot-
tles. Bottled water also comes in various sizes, from single servings to large carbuoys
holding up to 80 litres. Control of the quality of materials, containers and closures
for bottled water is of special concern. Ozone is sometimes used for final disinfection
prior to bottling because it does not impart a taste to the water. If the water contains
naturally occurring bromide, this can lead to the formation of bromate unless care is
taken to minimize its formation.


                                           114
                 6. APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES


      The Guidelines provide a basis for derivation of standards for all packaged wa-
ters. As with other sources of drinking-water, safety is pursued through a combination
of safety management and end product quality standards and testing and is more
readily achievable because batches can be held until results are available. The inter-
national framework for packaged water regulation is provided by the Codex Alimen-
tarius Commission of the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations.
      The Codex Alimentarius Commission has developed a Standard for natural
mineral waters—which describes the product and its compositional and quality
factors, including prescribed treatments, limits for certain chemicals, hygiene, pack-
aging and labelling—and an associated Code of Practice. It has also developed a
Standard for bottled/packaged waters to cover packaged drinking-water other than
natural mineral waters. Both relevant Codex standards refer directly to these Guide-
lines; the Codex standards for bottled/packaged water are directly equivalent to the
guideline values established in these Guidelines. Under the Codex Standard for nat-
ural mineral waters and associated Code of Practice, natural mineral waters must
conform to strict requirements, including collection and bottling without further
treatment from a natural source, such as a spring or well. In comparison, the Codex
Standard for bottled/packaged waters includes waters from other sources, in addi-
tion to springs and wells, and treatment to improve their safety and quality. The
distinctions between these standards are especially relevant in regions where natural
mineral waters have a long cultural history. For further information on the Codex
Standard for natural mineral waters and its companion Code of Practice and the
Codex Standard for bottled/packaged waters, readers are referred to the Codex web
site (http://www.codexalimentarius.net/).
      The Codex Alimentarius Commission’s Code of practice for collecting, processing
and marketing of natural mineral waters provides guidance on a range of good manu-
facturing practices and provides a generic WSP applied to packaged drinking-water.
      Some consumers believe that certain natural mineral waters have medicinal prop-
erties or offer other health benefits. Some such waters have higher mineral content,
sometimes significantly higher than concentrations normally accepted in drinking-
water. They often have a long tradition of use and are often accepted on the basis that
they are considered foods rather than drinking-water per se. Although certain mineral
waters may be useful in providing essential micronutrients, such as calcium and mag-
nesium, these Guidelines do not make recommendations regarding minimum con-
centrations of essential elements because of the uncertainties surrounding mineral
nutrition from drinking-water. Packaged waters with very low mineral content, such
as distilled or demineralized waters, are also consumed. There is insufficient scientific
information on the benefits or hazards of long-term consumption of very low mineral
waters to allow any recommendations to be made (WHO, 2005b; see also the sup-
porting document Calcium and magnesium in drinking-water; Annex 1).
      Another form of packaged water is ice that is intended for adding to drinks and
which may come into contact with food to be eaten without cooking. Ice prepared
and sold in this manner should be treated the same as any packaged water for potable
use.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


6.15 Food production and processing
The quality of water defined by the Guidelines is such that it is suitable for all normal
uses in the food industry. Some processes have special water quality requirements in
order to secure the desired characteristics of the product, and the Guidelines do not
necessarily guarantee that such special requirements are met.
      Poor quality drinking-water may have a severe impact in food processing and
potentially on public health. The consequences of a failure to use water of suitable
quality in food processing will depend on the use of the water and the subsequent
processing of potentially contaminated materials. Variations in water quality that may
be tolerated occasionally in drinking-water supply may be unacceptable for some uses
in the food industry. These variations may result in a significant financial impact on
food production—for example, through product recalls.
      The diverse uses of water in food production and processing have different water
quality requirements. Uses include irrigation and livestock watering; as an ingredient
or where used in washing or “refreshing” of foods, such as misting of salad vegetables
in grocery stores; and those in which contact between the water and foodstuff should
be minimal (as in heating or cooling and cleaning water).
      To reduce microbial contamination, specific treatments (e.g. heat) capable of re-
moving a range of pathogenic organisms of public health concern may be used in
food processing. The effect of these treatments should be taken into account when
assessing the impacts of deterioration in drinking-water quality on a food production
or processing facility. For example, water that is used in canning will usually be heated
to a temperature that is at least equivalent to pasteurization.
      Information on deterioration of the microbial or chemical quality of a drinking-
water supply should be promptly communicated to food and beverage production
facilities.
      For further information on disinfection of water for use in food production and
processing, see FAO/WHO (2009).

lines, these routes are considered waterborne.
     Chapter 11 (Microbial fact sheets) provides additional detailed information on
individual waterborne pathogens, as well as on indicator microorganisms.

7.1 Microbial hazards associated with drinking-water
Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites (e.g. proto-
zoa and helminths) are the most common and widespread health risk associated with
drinking-water. The public health burden is determined by the severity and incidence
of the illnesses associated with pathogens, their infectivity and the population exposed.
In vulnerable subpopulations, disease outcome may be more severe.

is unlikely to identify contaminated drink-
ing-water as the source.
     Waterborne pathogens have several properties that distinguish them from other
drinking-water contaminants:
•   Pathogens can cause acute and also chronic health effects.
•   Some pathogens can grow in the environment.
•   Pathogens are discrete.
•   Pathogens are often aggregated or adherent to suspended solids in water, and
    pathogen concentrations vary in time, so that the likelihood of acquiring an in-
    fective dose cannot be predicted from their average concentration in water.
•   Exposure to a pathogen resulting in disease depends upon the dose, invasiveness
    and virulence of the pathogen, as well as the immune status of the individual.
•   If infection is established, pathogens multiply in their host.
•   Certain waterborne pathogens are also able to multiply in food, beverages or
    warm water systems, perpetuating or even increasing the likelihood of infection.
•   Unlike many chemical agents, pathogens do not exhibit a cumulative effect.
     Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), a mathematical framework for
evaluating infectious risks from human pathogens, can assist in understanding and
managing waterborne microbial hazards, especially those associated with sporadic
disease.

7.1.1 Waterborne infections
The pathogens that may be transmitted through contaminated drinking-water are
diverse in characteristics, behaviour and resistance. Table 7.1 provides general infor-
mation on pathogens that are of relevance for drinking-water supply management.
Waterborne transmission of the pathogens listed has been confirmed by epidemio-
logical studies and case histories. Part of the demonstration of pathogenicity involves
reproducing the disease in suitable hosts. Experimental studies in which healthy adult
volunteers are exposed to known numbers of pathogens provide information, but these
data are applicable to only a part of the exposed population; extrapolation to more
vulnerable subpopulations is an issue that remains to be studied in more detail.
Table 7.2 provides information on organisms that have been suggested as possible
causes of waterborne disease but where evidence is inconclusive or lacking. The
spectrum of pathogens may change as a result of host, pathogen and environmental
changes such as fluctuations in human and animal populations, reuse of wastewater,
changes in lifestyles and medical interventions, population movement and travel,
selective pressures for new pathogens and mutants or recombinations of existing
pathogens. The immunity of individuals also varies considerably, whether acquired

         This table contains pathogens for which there is some evidence of health significance related to their occurrence in drinking-water supplies. More information on these and other
         pathogens is presented in chapter 11.

         The type species listed (e.g. L. pneumophila) are those most commonly linked to waterborne transmission but other species may also cause disease.

       e
         Within pathogen species and groups, there are likely to be variations in resistance, which could be further impacted by characteristics of the water supply and operating conditions.
         Resistance is based on 99% inactivation at 20 °C where, generally, low represents a Ct 99 of < 1 min.mg/L, moderate 1–30 min.mg/L and high > 30 min.mg/L (where C = the concentration
         of free chlorine in mg/L and t = contact time in minutes) under the following conditions: the infective stage is freely suspended in water treated at conventional doses and contact
         times, and the pH is between 7 and 8. It should be noted that organisms that survive and grow in biofilms, such as Legionella and mycobacteria, will be protected from chlorination.

by contact with a pathogen or influenced by such factors as age, sex, state of health
and living conditions.
     For pathogens transmitted by the faecal–oral route, drinking-water is only one
vehicle of transmission. Contamination of food, hands, utensils and clothing can also
play a role, particularly when domestic sanitation and hygiene are poor. Improve-
ments in the quality and availability of water, excreta disposal and general hygiene
are all important in reducing faecal–oral disease transmission.
     Microbial drinking-water safety is not related only to faecal contamination. Some
organisms grow in piped water distribution systems (e.g. Legionella), whereas others
occur in source waters (e.g. guinea worm [Dracunculus medinensis]) and may cause
outbreaks and individual cases. Some other microbes (e.g. toxic cyanobacteria) require
specific management approaches, which are covered elsewhere in these Guidelines
(see section 11.5).
     Although consumption of contaminated drinking-water represents the great-
est risk, other routes of transmission can also lead to disease, with some pathogens
transmitted by multiple routes (e.g. adenovirus) (Figure 7.1). Certain serious illnesses
result from inhalation of water droplets (aerosols) in which the causative organisms
have multiplied because of warm waters and the presence of nutrients. These include
legionellosis, caused by Legionella spp., and illnesses caused by the amoebae Naegleria
fowleri (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis) and Acanthamoeba spp. (amoebic
meningitis, pulmonary infections).
     Schistosomiasis (bilharziasis) is a major parasitic disease of tropical and sub-
tropical regions that is transmitted when the larval stage (cercariae), which is released
by infected aquatic snails, penetrates the skin. It is primarily spread by contact with
water. Ready availability of safe drinking-water contributes to disease prevention by
reducing the need for contact with contaminated water resources—for example, when
collecting water to carry to the home or when using water for bathing or laundry.
     It is conceivable that unsafe drinking-water contaminated with soil or faeces could
act as a carrier of other infectious parasites, such as Balantidium coli (balantidiasis) and
certain helminths (species of Fasciola, Fasciolopsis, Echinococcus, Spirometra, Ascaris,
Trichuris, Toxocara, Necator, Ancylostoma, Strongyloides and Taenia solium). However,
in most of these, the normal mode of transmission is ingestion of the eggs in food
contaminated with faeces or faecally contaminated soil (in the case of Taenia solium,
ingestion of the larval cysticercus stage in uncooked pork) rather than ingestion of
contaminated drinking-water.
     Other pathogens that may be naturally present in the environment may be able
to cause disease in vulnerable subpopulations: the elderly or the very young, patients
with burns or extensive wounds, those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or
those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). If water used by such per-
sons for drinking or bathing contains sufficient numbers of these organisms, they can
produce various infections of the skin and the mucous membranes of the eye, ear,
nose and throat. Examples of such agents are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and species
of Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia, Aeromonas and certain “slow-
growing” (non-tuberculous) mycobacteria (see the supporting document Pathogenic

mycobacteria in water; Annex 1). A number of these organisms are listed in Table 7.2
(and described in more detail in chapter 11).
     Most of the human pathogens listed in Table 7.1 (which are also described in more
detail in chapter 11) are distributed worldwide; some, however, such as those causing
outbreaks of cholera or guinea worm disease, are regional. Eradication of Dracunculus
medinensis is a recognized target of the World Health Assembly (1991).
     It is likely that there are pathogens not shown in Table 7.1 that are also transmit-
ted by water. This is because the number of known pathogens for which water is a
transmission route continues to increase as new or previously unrecognized pathogens
continue to be discovered (WHO, 2003).

7.1.2 Emerging issues
A number of developments are subsumed under the concept of “emerging issues” in
drinking-water. Global changes, such as human development, population growth and
movement and climate change (see section 6.1), exert pressures on the quality and
quantity of water resources that may influence waterborne disease risks. Between 1972

after long periods of inactivity or are expanding into areas where they have not previ-
ously been reported (WHO, 2003). In 2003, a coronavirus was identified as the causa-
tive agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, causing a multinational outbreak. Even
more recently, influenza viruses originating from animal reservoirs have been trans-
mitted to humans on several occasions, causing flu pandemics and seasonal epidemic
influenza episodes (see the supporting document Review of latest available evidence on
potential transmission of avian influenza (H5N1) through water and sewage and ways
to reduce the risks to human health; Annex 1). Zoonotic pathogens make up 75% of
the emerging pathogens and are of increasing concern for human health, along with
pathogens with strictly human-to-human transmission. Zoonotic pathogens pose the
greatest challenges to ensuring the safety of drinking-water and ambient water, now
and in the future (see the supporting document Waterborne zoonoses; Annex 1). For
each emerging pathogen, whether zoonotic or not, it should be considered whether it

can be transmitted through water and, if so, which prevention and control measures
can be suggested to minimize this risk.

7.1.3 Persistence and growth in water
Waterborne pathogens, such as Legionella, may grow in water, whereas other host-
dependent waterborne pathogens, such as noroviruses and Cryptosporidium, cannot
grow in water, but are able to persist.
      Host-dependent waterborne pathogens, after leaving the body of their host, grad-
ually lose viability and the ability to infect. The rate of decay is usually exponential,
and a pathogen will become undetectable after a certain period. Pathogens with low
persistence must rapidly find new hosts and are more likely to be spread by person-to-
person contact or poor personal hygiene than by drinking-water. Persistence is affected
by several factors, of which temperature is the most important. Decay is usually faster
at higher temperatures and may be mediated by the lethal effects of ultraviolet (UV)
radiation in sunlight acting near the water surface.
      Relatively high amounts of biodegradable organic carbon, together with warm
waters and low residual concentrations of chlorine, can permit growth of Legionella,
Vibrio cholerae, Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba and nuisance organisms in some
surface waters and during water distribution (see also the supporting documents
Heterotrophic plate counts and drinking-water safety and Legionella and the prevention
of legionellosis; Annex 1).
      Microbial water quality may vary rapidly and widely. Short-term peaks in pathogen
concentration may increase disease risks considerably and may also trigger outbreaks of
waterborne disease. Microorganisms can accumulate in sediments and are mobilized
when water flow increases. Results of water quality testing for microbes are not normally
available in time to inform management action and prevent the supply of unsafe water.

                                                               123
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


7.1.4 Public health aspects
Outbreaks of waterborne disease may affect large numbers of persons, and the first prior-
ity in developing and applying controls on drinking-water quality should be the control
of such outbreaks. Available evidence also suggests that drinking-water can contribute
to background rates of disease in non-outbreak situations, and control of drinking-water
quality should therefore also address waterborne disease in the general community.
      Experience has shown that systems for the detection of waterborne disease out-
breaks are typically inefficient in countries at all levels of socioeconomic development,
and failure to detect outbreaks is not a guarantee that they do not occur; nor does it
suggest that drinking-water should necessarily be considered safe.
      Some of the pathogens that are known to be transmitted through contaminated
drinking-water lead to severe and sometimes life-threatening disease. Examples include
typhoid, cholera, infectious hepatitis (caused by hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus)
and disease caused by Shigella spp. and E. coli O157. Others are typically associated
with less severe outcomes, such as self-limiting diarrhoeal disease (e.g. noroviruses,
Cryptosporidium).
      The effects of exposure to pathogens are not the same for all individuals or, as
a consequence, for all populations. Repeated exposure to a pathogen may be associ-
ated with a lower probability or severity of illness because of the effects of acquired
immunity. For some pathogens (e.g. hepatitis A virus), immunity is lifelong, where-
as for others (e.g. Campylobacter), the protective effects may be restricted to a few
months to years. In contrast, vulnerable subpopulations (e.g. the young, the elderly,
pregnant women, the immunocompromised) may have a greater probability of illness
or the illness may be more severe, including mortality. Not all pathogens have greater
effects in all vulnerable subpopulations.
      Not all infected individuals will develop symptomatic disease. The proportion
of the infected population that is asymptomatic (including carriers) differs between
pathogens and also depends on population characteristics, such as prevalence of
immunity. Those with asymptomatic infections as well as patients during and after
illness may all contribute to secondary spread of pathogens.

7.2 Health-based target setting
7.2.1 Health-based targets applied to microbial hazards
General approaches to health-based target setting are described in section 2.1 and
chapter 3.
     Sources of information on health risks may be from both epidemiology and
QMRA, and typically both are employed as complementary sources. Development
of health-based targets for many pathogens may be constrained by limitations in the
data. Additional data, derived from both epidemiology and QMRA, are becoming
progressively more available. Locally generated data will always be of great value in
setting national targets.
     Health-based targets may be set using a direct health outcome approach, where
the waterborne disease burden is believed to be sufficiently high to allow measurement



                                          124
                                    7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


of the impact of interventions—that is, epidemiological measurement of reductions in
disease that can be attributed to improvements in drinking-water quality.
     Interpreting and applying information from analytical epidemiological stud-
ies to derive health-based targets for application at a national or local level require
consideration of a number of factors, including the following questions:
•    Are specific estimates of disease reduction or indicative ranges of expected reduc-
     tions to be provided?
•    How representative of the target population was the study sample in order to as-
     sure confidence in the reliability of the results across a wider group?
•    To what extent will minor differences in demographic or socioeconomic condi-
     tions affect expected outcomes?
     More commonly, QMRA is used as the basis for setting microbial health-based
targets, particularly where the fraction of disease that can be attributed to drinking-
water is low or difficult to measure directly through public health surveillance or
analytical epidemiological studies.
     For the control of microbial hazards, the most frequent form of health-based tar-
get applied is performance targets (see section 3.3.3), which are anchored to a prede-
termined tolerable burden of disease and established by applying QMRA taking into
account raw water quality. Water quality targets (see section 3.3.2) are typically not
developed for pathogens; monitoring finished water for pathogens is not considered
a feasible or cost-effective option because pathogen concentrations equivalent to
tolerable levels of risk are typically less than 1 organism per 104–105 litres.

7.2.2 Reference pathogens
It is not practical, and there are insufficient data, to set performance targets for all
potentially waterborne pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and hel-
minths. A more practical approach is to identify reference pathogens that represent
groups of pathogens, taking into account variations in characteristics, behaviours
and susceptibilities of each group to different treatment processes. Typically, differ-
ent reference pathogens will be identified to represent bacteria, viruses, protozoa and
helminths.
      Selection criteria for reference pathogens include all of the following elements:
•    waterborne transmission established as a route of infection;
•    sufficient data available to enable a QMRA to be performed, including data on
     dose–response relationships in humans and disease burden;
•    occurrence in source waters;
•    persistence in the environment;
•    sensitivity to removal or inactivation by treatment processes;
•    infectivity, incidence and severity of disease.
Some of the criteria, such as environmental persistence and sensitivity to treatment pro-
cesses, relate to the specific characteristics of the reference pathogens. Other criteria can
be subject to local circumstances and conditions. These can include waterborne disease


                                            125
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


burden, which can be influenced by the prevalence of the organism from other sources,
levels of immunity and nutrition (e.g. rotavirus infections have different outcomes
in high- and low-income regions); and occurrence of the organism in source waters
(e.g. presence of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae and Entamoeba histolytica is more common
in defined geographical regions, whereas Naegleria fowleri is associated with warmer
waters).

Selection of reference pathogens
The selection of reference pathogens may vary between different countries and re-
gions and should take account of local conditions, including incidence and severity
of waterborne disease and source water characteristics (see section 7.3.1). Evidence of
disease prevalence and significance should be used in selecting reference pathogens.
However, the range of potential reference pathogens is limited by data availability,
particularly in regard to human dose–response models for QMRA.
     Decision-making regarding selection of reference pathogens should be informed
by all available data sources, including infectious disease surveillance and targeted
studies, outbreak investigations and registries of laboratory-confirmed clinical cases.
Such data can help identify the pathogens that are likely to be the biggest contributors
to the burden of waterborne disease. It is these pathogens that may be suitable choices
as reference pathogens and to consider when establishing health-based targets.

Viruses
Viruses are the smallest pathogens and hence are more difficult to remove by physical
processes such as filtration. Specific viruses may be less sensitive to disinfection than
bacteria and parasites (e.g. adenovirus is less sensitive to UV light). Viruses can persist
for long periods in water. Infective doses are typically low. Viruses typically have a
limited host range, and many are species specific. Most human enteric viruses are not
carried by animals, although there are some exceptions, including specific strains of
hepatitis E virus (Table 7.1).
     Rotaviruses, enteroviruses and noroviruses have been identified as potential
reference pathogens. Rotaviruses are the most important cause of gastrointestinal
infection in children and can have severe consequences, including hospitalization and
death, with the latter being far more frequent in low-income regions. There is a dose–
response model for rotaviruses, but there is no routine culture-based method for
quantifying infectious units. Typically, rotaviruses are excreted in very large numbers
by infected patients, and waters contaminated by human waste could contain high
concentrations. Occasional outbreaks of waterborne disease have been recorded. In
low-income countries, sources other than water are likely to dominate.
     Enteroviruses, including polioviruses and the more recently recognized parecho-
viruses, can cause mild febrile illness, but are also important causative agents of severe
diseases, such as paralysis, meningitis and encephalitis, in children. There is a dose–
response model for enteroviruses, and there is a routine culture-based analysis for meas-
uring infective particles. Enteroviruses are excreted in very large numbers by infected
patients, and waters contaminated by human waste could contain high concentrations.


                                           126
                                    7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


    Noroviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in all age groups. Symp-
toms of illness are generally mild and rarely last longer than 3 days; however, infection
does not yield lasting protective immunity. Hence, the burden of disease per case is
lower than for rotaviruses. Numerous outbreaks have been attributed to drinking-
water. A dose–response model has been developed to estimate infectivity for several
norovirus strains, but no culture-based method is available.

Bacteria
Bacteria are generally the group of pathogens that is most sensitive to inactivation
by disinfection. Some free-living pathogens, such as Legionella and non-tuberculous
mycobacteria, can grow in water environments, but enteric bacteria typically do not
grow in water and survive for shorter periods than viruses or protozoa. Many bacterial
species that are infective to humans are carried by animals.
     There are a number of potentially waterborne bacterial pathogens with known
dose–response models, including Vibrio, Campylobacter, E. coli O157, Salmonella and
Shigella.
     Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae can cause watery diarrhoea. When it is left untreated, as
may be the case when people are displaced by conflict and natural disaster, case fatality
rates are very high. The infective dose is relatively high. Large waterborne outbreaks
have been described and keep occurring.
     Campylobacter is an important cause of diarrhoea worldwide. Illness can produce
a wide range of symptoms, but mortality is low. Compared with other bacterial patho-
gens, the infective dose is relatively low and can be below 1000 organisms. It is relatively
common in the environment, and waterborne outbreaks have been recorded.
     Waterborne infection by E. coli O157 and other enterohaemorrhagic strains of
E. coli is far less common than infection by Campylobacter, but the symptoms of
infection are more severe, including haemolytic uraemic syndrome and death. The
infective dose can be very low (fewer than 100 organisms).
     Shigella causes over 2 million infections each year, including about 60 000 deaths,
mainly in developing countries. The infective dose is low and can be as few as 10–100
organisms. Waterborne outbreaks have been recorded.
     Although non-typhoidal Salmonella rarely causes waterborne outbreaks, S. Typhi
causes large and devastating outbreaks of waterborne typhoid.

Protozoa
Protozoa are the group of pathogens that is least sensitive to inactivation by chemical
disinfection. UV light irradiation is effective against Cryptosporidium, but Cryptospor-
idium is highly resistant to oxidizing disinfectants such as chlorine. Protozoa are of a
moderate size (> 2 µm) and can be removed by physical processes. They can survive
for long periods in water. They are moderately species specific. Livestock and humans
can be sources of protozoa such as Cryptosporidium and Balantidium, whereas hu-
mans are the sole reservoirs of pathogenic Cyclospora and Entamoeba. Infective doses
are typically low.
     There are dose–response models available for Giardia and Cryptosporidium.
Giardia infections are generally more common than Cryptosporidium infections, and

                                            127
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


symptoms can be longer lasting. However, Cryptosporidium is smaller than Giardia
and hence more difficult to remove by physical processes; it is also more resistant to
oxidizing disinfectants, and there is some evidence that it survives longer in water
environments.

7.2.3 Quantitative microbial risk assessment
QMRA systematically combines available information on exposure (i.e. the number of
pathogens ingested) and dose–response models to produce estimates of the probabil-
ity of infection associated with exposure to pathogens in drinking-water. Epidemio-
logical data on frequency of asymptomatic infections, duration and severity of illness
can then be used to estimate disease burdens.
      QMRA can be used to determine performance targets and as the basis for assess-
ing the effects of improved water quality on health in the population and subpopu-
lations. Mathematical modelling can be used to estimate the effects of low doses of
pathogens in drinking-water on health.
      Risk assessment, including QMRA, commences with problem formulation to
identify all possible hazards and their pathways from sources to recipients. Human
exposure to the pathogens (environmental concentrations and volumes ingested) and
dose–response relationships for selected (or reference) organisms are then combined
to characterize the risks. With the use of additional information (social, cultural, pol-
itical, economic, environmental, etc.), management options can be prioritized. To
encourage stakeholder support and participation, a transparent procedure and active
risk communication at each stage of the process are important. An example of a risk
assessment approach is outlined in Table 7.3 and described below. For more detailed
information on QMRA in the context of drinking-water safety, see the supporting
document Quantitative microbial risk assessment: application for water safety manage-
ment; Annex 1).

Problem formulation and hazard identification
All potential hazards, sources and events that can lead to the presence of microb-
ial pathogens (i.e. what can happen and how) should be identified and documented
for each component of the drinking-water system, regardless of whether or not the
component is under the direct control of the drinking-water supplier. This includes
point sources of pollution (e.g. human and industrial waste discharges) as well as
diffuse sources (e.g. those arising from agricultural and animal husbandry activities).
Continuous, intermittent or seasonal pollution patterns should also be considered, as
well as extreme and infrequent events, such as droughts and floods.
     The broader sense of hazards includes hazardous scenarios, which are events that
may lead to exposure of consumers to specific pathogenic microorganisms. In this, the
hazardous event (e.g. peak contamination of source water with domestic wastewater)
may be referred to as the hazard.
     As a QMRA cannot be performed for each of the hazards identified, representa-
tive (or reference) organisms are selected that, if controlled, would ensure control of
all pathogens of concern. Typically, this implies inclusion of at least one bacterium,
virus, protozoan or helminth. In this section, Campylobacter, rotavirus and Crypto-

sporidium have been used as example reference pathogens to illustrate application of
risk assessment and calculation of performance targets.

Exposure assessment
Exposure assessment in the context of drinking-water consumption involves esti-
mation of the number of pathogens to which an individual is exposed, principally
through ingestion. Exposure assessment inevitably contains uncertainty and must ac-
count for variability of such factors as concentrations of pathogens over time and
volumes ingested.
      Exposure can be considered as a single dose of pathogens that a consumer ingests
at a certain point in time or the total amount over several exposures (e.g. over a year).
Exposure is determined by the concentration of pathogens in drinking-water and the
volume of water consumed.
      It is rarely possible or appropriate to directly measure pathogens in drinking-water
on a regular basis. More often, concentrations in raw waters are assumed or measured,
and estimated reductions—for example, through treatment—are applied to estimate
the concentration in the water consumed. Pathogen measurement, when performed,
is generally best carried out at the location where the pathogens are at highest con-
centration (generally raw waters). Estimation of their removal by sequential control
measures is generally achieved by the use of indicator organisms such as E. coli for
enteric bacterial pathogens (see Table 7.4; see also the supporting document Water
treatment and pathogen control in Annex 1).
      The other component of exposure assessment, which is common to all pathogens,
is the volume of unboiled water consumed by the population, including person-to-
person variation in consumption behaviour and especially consumption behaviour of
vulnerable subpopulations. For microbial hazards, it is important that the unboiled vol-
ume of drinking-water, both consumed directly and used in food preparation, is used in
the risk assessment, as heating will rapidly inactivate pathogens. This amount is lower
than that used for deriving water quality targets, such as chemical guideline values.
      The daily exposure of a consumer to pathogens in drinking-water can be assessed
by multiplying the concentration of pathogens in drinking-water by the volume of
drinking-water consumed (i.e. dose). For the purposes of the example model calcula-
tions, drinking-water consumption was assumed to be 1 litre of unboiled water per
day, but location-specific data on drinking-water consumption are preferred.

                                                    129
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Dose–response assessment
The probability of an adverse health effect following exposure to one or more patho-
genic organisms is derived from a dose–response model. Available dose–response data
have been obtained mainly from studies using healthy adult volunteers. However, ad-
equate data are lacking for vulnerable subpopulations, such as children, the elderly
and the immunocompromised, who may suffer more severe disease outcomes.
     The conceptual basis for the dose–response model is the observation that expos­
ure to the described dose leads to the probability of infection as a conditional event:
for infection to occur, one or more viable pathogens must have been ingested. Further-
more, one or more of these ingested pathogens must have survived in the host’s body.
An important concept is the single-hit principle (i.e. that even a single pathogen may
be able to cause infection and disease). This concept supersedes the concept of (min­
imum) infectious dose that is frequently used in older literature (see the supporting
document Hazard characterization for pathogens in food and water; Annex 1).
     In general, well-dispersed pathogens in water are considered to be Poisson dis-
tributed. When the individual probability of any organism surviving and starting in-
fection is the same, the dose–response relationship simplifies to an exponential func-
tion. If, however, there is heterogeneity in this individual probability, this leads to the
beta-Poisson dose–response relationship, where the “beta” stands for the distribution
of the individual probabilities among pathogens (and hosts). At low exposures, such
as would typically occur in drinking-water, the dose–response model is approximately
linear and can be represented simply as the probability of infection resulting from
exposure to a single organism (see the supporting document Hazard characterization
for pathogens in food and water; Annex 1).

Risk characterization
Risk characterization brings together the data collected on exposure, dose–response
and the incidence and severity of disease.
      The probability of infection can be estimated as the product of the exposure to
drinking-water and the probability that exposure to one organism would result in
infection. The probability of infection per day is multiplied by 365 to calculate the
probability of infection per year. In doing so, it is assumed that different exposure
events are independent, in that no protective immunity is built up. This simplification
is justified for low risks only, such as those discussed here.
      Not all infected individuals will develop clinical illness; asymptomatic infection
is common for most pathogens. The percentage of infected persons who will develop
clinical illness depends on the pathogen, but also on other factors, such as the immune
status of the host. Risk of illness per year is obtained by multiplying the probability of
infection by the probability of illness given infection.
      The low numbers in Table 7.4 can be interpreted to represent the probability that
a single individual will develop illness in a given year. For example, a risk of illness
for Campylobacter of 2.2 × 10−4 per year indicates that, on average, 1 out of 4600
consumers would contract campylobacteriosis from consumption of drinking-water.
      To translate the risk of developing a specific illness to disease burden per case, the
metric disability-adjusted life year, or DALY, is used (see Box 3.1 in chapter 3). This

                                            130

metric reflects not only the effects of acute end-points (e.g. diarrhoeal illness) but also
mortality and the effects of more serious end-points (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome as-
sociated with Campylobacter). The disease burden per case varies widely. For example,
the disease burden per 1000 cases of rotavirus diarrhoea is 480 DALYs in low-income
regions, where child mortality frequently occurs. However, it is 14 DALYs per 1000
cases in high-income regions, where hospital facilities are accessible to the great ma-
jority of the population (see the supporting document Quantifying public health risk
in the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality; Annex 1). This considerable differ-
ence in disease burden results in far stricter treatment requirements in low-income
regions for the same raw water quality in order to obtain the same risk (expressed as
DALYs per person per year). Ideally, the health outcome target of 10−6 DALY per per-
son per year in Table 7.4 should be adapted to specific national situations. In Table 7.4,
no accounting is made for effects on immunocompromised persons (e.g. cryptospor­
idiosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS), which is significant
in some countries. Section 3.2 gives more information on the DALY metric and how it
is applied to derive a reference level of risk.
      Only a proportion of the population may be susceptible to some pathogens, be-
cause immunity developed after an initial episode of infection or illness may provide
lifelong protection. Examples include hepatitis A virus and rotaviruses. It is estimated
that in developing countries, all children above the age of 5 years are immune to rota-
viruses because of repeated exposure in the first years of life. This translates to an
average of 17% of the population being susceptible to rotavirus illness. In developed
countries, rotavirus infection is also common in the first years of life, and the illness is
diagnosed mainly in young children, but the percentage of young children as part of
the total population is lower. This translates to an average of 6% of the population in
developed countries being susceptible.
      The uncertainty of the risk outcome is the result of the uncertainty and variabil-
ity of the data collected in the various steps of the risk assessment. Risk assessment
models should ideally account for this variability and uncertainty, although here we
present only point estimates (see below).
      It is important to choose the most appropriate point estimate for each of the
variables. Theoretical considerations show that risks are directly proportional to the
arithmetic mean of the ingested dose. Hence, arithmetic means of variables such as
concentration in raw water, removal by treatment and consumption of drinking-water
are recommended. This recommendation is different from the usual practice among
microbiologists and engineers of converting concentrations and treatment effects to
log values and making calculations or specifications on the log scale. Such calcula-
tions result in estimates of the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic mean, and
these may significantly underestimate risk. Analysing site-specific data may therefore
require going back to the raw data (i.e. counts and tested volumes) rather than relying
on reported log-transformed values, as these introduce ambiguity.
      Emergencies such as major storms and floods can lead to substantial deteriora-
tions in source water quality, including large short-term increases in pathogen concen-
trations. These should not be included in calculations of arithmetic means. Inclusion
will lead to higher levels of treatment being applied on a continuous basis, with sub-

stantial cost implications. It is more efficient to develop specific plans to deal with the
events and emergencies (see section 4.4). Such plans can include enhanced treatment
or (if possible) selection of alternative sources of water during an emergency.

7.2.4 Risk-based performance target setting
The process outlined above enables estimation of risk on a population level, taking
account of raw water quality and impact of control. This can be compared with the

reference level of risk (see section 3.2) or a locally developed tolerable risk. The cal-
culations enable quantification of the degree of source protection or treatment that
is needed to achieve a specified level of tolerable risk and analysis of the estimated
impact of changes in control measures.
      Performance targets are most frequently applied to treatment performance—that
is, to determine the microbial reduction necessary to ensure water safety. A perform­
ance target may be applied to a specific system (i.e. formulated in response to local raw
water characteristics) or generalized (e.g. formulated in response to raw water quality
assumptions based on a certain type of source) (see also the supporting document
Water treatment and pathogen control; Annex 1).

sessment table. It can also be expressed as a per cent reduction. For example, a 5.96

7.2.6 Adapting risk-based performance target setting to local circumstances
The reference pathogens illustrated in the previous sections will not be priority patho-
gens in all regions of the world. Wherever possible, country- or site-specific informa-
tion should be used in assessments of this type. If no specific data are available, an
approximate risk estimate can be based on default values (see Table 7.6 below).
      Table 7.5 accounts only for changes in water quality derived from treatment and
not from source protection measures, which are often important contributors to over-
all safety, affecting pathogen concentration and/or variability. The risk estimates pre-
sented in Table 7.4 also assume that there is no degradation of water quality in the
distribution network. These may not be realistic assumptions under all circumstances,
and it is advisable to take these factors into account wherever possible.
      Table 7.5 presents point estimates only and does not account for variability and
uncertainty. Full risk assessment models would incorporate such factors by repre-
senting the input variables by statistical distributions rather than by point estimates.
However, such models are currently beyond the means of many countries, and data
to define such distributions are scarce. Producing such data may involve considerable
efforts in terms of time and resources, but will lead to much improved insight into the
actual raw water quality and treatment performance.
      The necessary degree of treatment also depends on the values assumed for vari-
ables that can be taken into account in the risk assessment model. One such vari-
able is drinking-water consumption. Figure 7.3 shows the effect of variation in the
consumption of unboiled drinking-water on the performance targets for Cryptospor­
idium. If the raw water concentration is 1 oocyst per litre, the performance target
varies between 4.3 and 5.2 log10 units if consumption values vary between 0.25 and
2 litres per day. Another variable is the fraction of the population that is susceptible.
Some outbreak data suggest that in developed countries, a significant proportion of
the population above 5 years of age may not be immune to rotavirus illness. Figure 7.4

water quality interventions at community and household levels. These targets would
identify expected disease reductions in communities receiving the interventions.
      The prioritization of water quality interventions should focus on those aspects
that are estimated to contribute more than, for example, 5% of the burden of a given
disease (e.g. 5% of total diarrhoea). In many parts of the world, the implementation of
a water quality intervention that results in an estimated health gain of more than 5%
would be considered extremely worthwhile. Directly demonstrating the health gains
arising from improving water quality—as assessed, for example, by reduced E. coli
counts at the point of consumption—may be possible where disease burden is high
and effective interventions are applied and can be a powerful tool to demonstrate a
first step in incremental drinking-water safety improvement.
      Where a specified quantified disease reduction is identified as a health outcome
target, it is advisable to undertake ongoing proactive public health surveillance among
representative communities to measure the effectiveness of water quality interventions.

7.3 Occurrence and treatment of pathogens
As discussed in section 4.1, system assessment involves determining whether the
drinking-water supply chain as a whole can deliver drinking-water quality that meets
identified targets. This requires an understanding of the quality of source water and
the efficacy of control measures, such as treatment.

7.3.1 Occurrence
An understanding of pathogen occurrence in source waters is essential, because it
facilitates selection of the highest-quality source for drinking-water supply, deter-
mines pathogen concentrations in source waters and provides a basis for establishing
treatment requirements to meet health-based targets within a water safety plan.
     By far the most accurate way of determining pathogen concentrations in specific
catchments and other water sources is by analysing pathogen concentrations in water

                                                            136

over a period of time, taking care to include consideration of seasonal variation and
peak events such as storms. Direct measurement of pathogens and indicator organisms
in the specific source waters for which a water safety plan and its target pathogens are
being established is recommended wherever possible, because this provides the best
estimates of microbial concentrations. However, resource limitations in many settings
preclude this. In the absence of measured pathogen concentrations, an alternative in-
terim approach is to make estimations based on available data, such as the results of
sanitary surveys combined with indicator testing.
      In the case of absence of data on the occurrence and distribution of human patho-
gens in water for the community or area of implementation, concentrations in raw
waters can be inferred from observational data on numbers of pathogens per gram
of faeces representing direct faecal contamination or from numbers of pathogens per
litre of untreated wastewater (Table 7.6). Data from sanitary surveys can be used to
estimate the impact of raw or treated wastewater discharged into source waters. In
treated wastewater, the concentrations of pathogens may be reduced 10- to 100-fold
or more, depending on the efficiency of the treatment process. The concentrations
of pathogens in raw waters can be estimated from concentrations of pathogens in
wastewater and the fraction of wastewater present in source waters. In addition, some
indicative concentrations of pathogens in source waters are given that were measured
at specific locations, but these concentrations may differ widely between locations.
      From Table 7.6, it may be clear that faecal indicator bacteria, such as E. coli, are
always present at high concentrations in wastewater. Everybody sheds E. coli; never-
theless concentrations vary widely. Only infected persons shed pathogens; therefore,
the concentrations of pathogens in wastewater vary even more. Such variations are
due to shedding patterns, but they also depend on other factors, such as the size of the
population discharging into wastewater and dilution with other types of wastewater,
such as industrial wastewater. Conventional wastewater treatment commonly reduces
microbial concentrations by one or two orders of magnitude before the wastewater is
discharged into surface waters. At other locations, raw wastewater may be discharged
directly, or discharges may occur occasionally during combined sewer overflows. Dis-
charged wastewater is diluted in receiving surface waters, leading to reduced pathogen
numbers, with the dilution factor being very location specific. Pathogen inactivation,
die-off or partitioning to sediments may also play a role in pathogen reduction. These
factors differ with the surface water body and climate. This variability suggests that
concentrations of faecal indicators and pathogens vary even more in surface water
than in wastewater.
      Because of differences in survival, the ratio of pathogen to E. coli at the point of dis-
charge will not be the same as farther downstream. A comparison of data on E. coli with
pathogen concentrations in surface waters indicates that, overall, there is a positive rela-
tionship between the presence of pathogens in surface water and E. coli concentration,
but that pathogen concentrations may vary widely from low to high at any E. coli con-
centration. Even the absence of E. coli is not a guarantee for the absence of pathogens or
for pathogen concentrations to be below those of significance for public health.
      The estimates based on field data in Table 7.6 provide a useful guide to the concen-
trations of enteric pathogens in a variety of sources affected by faecal contamination.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


However, there are a number of limitations and sources of uncertainty in these data,
including the following:
•   Although data on pathogens and E. coli were derived from different regions in the
    world, they are by far mostly from high-income countries.
•   There are concerns about the sensitivity and robustness of analytical techniques,
    particularly for viruses and protozoa, largely associated with the recoveries
    achieved by techniques used to process and concentrate large sample volumes
    typically used in testing for these organisms.
•   Numbers of pathogens were derived using a variety of methods, including culture-
    based methods using media or cells, molecular-based tests (such as polymerase
    chain reaction) and microscopy, and should be interpreted with care.
•   The lack of knowledge about the infectivity of the pathogens for humans has
    implications in risk assessment and should be addressed.

7.3.2 Treatment
Understanding the efficacy of control measures includes validation (see sections 2.2
and 4.1.7). Validation is important both in ensuring that treatment will achieve the
desired goals (performance targets) and in assessing areas in which efficacy may be
improved (e.g. by comparing performance achieved with that shown to be achievable
through well-run processes). Water treatment could be applied in a drinking-water
treatment plant (central treatment) to piped systems or in the home or at the point of
use in settings other than piped supplies.

Central treatment
Waters of very high quality, such as groundwater from confined aquifers, may rely on
protection of the source water and the distribution system as the principal control
measures for provision of safe water. More typically, water treatment is required to re-
move or destroy pathogenic microorganisms. In many cases (e.g. poor quality surface
water), multiple treatment stages are required, including, for example, coagulation,
flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Table 7.7 provides a summary
of treatment processes that are commonly used individually or in combination to
achieve microbial reductions (see also Annex 5). The minimum and maximum re-
movals are indicated as log10 reduction values and may occur under failing and optimal
treatment conditions, respectively.
     The microbial reductions presented in Table 7.7 are for broad groups or categor­
ies of microbes: bacteria, viruses and protozoa. This is because it is generally the case
that treatment efficacy for microbial reduction differs among these microbial groups
as a result of the inherently different properties of the microbes (e.g. size, nature of
protective outer layers, physicochemical surface properties). Within these microbial
groups, differences in treatment process efficiencies are smaller among the specific
species, types or strains of microbes. Such differences do occur, however, and the table
presents conservative estimates of microbial reductions based on the more resistant or
persistent pathogenic members of that microbial group. Where differences in removal
by treatment between specific members of a microbial group are great, the results for
the individual microbes are presented separately in the table.

                                      7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


      Treatment efficacy for microbial reduction can also differ when aggregating dif-
ferent treatment processes. Applying multiple barriers in treatment, for example in
drinking-water treatment plants, may strengthen performance, as failure of one pro-
cess does not result in failure of the entire treatment. However, both positive and nega-
tive interactions can occur between multiple treatment steps, and how these inter-
actions affect the overall water quality and water treatment performance is not yet
completely understood. In positive interactions, the inactivation of a contaminant is
higher when two steps are occurring together than when each of the steps occurs sepa-
rately—as happens, for example, when coagulation and sedimentation are operating
under optimal conditions, and there is an increase in performance of rapid sand filters.
In contrast, negative interactions can occur when failure in the first step of the treat-
ment process could lead to a failure of the next process—for example, if coagulation
fails to remove organic material, this could lead to a reduced efficacy of subsequent
disinfection and a potential increase in DBPs. An overall assessment of the drinking-
water treatment performance, as part of the implementation of the WSP, will assist in
understanding the efficacy of the multiple treatment processes to ensure the safety of
the drinking-water supply.

Household treatment
Household water treatment technologies are any of a range of devices or methods
employed for the purposes of treating water in the home or at the point of use in
other settings. These are also known as point-of-use or point-of-entry water treatment
technologies (Cotruvo & Sobsey, 2006; Nath, Bloomfield & Jones, 2006; see also the
supporting document Managing water in the home, Annex 1). Household water treat-
ment technologies comprise a range of options that enable individuals and communities
to treat collected water or contaminated piped water to remove or inactivate microbial

                                  7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


pathogens. Many of these methods are coupled with safe storage of the treated water
to preclude or minimize contamination after household treatment (Wright, Gundry &
Conroy, 2003).
      Household water treatment and safe storage have been shown to significantly
improve water quality and reduce waterborne infectious disease risks (Fewtrell & Col-
ford, 2004; Clasen et al., 2006). Household water treatment approaches have the po-
tential to have rapid and significant positive health impacts in situations where piped
water systems are not possible and where people rely on source water that may be
contaminated or where stored water becomes contaminated because of unhygienic
handling during transport or in the home. Household water treatment can also be
used to overcome the widespread problem of microbially unsafe piped water supplies.
Similar small technologies can also be used by travellers in areas where the drinking-
water quality is uncertain (see also section 6.11).
      Not all household water treatment technologies are highly effective in reducing
all classes of waterborne pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths). For
example, chlorine is ineffective for inactivating oocysts of the waterborne protozoan
Cryptosporidium, whereas some filtration methods, such as ceramic and cloth or fibre
filters, are ineffective in removing enteric viruses. Therefore, careful consideration of
the health-based target microbes to control in a drinking-water source is needed when
choosing among these technologies.
      Definitions and descriptions of the various household water treatment
technologies for microbial contamination follow:
•   Chemical disinfection: Chemical disinfection of drinking-water includes any
    chlorine-based technology, such as chlorine dioxide, as well as ozone, some
    other oxidants and some strong acids and bases. Except for ozone, proper dos-
    ing of chemical disinfectants is intended to maintain a residual concentration in
    the water to provide some protection from post-treatment contamination during
    storage. Disinfection of household drinking-water in developing countries is done
    primarily with free chlorine, either in liquid form as hypochlorous acid (com-
    mercial household bleach or more dilute sodium hypochlorite solution between
    0.5% and 1% hypochlorite marketed for household water treatment use) or in dry
    form as calcium hypochlorite or sodium dichloroisocyanurate. This is because
    these forms of free chlorine are convenient, relatively safe to handle, inexpensive
    and easy to dose. However, sodium trichloroisocyanurate and chlorine dioxide
    are also used in some household water treatment technologies. Proper dosing of
    chlorine for household water treatment is critical in order to provide enough free
    chlorine to maintain a residual during storage and use. Recommendations are to
    dose with free chlorine at about 2 mg/l to clear water (< 10 nephelometric turbid-
    ity units [NTU]) and twice that (4 mg/l) to turbid water (> 10 NTU). Although
    these free chlorine doses may lead to chlorine residuals that exceed the recom-
    mended chlorine residual for water that is centrally treated at the point of delivery,
    0.2–0.5 mg/l, these doses are considered suitable for household water treatment
    to maintain a free chlorine residual of 0.2 mg/l in stored household water treated
    by chlorination. Further information on point-of-use chlorination can be found


                                          141

    in the document Preventing travellers’ diarrhoea: How to make drinking water safe
    (WHO, 2005).
        Disinfection of drinking-water with iodine, which is also a strong oxidant, is
    generally not recommended for extended use unless the residual concentrations
    are controlled, because of concerns about adverse effects of excess intake on the
    thyroid gland; however, this issue is being re-examined, because dietary iodine
    deficiency is a serious health problem in many parts of the world (see also sec-
    tion 6.11 and Table 6.1). As for central treatment, ozone for household water
    treatment must be generated on site, typically by corona discharge or electrolytic­
    ally, both of which require electricity. As a result, ozone is not recommended for
    household water treatment because of the need for a reliable source of electricity
    to generate it, its complexity of generation and proper dosing in a small applica-
    tion, and its relatively high cost. Strong acids or bases are not recommended as
    chemical disinfectants for drinking-water, as they are hazardous chemicals that
    can alter the pH of the water to dangerously low or high levels. However, as an
    emergency or short-term intervention, the juices of some citrus fruits, such as
    limes and lemons, can be added to water to inactivate Vibrio cholerae, if enough is
    added to sufficiently lower the pH of the water (probably to pH less than 4.5).
•   Membrane, porous ceramic or composite filters: These are filters with defined pore
    sizes and include carbon block filters, porous ceramics containing colloidal silver,
    reactive membranes, polymeric membranes and fibre/cloth filters. They rely on
    physical straining through a single porous surface or multiple surfaces having
    structured pores to physically remove and retain microbes by size exclusion. Some
    of these filters may also employ chemical antimicrobial or bacteriostatic surfaces
    or chemical modifications to cause microbes to become adsorbed to filter media
    surfaces, to be inactivated or at least to not multiply. Cloth filters, such as those of
    sari cloth, have been recommended for reducing Vibrio cholerae in water. However,
    these filters reduce only vibrios associated with copepods, other large crustaceans
    or other large eukaryotes retained by the cloth. These cloths will not retain dis-
    persed vibrios or other bacteria not associated with copepods, other crustaceans,
    suspended sediment or large eukaryotes, because the pores of the cloth fabric are
    much larger than the bacteria, allowing them to pass through. Most household
    filter technologies operate by gravity flow or by water pressure provided from a
    piped supply. However, some forms of ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse
    osmosis filtration may require a reliable supply of electricity to operate.
•   Granular media filters: Granular media filters include those containing sand or
    diatomaceous earth or others using discrete particles as packed beds or layers
    of surfaces over or through which water is passed. These filters retain microbes
    by a combination of physical and chemical processes, including physical strain-
    ing, sedimentation and adsorption. Some may also employ chemically active
    antimicrobial or bacteriostatic surfaces or other chemical modifications. Other
    granular media filters are biologically active because they develop layers of mi-
    crobes and their associated exopolymers on the surface of or within the granular
    medium matrix. This biologically active layer, called the schmutzdecke in conven-
    tional slow sand filters, retains microbes and often leads to their inactivation and


                                           142

    biodegradation. A household-scale filter with a biologically active surface layer
    that can be dosed intermittently with water has been developed.
•   Solar disinfection: There are a number of technologies using solar irradiation to
    disinfect water. Some use solar radiation to inactivate microbes in either dark
    or opaque containers by relying on heat from sunlight energy. Others, such as
    the solar water disinfection or SODIS system, use clear plastic containers pene-
    trated by UV radiation from sunlight that rely on the combined action of the
    UV radiation, oxidative activity associated with dissolved oxygen and heat. Other
    physical forms of solar radiation exposure systems also employ combinations of
    these solar radiation effects in other types of containers, such as UV-penetrable
    plastic bags (e.g. the “solar puddle”) and panels.
•   UV light technologies using lamps: A number of drinking-water treatment tech-
    nologies employ UV light radiation from UV lamps to inactivate microbes. For
    household- or small-scale water treatment, most employ low-pressure mercury
    arc lamps producing monochromatic UV radiation at a germicidal wavelength of
    254 nm. Typically, these technologies allow water in a vessel or in flow-through
    reactors to be exposed to the UV radiation from the UV lamps at sufficient dose
    (fluence) to inactivate waterborne pathogens. These may have limited application
    in developing countries because of the need for a reliable supply of electricity, cost
    and maintenance requirements.
•   Thermal (heat) technologies: Thermal technologies are those whose primary
    mechanism for the destruction of microbes in water is heat produced by burning
    fuel. These include boiling and heating to pasteurization temperatures (typically
    > 63 °C for 30 minutes when applied to milk). The recommended procedure
    for water treatment is to raise the temperature so that a rolling boil is achieved,
    removing the water from the heat and allowing it to cool naturally, and then
    protecting it from post-treatment contamination during storage (see the support-
    ing document Boil water; Annex 1). The above-mentioned solar technologies
    using solar radiation for heat or for a combination of heat and UV radiation from
    sunlight are distinguished from this category.
•   Coagulation, precipitation and/or sedimentation: Coagulation or precipitation is
    any device or method employing a natural or chemical coagulant or precipitant
    to coagulate or precipitate suspended particles, including microbes, to enhance
    their sedimentation. Sedimentation is any method for water treatment using the
    settling of suspended particles, including microbes, to remove them from the
    water. These methods may be used along with cloth or fibre media for a straining
    step to remove the floc (the large coagulated or precipitated particles that form in
    the water). This category includes simple sedimentation (i.e. that achieved with-
    out the use of a chemical coagulant). This method often employs a series of three
    pots or other water storage vessels in series, in which sedimented (settled) water
    is carefully transferred by decanting daily; by the third vessel, the water has been
    sequentially settled and stored a total of at least 2 days to reduce microbes.
•   Combination (multiple-barrier) treatment approaches: These are any of the above
    technologies used together, either simultaneously or sequentially, for water treat-
    ment. These combination treatments include coagulation plus disinfection, media
    filtration plus disinfection or media filtration plus membrane filtration. Some are

                                          143
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


    commercial single-use chemical products in the form of granules, powders or
    tablets containing a chemical coagulant, such as an iron or aluminium salt, and
    a disinfectant, such as chlorine. When added to water, these chemicals coagulate
    and flocculate impurities to promote rapid and efficient sedimentation and also
    deliver the chemical disinfectant (e.g. free chlorine) to inactivate microbes. Other
    combined treatment technologies are physical devices that include two or more
    stages of treatment, such as media or membrane filters or adsorbents to physically
    remove microbes and either chemical disinfectants or another physical treatment
    process (e.g. UV radiation) to kill any remaining microbes not physically removed
    by filtration or adsorption. Many of these combined household water treatment
    technologies are commercial products that can be purchased for household or
    other local use. It is important to choose commercial combination devices based
    on consideration of the treatment technologies that have been included in the
    device. It is also desirable to require that they meet specific microbial reduction
    performance criteria and preferably be certified for such performance by a cred-
    ible national or international authority, such as government or an independ­
    ent organization representing the private sector that certifies good practice and
    documented performance.
     Estimated reductions of waterborne bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites by
several of the above-mentioned household water treatment technologies are summar­
ized in Table 7.8. These reductions are based on the results of studies reported in
the scientific literature. Two categories of effectiveness are reported: baseline remov-
als and maximum removals. Baseline removals are those typically expected in actual
field practice when done by relatively unskilled persons who apply the treatment to
raw waters of average and varying quality and where there are minimum facilities or
supporting instruments to optimize treatment conditions and practices. Maximum
removals are those possible when treatment is optimized by skilled operators who
are supported with instrumentation and other tools to maintain the highest level of
performance in waters of predictable and unchanging quality (e.g. a test water seeded
with known concentrations of specific microbes). It should be noted that there are dif-
ferences in the log10 reduction value performance of certain water treatment processes
as specified for household water treatment in Table 7.8 and for central treatment in
Table 7.7. These differences in performance by the same treatment technologies are
to be expected, because central treatment is often applied to water that is of desirable
quality for the treatment process, and treatment is applied by trained operators using
properly engineered and operationally controlled processes. In contrast, household
water treatment is often applied to waters having a range of water qualities, some of
which are suboptimal for best technology performance, and the treatment is often ap-
plied without the use of specialized operational controls by people who are relatively
untrained and unskilled in treatment operations, compared with people managing
central water treatment facilities. Further details on these treatment processes, includ-
ing the factors that influence their performance and the basis for the log10 reduction
value performance levels provided in Table 7.8, can be found in the supporting docu-
ments Managing water in the home and Evaluating household water treatment options
(Annex 1).

     The values in Table 7.8 do not account for post-treatment contamination of
stored water, which may limit the effectiveness of some technologies where safe stor-
age methods are not practised. The best options for water treatment at the household
level will also employ means for safe storage, such as covered, narrow-mouthed vessels
with a tap system or spout for dispensing stored water.

      Validation, surveillance and certification of household water treatment and stor-
age are recommended, just as they are for central water supplies and systems. The enti-
ties responsible for these activities for household water treatment systems may differ
from those of central supplies. In addition, separate entities may be responsible for
validation, independent surveillance and certification. Nevertheless, validation and
surveillance as well as certification are critical for effective management of household

and other point-of-use and point-of-entry drinking-water supplies and their treat-
ment and storage technologies, just as they are for central systems (see sections 2.3
and 5.2.3).
      Non-piped water treatment technologies manufactured by or obtained from
commercial or other external sources should be certified to meet performance or ef-
fectiveness requirements or guidelines, preferably by an independent, accredited cer-
tification body. If the treatment technologies are locally made and managed by the
household itself, efforts to document effective construction and use and to monitor
performance during use are recommended and encouraged.

7.4 Microbial monitoring
Microbial monitoring can be undertaken for a range of purposes, including:
•   validation (see also section 4.1.7);
•   operational monitoring (see also sections 2.2.2 and 4.2);
•   verification (see also sections 2.4.1 and 4.3);
•   surveillance (see chapter 5);
•   source water monitoring for identifying performance targets (see sections 7.2 and
    7.3.1);
•   collecting data for QMRA (see also section 7.2.3 and the supporting document
    Quantitative microbial risk assessment: application to water safety management,
    Annex 1).
     Owing to issues relating to complexity, sensitivity of detection, cost and timeli-
ness of obtaining results, testing for specific pathogens is generally limited to assessing
raw water quality as a basis for identifying performance targets and validation, where
monitoring is used to determine whether a treatment or other process is effective in
removing target organisms. Very occasionally, pathogen testing may be performed to
verify that a specific treatment or process has been effective. However, microbial test-
ing included in verification, operational and surveillance monitoring is usually limited
to testing for indicator organisms.
     Different methods can be employed for the detection of bacteria, viruses, proto-
zoan parasites and helminths in water. The use of some methods, such as micros-
copy, relies on detection of the whole particle or organism. Other methods, such as
molecular amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), target the genomic
material, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Still other meth-
ods, such as immunological detection methods (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorb-
ent assay [ELISA]), target proteins. Culture-based methods, such as broth cultures or
agar-based bacterial media and cell cultures for viruses and phages, detect organisms
by infection or growth.
     Culture in broth or on solid media is largely applied to determine the number
of viable bacteria in water. The best known examples are culture-based methods for
indicators such as E. coli. Viruses can be detected by several methods. Using cell cul-
ture, the number of infectious viruses in water can be determined. Alternatively, viral
genomes can be detected by use of PCR. Protozoan parasites are often detected by


                                           147
                                  7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


immunomagnetic separation in combination with immunofluorescence microscopy.
PCR can also be applied. Helminths are generally detected using microscopy.
     In source investigation associated with waterborne infectious disease outbreaks,
microbial hazards are generally typed by use of PCR, which can be followed by se-
quencing analysis to improve the precision of identification. One innovative approach
is metagenome analysis (i.e. sequencing nucleic acid obtained directly from environ-
mental samples). This can detect a multitude of microbial hazards in a water sample.
     It is important to recognize that the different methods measure different proper-
ties of microorganisms. Culture-based methods detect living organisms, whereas
microscopy, detection of nucleic acid and immunological assays measure the physical
presence of microorganisms or components of them, and do not necessarily determine
if what is detected is alive or infectious. This creates greater uncertainty regarding
the significance of the human health risk compared with detection by culture-based
methods. When using non-culture methods that do not measure in units indicative of
culturability or infectivity, assumptions are often made about the fraction of pathogens
or components detected that represent viable and infectious organisms.
     The concept of using organisms such as E. coli as indicators of faecal pollution is
a well-established practice in the assessment of drinking-water quality. The criteria de-
termined for such faecal indicators are that they should not be pathogens themselves
and they should:

•       be universally present in faeces of humans and animals in large numbers;
•       not multiply in natural waters;
•       persist in water in a similar manner to faecal pathogens;
•       be present in higher numbers than faecal pathogens;
•       respond to treatment processes in a similar fashion to faecal pathogens;
•       be readily detected by simple, inexpensive culture methods.
These criteria reflect an assumption that the same organism could be used as an indi-
cator of both faecal pollution and treatment/process efficacy. However, it has become
clear that one indicator cannot fulfil these two roles and that a range of organisms
should be considered for different purposes (Table 7.9). For example, heterotrophic
bacteria can be used as operational indicators of disinfection effectiveness and dis-
tribution system cleanliness; Clostridium perfringens and coliphage can be used to
validate the effectiveness of treatment systems.
     Escherichia coli has traditionally been used to monitor drinking-water quality,
and it remains an important parameter in monitoring undertaken as part of verifica-
tion or surveillance. Thermotolerant coliforms can be used as an alternative to the test
for E. coli in many circumstances. Water intended for human consumption should
contain no faecal indicator organisms. In the majority of cases, monitoring for E. coli
or thermotolerant coliforms provides a high degree of assurance because of their large
numbers in polluted waters.

    Although E. coli is the more precise indicator of faecal pollution, the count of thermotolerant coliform bacteria is
    an acceptable alternative. If necessary, proper confirmatory tests must be carried out. Total coliform bacteria are
    not acceptable as an indicator of the sanitary quality of water supplies, particularly in tropical areas, where many
    bacteria of no sanitary significance occur in almost all untreated supplies.
c
    It is recognized that in the great majority of rural water supplies, especially in developing countries, faecal contami‑
    nation is widespread. Especially under these conditions, medium-term targets for the progressive improvement of
    water supplies should be set.



     However, increased attention has focused on the shortcomings of traditional indi-
cators, such as E. coli, as indicator organisms for enteric viruses and protozoa. Viruses
and protozoa more resistant to conventional environmental conditions or treatment
technologies, including filtration and disinfection, may be present in treated drinking-
water in the absence of E. coli. Retrospective studies of waterborne disease outbreaks
have shown that complete reliance on assumptions surrounding the absence or presence
of E. coli may not ensure safety. Under certain circumstances, it may be desirable to in-
clude more resistant microorganisms, such as bacteriophages and/or bacterial spores, as
indicators of persistent microbial hazards. Their inclusion in monitoring programmes,
including control and surveillance programmes, should be evaluated in relation to local
circumstances and scientific understanding. Such circumstances could include the use of
source water known to be contaminated with enteric viruses and parasites or where such
contamination is suspected as a result of the impacts of human and livestock waste.
     Further discussion on indicator organisms is contained in the supporting
document Assessing microbial safety of drinking water (Annex 1).
     Table 7.10 presents guideline values for verification of the microbial quality of
drinking-water. Individual values should not be used directly from the table. The
guideline values should be used and interpreted in conjunction with the information
contained in these Guidelines and other supporting documentation.
     A consequence of variable susceptibility to pathogens is that exposure to
drinking-water of a particular quality may lead to different health effects in different
populations. For derivation of national standards, it is necessary to define reference
populations or, in some cases, to focus on specific vulnerable subpopulations. Nation-
al or local authorities may wish to apply specific characteristics of their populations in
deriving national standards.

7.5 Methods of detection of faecal indicator organisms
Analysis for faecal indicator organisms provides a sensitive, although not the most
rapid, indication of pollution of drinking-water supplies. Because the growth medium
and the conditions of incubation, as well as the nature and age of the water sample,
can influence the species isolated and the count, microbiological examinations may
have variable accuracy. This means that the standardization of methods and of labora-
tory procedures is of great importance if criteria for the microbial quality of water are
to be uniform in different laboratories and internationally.
     International standard methods should be evaluated under local circumstances
before being adopted. Established standard methods are available, such as those of
the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) (Table 7.11) or methods
of equivalent efficacy and reliability. It is desirable that established standard meth-
ods be used for routine examinations. Whatever method is chosen for detection of
E. coli or thermotolerant coliforms, the importance of “resuscitating” or recovering
environmentally damaged or disinfectant-damaged strains must be considered.

7.6 Identifying local actions in response to microbial water quality
    problems and emergencies
During an emergency in which there is evidence of faecal contamination of the
drinking-water supply, it may be necessary either to modify the treatment of existing

                                               150
                                    7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


sources or to temporarily use alternative sources of drinking-water. It may be necessary
to increase disinfection at source, following treatment or during distribution.
     If microbial quality cannot be maintained, it may be necessary to advise consum-
ers to boil the water during the emergency (see section 7.6.1). Initiating superchlor­
ination and undertaking immediate corrective measures may be preferable where the
speed of response is sufficient to prevent significant quantities of contaminated water
from reaching consumers.
     During outbreaks of potentially waterborne disease or when faecal contamina-
tion of a drinking-water supply is detected, the concentration of free chlorine should
be increased to greater than 0.5 mg/l throughout the system as a minimum immediate
response. It is most important that decisions are taken in consultation with public
health authorities and, where appropriate, civil authorities (see also sections 4.4.3, 6.2
and 8.7).

7.6.1 Boil water advisories
Boil water advisories share many features with water avoidance advisories used in the
event of serious chemical contamination (see section 8.7). Water suppliers in conjunc-
tion with public health authorities should develop protocols for boil water orders.
Protocols should be prepared prior to the occurrence of incidents and incorporated
within management plans. Decisions to issue advisories are often made within a short
period of time, and developing responses during an event can complicate decision-
making, compromise communication and undermine public confidence. In addition
to the information discussed in section 4.4.3, the protocols should deal with:
•   criteria for issuing and rescinding advisories;
•   information to be provided to the general public and specific groups;
•   activities affected by the advisory.
     Protocols should identify mechanisms for the communication of boil water ad-
visories. The mechanisms may vary, depending on the nature of the supply and the
size of the community affected, and could include:
•   media releases through television, radio and newspapers;
•   telephone, e-mail and fax contact of specific facilities, community groups and
    local authorities;
•   posting of notices in conspicuous locations;
•   personal delivery;
•   mail delivery.
The methods chosen should provide a reasonable surety that all of those affected by the
advisory, including residents, workers and travellers, are notified as soon as possible.
      Boil water advisories should indicate that the water can be made safe by bringing it
to a rolling boil. After boiling, the water should be allowed to cool down on its own with-
out the addition of ice. This procedure is effective at all altitudes and with turbid water.
The types of event that should lead to consideration of boil water advisories include:
•   substantial deterioration in source water quality;

                                            151
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•    major failures associated with treatment processes or the integrity of distribution
     systems;
•    inadequate disinfection;
•    detection of pathogens or faecal indicator organisms in drinking-water;
•    epidemiological evidence suggesting that drinking-water is responsible for an
     outbreak of illness.
     Boil water advisories are a serious measure that can have substantial adverse con-
sequences. Advice to boil water can have negative public health consequences through
scalding and increased anxiety, even after the advice is rescinded. In addition, not all
consumers will follow the advice issued, even at the outset; if boil water advisories are
issued frequently or are left in place for long periods, compliance will decrease. Hence,
advisories should be issued only after careful consideration of all available informa-
tion by the public health authority and the incident response team and conclusion that
there is an ongoing risk to public health that outweighs any risk from the ad-
vice to boil water. For example, where microbial contamination is detected in samples
of drinking-water, factors that should be considered in evaluating the need for an
advisory include:
•    reliability and accuracy of results;
•    vulnerability of source water to contamination;
•    evidence of deterioration in source water quality;
•    source water monitoring results;
•    results from operational monitoring of treatment and disinfection processes;
•    disinfectant residuals;
•    physical integrity of the distribution system.
The available information should be reviewed to determine the likely source of the
contamination and the likelihood of recurrence or persistence.
     When issued, a boil water advisory should be clear and easily understood by re-
cipients, or it may be ignored. Advisories should normally include a description of the
problem, potential health risks and symptoms, activities that are affected, investigative
actions and corrective measures that have been initiated, as well as the expected time
to resolve the problem. If the advisory is related to an outbreak of illness, specific in-
formation should be provided on the nature of the outbreak, the illness and the public
health response.
     Boil water advisories should identify both affected and unaffected uses of
drinking-water supplies. Generally, the advisory will indicate that unboiled water
should not be used for drinking, preparing cold drinks, making ice, preparing or wash-
ing food or brushing teeth. Unless heavily contaminated, unboiled water will generally
be safe for bathing (providing swallowing of water is avoided) and washing clothes. A
boil water advisory could include specific advice for vulnerable subpopulations, such
as pregnant women and others who might be immunocompromised. Specific advice
should also be provided to facilities such as dental clinics, dialysis centres, doctors’
offices, hospitals and other health-care facilities, child-care facilities, schools, food sup-
pliers and manufacturers, hotels, restaurants and operators of public swimming pools
and spas.

                                  7. MICROBIAL ASPECTS


     Provision of alternative supplies of drinking-water, such as bottled water or
bulk water, should be considered when temporary boil water advisories are in place.
The protocols should identify sources of alternative supplies and mechanisms for
delivery.
     Protocols should include criteria for rescinding boil water advisories. Depending
on the reason for issuing the advisory, the criteria could include one or more of the
following:
•   evidence that source water quality has returned to normal;
•   correction of failures associated with treatment processes or distribution
    systems;
•   correction of faults in disinfection processes and restoration of normal disinfectant
    residuals;
•   where detection of microbial contamination in drinking-water initiated the
    advisory, evidence that this contamination has been removed or inactivated;
•   evidence that sufficient mains flushing or water displacement has removed
    potentially contaminated water and biofilms;
•   epidemiological evidence indicating that an outbreak has concluded.
     When boil water advisories are rescinded, information should be provided
through similar channels and to the same groups that received the original advice. In
addition, operators/managers or occupants of large buildings and buildings with stor-
age tanks should be advised of the need to ensure that storages and extensive internal
distribution systems are thoroughly flushed before normal uses are restored.

7.6.2 Actions following an incident
It is important that any incident be properly investigated and remedial action insti-
gated to prevent its recurrence. The water safety plan will require revision to take into
account the experience gained, and the findings may also be of importance in inform-
ing actions regarding other water supplies to prevent a similar event from occurring
elsewhere. Where appropriate, epidemiological investigations by the health authority
will also help to inform actions for the future.

8.1 Chemical hazards in drinking-water
A few chemical contaminants have been shown to cause adverse health effects in hu-
mans as a consequence of prolonged
exposure through drinking-water.              The lists of chemicals addressed in these Guide‑

sources.
     The substances considered here have been assessed for possible health effects, and
guideline values have been established only on the basis of health concerns. Addi-
tional consideration of the potential effects of chemical contaminants on the accept-
ability (i.e. taste, odour and appearance) of drinking-water to consumers is included
in chapter 10. Some substances of health concern have effects on the acceptability
of drinking-water that would normally lead to rejection of the water at concentra-
tions significantly lower than those of health concern. For such substances, no formal
guideline value is usually proposed, but a health-based value (see section 8.2) may be
needed, for instance, in order to assist in judging the response required when prob-
lems are encountered and in some cases to provide reassurance to health authorities
and consumers with regard to possible health risks.
     Regulators are required to establish health-based targets that must be met
through water safety plans. In the case of chemical contaminants, these are normally
based on the guideline value, which is, in turn, based on health-related end-points.
In this case, the guideline value and the local water quality target are similar, but
not necessarily identical, because the latter value may need to be adjusted to take
into account local sociocultural, economic and environmental/geological circum-
stances, as indicated in section 2.6. Guideline values provide a benchmark for the
development of local water quality targets for chemicals (usually a national stan-
dard expressing a maximum allowable concentration). Guideline values may not
directly reflect the target of 10−6 disability-adjusted life year (DALY),as these are
frequently derived based on evidence indicating a no-adverse effect or negligible
risk level. Some guideline values are based on extrapolation of the risk of cancer
from exposures at which this can be measured to low exposures where measurement
is currently not possible.
     In section 2.6, it is stated that “In developing national drinking-water standards
based on these Guidelines, it will be necessary to take account of a variety of environ­
mental, social, cultural, economic, dietary and other conditions affecting potential
exposure. This may lead to national standards that differ appreciably from these
Guidelines.” This is particularly applicable to chemical contaminants, for which there

      The probability that any par-
ticular chemical may occur in sig-
nificant concentrations in any particular setting must be assessed on a case-by-case
basis. The presence of certain chemicals may already be known within a particular
country, but others may be more difficult to assess.
      In most countries, whether developing or industrialized, water sector profes-
sionals are likely to be aware of a number of chemicals that are present in significant
concentrations in some drinking-water supplies. A body of local knowledge that has
been built up by practical experience over a period of time is invaluable. Hence, the
presence of a limited number of chemical contaminants in drinking-water is usually
already known in many countries and in many local systems. Significant problems,
even crises, can occur, however, when chemicals posing high health risk are wide-
spread but their presence is unknown, because their long-term health effect is caused
by chronic exposure as opposed to acute exposure. Such has been the case of arsenic
in groundwater in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, for example.
      For many contaminants, there will be exposure from sources other than drinking-
water, and this may need to be taken into account when setting, and considering the
need for, standards. It may also be important when considering the need for monitor-
ing. In some cases, drinking-water will be a minor source of exposure, and controlling
levels in water will have little impact on overall exposure. In other cases, controlling
a contaminant in water may be the most cost-effective way of reducing exposure.
Drinking-water monitoring strategies should therefore not be considered in isolation
from other potential routes of exposure to chemicals in the environment.
      The scientific basis for each of the guideline values is summarized in chapter 12.
This information is important in helping to adapt guideline values to suit national re-
quirements or for assessing the health significance of a contaminant that is of a higher
concentration than the guideline value.
      Chemical contaminants in drinking-water may be categorized in various ways;
however, the most appropriate is to consider the primary source of the contaminant—
that is, to group chemicals according to where control may be effectively exercised.
This aids in the development of approaches that are designed to prevent or minimize
contamination, rather than those that rely primarily on the measurement of contam­
inant levels in final waters.
      In general, approaches to the management of chemical hazards in drinking-water
vary between those where the source water is a significant contributor (with control
effected, for example, through source water selection, pollution control, treatment or
blending) and those from materials and chemicals used in the production and distribu-
tion of drinking-water (controlled by process optimization or product specification).
In these Guidelines, chemicals are therefore divided into five major source groups, as
shown in Table 8.1.

     Categories may not always be clear-cut. The group of naturally occurring con-
taminants, for example, includes many inorganic chemicals that are found in drink-
ing-water as a consequence of release from rocks and soils by rainfall, some of which
may become problematical where there is environmental disturbance, such as in min-
ing areas.

8.2 Derivation of chemical guideline values and health-based values
In order for a particular chemical constituent to be evaluated to determine whether a
guideline value or health-based value should be derived, one of the following criteria
must be satisfied:
•     There is credible evidence of occurrence of the chemical in drinking-water, com-
      bined with evidence of actual or potential toxicity.
•     The chemical is of significant international concern.
•     The chemical is being considered for inclusion or is included in the WHO Pesti-
      cide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES), which coordinates the testing and evalua-
      tion of pesticides for public health, including those applied directly to drinking-
      water for control of insect vectors of disease.
     Guideline values are derived for many chemical constituents of drinking-water. A
guideline value normally represents the concentration of a constituent that does not
result in any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption. A number of
provisional guideline values have been established at concentrations that are reason-
ably achievable through practical treatment approaches or in analytical laboratories;
in these cases, the guideline value is above the concentration that would normally
represent the calculated health-based value. Guideline values are also designated as
provisional when there is a high degree of uncertainty in the toxicological and health
data (see also section 8.2.5).
     For some chemicals, no formal guideline value is proposed, on the grounds that
occurrence is only at concentrations well below those that would be of concern for

                                                158
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


health. Establishing a formal guideline value for such substances could encourage
some Member States to incorporate the value into their national standards when this
is neither necessary nor appropriate. However, to provide guidance for Member States
should the chemical be found in drinking-water or in source water in the hazard iden-
tification phase of developing a WSP, a health-based value has been determined.
      In addition, health-based values for acute exposures are now being developed
for a small number of substances that may be implicated in emergency situations as a
result of a spill, usually to surface water sources. The derivation of these acute health-
based values is explained in section 8.7.5.




                                          158a
                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS




     There are two principal sources of information on health effects resulting from
exposure to chemicals that can be used in deriving guideline values. The first and
preferred source is studies on human populations. However, the availability of such
studies for most substances is limited, owing to the ethical barriers to conducting hu-
man toxicological studies and the lack of quantitative information on the concentra-
tion to which people have been exposed or on simultaneous exposure to other agents.
However, for a few substances, such studies are the primary basis on which guideline
values are developed. The second and most frequently used source of information is
toxicological studies using laboratory animals. The limitations of toxicological studies
include the relatively small number of experimental animals used and the relatively
high doses administered, which create uncertainty as to the relevance of particular
findings to human health. This uncertainty stems from the need to extrapolate the
results from experimental animals to humans and to the low doses to which human
populations are usually exposed. In most cases, the study used to derive the guideline
value is supported by a range of other studies, including human data, and these are
also considered in carrying out a health risk assessment.
     In order to derive a guideline value to protect human health, it is necessary to
select the most suitable study or studies. Data from well-conducted studies, where a
clear dose–response relationship has been demonstrated, are preferred. Expert judge-
ment, applied against criteria described in section 8.2.4, is exercised in the selection
of the most appropriate studies from the range of information available. Safety or
uncertainty factors using standard risk assessment principles are included to provide
conservative guideline values that are considered to be protective.

8.2.1 Approaches taken
Two approaches to the derivation of guideline values are used: one for “threshold
chemicals” and the other for “non-threshold chemicals” (mostly genotoxic carcino-
gens).
     It is generally considered that the initiating event in the process of genotoxic
chemical carcinogenesis is the induction of a mutation in the genetic material (de-
oxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) of somatic cells (i.e. cells other than ova or sperm) and
that there is a theoretical risk at any level of exposure (i.e. no threshold). In contrast,
there are carcinogens that are capable of producing tumours in experimental ani-
mals or humans without exerting a genotoxic activity, but acting through an indirect
mechanism. It is generally believed that a demonstrable threshold dose exists for non-
genotoxic carcinogens.
     In deriving guideline values for carcinogens, consideration is given to the
potential mechanisms by which the substance may cause cancer, in order to decide
whether a threshold or non-threshold approach should be used (see sections 8.2.2
and 8.2.3).


                                           159
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


    The evaluation of the potential carcinogenicity of chemical substances is usually
based on long-term laboratory animal studies. Sometimes data are available on car-
cinogenicity in humans, mostly from occupational exposure.
    On the basis of the available evidence, the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) categorizes chemical substances with respect to their potential car­
cinogenic risk into the following groups:
          Group 1:        the agent is carcinogenic to humans
          Group 2A:       the agent is probably carcinogenic to humans
          Group 2B:       the agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans
          Group 3:        the agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to
                          humans
          Group 4:        the agent is probably not carcinogenic to humans
     According to IARC, these classifications represent a first step in carcinogenic risk
assessment, which leads to a second step of quantitative risk assessment where pos-
sible. In establishing guideline values for drinking-water, the IARC evaluation of car-
cinogenic compounds, where available, is taken into consideration.

8.2.2 Threshold chemicals
For most kinds of toxicity, it is believed that there is a dose below which no adverse ef-
fect will occur. For chemicals that give rise to such toxic effects, a tolerable daily intake
(TDI) should be derived as follows, using the most sensitive end-point in the most
relevant study, preferably involving administration in drinking-water:

                                       NOAEL or LOAEL or BMDL
                   TDI     =
                                          UF and/or CSAF
where:
    NOAEL      =    no-observed-adverse-effect level
    LOAEL      =    lowest-observed-adverse-effect level
    BMDL       =    lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose
    UF         =    uncertainty factor
    CSAF       =    chemical-specific adjustment factor
The guideline value (GV) is then derived from the TDI as follows:

                                               TDI × bw × P
                               GV       =
                                                    C

where:
    bw         =    body weight (see below)
    P          =    fraction of the TDI allocated to drinking-water
    C          =    daily drinking-water consumption (see below)




                                            160
                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


Tolerable daily intake
The TDI is an estimate of the amount of a substance in food and drinking-water,
expressed on a body weight basis (milligram or microgram per kilogram of body
weight), that can be ingested over a lifetime without appreciable health risk, and with
a margin of safety.
     Acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) are established for food additives and pesticide
residues that occur in food for necessary technological purposes or plant protection
reasons. For chemical contaminants, which usually have no intended function in
drinking-water, the term “tolerable daily intake” is more appropriate than “acceptable
daily intake”, as it signifies permissibility rather than acceptability.
     Over many years, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Na-
tions (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Addi-
tives (JECFA) and the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) have
developed certain principles in the derivation of ADIs (FAO/WHO, 2009). These
principles have been adopted, where appropriate, in the derivation of TDIs used in
developing guideline values for drinking-water quality.
     As TDIs are regarded as representing a tolerable intake for a lifetime, they are not
so precise that they cannot be exceeded for short periods of time. Short-term exposure
to levels exceeding the TDI is not a cause for concern, provided the individual’s intake
averaged over longer periods of time does not appreciably exceed the level set. The
large uncertainty factors generally involved in establishing a TDI (see below) serve
to provide assurance that exposure exceeding the TDI for short periods is unlikely to
have any deleterious effects upon health. However, consideration should be given to
any potential acute effects that may occur if the TDI is substantially exceeded for short
periods of time.

No-observed-adverse-effect level and lowest-observed-adverse-effect level
The NOAEL is defined as the highest dose or concentration of a chemical in a single
study, found by experiment or observation, that causes no detectable adverse health
effect. Wherever possible, the NOAEL is based on long-term studies, preferably of
ingestion in drinking-water. However, NOAELs obtained from short-term studies and
studies using other sources of exposure (e.g. food, air) may also be used.
      If a NOAEL is not available, a LOAEL may be used, which is the lowest observed
dose or concentration of a substance at which there is a detectable adverse health ef-
fect. When a LOAEL is used instead of a NOAEL, an additional uncertainty factor is
normally applied (see below).

Benchmark dose
Increasingly, the preferred approaches for the derivation of TDIs/ADIs for thresh-
old effects include the benchmark dose (BMD) or the lower confidence limit on the
benchmark dose (BMDL) (IPCS, 1994). When appropriate data for mathematical
modelling of dose–response relationships are available, BMDLs are used as alterna-
tives to NOAELs in the calculation of health-based guideline values. In such a case,
use of the BMDL could eliminate the need for application of an additional uncer-
tainty factor to the LOAEL. The BMDL is the lower confidence limit of the dose that

produces a small increase (e.g. 5% or 10%) in the level of adverse effects. The BMDL
is derived on a quantitative basis using data from the entire dose–response curve for
the critical effect rather than from a single dose at the NOAEL or LOAEL and accounts
for the statistical power and quality of the data (IPCS, 2009).

Uncertainty factors
The application of uncertainty or safety factors has been traditionally and successfully
used in the derivation of ADIs and TDIs for food additives, pesticides and environ-
mental contaminants. The derivation of these factors requires expert judgement and
careful consideration of the available scientific evidence.
      In the derivation of guideline values, uncertainty factors are applied to the
NOAEL, LOAEL or BMD/BMDL for the response considered to be the most biologic­
ally significant.
      In relation to exposure of the general population, the NOAEL or BMD/BMDL for
the critical effect in experimental animals is normally divided by an uncertainty factor
of 100. This comprises two 10-fold factors, one for interspecies differences and one
for interindividual variability in humans (Table 8.2). Extra uncertainty factors may be
incorporated to allow for database deficiencies and for the severity or irreversibility
of effects.
      Factors lower than 10 are used, for example, for interspecies variation when hu-
mans are known to be less sensitive than the experimental animal species studied.
Inadequate studies or databases include those where a LOAEL is used instead of a
NOAEL and studies considered to be shorter in duration than desirable. Situations
in which the nature or severity of effect might warrant an additional uncertainty fac-
tor include studies in which the end-point is malformation of a fetus or in which
the end-point determining the NOAEL is directly related to possible carcinogenicity.
In the latter case, an additional uncertainty factor is usually applied for carcinogenic
compounds for which the guideline value is derived using a TDI approach rather than
a theoretical risk extrapolation approach.
      For substances for which the uncertainty factors are greater than 1000, guideline
values are designated as provisional in order to emphasize the higher level of uncer-
tainty inherent in these values. A high uncertainty factor indicates that the guideline
value may be considerably lower than the concentration at which health effects would
actually occur in a real human population. Guideline values with high uncertainty are
more likely to be modified as new information becomes available.
      The selection and application of uncertainty factors are important in the deriva-
tion of guideline values for chemicals, as they can make a considerable difference in the

                                                 162
                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


values set. For contaminants for which there is sufficient confidence in the database,
the guideline value is derived using a small uncertainty factor. For most contaminants,
however, there is greater scientific uncertainty, and a relatively large uncertainty factor
is used. The use of uncertainty factors enables the particular attributes of the chemical
and the data available to be considered in the derivation of guideline values.

Use of chemical-specific adjustment factors instead of uncertainty factors
Approaches to the derivation of TDIs are increasingly being based on understanding
of a chemical’s mode of action in order to reduce reliance on default assumptions.
This approach provides a departure from the use of default uncertainty factors (such
as a simple 10 for interspecies variation and 10 for intraspecies variation) and relies
on the use of quantitative toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data to derive CSAFs for
use in interspecies and intraspecies extrapolations (IPCS, 2005). Previously, CSAFs
were called “data-derived uncertainty factors”. The part of the CSAF approach that is
at present best developed is the use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models
to replace the default values for extrapolation between species and between differing
routes of exposure (e.g. inhalation to oral).

Relative source allocation
Drinking-water is usually not the only source of human exposure to the chemicals
for which guideline values have been derived. In many cases, the exposure to or in-
take of chemical contaminants from drinking-water is much lower than that from
other sources, such as food, air and consumer products. Some consideration of the
proportion of the ADI or TDI that may be attributed to different sources is therefore
needed in developing guideline values and risk management strategies. This approach
ensures that total daily intake from all sources (including drinking-water containing
concentrations of the chemical at or near the guideline value) does not exceed the ADI
or TDI.
     Wherever possible or in an ideal situation, derivation of guideline values uses data
on the proportion of total daily intake normally ingested in drinking-water (based
on mean levels in food, drinking-water, consumer products, soil and air), or data on
intakes estimated on the basis of physical and chemical properties of the substances
of concern. As the primary sources of exposure to chemicals are generally food (e.g.
pesticide residues) and water, it is important to quantify, whenever possible, the ex-
posures from both sources. To inform this process, it is desirable to collect as much
high-quality data as possible on food intake in different parts of the world as possible.
The data collected can then be used to estimate the proportion of the intake that
comes from food and the proportion that comes from drinking-water. However, for
most contaminants, data from the various exposure sources, most notably food and
drinking-water, are available only from developed countries.
     In the absence of adequate exposure data or where documented evidence is avail-
able regarding widespread presence in one or more of the other media (i.e. air, food,
soil or consumer products), the normal allocation of the total daily intake to drink-
ing-water is 20% (floor value), which reflects a reasonable level of exposure based on
broad experience, while still being protective (Krishnan & Carrier, 2013). This value
reflects a change from the previous allocation of 10%, which was found to be exces-

                                           163
                                  8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


sively conservative. As chemicals are progressively reassessed, overall exposure will
be reconsidered, and a change in the default allocation factor from 10% to 20% will be
made, if appropriate. Therefore, not all older guideline values reflect this change. In
some circumstances, there is clear evidence that water is the main (and possibly only)
source of exposure, such as for some of the DBPs; the allocation in such cases may be
as high as 80% (ceiling value), which still allows for some exposure from other sources
(Krishnan & Carrier, 2013). Where chemical and context-specific allocation factors
can be developed using exposure data or models, the allocation factor applied should
still be bounded by the floor and ceiling values (i.e. 20–80%).
      For pesticides, even when available food exposure data suggest that exposure
via this route is minimal, the default allocation factor of 20% is used to account for
the fact that available food exposure data do not generally include information from
developing countries, where exposure via this route may be higher.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY




     A detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the choice of allocation factor is
an essential component of the evaluation. This assists Member States in making ap-
propriate decisions about incorporating or adapting guideline values into national
standards where local circumstances need to be taken into account. It also provides
assistance in making decisions regarding potential risks when a guideline value is ex-
ceeded. As a general principle, efforts should be made to keep contaminant concentra-
tions as low as possible and not allow increases up to the guideline value.
     Although the values chosen are, in most cases, sufficient to account for additional
routes of intake (i.e. inhalation and dermal absorption) of contaminants in water,
under certain circumstances (e.g. limited ventilation), authorities may wish to take
inhalation and dermal exposure into account in adapting the guideline values to local
conditions (see section 8.2.9).
     Some elements are essential for human nutrition. In developing guideline values
and in considering allocation factors, it is necessary to take into account the recom-
mended minimum daily intake and exposures from food and to ensure that the alloca-
tion does not result in an apparent conflict with essentiality.

Default assumptions
There is variation in both the volume of water consumed daily and the body weight of
consumers. It is therefore necessary to apply some assumptions in order to determine
a guideline value. The default assumption for consumption by an adult is 2 litres of
water per day, whereas the default assumption for body weight is 60 kg.
     In some cases, the guideline value is based on children, where they are considered
to be particularly vulnerable to a particular substance. In this event, a default intake
of 1 litre is assumed for a body weight of 10 kg; where the most vulnerable group is
considered to be bottle-fed infants, an intake of 0.75 litre is assumed for a body weight
of 5 kg.

Significant figures
The calculated ADI or TDI is used to derive the guideline value, which is usually
rounded to one significant figure. In calculating the guideline value, the unrounded
ADI or TDI value should be used.
     The guideline value is generally rounded to one significant figure to reflect the
uncertainty in, for example, experimental animal toxicity data, exposure assumptions
made and the uncertainty factors selected. In a few cases, rounding to two significant
figures is appropriate because the practical impact of rounding depends on the units;
for example, rounding from 1.5 to 2.0 μg/L has less influence on treatment require-
ments than rounding from 1.5 to 2.0 mg/L. These are considered on a case-by-case
basis.

                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


     The general rounding rule for mid-way values (x.5) is to round up, in line with
common convention. Examples for rounding to one significant figure are as follows:
1.25 becomes 1, 0.73 becomes 0.7 and 1.5 becomes 2.

8.2.3 Non-threshold chemicals
In the case of compounds considered to be genotoxic carcinogens, guideline values are
normally determined using a mathematical model. Although several models exist, the
linearized multistage model is generally adopted. Other models are considered more
appropriate in certain cases. These models compute an estimate of risk at a particular
level of exposure, along with upper and lower bounds of confidence on the calcu-
lation, which may include zero at the lower bound. Guideline values are conserva-
tively presented as the concentrations in drinking-water associated with an estimated
upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk of 10−5 (or one additional case of cancer per
100 000 of the population ingesting drinking-water containing the substance at the
guideline value for 70 years). This value does not equate to the number of cases of
cancer that will be caused by exposure to the substance at this level. It is the maximum
potential risk, taking into account large uncertainties. It is highly probable that the
actual level of risk is less than this, even approaching zero, but risks at low levels of
exposure cannot be experimentally verified. The recognition that the cancer risk may
approach zero or be indistinguishable from zero stems from the uncertainties associ-
ated with mechanisms of carcinogenesis, including the role of the chemical in the
cancer process and the possibility of detoxification and repair mechanisms. Member
States may consider that a different level of hypothetical risk is more appropriate to
their circumstances, and values relating to risks of 10−4 or 10−6 additional cancer cases
over a lifetime of exposure may be determined by respectively multiplying or dividing
the guideline value by 10.
     The mathematical models used for deriving guideline values for non-threshold
chemicals cannot be verified experimentally, and they do not usually take into ac-
count a number of biologically important considerations, such as pharmacokinetics,
pre-systemic and metabolic detoxification, DNA repair or protection by the immune
system. They also assume the validity of a linear extrapolation of very high dose expos­
ures in test animals to very low dose exposures in humans. As a consequence, the mod-
els used are conservative (i.e. err on the side of caution). The guideline values derived
using these models should be interpreted differently from TDI-derived values because
of the lack of precision of the models. Moderate short-term exposure to levels exceeding
the guideline value for non-threshold chemicals does not significantly affect the risk.

8.2.4 Data quality
The following factors were taken into account in assessing the quality and reliability
of available information:
•   Oral studies are preferred (in particular, drinking-water studies), using the pure
    substance with appropriate dosing regime and a good quality clinical biochem-
    istry and histopathology.



                                          165
                               GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


•    The database should be sufficiently broad that all potential toxicological end-
     points of concern have been identified.
•    The quality of the studies is such that they are considered reliable; for example,
     there has been adequate consideration of confounding factors in epidemiological
     studies.
•    There is reasonable consistency between studies; the end-point and study used to
     derive a guideline value do not contradict the overall weight of evidence.
•    For inorganic substances, there is some consideration of speciation in drinking-
     water.
•    There is appropriate consideration of multimedia exposure in the case of epi­
     demiological studies.
     In the development of guideline values, existing international approaches are
carefully considered. In particular, previous risk assessments developed by the Inter-
national Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) in Environmental Health Criteria
monographs and Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents, IARC,
JMPR and JECFA are reviewed. These assessments are relied upon except where new
information justifies a reassessment, but the quality of new data is critically evaluated
before it is used in any risk assessment. Where international reviews are not available,
other sources of data are used in the derivation of guideline values, including pub-
lished reports from peer-reviewed open literature, national reviews recognized to be
of high quality, information submitted by governments and other interested parties
and, to a limited extent, unpublished proprietary data (primarily for the evaluation of
pesticides).

8.2.5 Provisional guideline values
The use and designation of provisional guideline values are outlined in Table 8.3.
    For non-threshold substances, in cases in which the concentration associated
with an upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk of 10−5 is not feasible as a result of in-
adequate analytical or treatment technology, a provisional guideline value (designated
A or T, respectively) is recommended at a practicable level.

8.2.6 Chemicals with effects on acceptability
Some substances of health concern have effects on the taste, odour or appearance
of drinking-water that would normally lead to rejection of water at concentrations
significantly lower than those of concern for health. Such substances are not normally
appropriate for routine monitoring. However, guideline values have been established
for some substances that may cause taste or odour in drinking-water at concentra-
tions much lower than the guideline values because there is such a wide range in the
ability of consumers to detect them by taste or odour. For such substances, a fact sheet
and health-based guideline value (see chapter 12) are presented in the usual way. In
the fact sheet, the relationship between concentrations relevant to health and those
relevant to the acceptability of the drinking-water is explained. In tables of guideline
values, the health-based guideline values are designated with a “C”. For other sub-
stances, health-based guideline values may be needed, for instance, in order to assist
in judging the response that is required when problems are encountered and in some
cases to provide reassurance to health authorities and consumers with regard to pos-
sible health risks.

8.2.7 Chemicals not included in the Guidelines
Additional information on many chemicals not included in these Guidelines is avail-
able from several credible sources, including WHO Environmental Health Criteria
monographs and Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents (http://
www.who.int/ipcs/en/), chemical risk assessment reports from JMPR, JECFA and
IARC and published documents from a number of national sources, such as the United
States Environmental Protection Agency. Although these information sources may not
have been reviewed for these Guidelines, they have been peer reviewed and provide
readily accessible information on the toxicology of many additional chemicals. They
can help drinking-water suppliers and health officials decide upon the significance (if
any) of a detected chemical and on the response that might be appropriate.

8.2.8 Mixtures
Chemical contaminants of drinking-water supplies are present with numerous other
inorganic and organic constituents. The guideline values are calculated separately for
individual substances, without specific consideration of the potential for interaction
of each substance with other compounds present. Synergistic interactions between
substances are usually selective and very limited, especially at the very low levels usu-
ally encountered in drinking-water. The large margin of uncertainty incorporated in
the majority of the guideline values is considered to be sufficient to account for poten-
tial interactions. In addition, the majority of contaminants will not be continuously
present at concentrations at or near their guideline value.
      For many chemical contaminants, mechanisms of toxicity are different; con­
sequently, there is no reason to assume that there are interactions. There may, however,
be occasions when a number of contaminants with similar toxicological mechanisms
are present at levels near their respective guideline values. In such cases, decisions
concerning appropriate action should be made, taking into consideration local


                                          167
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


circumstances. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, it is appropriate to assume that
the toxic effects of these compounds are additive.

8.2.9 Adapting guideline values to local circumstances
In order to account for the variations in exposure from different sources in differ-
ent parts of the world, default values, generally between 20% and 80%, are used to
make an allocation of the TDI to drinking-water in setting guideline values for many
chemicals. Where relevant exposure data are available, authorities are encouraged
to develop context-specific guideline values that are tailored to local circumstances
and conditions. For example, in areas where the intake of a particular contaminant in
drinking-water is known to be much greater than that from other sources (e.g. air and
food), it may be appropriate to allocate a greater proportion of the TDI to drinking-
water to derive a guideline value more suited to the local conditions.
     Daily water intake can vary significantly in different parts of the world, season-
ally and particularly where consumers are involved in manual labour in hot climates.
Local adjustments to the daily water consumption value may be needed in setting
local standards, as in the case of fluoride, for example. For most other substances, the
drinking-water intake range is very small (perhaps a factor of 2–4) compared with the
much larger range in the toxicological uncertainty factors; hence, no such adjustment
is necessary.
     Volatile substances in water may be released to the atmosphere in showering and
through a range of other household activities. Under such circumstances, inhalation
may become a significant route of exposure. Some substances may also be absorbed
through the skin during bathing, but this is not usually a major source of uptake. For
those substances that are particularly volatile, such as chloroform, the correction fac-
tor would be approximately equivalent to a doubling of exposure, which is small in
relation to the uncertainties inherent in the derivation of guideline values. However,
in some parts of the world, houses have a very low rate of ventilation, and authorities
may wish to take inhalation exposure into account in adapting the guideline values to
local conditions, although other uncertainty factors used in the quantitative assess-
ments may render this unnecessary. Where such exposure is shown to be important
for a particular substance (i.e. high volatility, low ventilation rates and high rates of
showering/bathing), it may be appropriate to adjust the guideline value accordingly.

8.3 Analytical achievability
As noted above, guideline values are not set at concentrations of substances that can-
not reasonably be measured. In such circumstances, provisional guideline values are
set at the reasonable analytical limits.
     Guidance provided in this section and in Annex 4 is intended to assist readers to
select appropriate analytical methods for specific circumstances. In carrying out haz-
ard identification and risk assessment and for verification and auditing of the water
safety plan for chemical contaminants, it is usually necessary to carry out some an­
alysis. It is important that appropriate facilities are available to ensure that suitable
methods are used in carrying out chemical analysis.

                                  8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


     Various collections of “standard” or “recommended” methods for water analysis
are published by a number of national and international agencies. It is often thought
that adequate analytical accuracy can be achieved provided that all laboratories use
the same standard method. Experience shows that this is not always the case, as a var­
iety of factors may affect the accuracy of the results. Examples include reagent purity,
apparatus type and performance, degree of modification of the method in a particular
laboratory and the skill and care of the analyst. These factors are likely to vary both
between laboratories and over time in an individual laboratory. Moreover, the preci-
sion and accuracy that can be achieved with a particular method frequently depend
upon the adequacy of sampling and nature of the sample (“matrix”). While it is not
essential to use standard methods, it is important that the methods used are properly
validated and their precision and accuracy determined before significant decisions are
made based on the results. In the case of “nonspecific” variables such as taste, odour,
colour and turbidity, the result is method specific, and this needs to be considered
when using the data to make comparisons.
     A number of considerations are important in selecting methods:
•   The overriding consideration is that the method chosen is demonstrated to have
    the required accuracy. Other factors, such as speed and convenience, should be
    considered only in selecting among methods that meet this primary criterion.
•   Of primary importance is the expertise and diligence of the laboratories per-
    forming the analyses. They must utilize auditable quality control and quality as-
    surance procedures for their results to be credible. External certification is highly
    desirable.
•   There are a number of markedly different procedures for measuring and reporting
    the errors to which all methods are subject. This complicates and prejudices the
    effectiveness of method selection, and suggestions for standardizing such proce-
    dures have been made. It is therefore desirable that details of all analytical methods
    are published together with performance characteristics that can be interpreted
    unambiguously.
•   If the analytical results from one laboratory are to be compared with those from
    others or with a numerical standard, it is obviously preferable for them not to
    have any associated systematic error. In practice, this is not possible, but each
    laboratory should select methods whose systematic errors have been thoroughly
    evaluated and shown to be acceptably small.
     A qualitative ranking of analytical methods based on their degree of technical
complexity is given in Table 8.4 for inorganic chemicals and in Table 8.5 for organic
chemicals. These groups of chemicals are separated, as the analytical methods used
differ greatly. The higher the ranking, the more complex the process in terms of equip-
ment or operation. In general, higher rankings are also associated with higher total
costs.
     Analytical achievabilities, based on detection limits, of the inorganic and organic
chemicals for which guideline values have been established are given in Annex 4, by
source category.

     Many kinds of field test kits are available to measure the concentrations of various
chemicals in water. These are generally used for compliance examinations as well as
for operational monitoring of drinking-water quality. Although the field test kits have
the advantage of being simple to use in non-laboratory environments and are often
available at relatively low prices, their analytical accuracy is generally less than that of
the methods shown in Tables 8.4 and 8.5. However, when properly used, they provide
valuable tools for rapidly assessing numerous contaminants in a non-formal labora-
tory setting at low cost compared with commercial laboratory tests. It is therefore
necessary to check the validity of the field test kit before applying it.
     A brief description of the analytical methods listed in Tables 8.4 and 8.5 is pro-
vided in Annex 4.

8.4 Treatment
As noted above, where a health-based guideline value cannot be achieved by reason-
ably practicable treatment, then the guideline value is designated as provisional and
set at the concentration that can be reasonably achieved through treatment.
     Collection, treatment, storage and distribution of drinking-water involve deliber-
ate additions of numerous chemicals to improve the safety and quality of the finished
drinking-water for consumers (direct additives). In addition, water is in constant con-
tact with pipes, valves, taps and tank surfaces, all of which have the potential to impart
additional chemicals to the water (indirect additives). The chemicals used in water
treatment or from materials in contact with drinking-water are discussed in more
detail in section 8.5.4.

8.4.1 Treatment performance
Treatment performance varies according to local conditions and circumstances. The
ability to achieve a guideline value within a drinking-water supply depends on a
number of factors, including:
•    the concentration of the chemical in the raw water;
•    control measures employed throughout the drinking-water system;
•    nature of the raw water (groundwater or surface water, presence of natural or-
     ganic matter and inorganic solutes and other components, such as turbidity);
•    treatment processes already installed.
If a guideline value cannot be met with the existing system, then additional treat-
ment may need to be considered, or water might need to be obtained from alternative
sources.
      The cost of achieving a guideline value will depend on the complexity of any
additional treatment or other control measures required. It is not possible to pro-
vide general quantitative information on the cost of achieving individual guideline
values. Treatment costs (capital and operating) will depend not only on the factors
identified above, but also on issues such as plant throughput; local costs for labour,
civil and mechanical works, chemicals and electricity; life expectancy of the plant; and
so on. Guideline values may be progressively achieved in the long term through less
capital-intensive non-treatment options, such as through agreements with land users
to reduce application of chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, etc.)
      A qualitative ranking of treatment processes based on their degree of technical
complexity is given in Table 8.6. The higher the ranking, the more complex the process
in terms of plant or operation. In general, higher rankings are also associated with
higher costs.
      Annex 5 summarizes the treatment processes that are capable of removing chem-
ical contaminants of health significance. The tables in Annex 5 include only those
chemicals, by source category, for which some treatment data are available and for
which guideline values have been established.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     The tables in Annex 5 are provided to help inform decisions regarding the ability
of existing treatment to meet guidelines and what additional treatment might need
to be installed. They have been compiled on the basis of published literature, which
includes mainly laboratory experiments, some pilot plant investigations and relatively
few full-scale studies of water treatment processes. Consequently:
•   Many of the treatments outlined are designed for larger treatment plants and
    may not necessarily be appropriate for smaller treatment plants or individual-
    type treatment. In these cases, the choice of technology must be made on a case-
    by-case basis.
•   The information is probably “best case”, as the data would have been obtained
    under laboratory conditions or with a carefully controlled plant for the purposes
    of experimentation.
•   Actual process performance will depend on the concentration of the chemical in
    the raw water and on general raw water quality. For example, chlorination and
    removal of organic chemicals and pesticides using activated carbon or ozonation
    will be impaired if there is a high concentration of natural organic matter.
•   For many contaminants, potentially several different processes could be appro-
    priate, and the choice between processes should be made on the basis of tech-
    nical complexity and cost, taking into account local circumstances. For example,
    membrane processes can remove a broad spectrum of chemicals, but simpler and
    cheaper alternatives are effective for the removal of most chemicals.
•   It is normal practice to use a series of unit processes (e.g. coagulation, sedimenta-
    tion, filtration, chlorination) to achieve desired water quality objectives. Each of
    these may contribute to the removal of chemicals. It may be technically and eco-
    nomically advantageous to use a combination of processes (e.g. ozonation plus
    granular activated carbon or membranes) to remove particular chemicals.
•   The effectiveness of potential processes should be assessed using laboratory or
    pilot plant tests on the actual raw water concerned. These tests should be of suf-
    ficient duration to identify potential seasonal or other temporal variations in con-
    taminant concentrations and process performance.
•   These treatment technology characterizations are estimates and are not compre-
    hensive, but are intended to provide some indications of the types of technologies
    that have shown greater or lesser capabilities for removing the indicated chemi-
    cals from drinking-water.
     A brief description of the various treatment processes referred to in Table 8.6 is
included in Annex 5.

8.4.2 Process control measures for disinfection by-products
All chemical disinfectants produce inorganic or organic DBPs that may be of concern.
     The principal DBPs formed during chlorination are THMs, HAAs, haloketones
and haloacetonitriles, as a result of chlorination of naturally occurring organic pre-
cursors such as humic substances. Monochloramine produces lower THM concentra-
tions than chlorine but produces other DBPs, including cyanogen chloride.

A range of other DBPs, including          out the distribution system.
aldehydes and carboxylic acids,
may also be formed. Of particular
concern is bromate, formed by the oxidation of bromide. Bromate may also be present
in some sources of hypochlorite, but usually at concentrations that will give rise to
levels in final water that are below the guideline value.
     The main by-products from the use of chlorine dioxide are chlorite ion, which is
an inevitable decomposition product, and chlorate ion. Chlorate is also produced in
hypochlorate as it ages.
     The basic strategies that can be adopted for reducing the concentrations of DBPs are:
•    changing the process conditions (including removal of precursor compounds
     prior to application);
•    using a different chemical disinfectant with a lower propensity to produce by-
     products with the source water;
•    using non-chemical disinfection;
•    removing DBPs prior to distribution.

Changes to process conditions
The formation of THMs during chlorination can be reduced by removing precur-
sors prior to contact with chlorine—for example, by installing or enhancing coagula-
tion (this may involve using higher coagulant doses or lower coagulation pH values
than are applied conventionally). DBP formation can also be reduced by lowering
the applied chlorine dose; if this is done, it must be ensured that disinfection is still
effective.
     The pH value during chlorination affects the distribution of chlorinated by-
products. Reducing the pH lowers the THM concentration, but at the expense of
increased formation of HAAs. Conversely, increasing the pH reduces HAA production
but leads to increased THM formation.
     The formation of bromate during ozonation depends on several factors, includ-
ing concentrations of bromide and ozone and the pH. It is not practicable to remove
bromide from raw water, and it is difficult to remove bromate once formed, although
granular activated carbon filtration has been reported to be effective under certain cir-
cumstances. Bromate formation can be minimized by using lower ozone dose, shorter
contact time and a lower residual ozone concentration. Operating at lower pH (e.g.
pH 6.5) followed by raising the pH after ozonation also reduces bromate formation,
and addition of ammonia can also be effective. Addition of hydrogen peroxide can
either increase or decrease bromate formation, depending on the point at which it is
applied and local treatment conditions.

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Changing disinfectants
It may be feasible to change disinfectant in order to achieve guideline values for DBPs.
The extent to which this is possible will be dependent on the raw water quality and
installed treatment (e.g. for precursor removal).
     It may be effective to change from chlorine to monochloramine to provide a
secondary disinfectant residual within distribution, in order to reduce THM for-
mation and subsequent development within the distribution system. Although
monochloramine provides a more stable residual within distribution, it is a less
powerful disinfectant and should not be used as a primary disinfectant.
     Chlorine dioxide can be considered as a potential alternative to both chlorine and
ozone disinfection, although it does not provide a residual effect, as chlorine would.
The main concerns with chlorine dioxide are with the residual concentrations of
chlorine dioxide and the by-products chlorite and chlorate. These can be addressed by
controlling the dose of chlorine dioxide at the treatment plant.

Non-chemical disinfection
Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation or membrane processes can be considered as alternatives
to chemical disinfection. UV is particularly effective at inactivating Cryptosporidium,
which is extremely resistant to chlorination. Neither of these provides any residual
disinfection, and it may be considered appropriate to add a small dose of a persistent
disinfectant such as chlorine or monochloramine to act as a preservative during dis-
tribution.

Removing DBPs prior to distribution
It is technically feasible to remove DBPs prior to distribution; however, this is the least
attractive option for controlling DBP concentrations. Strategies for DBP control in-
clude source control, precursor removal, use of alternative disinfectants and removal
of DBPs by technologies such as air stripping, activated carbon, UV light and ad-
vanced oxidation. These processes would need to be followed by a further disinfection
step to guard against microbial contamination and to ensure a residual concentration
of disinfectant within distribution.

8.4.3 Treatment for corrosion control
Corrosion is the partial dissolution of the materials constituting the treatment and
supply systems, tanks, pipes, valves and pumps. In certain circumstances, all water
can be corrosive. Corrosion may lead to structural failure, leaks, loss of capacity and
deterioration of chemical and microbial water quality. The internal corrosion of pipes
and fittings can have a direct impact on the concentration of water constituents, in-
cluding lead and copper. Corrosion control is therefore an important aspect of the
management of a drinking-water system for safety.
     Corrosion control involves many parameters, including the concentrations of
calcium, bicarbonate, carbonate and dissolved oxygen, as well as pH. The detailed
requirements differ depending on water quality and the materials used in the distribu-
tion system. The pH controls the solubility and rate of reaction of most of the metal
species involved in corrosion reactions. It is particularly important in relation to the


                                           174
                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


formation of a protective film at the metal surface. For some metals, alkalinity (car-
bonate and bicarbonate) and calcium (hardness) also affect corrosion rates.
Characterizing corrosivity
Most of the indices that have been developed to characterize the corrosion potential
of waters are based on the assumption that water with a tendency to deposit a calcium
carbonate scale on metal surfaces will be less corrosive. The Langelier index is the dif-
ference between the actual pH of a water and its “saturation pH”, this being the pH at
which a water of the same alkalinity and calcium hardness would be at equilibrium
with solid calcium carbonate. Waters with a positive Langelier index are capable of
depositing calcium carbonate scale from solution.
     There is no corrosion index that applies to all materials, and corrosion indices,
particularly those related to calcium carbonate saturation, have given mixed results.
The parameters related to calcium carbonate saturation status are, strictly speaking,
indicators of the tendency to deposit or dissolve calcium carbonate (calcite) scale, not
indicators of the “corrosivity” of a water. For example, there are many waters with a
negative Langelier index that are non-corrosive and many with a positive Langelier
index that are corrosive. Nevertheless, there are many documented instances of the
use of saturation indices for corrosion control based on the concept of laying down
a protective “eggshell” scale of calcite in iron pipes. In general, waters with high pH,
calcium and alkalinity are less corrosive, and this tends to be correlated with a positive
Langelier index. However, these calcium carbonate precipitation indices are not neces-
sarily considered to be good corrosion predictors for copper systems.
     The ratio of the chloride and sulfate concentrations to the bicarbonate concen-
tration (Larson ratio) has been shown to be helpful in assessing the corrosiveness of
water to cast iron and steel. A similar approach has been used in studying zinc dissolu-
tion from brass fittings—the Turner diagram.
Water treatment for corrosion control
To control corrosion in water distribution networks, the methods most commonly
applied are adjusting pH, increasing the alkalinity or hardness or adding corrosion
inhibitors, such as polyphosphates, silicates and orthophosphates. The quality and
maximum dose to be used should be in line with specifications for such water treat-
ment chemicals. Although pH adjustment is an important approach, its possible im-
pact on other aspects of water supply technology, including disinfection, must always
be taken into account.
     It is not always possible to achieve the desired values for all parameters. For ex-
ample, the pH of hard waters cannot be increased too much, or softening will occur.
The application of lime and carbon dioxide to soft waters can be used to increase both
the calcium concentration and the alkalinity to at least 40 mg/l as calcium carbonate.
     More detailed information on the corrosion of various metals commonly used in
water treatment and distribution systems can be found in Annex 5.

8.4.4 Household treatment
The chemicals of greatest health concern in some natural waters are usually excess
natural fluoride, nitrate/nitrite and arsenic.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Some commercial water treatment technologies are available for small applica-
tions for the removal of chemical contaminants. For example, anion exchange using
activated alumina or iron-containing products will effectively reduce excess fluoride
concentrations. Bone char has also been used to reduce fluoride concentrations. Ar-
senic is also removed by anion exchange processes similar to those employed for fluor­
ide. Nitrates and nitrates, which are frequently present due to sewage contamination
or agricultural runoff, are best managed by protecting the source water from contam-
ination. They are difficult to remove, although disinfection will oxidize nitrite, the
more toxic form, to nitrate. In addition, disinfection will sanitize the water and reduce
the risk of gastrointestinal infection, which is a risk factor for methaemoglobinaemia
caused by excess nitrate/nitrite exposure of infants up to approximately 3–6 months
of age.
     Cation exchange water softening is widely used in homes to remove excess hard-
ness due to high calcium or magnesium, and it can also remove metals including iron
and radium.
     Synthetic and natural organic chemicals can be removed by granular activated
carbon or carbon block technologies. The treatment systems must be well managed
and replaced regularly, because their effectiveness is eventually lost, depending upon
the types of contaminating chemicals and their concentrations in the water. Reverse
osmosis technologies have general applicability for removal of most organic and in-
organic chemicals; however, there is some selectivity, and also there is a significant
amount of water wastage when low-pressure units are used in small-volume applica-
tions.

8.5 Guideline values for individual chemicals, by source category
8.5.1 Naturally occurring chemicals
There are a number of sources of naturally occurring chemicals in drinking-water.
All natural water contains a range of inorganic and organic chemicals. The former
derive from the rocks and soil through which water percolates or over which it flows.
The latter derive from the breakdown of plant material or from algae and other
microorganisms that grow in the water or on sediments. Most of the naturally occur-
ring chemicals for which guideline values have been derived or that have been con-
sidered for guideline value derivation are inorganic. Only one, microcystin-LR, a toxin
produced by cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, is organic. Cyanobacteria (see also
section 11.5) occur widely in lakes, reservoirs, ponds and slow-flowing rivers. Many
species are known to produce toxins, or “cyanotoxins”, which are of concern for health.
Cyanotoxins vary in structure and may be found within cells or released into water.
There is wide variation in the toxicity of recognized cyanotoxins (including different
structural variants within a group, such as microcystins), and it is likely that further
toxins remain unrecognized, so control of blooms is the preferred control option.
     The approach to dealing with naturally occurring chemicals will vary according
to the nature of the chemical and the source. For inorganic contaminants that arise
from rocks and sediments, it is important to screen possible water sources to deter-
mine whether the source is suitable for use or whether it will be necessary to treat the

water to remove the contaminants of concern along with microbial contaminants. In
some cases, where a number of sources may be available, dilution or blending of the
water containing high levels of a contaminant with a water containing much lower
levels may achieve the desired result.
     A number of the most important chemical contaminants (i.e. those that have
been shown to cause adverse health effects as a consequence of exposure through
drinking-water) fall into the category of naturally occurring chemicals. Some naturally
occurring chemicals have other primary sources and are therefore discussed in other
sections of this chapter.

products containing the chemicals. In some cases, inappropriate handling and dis-
posal may lead to contamination (e.g. degreasing agents that are allowed to reach
groundwater). Some of these chemicals, particularly inorganic substances, may also
be encountered as a consequence of natural contamination, but this may also be a by-
product of industrial activity, such as mining, that changes drainage patterns. Many
of these chemicals are used in small industrial units within human settlements, and,
particularly where such units are found in groups of similar enterprises, they may be a
significant source of pollution. Petroleum oils are widely used in human settlements,
and improper handling or disposal can lead to significant pollution of surface water
and groundwater. Where plastic pipes are used, the smaller aromatic molecules in
petroleum oils can sometimes penetrate the pipes where they are surrounded by earth
soaked in the oil, with subsequent pollution of the local water supply.
      A number of chemicals can reach water as a consequence of disposal of general
household chemicals; in particular, a number of heavy metals may be found in do-
mestic wastewater. Where wastewater is treated, these will usually partition out into
the sludge. Some chemicals that are widely used both in industry and in materials
used in a domestic setting are found widely in the environment (e.g. di(2-ethylhexyl)­
phthalate), and these may be found in water sources, although usually at low concen-
trations.
      Some chemicals that reach drinking-water from industrial sources or human
settlements have other primary sources and are therefore discussed in other sections
of this chapter. Where latrines and septic tanks are poorly sited, these can lead to con-
tamination of drinking-water sources with nitrate (see section 8.5.3).
      Identification of the potential for contamination by chemicals from industrial ac-
tivities and human dwellings requires assessment of activities in the catchment and of

agriculture are pesticides, although their presence will depend on many factors, and
not all pesticides are used in all circumstances or climates. Contamination can result
from application and subsequent movement following rainfall or from inappropriate
disposal methods.
     Some pesticides are also used in non-agricultural circumstances, such as the con-

     Guideline values and health-based values are protective against health effects
resulting from lifetime exposure. Small exceedances for short periods would not nor-
mally constitute a health emergency. In the event of a spill, a higher allocation of the
ADI to drinking-water could be justified. Alternatively, in cases where acute health-
based values have been derived, normally based on JMPR evaluations, these may
provide useful guidance (for further information, see section 8.7.5).
     Routine monitoring of pesticides is generally not considered necessary. Member
States should consider local usage and potential situations such as spills in deciding
whether and where to monitor. In the event that monitoring results show levels above
the guideline value or health-based value on a regular basis, it is advisable that a plan
be developed and implemented to address the situation.
     As a general principle, efforts should be made to keep the concentration of pesti-
cides in water as low as possible, and to not allow concentrations to increase up to the
guideline value or health-based value.

  For substances that are considered to be carcinogenic, the guideline value is the concentration in drinking-water
  associated with an upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk of 10−5 (one additional cancer per 100 000 of the
  population ingesting drinking-water containing the substance at the guideline value for 70 years). Concentrations
  associated with estimated upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risks of 10−4 and 10−6 can be calculated by multiplying
  and dividing, respectively, the guideline value by 10.

(e.g. salts, coagulant polymer residues or monomers). Chloramine and chlorine dis-
infectant residuals, for example, are deliberate additives, and their presence confers
a benefit. Others, such as DBPs, are generated during chemical interactions between
disinfectant chemicals and substances normally in water (Table 8.14). Chlorination
by-products and other DBPs may also occur in swimming pools, from which exposure
by inhalation and skin absorption will be of greater importance (WHO, 2006).
      Other chemicals, such as lead or copper from pipes or brass taps and chemicals
leaching from coatings, may be taken up from contact with surfaces during treatment
or distribution (indirect or unintentional additives).
      Some chemicals used in water treatment (e.g. aluminium) or in materials in con-
tact with drinking-water (e.g. styrene) have other principal sources and are therefore
discussed in detail in other sections of this chapter.
      Many of these additives, both direct and indirect or unintentional, are compon­
ents of processes for producing safe drinking-water. The approach to monitoring and
management is preferably through control of the material or chemical. It is import­
ant to optimize treatment processes and to ensure that such processes remain opti-
mized in order to control residuals of chemicals used in treatment and to control the
formation of DBPs. Inadvertent contamination caused by poor quality materials is
best controlled by applying specifications governing the composition of the products
themselves rather than by setting limits on the quality of finished water, whereas con-
tamination due to the inappropriate use of additives can be addressed by guidance on
use. Similarly, regulations on the quality of pipe can avoid possible contamination of
water by leachable materials. Control of contamination from in situ applied coatings
requires suitable codes of practice on their application in addition to controls on the
composition of materials.
      Numerous national and third-party evaluation and approval systems for additives
and materials for contact with drinking-water exist throughout the world; however,

many countries do not have or operate such systems. Governments and other organiz­
ations should consider establishing or adapting additive management systems and set-
ting product quality standards and guidance on use that would apply to determining
acceptable water contact products. Ideally, harmonized standards between countries
or reciprocal recognition would reduce costs and increase access to such standards
(see also section 1.2.9).

Indicator substances for monitoring chlorination by-products
Although guideline values have been established for a number of chlorination
by‑products, data from drinking-water supplies indicate that THMs and HAAs are
adequate as indicators of the majority of chlorination by-products. The most appro-

priate means of controlling chlorination by-products is to remove the organic precur-
sors, which are largely of natural origin. Measurement of THMs and, if appropriate,
HAAs (e.g. where water is chlorinated at a low pH) can be used to optimize treatment
efficiency and to establish the boundaries of other operational parameters that can be
used to monitor treatment performance. In these circumstances, monitoring frequen-
cies of other chlorination by-products can be reduced. Although total organohalogen
does not correlate well with either THMs or HAAs, it is a measure of total chlorination
by-products and may be another potential indicator for operational purposes.

  For substances that are considered to be carcinogenic, the guideline value is the concentration in drinking-water
  associated with an upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk of 10−5 (one additional case of cancer per 100 000 of the
  population ingesting drinking-water containing the substance at the guideline value for 70 years). Concentrations
  associated with estimated upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risks of 10−4 and 10−6 can be calculated by multiplying
  and dividing, respectively, the guideline value by 10.



     In all circumstances, disinfection efficiency should not be compromised in try-
ing to meet guidelines for DBPs, including chlorination by-products, or in trying to
reduce concentrations of these substances.

Contaminants from storage and generation of hypochlorite solutions
Sodium hypochlorite solutions slowly decompose—more rapidly at warmer temper-
atures—to produce chlorate and chlorite ions. As the solution ages and the available
chlorine concentration decreases, it is necessary to dose more product to achieve the
desired residual chlorine concentration, with a consequent increase in the amounts
of chlorate and chlorite added to the treated water. The decomposition of solid cal-
cium hypochlorite is much slower, and consequently contamination is less likely to be
significant. However, if calcium hypochlorite solutions are prepared and stored before
use, then decomposition to form chlorate and chlorite would also occur.

                                                        188
                                  8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


     Sodium hypochlorite is manufactured by electrolysing sodium chloride dissolved
in water, which would naturally also contain small concentrations of sodium bro-
mide. This results in the presence of bromate in the sodium hypochlorite solution and
will contribute bromate to the treated water. The quality and acceptability of sodium
hypochlorite will partly be a function of the concentration of the bromate residue.
Industrial-grade product may not be acceptable for drinking-water applications. The
sodium bromide naturally present in sodium chloride will also be oxidized to form
bromate in systems using on-site electrochemical generation of hypochlorite.

Contaminants from use of ozone and chlorine dioxide
The use of ozone can lead to elevated bromate concentrations through oxidation of
bromide present in the water. As a general rule, the higher the bromide concentration
in the water, the more bromate that is produced.
     Chlorine dioxide solutions can contain chlorate as a result of reactions that com-
pete with the desired reaction for generation of chlorine dioxide. Chlorite ion is an
inevitable decomposition product from the use of chlorine dioxide; typically, 60–70%
of the applied dose is converted to chlorite in the treated water.

8.5.5 Chemicals of emerging concern
Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceuticals can be introduced into water sources in sewage by excretion from
individuals using these chemicals, from uncontrolled drug disposal (e.g. discarding
drugs into toilets) and from agricultural runoff from livestock manure. They have be-
come chemicals of emerging concern to the public because of their potential to reach
drinking-water.
     The specific types of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in water sources can
differ between countries or regions depending on social, cultural, technological and
agricultural factors. Urban and rural areas may exhibit important differences in the
occurrence and concentrations of these chemicals as a result of different usage pat-
terns. The local physical and chemical characteristics of source waters can also affect
the occurrence levels of pharmaceuticals by influencing their natural degradation.
     Most occurrence data in drinking-water and source water have resulted from tar-
geted investigations, rather than from systematic monitoring. Advancements in the
sensitivity and accuracy of detection technologies and methodologies have led to in-
creasing detection of trace amounts of pharmaceuticals, ranging from concentrations
in the nanogram per litre to low microgram per litre range (although largely less than
0.1 µg/l) in drinking-water, surface water and groundwater. Higher concentrations of
these contaminants are found in wastewater treatment effluents or wastewater dis-
charges from poorly controlled manufacturing facilities.
     The concentrations of pharmaceuticals found in drinking-water are typically orders
of magnitude less than the lowest therapeutic doses. Therefore, exposure to individual
compounds in drinking-water is unlikely to have appreciable adverse impacts on human
health. Formal guideline values are therefore not proposed in these Guidelines.
     Routine monitoring for pharmaceuticals in drinking-water and additional or
specialized drinking-water treatment to reduce the concentrations of pharmaceuticals

                                         189
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


in drinking-water are not considered necessary. However, where local circumstances
indicate a potential for elevated concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking-water,
investigative monitoring and surveys of impacted water sources can be undertaken
to assess possible exposure. If undertaken, these surveys should be quality assured
and should target pharmaceuticals that are of local significance—i.e. those that are
commonly prescribed and used or manufactured locally. Based on the risk assess-
ment, screening values can be developed to assess the potential risks from exposure
through drinking-water, and possible control measures could be considered within
the context of water safety plans. Practical difficulties with implementing monitoring
programmes include lack of standardized sampling and analysis protocols, high costs
and limited availability of technologies needed to detect the diverse range of pharma-
ceuticals that may be present.
     Effective treatment of pharmaceuticals depends on the physicochemical proper-
ties of the specific compounds. Typically, conventional treatment processes are less
effective than advanced treatment processes for the removal of many organic com-
pounds, particularly those that are more water soluble.
     Preventive measures, such as rational drug use and education of prescribers and
the public to reduce disposal and discharges to the environment, will likely reduce
human exposure.
     Further information is available in Pharmaceuticals in drinking-water (see Annex 1).

8.6 Pesticides used in water for public health purposes
The control of insect vectors of disease (e.g. dengue fever) is vital in many countries,
and there are occasions when vectors, particularly mosquitoes, breed in containers
used for the storage and collection of drinking-water. Although actions should be
taken to prevent access of vectors to or breeding of vectors in these containers, this is
not always possible or may not always be fully effective, and use of mosquito larvicides
may be indicated in certain settings.
      WHOPES carries out evaluations of pesticides for public health uses. There are
currently seven larvicidal compounds (diflubenzuron, methoprene, novaluron, piri-
miphos-methyl, pyriproxyfen, spinosad and temephos) and a bacterial larvicide (Ba-
cillus thuringiensis israelensis) that have been evaluated and listed by WHOPES for the
control of container-breeding mosquitoes.
      While it is not appropriate to set guideline values for pesticides used for vector
control, it is valuable to provide information regarding their safety in use. Formula-
tions of pesticides used for vector control in drinking-water should strictly follow
the label recommendations and should only be those approved for such use by na-
tional authorities, taking into consideration the ingredients and formulants used in
making the final product. In evaluating vector control pesticides for the Guidelines,
an assessment is made of the potential exposure compared with the ADI. However,
exceeding the ADI does not necessarily mean that this will result in adverse health ef-
fects. The diseases spread by vectors are significant causes of morbidity and mortality.
It is therefore important to achieve an appropriate balance between the intake of the
pesticide from drinking-water and the control of disease-carrying insects. It is stressed
that every effort should be made to keep overall exposure and the concentration of

any larvicide no greater than that recommended by WHOPES and as low as possible
commensurate with efficacy.
     Member States should consider the use of larvicides within the context of their
broad vector control strategy. The use of larvicides should be only part of a compre-
hensive management plan for household water storage and domestic waste manage-
ment that does not rely exclusively on larviciding by insecticides, but also includes
other environmental management measures and social behaviour change. Never-
theless, it would be valuable to obtain actual data on exposure to these substances
under field conditions in order to carry out a more refined assessment of margins of
exposure.
     In addition to the use of larvicides approved for drinking-water application to
control disease vector insects, other control measures should also be considered. For
example, the stocking of fish of appropriate varieties (e.g. larvae-eating mosquito-
fish and predatory copepods) in water bodies may adequately control infestations and
breeding of mosquitoes in those bodies. Other mosquito breeding areas where water
collects should be managed by draining, especially after rainfall.
     Those pesticides used for public health purposes for which guideline values have
not been derived are listed in Table 8.17. Dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (DDT) has
been used for public health purposes in the past. It is being reintroduced (but not for
water applications) in some areas to control malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Its guide-
line value is shown in Table 8.18. A summary of the product formulations and dosage
rates, with corresponding exposures, is provided in Table 8.19.
     Fact sheets for all larvicides considered in the Guidelines are included in chapter 12.

8.7 Identifying local actions in response to chemical water quality
    problems and emergencies
It is difficult to give comprehensive guidance concerning emergencies in which chem-
icals cause massive contamination of the drinking-water supply, caused either by ac-
cident or by deliberate action. Most of the guideline values recommended in these
Guidelines (see section 8.5 and Annex 3) relate to a level of exposure that is regarded
as tolerable throughout life. Acute toxic effects are considered for a limited number
of chemicals. The length of time for which exposure to a chemical far in excess of the
guideline value would have adverse effects on health will depend upon factors that
vary from contaminant to contaminant. In an emergency situation, the public health
authorities should be consulted about appropriate action.
      The exceedance of a guideline value may not result in a significant or increased
risk to health. Therefore, deviations above the guideline values in either the short or
long term may not necessarily mean that the water is unsuitable for consumption.
The amount by which, and the period for which, any guideline value can be exceeded
without affecting public health depends upon the specific substance involved, and ac-
ceptability judgements need to be made by qualified health officials. However, exceed-
ance should be a signal:
•    as a minimum, to investigate the cause with a view to taking remedial action as
     necessary;
•    to consult the authority responsible for public health for advice on suitable
     action, taking into account the intake of the substance from sources other than
     drinking-water, the toxicity of the substance, the likelihood and nature of any
     adverse effects and the practicality of remedial measures.
If a guideline value is to be exceeded by a significant amount or for more than a few
days, it may be necessary to act rapidly so as to ensure that health protective action is
taken and to inform consumers of the situation so that they can act appropriately.
      The primary aim with regard to chemical contaminants when a guideline value is
exceeded or in an emergency is to prevent exposure of the population to toxic concen-
trations of pollutants. However, in applying the Guidelines under such circumstances,
an important consideration is that, unless there are appropriate alternative supplies of
drinking-water available, maintenance of adequate quantities of water is a high prior-
ity. In the case of an incident in which chemical contaminants are spilt into a source
water and enter a drinking-water supply or enter a supply through treatment or dur-
ing distribution, the primary aim is to minimize the risk of adverse effects without
unnecessarily disrupting the use of the water supply.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     This section of the Guidelines can be used to assist evaluation of the risks
associated with a particular situation and—especially if a guideline value exists or
an authoritative risk assessment is available from an alternative source—support
appropriate decision-making on short- and medium-term actions. The approaches
proposed provide a basis for discussion between various authorities and for judging
the urgency of taking further action.
     Normally, a specific review of the situation will be required and should call on
suitable expertise. It is important to take local circumstances into account, including
the availability of alternative water supplies and exposure to the contaminant from
other sources, such as food. It is also important to consider what water treatment is
applied or available and whether this will reduce the concentration of the substance.
     Where the nature of contamination is unknown, expert opinion should be sought
as quickly as possible to identify the contaminants, to determine what actions can be
taken to prevent the contaminants from entering the supply and to minimize the ex-
posure of the population and so minimize any potential for adverse effects.
     A water safety plan should include planning for response to both predictable
events and undefined “emergencies”. Such planning facilitates rapid and appropriate
response to events when they occur (see section 4.4).
     Consideration of emergency planning and planning for response to incidents in
which a guideline value is exceeded, covering both microbial and chemical contamin­
ants, is discussed in section 4.4. Broader discussion of actions in emergency situations
can be found in section 6.7 and, for microbial contamination, section 7.6.

8.7.1 Trigger for action
Triggers for action may include:
•   detection of a spill by, or reporting of a spill to, the drinking-water supplier;
•   an alarm raised by the observation of items, such as chemical drums, adjacent to
    a vulnerable part of the drinking-water supply;
•   the detection of a substance in the water;
•   a sudden change to water treatment;
•   consumer complaints (e.g. an unusual odour, taste or discoloration).

8.7.2 Investigating the situation
Each incident is unique, and it is therefore important to determine associated facts,
including what the contaminant is; what the likely concentration is, and by how much
the guideline value has been exceeded, if at all; and the potential duration of the inci-
dent. These are important in determining the actions to be taken.

8.7.3 Talking to the right people
In any emergency, it is important that there be good communication between the
various authorities, particularly the water supplier and health authorities. It will usu-
ally be the health authorities that make the final decisions, but knowledge of the water
supply and the nature of the supply is vital in making the most appropriate decisions.

                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


In addition, timely and clear communication with consumers is a vital part of success-
fully handling drinking-water problems and emergencies.
     Liaison with key authorities is discussed in section 4.4. It is particularly import­
ant to inform the public health authority of any exceedance or likely exceedance of a
guideline value or other conditions likely to affect human health and to ensure that
the public health authority is involved in decision-making. In the event of actions that
require all consumers to be informed or where the provision of temporary supplies of
drinking-water is appropriate, civil authorities should also be involved. Planning for
these actions is an important part of the development of water safety plans. Involving
the public health authorities at an early stage enables them to obtain specialist infor-
mation and to make the appropriate staff available.

8.7.4 Informing the public
Consumers may be aware of a potential problem with the safety of their drinking-
water because of media coverage, their own senses or informal networks. Lack of con-
fidence in the drinking-water or the authorities may drive consumers to alternative,
potentially less safe sources. Not only do consumers have a right to information on
the safety of their drinking-water, but they have an important role to play in assisting
the authorities in an incident by their own actions and by carrying out the necessary
measures at the household level. Trust and goodwill from consumers are extremely
important in both the short and long term.
     The health authorities should be involved whenever a decision to inform the pub-
lic of health-based concerns or advice to adopt health protection measures such as
boiling of water may be required. Such guidance needs to be both timely and clear.

8.7.5 Evaluating the significance to public health and individuals
In assessing the significance of an exceedance of a guideline value, account should be
taken of:
•   information underpinning the guideline value derivation;
•   local exposure to the substance of concern through other routes (e.g. food);
•   any sensitive subpopulations;
•   locally relevant protective measures to prevent the chemical from entering the
    source water or supply in the case of a spill.
Information underpinning guideline value derivation
The derivation of guideline values for chemical contaminants is described in section 8.2.
      Most guideline values are derived by calculating a TDI or using an existing TDI
or ADI. A proportion of the TDI or ADI is then allocated to drinking-water to make
allowance for exposure from other sources, particularly food. This allocation is often
20%, but it may be as low as 1% or as high as 80%. In many circumstances, a review
of likely local sources of exposure may identify that sources other than drinking-water
are less significant than assumed and that a larger proportion of total exposure can
be safely allocated to drinking-water. The fact sheets in chapter 12 and background
documents on all chemicals addressed in these Guidelines (http://www.who.int/
water_sanitation_health/water-quality/guidelines/chemicals/en/) provide further

                                          195
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


information on likely sources of the chemicals concerned, including their allocation
factors. When rapid decision-making is required for such chemicals, it is possible
to allow 100% of the TDI to come from drinking-water for a short period (e.g. a few
days) while undertaking a more substantive review. In the event that there is signifi-
cant exposure from other sources or exposure is likely to be for more than a few days,
then it is possible to allocate more than the allocation used in the guideline value
derivation, but no more than 100%.
     In some cases, the guideline value is derived from epidemiological or clinical
studies in humans. In most cases (e.g. benzene, barium), these relate to long-term
exposure, and short-term exposure to concentrations higher than the guideline value
are unlikely to be of significant concern; however, it is important to seek expert advice.
In other cases of guideline values derived from epidemiological studies, the associated
health effects are acute in nature. For example:
•   The guideline value for nitrate is 50 mg/L, (as nitrate ion), to be protective of
    the health of the most sensitive subpopulation, bottle-fed infants. This guideline
    value is based on the absence of adverse health effects (methaemoglobinaemia
    and thyroid effects) at concentrations below 50 mg/L in epidemiological studies.
    Although the guideline value is based on short-term effects, it is protective for
    long-term effects and in other population groups, such as older children and
    adults. Methaemoglobinaemia is complicated by the presence of microbial con-
    tamination and subsequent gastrointestinal infection, which can increase the risk
    for this group significantly. Authorities should therefore be all the more vigilant
    that water to be used for bottle-fed infants is microbiologically safe when nitrate
    is present at concentrations near or above the guideline value. It is also particu-
    larly important to ensure that these infants are not currently exhibiting symptoms
    of gastrointestinal infection (diarrhoea). In addition, because excessive boiling of
    water to ensure microbiological safety can concentrate levels of nitrate in the
    water, care should be taken to ensure that water is heated only until the water
    reaches a rolling boil. In extreme situations, alternative sources of water (e.g.
    bottled water) can be used.
•   The guideline value for copper is also based on short-term exposure but is intend-
    ed to protect against direct gastric irritation, which is a concentration-dependent
    phenomenon. The guideline value may be exceeded, but there will be an increas-
    ing risk of consumers suffering from gastrointestinal irritation as the concentra-
    tion increases above the guideline value. The occurrence of such irritation can be
    assessed in exposed populations.
    In some cases, the guideline value is derived from a cancer risk estimate derived
from studies in laboratory animals. In these cases, short-term (a few months to a year)
exposure to concentrations up to 10 times the guideline value would result in only
a small increase in estimated risk of cancer. Because the estimate of risk varies over
a wide range, there may be no, or a very small, increase in risk. In such a circum-
stance, accepting a 10-fold increase in the guideline value for a short period would
have no discernible impact on the risk over a lifetime. However, care would be needed

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


to determine whether other toxicological end-points more relevant for short-term
exposure, such as neurotoxicity, would become significant.
     Health-based values for short-term exposures are now being developed for a small
number of substances that are used in significant quantities and are frequently impli-
cated in an emergency as a consequences of spills, usually to surface water sources. The
methodology used in the derivation of these health-based values is described below.

Health-based values for use in emergencies
Health-based values for acute and short-term exposures (called acute and short-term
health-based values) can be derived for any chemicals that are used in significant
quantities and are involved in an emergency, such as a spill into surface water sources.
      JMPR has provided guidance on the setting of acute reference doses (ARfDs) for
pesticides (Solecki et al., 2005). These ARfDs can be used as a basis for deriving acute
health-based values for pesticides in drinking-water, and the general guidance can also
be applied to derive ARfDs for other chemicals. The JMPR ARfD is usually established
to cover the whole population, and must be adequate to protect the embryo or fetus
from possible in utero effects. An ARfD based on developmental (embryo/fetal) ef-
fects, which applies to women of childbearing age only, may be conservative and not
relevant to other population subgroups.1
      The ARfD can be defined as the amount of a chemical, normally expressed on a
body weight basis, that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without appre-
ciable health risk to the consumer. Most of the scientific concepts applicable to the
setting of ADIs or TDIs for chronic exposure apply equally to the setting of ARfDs.
The toxicological end-points most relevant for a single or 1-day exposure should be
selected. For ARfDs for pesticides, possible relevant end-points include haematotoxic-
ity (including methaemoglobin formation), immunotoxicity, acute neurotoxicity, liver
and kidney toxicity (observed in single-dose studies or early in repeated-dose studies),
endocrine effects and developmental effects. The most relevant or adequate study in
which these end-points have been determined (in the most sensitive species or most
vulnerable subgroup) is selected, and NOAELs are established. The most relevant
end-point providing the lowest NOAEL is then used in the derivation of the ARfD.
Uncertainty factors are used to extrapolate from experimental animal data to the aver-
age human and to allow for variation in sensitivity within the human population. An
ARfD derived in such a manner can then be used to establish an acute health-based
value by allocating 100% of the ARfD to drinking-water, as follows:

                                                              ARfD × bw × P
                          Acute health-based value =
                                                                   C
where:
   bw =          body weight (60 kg for adult, 10 kg for children, 5 kg for infants)
   P =           fraction of the ARfD allocated to drinking-water (100%)
   C =           daily drinking-water consumption (2 L for adults, 1 L for children, 0.75 L
			              for bottle-fed infants)

     However, available data sets do not allow the accurate evaluation of the acute
toxicity for a number of compounds of interest. If appropriate single-dose or short-
term data are lacking, an end-point from a repeated-dose toxicity study can be used.
This is likely to be a more conservative approach, and this should be clearly stated in
the health-based value derivation.

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


      When a substance has been spilt into a drinking-water source, contamination
may be present for a period longer than 24 hours, but is not usually present for longer
than a few days. Under these circumstances, the use of data from repeated-dose toxic-
ity studies is appropriate to derive a short-term health-based value (using the approach
outlined in section 8.2.2). As the period of exposure used in these studies will often be
much longer than a few days, this, too, is likely to be a conservative approach.
      Where there is a need for a rapid response, and suitable data are not available
to establish an ARfD but a guideline value or health-based value is available for the
chemical of concern, a pragmatic approach would be to allocate a higher proportion
of the ADI or TDI to drinking-water. As the ADI or TDI is intended to be protective
of lifetime exposure, small exceedances of the ADI or TDI for short periods will not
be of significant concern for health. In these circumstances, it would be reasonable to
allow 100% of the ADI or TDI to come from drinking-water for a short period.

Assessing locally relevant sources of the substance of concern through other
routes of exposure
The most useful sources of information regarding local exposure to substances
through food and, to a lesser extent, air and other environmental routes are usually
government departments dealing with food and environmental pollution. Other
sources of information may include universities. In the absence of specific data,
the Guidelines background documents consider the sources of exposure and give
a generic assessment that can be used to make a local evaluation as to the potential
use of a chemical and whether this would be likely to enter the food-chain. Further
information is available in the supporting document Chemical safety of drinking-
water (Annex 1).

Sensitive subpopulations
In some cases, there may be a specific subpopulation that is at greater risk from a sub-
stance than the rest of the population. These usually relate to high exposure relative to
body weight (e.g. bottle-fed infants) or a particular sensitivity (e.g. fetal haemoglobin
and nitrate/nitrite). However, some genetic subpopulations may show greater sensi-
tivity to particular toxicity (e.g. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase–deficient groups
and oxidative stress on red blood cells). If the potential exposure from drinking-water
in an incident is greater than the ADI or TDI or exposure is likely to be extended
beyond a few days, then this would require consideration in conjunction with health
authorities. In such circumstances, it may be possible to target action to avoid expo-
sure of the specific group concerned, such as supplying bottled water for bottle-fed
infants.

Specific mitigation measures affecting risk assessment
Such measures relate to actions taken locally or on a household basis that can have an
impact on the presence of a particular contaminant. For example, the presence of a
substance that is volatile or heat labile will be affected by heating the water for cooking
or the preparation of beverages. Where such measures are routinely undertaken by the
exposed population, the risk assessment may be modified accordingly. Alternatively,


                                           198
                       GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


such steps can be used on a household basis to reduce exposure and allow the con-
tinued use of the supply without interruption.

8.7.6 Determining appropriate action
Determining appropriate action means that various risks will need to be balanced.
The interruption of water supply to consumers is a serious step and can lead to




                                       198a
                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


risks associated with contamination of drinking-water stored in the household with
pathogens and limiting use for purposes of hygiene and health protection. Issuing
a “do not drink” notice may allow the use of the supply for hygiene purposes such
as showering or bathing, but creates pressure on consumers and authorities to pro-
vide a safe alternative for drinking and cooking. In some cases, this option will be
expensive and could divert resources from other, more important issues. Appropriate
action will always be decided on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with other au-
thorities, including the health protection and civil authorities, who may be required
to participate in informing consumers, delivering alternative supplies or supervising
the collection of water from bowsers and tankers. Responding to a potential risk
to health from a chemical contaminant should not lead to an increase in overall
health risk from disruption of supply, microbial contaminants or other chemical
contaminants.

8.7.7 Consumer acceptability
Even though, in an emergency, supplying water that contains a substance present at
higher concentrations than would normally be desirable may not result in an undue
risk to health, the water may not be acceptable to consumers. A number of substances
that can contaminate drinking-water supplies as a consequence of spills can give rise
to severe problems with taste or odour. Under these circumstances, drinking-water
may become so unpalatable as to render the water undrinkable or to cause consumers
to turn to alternative drinking-water sources that may present a greater risk to health.
In addition, water that is clearly contaminated may cause some consumers to feel un-
well due to a perception of poor water quality. Consumer acceptability may be the
most important factor in determining the advice given to consumers about whether
or not the water should be used for drinking or cooking.

8.7.8 Ensuring remedial action, preventing recurrence and updating the water
       safety plan
The recording of an incident, the decisions taken and the reasons for them are essential
parts of handling an incident. The water safety plan, as discussed in chapter 4, should
be updated in the light of experience. This would include making sure that problem
areas identified during an incident are corrected. Where possible, it would also mean
that the cause of the incident is dealt with to prevent its recurrence. For example, if the
incident has arisen as a consequence of a spill from industry, the source of the spill can
be advised as to how to prevent another spill and the information passed on to other
similar industrial establishments.

8.7.9 Mixtures
A spill may contain more than one contaminant of potential health concern (see
section 8.2.8). Under these circumstances, it will be important to determine whether
the substances present interact. Where the substances have a similar mechanism or
mode of action, it is appropriate to consider them as additive. This may be particu-
larly true of some pesticides, such as atrazine and simazine. In these circumstances,


                                           199
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


appropriate action must take local circumstances into consideration. Specialist advice
should generally be sought.

8.7.10 Water avoidance advisories
Water avoidance advisories share many features with boil water advisories (see sec-
tion 7.6.1), but are less common. Like boil water advisories, they are a serious measure
that should be instituted only when there is evidence that an advisory is necessary to
reduce a substantial public health risk. In cases where alternative sources of water are
recommended, particular consideration should be given to the potential for microb­
ial hazards in those alternative sources. Water avoidance advisories are applied when
the parameter of concern is not susceptible to boiling or when risks from dermal
contact or inhalation of the contaminant are also significant. Water avoidance advis­
ories may also be issued when an unknown agent or chemical substance is detected
in the distribution system. It is important that the water avoidance advisories include
the information that boiling is ineffective or insufficient to reduce the risk.
     As with the case of boil water advisories, water suppliers in conjunction with
public health authorities should develop protocols for water avoidance advisories.
Protocols should be prepared before any incident occurs and incorporated within
water safety plans. Decisions to issue advisories are often made within a short period
of time, and developing responses during an event can complicate decision-making,
compromise communication and undermine public confidence.
     In addition to the information discussed in section 4.4.3, the protocols should
provide information to the general public and specific groups on the following:
•   criteria for issuing and rescinding an advisory;
•   activities impacted by the advisory;
•   alternative sources of safe water for drinking and other domestic uses.
     Protocols should identify mechanisms for the communication of water avoidance
advisories. The mechanisms may vary, depending on the nature of the supply and the
size of the community affected, and could include:
•   media releases through television, radio and newspapers;
•   telephone, e-mail and fax contact of specific facilities, community groups and
    local authorities;
•   posting of notices in conspicuous locations;
•   personal delivery;
•   mail delivery.
The methods chosen should provide a reasonable assurance that all of those affected
by the advisory, including residents, workers and travellers, are notified as soon as
possible.
     The issuing of a water avoidance advisory may be necessary, for example, follow-
ing contamination—for example, chemical or radiological—as a result of accidental,
natural or malicious origin that leads to:
•   a significant exceedance of a guideline value, which may pose a threat to health
    from short-term exposure;


                                          200
                                   8. CHEMICAL ASPECTS


•   concentrations of a chemical with no guideline value that may pose a threat to
    health from short-term exposure;
•   significant odour or taste that has no identified source or that will give rise to
    significant public anxiety.
      When issued, water avoidance advisories should provide information on the same
issues included in boil water advisories (see section 7.6.1), although recommendations
relating to affected uses and users will vary, depending on the nature of the problem.
For example, for elevated concentrations of contaminants that are of concern only
from a drinking or cooking perspective, the public could be advised to avoid using
the water for drinking, food preparation, preparing cold drinks, making ice and hy-
gienic uses, such as tooth brushing. Where the advisory applies to elevated levels of
chemicals that can cause skin or eye irritation or gastrointestinal upsets, the public
could be advised not to use the water for drinking, cooking, tooth brushing or bath-
ing/showering. Alternatively, specific water avoidance advice might be issued where
the contamination might affect subgroups of the population—for example, pregnant
women or bottle-fed infants.
      As for boil water advisories, specific advice may need to be issued for dentists,
doctors, hospitals and other health-care facilities, child-care facilities, schools, food
suppliers and manufacturers, hotels, restaurants and operators of public swimming
pools.
      Water avoidance advisories do not equate to cessation of supply; water will gener-
ally be suitable for flushing toilets and other uses, such as clothes washing. However,
suitable alternative supplies of drinking-water, such as bottled water and carted or
tankered water, will be required for drinking and other domestic uses.
      Criteria for rescinding water avoidance advisories will generally be based on evi-
dence that the source of elevated concentrations of hazardous contaminants has been
removed, that distribution systems have been appropriately flushed and that the water
is safe for drinking and other uses. In buildings, the flushing would extend to storages
and internal plumbing systems.

     Naturally occurring radionuclides in drinking-water usually give radiation doses
higher than those provided by artificially produced radionuclides and are therefore of
greater concern. Radiological risks are best controlled through a preventive risk man-
agement approach following the framework for safe drinking-water (see chapter 2)
and the water safety plan approach (see chapter 4). When considering what action
to take in assessing and managing radiological risks, care should be taken to ensure
that scarce resources are not diverted away from other, more important public health
concerns.
     The screening levels and guidance levels for radioactivity presented in these
Guidelines are based on the latest recommendations of the International Commission
on Radiological Protection (ICRP, 2008).
     Some drinking-water supplies, in particular those sourced from groundwater,
may contain radon, a radioactive gas. Although radon can enter indoor air in build-
ings through its release from water from taps or during showering, the most significant
source of radon in indoor air arises through natural accumulation from the environ-
ment. An evaluation of international research data (UNSCEAR, 2000) has concluded
that, on average, 90% of the dose attributable to radon in drinking-water comes from
inhalation rather than ingestion. Consequently, the setting of screening levels and
guidance levels to limit the dose from ingestion of radon contained in drinking-water
is not usually necessary. The screening measurements for gross alpha and gross beta
activities will include the contribution from radon progeny, which is the principal
source of dose from ingestion of radon present in drinking-water supplies. This is
further discussed in section 9.7.

9.1 Sources1 and health effects of radiation exposure
Radioactivity from several naturally occurring and human-made sources is present
throughout the environment. Some chemical elements present in the environment
are naturally radioactive. These are found in varying amounts in soils, water, indoor
and outdoor air and even within our bodies, and so exposure to them is inevitable.
In addition, Earth is constantly bombarded by high-energy particles originating both
from the sun and from outside the solar system. Collectively, these particles are re-
ferred to as cosmic radiation. Everybody receives a dose from cosmic radiation, which
is influenced by latitude, longitude and height above sea level.
      The use of radiation in medicine for diagnosis and treatment is the largest hu-
man-made source of radiation exposure today. The testing of nuclear weapons, rou-
tine discharges from industrial and medical facilities and accidents such as Chernobyl
have added human-made radionuclides to our environment.
      The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation
(UNSCEAR, 2008) has estimated that the global average annual dose per person from
all sources of radiation in the environment is approximately 3.0 mSv/year (see Box 9.1).
Of this, 80% (2.4 mSv) is due to naturally occurring sources of radiation, 19.6% (almost
0.6 mSv) is due to the use of radiation for medical diagnosis and the remaining 0.4%

    When the term “source” appears in this chapter without any other reference, it is used in the context of
    “radiation source”. For any other purpose, additional information is provided (e.g. “water source”).

                                 Box 9.1 Key terms, quantities and units

    Becquerel (Bq)—The becquerel is the unit of radioactivity in the International System of Units
    (abbreviated SI from the French Système international d’unités), corresponding to one radioac‑
    tive disintegration per second. In the case of drinking-water, it is usual to talk about the activity
    concentration, expressed in units of Bq/l.

    Effective dose—When radiation interacts with body tissues and organs, the radiation dose re‑
    ceived is a function of factors such as the type of radiation, the part of the body affected and the
    exposure pathway. This means that 1 Bq of radioactivity will not always deliver the same radia‑
    tion dose. A unit called “effective dose” has been developed to take account of the differences
    between different types of radiation so that their biological impacts can be compared directly.
    The effective dose is expressed in SI units called sieverts (Sv). The sievert is a very large unit, and
    it is often more practical to talk in terms of millisieverts (mSv). There are 1000 mSv in 1 Sv.

    Effective half-life—Radioisotopes have a “physical” half-life, which is the period of time it takes
    for one half of the atoms to disintegrate. Physical half-lives for various radioisotopes can range
    from a few microseconds to billions of years. When a radioisotope is present in a living organism,
    it may be excreted. The rate of this elimination is influenced by biological factors and is referred
    to as the “biological” half-life. The effective half-life is the actual rate of halving the radioactivity
    in a living organism as determined by both the physical and biological half-lives. Whereas for
    certain radionuclides, the biological processes are dominant, for others, physical decay is the
    dominant influence.




(around 0.01 mSv) is due to other sources of human-made radiation (see Figure 9.1).
There can be large variability in the dose received by individual members of the popula-
tion, depending on where they live, their dietary preferences and other lifestyle choices.
Individual radiation doses can also differ depending on medical treatments and occu-
pational exposures. Annual average doses and typical ranges of individual doses from
naturally occurring sources are presented in Table 9.1 (UNSCEAR, 2008).

9.1.1 Radiation exposure through ingestion of drinking-water
Water sources can contain radionuclides of natural and artificial origin (i.e. human-
made):
•     Natural radionuclides, including potassium-40, and those of the thorium and ur­
      anium decay series, in particular radium-226, radium-228, uranium-234, uranium-
      238 and lead-210, can be found in water as a result of either natural processes (e.g.
      absorption from the soil) or technological processes involving naturally occurring
      radioactive materials (e.g. the mining and processing of mineral sands or phos-
      phate fertilizer production).
•     Human-made radionuclides may be present in water from several sources, such as
      —— radionuclides discharged from nuclear fuel cycle facilities;
      —— manufactured radionuclides (produced and used in unsealed form in medicine
          or industry) entered into drinking-water supplies as a result of regular or
          incidental discharges;
      —— radionuclides released in the past into the environment, including drinking-
          water sources.

                              Box 9.2 Radiation exposure situations

   The ICRP (2008) distinguishes between three types of radiation exposure situations—planned,
   existing and emergency exposure situations:

      •   A planned exposure situation is a situation that arises from the planned operation of
          a radiation source or from a planned activity that results in an exposure to a radiation
          source (e.g. exposure to a radiation source during a medical procedure for diagnosis or

      •   An existing exposure situation is a situation that already exists when a decision on the
          need for control has to be taken (e.g. exposure to indoor radon in dwellings).
      •   An emergency exposure situation is a situation that arises as a result of an accident,
          a malicious act or any other unexpected event. The present Guidelines do not apply
          during emergency exposure situations (see chapter 6).




                     Box 9.3 Individual dose criterion (IDC) and health risks

   The additional risk to health from exposure to an annual dose of 0.1 mSv associated with the
   intake of radionuclides from drinking-water is considered to be low for the following reasons:

      •   Individual doses from natural radioactivity in the environment vary widely. The average
          is about 2.4 mSv/year, but in some parts of the world, average doses can be up to
          10 times higher (i.e. 24 mSv/year) without any observed increase in health risks, as
          noted in long-term population studies (Tao, 2000; Nair et al., 2009). An IDC of 0.1 mSv/
          year therefore represents a small addition to natural levels.
      •   The nominal risk coefficient for radiation-induced cancer incidence is 5.5 × 10−2/Sv
          (ICRP, 2008). Multiplying this by an IDC of 0.1 mSv/year from drinking-water gives an
          estimated annual cancer risk of approximately 5.5 × 10−6.




9.2 Rationale for screening levels and guidance levels
The current Guidelines are based on the approach proposed by the ICRP in situations
of prolonged radiation exposure of the public. According to the ICRP, in planned ex-
posure situations (see Box 9.2), it is prudent to restrict the prolonged component of
the individual dose to 0.1 mSv in any
given year (ICRP, 2000). It is recog-

existing exposure situation. Rather
than adopt a different approach de-
pending on whether or not the radionuclides are naturally occurring or human-made,
a pragmatic and conservative approach was adopted, with an IDC of 0.1 mSv from
1 year’s consumption of drinking-water, regardless of the origin of the radionuclides
(see Box 9.3).

                          Box 9.4 Recommended assessment methodology
    The recommended assessment methodology for controlling radionuclide health risks from
    drinking-water involves four steps:
       1.   An IDC1 of 0.1 mSv from 1 year’s consumption of drinking-water is adopted.
       2.   Initial screening is undertaken for both gross alpha activity and gross beta activity. If the
            measured activity concentrations are below the screening levels of 0.5 Bq/l for gross
            alpha activity and 1 Bq/l for gross beta activity, no further action is required.
       3.   If either of the screening levels is exceeded, the concentrations of individual radionu‑
            clides should be determined and compared with the guidance levels (see Table 9.2).
       4.   The outcome of this further evaluation may indicate that no action is required or that
            further evaluation is necessary before a decision can be made on the need for measures
            to reduce the dose.

9.3.1 Screening of drinking-water supplies
The process of identifying individual radionuclides in drinking-water and determin-
ing their concentration is time-consuming and expensive. Because, in most circum-
stances, the concentrations are low, such detailed analysis is normally not justified
for routine monitoring. A more practical approach is to use a screening procedure,
where the total radioactivity present in the form of alpha and beta radiation is first
determined, without regard to the identity of specific radionuclides.
     These measurements are suitable as a preliminary screening procedure to de-
termine whether further radioisotope-specific analysis is necessary. They can also be
used for detecting changes in the radiological characteristics of the drinking-water
source as well as for identifying spatial and/or temporal trends in the radionuclide
content of drinking-water.
     Screening levels for drinking-water, below which no further action is required,
are 0.5 Bq/l for gross alpha activity and 1 Bq/l for gross beta activity. If neither of these
values is exceeded, the IDC of 0.1 mSv/year will also not be exceeded. The use of these
screening levels is recommended, as this maximizes both the reliability and the cost-
effectiveness of assessing the radionuclide content of drinking-water.
     Radionuclides emitting low-energy beta activity, such as tritium, and some gas-
eous or volatile radionuclides, such as iodine, will not be detected by standard gross
activity measurements. Routine analysis for these radionuclides is not necessary, but,
if there are any reasons for believing that they may be present, radionuclide-specific
sampling and measurement techniques should be used.2
     Gross beta measurements include a contribution from potassium-40, a beta emit-
ter that occurs naturally in a fixed ratio to stable potassium. Potassium is an essential
element for humans and is absorbed mainly from ingested food. If the screening level
of 1 Bq/l for gross beta is exceeded, the contribution of potassium-40 to beta activ-
ity should be subtracted following a separate determination of total potassium. The

  In the European Commission Drinking Water Directive (European Commission, 2001), this parameter is
  called the total indicative dose (TID), and the same value of 0.1 mSv/year is adopted.

beta activity of potassium-40 is 27.9 Bq/g of stable potassium, which is the factor that
should be used to calculate the beta activity due to potassium-40.

9.3.2 Strategy for assessing drinking-water if screening levels are exceeded
If either of the screening levels is exceeded, then the specific radionuclides should
be identified and their individual activity concentrations measured. This will allow
the contribution from each radionuclide to the IDC to be calculated. If the following
additive formula is satisfied, then no further action is required:




where:
        Ci =      the measured activity concentration of radionuclide i, and
        GL =      the guidance level (see Tables 9.2 and A6.1 in Annex 6) of radionuclide i
        		        that, at an intake of 2 litres/day1 for 1 year, will result in an effective dose
        		        of 0.1 mSv/year.
     If any of the guidance levels is exceeded, then the sum will exceed unity. The
sum may also exceed unity even if none of the individual guidance levels is exceeded.
Where the sum exceeds unity for a single sample, the IDC of 0.1 mSv/year would be
exceeded only if the exposure to the same measured concentrations were to continue
for a full year. Hence, such a result does not in itself imply that the water is unsuitable for
consumption.

9.3.3 Strategy for assessing drinking-water if guidance levels are exceeded
An annual dose of 0.1 mSv is a small percentage of the average radiation dose received
by any individual. Both the screening levels and guidance levels are highly conserva-
tive values that allow national authorities to determine, without further consideration,
that the drinking-water is fit for consumption from a radiological viewpoint. National
experiences have shown that the vast majority of water supplies comply with these
criteria.
     Occasionally, the situation may arise where the guidance levels are consistently
exceeded for one or a combination of specific radionuclides. National authorities will
then need to make a decision regarding the need to implement remedial measures
or to place some restriction on the continued use of the water supply for drinking
purposes.
     From a radiological point of view, one of the key considerations is the extent to
which the guidance levels are exceeded. The International Basic Safety Standards for
Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources address
drinking-water in the chapter on existing exposure situations and contain a require-
ment that the highest annual individual doses received from the consumption of

1
    Where national or regional consumption rates are known, the guidance level should be adjusted to take
    this into account.

  Guidance levels were rounded to the nearest order of magnitude by averaging the log scale values (to 10n if the
  calculated value was below 3 × 10 n and to 10 n+1 if value was 3 × 10 n or above). For example, if the calculated value
  was 2 Bq/L (i.e. 2 × 10 0), the guidance level was rounded to 10 0 (i.e. = 1) whereas. if the calculated value was 3 Bq /L,
  (i.e. 3 × 10 0 or above) the guidance level was rounded to 101 (i.e. = 10).

  Separate guidance levels are provided for individual uranium radioisotopes in terms of radioactivity (i.e. expressed as
  Bq/l). The provisional guideline value for total content of uranium in drinking-water is 30 μg/l based on its chemical
  toxicity, which is predominant compared with its radiological toxicity (see chapter 12).

  These radionuclides either may not occur in drinking-water in normal situations or may be found at doses that are too low
  to be of significance to public health. Therefore, they are of lower priority for investigation following an exceedance of a
  screening level.
e
  Although iodine and tritium will not be detected by standard gross activity measure¬ments and routine analysis for
  these radionuclides is not necessary, if there are any reasons for believing that they may be present, radionuclide-
  specific sampling and measurement tech¬niques should be used. This is the reason for including them in this table.

drinking-water do not exceed a value of approximately 1 mSv.1 This should not be
regarded either as an “acceptable” dose or as a dose limit, and all reasonable efforts
should be made to minimize the doses received. Each situation will be different, and
non-radiological factors, such as the costs of remediation and the availability of other
drinking-water supplies, will need to be taken into account in reaching a final decision.
National authorities also need to be aware that radionuclides such as uranium are chem-
ically toxic, and the allowable concentrations in drinking-water may be determined by
a radioisotope’s toxicological rather than its radioactive properties (see chapter 12).

9.3.4 Sampling frequency
Criteria for monitoring radiological contamination of drinking-water should be de-
veloped, taking into account available resources and the potential for radiological risks.
It should not detract from the adequate assessment and management of microbial and
chemical risks. New water supplies should be sampled to determine their suitability
for drinking-water, whereas existing supplies would need monitoring occasionally. If
the water supply is adequately characterized and measured concentrations are consist­
ently below screening levels, then sampling frequency should be reduced. However, if
sources of potential radionuclide contamination exist nearby or are expected to be
changing rapidly with time, then the sampling should be more frequent. Sampling
frequency should be maintained, or even increased, if concentrations are approaching
the screening levels or if the sum of ratios of the observed concentrations of indi-
vidual radionuclides to their guidance levels approaches unity (see below). A graded
approach to sampling frequency should be developed commensurate with the degree
of contamination, the source of supply (i.e. surface water or groundwater), the size of
the population served, the expected variability of radionuclide concentrations and the
availability and results of historical monitoring records. International standards are
available relating to the assessment of radiological water quality, including sampling
procedures (e.g. preservation and handling of samples) and programmes (Standards
Australia & Standards New Zealand, 1998; ISO, 2003, 2006a,b, 2009a).

9.4 Guidance levels for radionuclides commonly found in
    drinking‑water
Guidance levels established for naturally occurring and human-made radionuclides
most commonly detected in drinking-water supplies as well as for human-made
radionuclides potentially relevant for prolonged exposure situations resulting from
past nuclear emergency situations are presented in Table 9.2. The respective dose
coefficients for adults are also presented (IAEA, 1996; ICRP, 1996).
     The guidance level for each radionuclide in Table 9.2 represents the concentration
that, if present in the drinking-water consumed throughout the year, would result in
an individual dose of 0.1 mSv.
     The guidance levels were calculated using dose coefficients for adults. Insufficient
evidence was found to introduce separate guidance levels for different age groups.
Although infants and children consume a lower mean volume of drinking-water, the

                                  9. RADIOLOGICAL ASPECTS


age-dependent dose coefficients for children are higher than those for adults, account-
ing for higher uptake or metabolic rates. In the case of prolonged contamination of
the water source, an assessment of doses to infants and children may be considered.
     The guidance levels apply to routine (“normal”) operational conditions of existing
or new drinking-water supplies. They do not apply during an emergency exposure
situation involving the release of radionuclides into the environment. However, the
guidance levels apply again once the relevant authorities have declared an end to the
emergency exposure situation. Additional guidance is provided in section 6.7 and in
several publications (IAEA, 2002; IAEA & WHO, 2005, 2010; ICRP, 2009a).
     The guidance levels for radionuclides in drinking-water were calculated using the
following equation:

                                               IDC
                                   GL =
                                              h ing × q
where:
    GL =      guidance level of radionuclide in drinking-water (Bq/l)
    IDC =     individual dose criterion, equal to 0.1 mSv/year for this calculation
    h ing =   dose coefficient for ingestion by adults (mSv/Bq)
    q     =   annual ingested volume of drinking-water, assumed to be 730 litres/year
    		        (equivalent to the standard World Health Organization drinking-water
    		        consumption rate of 2 litres/day)

9.5 Analytical methods
9.5.1 Measuring gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations
To analyse drinking-water for gross alpha and gross beta activities (excluding radon),
the most common approach is to evaporate a known volume of the sample to dryness
and measure the activity of the residue. As alpha radiation is easily absorbed within a
thin layer of solid material, the reliability and sensitivity of the method for alpha de-
termination may be reduced in samples with high total dissolved solids (TDS) content.
Where possible, standardized methods should be used to determine concentrations of
gross alpha and gross beta activities. Procedures for this analysis are listed in Table 9.3.
      The determination of gross beta activity using the evaporation method includes
the contribution from potassium-40. An additional analysis of total potassium is
therefore required if the gross beta screening value is exceeded.
      The co-precipitation technique (APHA et al., 2005) excludes the contribution due
to potassium-40; therefore, determination of total potassium is not necessary. This
method is not applicable to assessment of water samples containing certain fission
products, such as caesium-137. However, under normal circumstances, concentrations
of fission products in drinking-water supplies are extremely low.

9.5.2 Measuring specific radionuclides
If either of the gross alpha and gross beta screening levels is exceeded, then the specific
radionuclides should be identified and their individual activity concentrations mea-
sured.

Information on measuring radon concentrations in water is provided in section 9.7.4.

9.6 Remedial measures
If the IDC of 0.1 mSv/year is being exceeded, then the options available to the regu-
latory authority to reduce the dose should be examined. Where remedial measures
are contemplated, any strategy considered should first be justified (in the sense that
it achieves a net benefit). Any decision that alters the radiation exposure situation
should do more good than harm. This means that by reducing existing exposure, it
will achieve sufficient individual or societal benefit to offset the detriment it causes
(ICRP, 2008).
     Once the remedial action is justified, then protection should be optimized in
accordance with the recommendations of ICRP (2008). The principle of optimiza-
tion of protection implies that the likelihood of incurring exposures, the number of
people exposed and the magnitude of their individual doses should all be kept as low
as reasonably achievable, taking economic and societal factors into account.
     When source water contains unacceptably high concentrations of radionuclides,
control options include use of an alternative supply, controlled blending with another
source or additional water treatment. Treatment plants with a combination of coagu-
lation, sedimentation and sand filtration processes may remove up to 100% of the sus-
pended radioactivity present in raw waters. Lime–soda ash softening plants can also
remove practically all of the suspended radioactivity, depending on the radionuclide
and on the proportion of radioactivity that might be associated with particulates.
     A comprehensive review of the removal of dissolved radionuclides by water treat-
ment processes has been undertaken (Brown, Hammond & Wilkins, 2008). The re-
sults summarized in that report are reproduced in Table 9.4. References for treatment
technologies specific to radionuclides are provided in Annex 6.

9.7 Radon
9.7.1 Radon in air and water
Uranium, radium and radon are all soluble in water. Radon present in surface waters,
such as lakes and rivers, is readily released into outdoor air by agitation as it passes

                                       Box 9.5 Radon in drinking-water

          •   Some groundwater supplies may contain elevated concentrations of radon. High radon
              concentrations are seldom found in surface drinking-water supplies.
          •   Radon dissolved in drinking-water can be released into indoor air. Normally, a higher
              radon dose is received from inhaling the radon and radon progeny compared with their
              ingestion.
          •   Radon released from drinking-water is not the only source of radon in indoor air.
              Where high indoor radon concentrations exist, the underlying soil and building
              materials, rather than the drinking-water, are normally the predominant sources.
          •   Straightforward and effective techniques exist to reduce the concentration of radon in
              drinking-water supplies.
          •   In deciding whether or not to take steps to reduce the concentration of radon in
              drinking-water supplies, it is important to take account of the contribution of other
              sources of radon to the total radiation dose. Any action should be both justified and
              optimized and take account of local conditions.



over rocks and soils. Groundwater from wells and boreholes usually contains higher
radon concentrations than surface waters. In some extreme circumstances, very high
radon concentrations can be found in drinking-water supplies from these sources (see
Box 9.5).
     Radon is soluble in water, its solubility decreasing rapidly with an increase in tem-
perature. When a tap or shower is turned on, some of the dissolved radon is released
into indoor air. This adds to the radon present from other sources and will give rise to
a radiation dose when inhaled.
     An evaluation of international research data (UNSCEAR, 2000) has concluded
that, on average, 90% of the dose attributable to radon in drinking-water comes from
inhalation rather than ingestion. Therefore, controlling the inhalation pathway rather
than the ingestion pathway is the most effective way to control doses from radon in
drinking-water.

                                GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     The percentage of radon present in drinking-water that is released into indoor air
will depend on local conditions, such as the total consumption of water in the house,
the volume of the house and its ventilation rate, and is likely to be highly variable. It
has been estimated that a radon concentration of 1000 Bq/l in drinking-water dis-
charged from a tap or shower will, on average, increase the radon concentration by 100
Bq/m3 in indoor air (NAS, 1999; European Commission, 2001; Health Canada, 2009).
This contribution is not constant, as it occurs only while the water is being discharged
through the tap or shower. Radon in air also comes from other sources, in particular
radon entering the home from the underlying soil.

9.7.2 Health risks from radon
Epidemiological studies have clearly shown that long-term exposure to high radon
concentrations in indoor air increases the risk of lung cancer (WHO, 2009). Radon in-
gested in drinking-water will give a radiation dose to the lining of the stomach. Scien-
tific studies have not shown a definitive link between consumption of drinking-water
containing radon and an increased risk of stomach cancer (Ye et al., 1998; Auvinen
et al., 2005; WHO, 2009).

9.7.3 Guidance on radon in drinking-water supplies
As the dose from radon present in drinking-water is normally received from inhal­
ation rather than ingestion, it is more appropriate to measure the radon concentration
in air than in drinking-water.
     The World Health Organization reference level for radon concentration in
indoor air is 100 Bq/m3 in dwellings. If this level cannot be reached under prevailing
country-specific conditions, the level should not exceed 300 Bq/m3, corresponding
to an annual dose of approximately 10 mSv (WHO, 2009). This recommendation is
consistent with the International Basic Safety Standards1 and with the most recent
recommendations of the ICRP (2009b).
     Screening levels for radon in water should be set on the basis of the national refer-
ence level for radon in air and the distribution of radon in the national housing stock.
Where high radon concentrations are identified in indoor air, this is nearly always
due to ingress of radon from the soil rather than degassing from the drinking-water
supply. Nevertheless, in circumstances where high radon concentrations might be
expected in drinking-water, it is prudent to measure for radon and, if high concentra-
tions are identified, consider whether measures to reduce the concentrations present
are justified.
     The concentration of radon in groundwater supplies can vary considerably. Con-
sequently, in situations where high radon concentrations have been identified or are
suspected, the frequency of gross alpha and gross beta measurements may need to be
increased so that the presence of radon progeny (in particular polonium-210), which
can be major contributors to dose, can be assessed and monitored on an ongoing basis.

9.7.4 Measuring radon in drinking-water
There are difficulties in deriving activity concentrations of radon in drinking-water
because of the ease with which radon is released from water during handling. Stirring
and transferring water from one container to another will release dissolved radon.
Water that has been left to stand will have reduced radon activity, and boiling will also
completely release radon from the water into the air. A variety of methods can be used
to measure radon in water, including liquid scintillation counting, which is a sensitive
and widely used method (WHO, 2009).

9.7.5 Decreasing radon concentrations in drinking-water
Reasonably simple measures are available to decrease radon concentrations in
drinking-water by aeration. High-performance aeration is an effective means for the
removal of radon in groundwater supplies and can achieve up to 99.9% removal. How-
ever, these methods may create a large source of airborne radon. Adsorption via granular
activated carbon, with or without ion exchange, can also achieve high radon removal
efficiencies, but is less efficient and requires large amounts of granular activated carbon.

9.8 Risk communication
9.8.1 Reporting results
The analytical results for each sample should contain the following information:

•   sample identification code;
•   sample collection date and time;
•   standard analytical methods used or brief description of any non-standard
    analytical methods used;
•   identification of the radionuclides or type of radioactivity and total radioactivity
    determined;
•   measurement-based concentration or activity value calculated using the appro-
    priate blank for each radionuclide;
•   estimates of the counting uncertainty;
•   a minimum detectable concentration for each radionuclide or parameter ana­
    lysed;
•   estimate of total projected uncertainty of the reported result, including the con-
    tributions from all the parameters within the analytical method (i.e. counting and
    other random and systematic uncertainties or errors).

9.8.2 Communicating risks
Communicating radiation risks clearly and effectively includes identifying target audi-
ences (e.g. public, policy-makers and decision-makers) and tailoring the messages to
them (WHO, 2002). Risk has different meaning for different people, but, in general,
risk communication requires a description of the likelihood of harm and its severity.
     Risk communication with the public should utilize plain language. The tech-
nical lexicon of radiation protection is not readily understood by non-specialists
(Picano, 2008). In some situations, comparisons are helpful to explain radiation risks

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


(e.g. placing possible health risks from ingestion of drinking-water in the context of
risk associated with exposure to natural radiation in different parts of the world). It
should be clearly explained that guidance levels should not be interpreted as manda-
tory limits and that exceeding a guidance level may be taken as a trigger for further
investigation, but it is not necessarily an indication that the drinking-water is unsafe.
      The persons in charge of communicating risk should be skilled in interpersonal
communication, able to convey empathy, effective listeners and respectful of people’s
concerns. They should be knowledgeable about the topic area with which they are
dealing and be able to answer basic questions about the current as well as possible fu-
ture risks. Guidance on radiation risk communication is provided elsewhere (USEPA,
2007; WHO, 2009).

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Some substances of health concern have effects on the taste, odour or appearance
of drinking-water that would normally lead to rejection of the water at concentrations
significantly lower than those of concern for health.

tionable to consumers is variable and dependent on           Guideline values have not

considerations. Guideline values have not been es-
tablished for constituents influencing water quality
that have no direct link to adverse health impacts. However, guideline values have been
established for some substances that may cause taste or odour in drinking-water at
much lower concentrations than the guideline value because there is such a wide range
in the ability of consumers to detect them by taste or odour. In the summaries in this
chapter and the fact sheets in chapter 12, reference is made to levels likely to give rise
to complaints from consumers. These are not precise numbers, and tastes or odours
may be detectable by consumers at lower or higher levels, depending on individual
and local circumstances.
     It is important to consider whether existing or proposed water treatment and
distribution practices can affect the acceptability of drinking-water and to manage
change and operations to minimize the risk of problems for acceptability as well as
health. For example, chloramination that is not properly managed can lead to the
formation of trichloramines, which can cause unacceptable taste and odour. Other
problems may be indirect, such as the disturbance of internal pipe deposits and bio-
films when the flow is disturbed or changed in distribution systems.
     It is not normally appropriate to directly regulate or monitor substances of health
concern whose effects on the acceptability of water would normally lead to rejection
of the water at concentrations significantly lower than those of concern for health;
rather, these substances may be addressed through a general requirement that water be
acceptable to the majority of consumers. For such substances, a formal guideline value
is not usually derived, but a health-based value is derived in order to assist in judging
the response that is needed when problems are encountered and in some cases to pro-
vide reassurance to health authorities and consumers with regard to possible health
risks. In the fact sheets in chapter 12, this is explained, and information on accept-
ability is described. In the tables of guideline values (see chapter 8 and Annex 3), for
those chemicals for which health-based guideline values were derived, the guideline
value is designated with a “C”, with a footnote explaining that while the substance is of
health significance, water would normally be rejected by consumers at concentrations
well below the health-based guideline value. Monitoring of such substances should be
undertaken in response to consumer complaints.
     Taste and odour can originate from natural inorganic and organic chemical con-
taminants and biological sources or processes (e.g. aquatic microorganisms), from
contamination by synthetic chemicals, from corrosion or as a result of problems with
water treatment (e.g. chlorination). Taste and odour may also develop during storage
and distribution as a result of microbial activity.


                                            220
                       10. ACCEPTABILITY ASPECTS: TASTE, ODOUR AND APPEARANCE


     Taste and odour in drinking-water may be indicative of some form of pollution
or of a malfunction during water treatment or distribution. It may therefore be an
indication of the presence of potentially harmful substances. The cause should be in-
vestigated and the appropriate health authorities should be consulted, particularly if
there is a sudden or substantial change.
     Colour, cloudiness, particulate matter and visible organisms may also be noticed
by consumers and may create concerns about the quality and acceptability of a drink-
ing-water supply.

10.1 Biologically derived contaminants
There are a number of diverse organisms that often have no public health significance
but which are undesirable because they produce taste and odour. As well as affecting
the acceptability of the water, they indicate that water treatment and/or the state of
maintenance and repair of the distribution system are insufficient.

Actinomycetes and fungi
Actinomycetes and fungi can be abundant in surface water sources, including reser-
voirs, and they can also grow on unsuitable materials in the water supply distribution
systems, such as rubber. They can produce geosmin, 2-methyl isoborneol and other
substances, resulting in objectionable tastes and odours in the drinking-water.

Cyanobacteria and algae
Blooms of cyanobacteria and other algae in reservoirs and in river waters may impede
coagulation and filtration, causing coloration and turbidity of water after filtration.
They can also produce geosmin, 2-methyl isoborneol and other chemicals, which have
taste thresholds in drinking-water of a few nanograms per litre. Some other cyano-
bacterial products—cyanotoxins—are also of direct health significance (see section
8.5.1), but the production by cyanobacteria of chemicals with effects on taste does not
seem to be linked to the production of cyanotoxins.

Invertebrate animal life1
Invertebrate animals are naturally present in many water resources used as sources
for the supply of drinking-water and often infest shallow, open wells. Small numbers
of invertebrates may also pass through water treatment works where the barriers to
particulate matter are not completely effective and colonize filters or the distribution
system. Their motility may enable them and their larvae to penetrate filters at the
treatment works and vents on storage reservoirs.
     The types of invertebrates concerned can be considered, for control purposes, as
belonging to two groups. First, there are free-swimming organisms in the water itself
or on water surfaces, such as the crustaceans Gammarus pulex (freshwater shrimp),
Crangonyx pseudogracilis, Cyclops spp. and Chydorus sphaericus. Second, there are
other invertebrates that either move along surfaces or are anchored to them (e.g. water

                                                    221
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


louse [Asellus aquaticus], snails, zebra mussel [Dreissena polymorpha], other bivalve
molluscs and the bryozoan Plumatella sp.) or inhabit slimes (e.g. Nais spp., nematodes
and the larvae of chironomids). In warm weather, slow sand filters can sometimes
discharge the larvae of gnats (Chironomus and Culex spp.) into the water. In certain
circumstances, these can reproduce parthenogenetically (i.e. asexual reproduction),
which can exacerbate the problem in service reservoirs and distribution.
      Many of these invertebrates can survive, deriving food from bacteria, algae and
protozoa in the water or present on slimes on pipe and tank surfaces. Few water dis-
tribution systems are completely free of animals at all times. However, the density and
composition of invertebrate populations vary widely, from heavy infestations, includ-
ing readily visible species that are objectionable to consumers, to sparse occurrences
of microscopic species.
      The presence of invertebrates has largely been regarded by piped drinking-water
suppliers in temperate regions as an acceptability problem, either directly or through
their association with discoloured water. Large invertebrate populations also indicate
high levels of organic material that may give rise to other water quality issues, such
as microbial growth. In tropical and subtropical countries, in contrast, there are spe-
cies of aquatic invertebrates that act as secondary hosts for parasites. For example, the
small crustacean Cyclops is the intermediate host of the guinea worm (Dracunculus
medinensis) (see sections 7.1.1 and 11.4). However, there is no evidence that guinea
worm transmission occurs from piped drinking-water supplies. The presence of in-
vertebrates in drinking-water, especially if visible, raises consumer concern about the
quality of the drinking-water supply and should be controlled.
      Penetration of waterworks and mains is more likely to be a problem when high-
rate filtration processes are used, but problems can arise even at well-run treatment
works. Regular cleaning of water mains by flushing and/or swabbing will usually con-
trol infestation.
      Treatment of invertebrate infestations in piped distribution systems is discussed
in detail in chapter 6 of the supporting document Safe piped water (Annex 1).

Iron bacteria
In waters containing ferrous and manganous salts, oxidation by iron bacteria (or by
exposure to air) may cause rust-coloured deposits on the walls of tanks, pipes and
channels and carry-over of deposits into the water.

10.2 Chemically derived contaminants
Aluminium
Naturally occurring aluminium as well as aluminium salts used as coagulants in
drinking-water treatment are the primary sources of aluminium in drinking-water.
The presence of aluminium at concentrations in excess of 0.1–0.2 mg/l often leads to
consumer complaints as a result of deposition of aluminium hydroxide floc and the
exacerbation of discoloration of water by iron. It is therefore important to optimize
treatment processes in order to minimize any residual aluminium entering the distri-
bution system. Under good operating conditions, aluminium concentrations of less

                                          222
                  10. ACCEPTABILITY ASPECTS: TASTE, ODOUR AND APPEARANCE


than 0.1 mg/l are achievable in many circumstances. Available evidence does not sup-
port the derivation of a health-based guideline value for aluminium in drinking-water
(see sections 8.5.4 and 12.1).

Ammonia
The threshold odour concentration of ammonia at alkaline pH is approximately 1.5
mg/l, and a taste threshold of 35 mg/l has been proposed for the ammonium cat-
ion. Ammonia is not of direct relevance to health at these levels, and no health-based
guideline value has been proposed (see sections 8.5.3 and 12.1). However, ammonia
does react with chlorine to reduce free chlorine and to form chloramines.

Chloramines
Chloramines, such as monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine (nitrogen
trichloride), are generated from the reaction of chlorine with ammonia. Among
chloramines, monochloramine is the only useful chlorine disinfectant, and
chloramination systems are operated to minimize the formation of dichloramine and
trichloramine. Higher chloramines, particularly trichloramine, are likely to give rise to
taste and odour complaints, except at very low concentrations.
     For monochloramine, no odour or taste was detected at concentrations between
0.5 and 1.5 mg/l. However, slight organoleptic effects within this range and odour
and taste thresholds of 0.65 and 0.48 mg/l have been reported. For dichloramine, the
organoleptic effects between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/l were found to be “slight” and “accept-
able”. Odour and taste thresholds of 0.15 and 0.13 mg/l were reported, respectively.
An odour threshold of 0.02 mg/l has been reported for trichloramine, and it has been
described as “geranium”.
     A guideline value for monochloramine has been established (see sections 8.5.4
and 12.1).

Chloride
High concentrations of chloride give a salty taste to water and beverages. Taste thresh-
olds for the chloride anion depend on the associated cation and are in the range of
200–300 mg/l for sodium, potassium and calcium chloride. Concentrations in excess
of 250 mg/l are increasingly likely to be detected by taste, but some consumers may
become accustomed to low levels of chloride-induced taste. No health-based guideline
value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water (see sections 8.5.1 and 12.1).

Chlorine
Most individuals are able to taste or smell chlorine in drinking-water at concentra-
tions well below 5 mg/l, and some at levels as low as 0.3 mg/l. The taste threshold
for chlorine is below the health-based guideline value of 5 mg/l (see sections 8.5.4
and 12.1).

Chlorobenzenes
Taste and odour thresholds of 10–20 µg/l and odour thresholds ranging from 40 to
120 µg/l have been reported for monochlorobenzene. A health-based guideline value

                                           223
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


has not been derived for monochlorobenzene (see sections 8.5.2 and 12.1), although
the health-based value that could be derived far exceeds the lowest reported taste and
odour threshold in water.
     Odour thresholds of 2–10 and 0.3–30 µg/l have been reported for 1,2- and 1,4-
dichlorobenzene, respectively. Taste thresholds of 1 and 6 µg/l have been reported for
1,2- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, respectively. The health-based guideline values of 1
mg/l derived for 1,2-dichlorobenze and of 0.3 mg/l for 1,4-dichlorobenzene (see
sections 8.5.2 and 12.1) far exceed the lowest reported taste and odour thresholds for
these compounds.
     Odour thresholds of 10, 5–30 and 50 µg/l have been reported for 1,2,3-, 1,2,4- and
1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, respectively. A taste and odour threshold concentration of 30 µg/l
has been reported for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. A health-based guideline value was not de-
rived for trichlorobenzenes, although the health-based value that could be derived (see
sections 8.5.2 and 12.1) exceeds the lowest reported odour threshold in water of 5 µg/l.

Chlorophenols
Chlorophenols generally have very low taste and odour thresholds. The taste thresh-
olds in water for 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol are
0.1, 0.3 and 2 µg/l, respectively. Odour thresholds are 10, 40 and 300 µg/l, respectively.
If water containing 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is free from taste, it is unlikely to present a
significant risk to health (see sections 8.5.4 and 12.1). Microorganisms in distribution
systems may sometimes methylate chlorophenols to produce chlorinated anisoles, for
which the odour threshold is considerably lower.

Colour
Drinking-water should ideally have no visible colour. Colour in drinking-water is usu-
ally due to the presence of coloured organic matter (primarily humic and fulvic acids)
associated with the humus fraction of soil. Colour is also strongly influenced by the
presence of iron and other metals, either as natural impurities or as corrosion prod-
ucts. It may also result from the contamination of the water source with industrial
effluents and may be the first indication of a hazardous situation. The source of colour
in a drinking-water supply should be investigated, particularly if a substantial change
has taken place.
     Most people can detect colour above 15 true colour units (TCU) in a glass of
water. Levels of colour below 15 TCU are often acceptable to consumers. High colour
from natural organic carbon (e.g. humics) could also indicate a high propensity to
produce by-products from disinfection processes. No health-based guideline value is
proposed for colour in drinking-water.

Copper
Copper in a drinking-water supply usually arises from the corrosive action of water
leaching copper from copper pipes in buildings. High levels of dissolved oxygen have
been shown to accelerate copper corrosion in some cases. Concentrations can vary
significantly with the period of time the water has been standing in contact with the
pipes; for example, first-draw water would be expected to have a higher copper con-

                                           224
                  10. ACCEPTABILITY ASPECTS: TASTE, ODOUR AND APPEARANCE


centration than a fully flushed sample. High concentrations can interfere with the
intended domestic uses of the water. Staining of sanitary ware and laundry may occur
at copper concentrations above 1 mg/l. At levels above 5 mg/l, copper also imparts a
colour and an undesirable bitter taste to water. Although copper can give rise to taste,
it should be acceptable at the health-based guideline value of 2 mg/l (see sections 8.5.4,
12.1 and A5.3 in Annex 5).

Dissolved oxygen
The dissolved oxygen content of water is influenced by the source, raw water tem-
perature, treatment and chemical or biological processes taking place in the distri-
bution system. Depletion of dissolved oxygen in water supplies can encourage the
microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrite and sulfate to sulfide. It can also cause an
increase in the concentration of ferrous iron in solution, with subsequent discolora­
tion at the tap when the water is aerated. No health-based guideline value is recom-
mended. However, very high levels of dissolved oxygen may exacerbate corrosion of
metal pipes.

Ethylbenzene
Ethylbenzene has an aromatic odour; the reported odour threshold in water ranges
from 2 to 130 µg/l. The lowest reported odour threshold is 100-fold lower than the
health-based guideline value of 0.3 mg/l (see sections 8.5.2 and 12.1). The taste thresh-
old ranges from 72 to 200 µg/l.

Hardness
Hardness caused by calcium and magnesium is usually indicated by precipitation of
soap scum and the need for excess use of soap to achieve cleaning. Consumers are
likely to notice changes in hardness. Public acceptability of the degree of hardness of
water may vary considerably from one community to another. The taste threshold for
the calcium ion is in the range of 100–300 mg/l, depending on the associated anion,
and the taste threshold for magnesium is probably lower than that for calcium. In
some instances, consumers tolerate water hardness in excess of 500 mg/l.
     Depending on the interaction of other factors, such as pH and alkalinity, water
with a hardness above approximately 200 mg/l may cause scale deposition in the treat-
ment works, distribution system and pipework and tanks within buildings. It will also
result in high soap consumption and subsequent “scum” formation. On heating, hard
waters form deposits of calcium carbonate scale. Soft water, but not necessarily cation
exchange softened water, with a hardness of less than 100 mg/l, may, in contrast, have
a low buffering capacity and so be more corrosive for water pipes.
     No health-based guideline value is proposed for hardness in drinking-water (see
the supporting document Calcium and magnesium in drinking-water; Annex 1).

Hydrogen sulfide
The taste and odour thresholds of hydrogen sulfide in water are estimated to be be-
tween 0.05 and 0.1 mg/l. The “rotten eggs” odour of hydrogen sulfide is particularly


                                           225
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


noticeable in some groundwaters and in stagnant drinking-water in the distribution
system, as a result of oxygen depletion and the subsequent reduction of sulfate by
bacterial activity.
     Sulfide is oxidized rapidly to sulfate in well-aerated or chlorinated water, and hy-
drogen sulfide levels in oxygenated water supplies are normally very low. The presence
of hydrogen sulfide in drinking-water can be easily detected by the consumer and
requires immediate corrective action. It is unlikely that a person could consume a
harmful dose of hydrogen sulfide from drinking-water; hence, a health-based guide-
line value has not been derived for this compound (see sections 8.5.1 and 12.1).

Iron
Anaerobic groundwater may contain ferrous iron at concentrations up to several milli-
grams per litre without discoloration or turbidity in the water when directly pumped
from a well. On exposure to the atmosphere, however, the ferrous iron oxidizes to fer-
ric iron, giving an objectionable reddish-brown colour to the water.
      Iron also promotes the growth of “iron bacteria”, which derive their energy from
the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron and in the process deposit a slimy coating
on the piping. At levels above 0.3 mg/l, iron stains laundry and plumbing fixtures.
There is usually no noticeable taste at iron concentrations below 0.3 mg/l, although
turbidity and colour may develop. No health-based guideline value is proposed for
iron (see sections 8.5.4 and 12.1).

Manganese
At levels exceeding 0.1 mg/l, manganese in water supplies may cause an undesirable
taste in beverages and stains sanitary ware and laundry. The presence of manganese
in drinking-water, like that of iron, may lead to the accumulation of deposits in the
distribution system. Concentrations below 0.1 mg/l are usually acceptable to consum-
ers. Even at a concentration of 0.2 mg/l, manganese will often form a coating on pipes,
which may slough off as a black precipitate. The health-based value of 0.4 mg/l for
manganese is higher than this acceptability threshold of 0.1 mg/l (see sections 8.5.1
and 12.1). However, under some conditions, manganese can be at concentrations
above 0.1 mg/L and may remain in solution for a longer period compared with its
usual solubility in most drinking-water.

Petroleum oils
Petroleum oils can give rise to the presence of a number of low molecular weight
hydrocarbons that have low odour thresholds in drinking-water. Benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) are considered individually in this section, as health-
based guideline values have been derived for these chemicals. However, a number of
other hydrocarbons, particularly alkylbenzenes such as trimethylbenzene, may give
rise to a very unpleasant “diesel-like” odour at concentrations of a few micrograms
per litre. There is experience indicating that the taste threshold of a mixture of low
molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons is lower than the threshold of individual
substances. Diesel is a particularly rich source of such substances.

pH and corrosion
Although pH usually has no direct impact on consumers, it is one of the most im-
portant operational water quality parameters. Careful attention to pH control is ne­




                                        226a
                 10. ACCEPTABILITY ASPECTS: TASTE, ODOUR AND APPEARANCE


cessary at all stages of water treatment to ensure satisfactory water clarification and
disinfection (see the supporting document Safe piped water; Annex 1). For effective
disinfection with chlorine, the pH should preferably be less than 8; however, low­
er-pH water (approximately pH 7 or less) is more likely to be corrosive. The pH of
the water entering the distribution system must be controlled to minimize the cor-
rosion of water mains and pipes in household water systems. Alkalinity and calcium
management also contribute to the stability of water and control its aggressiveness to
pipes and appliances. Failure to minimize corrosion can result in the contamination
of drinking-water and in adverse effects on its taste and appearance. The optimum
pH required will vary in different supplies according to the composition of the water
and the nature of the construction materials used in the distribution system, but it is
usually in the range 6.5–8.5 (see section 8.4.3). Extreme values of pH can result from
accidental spills, treatment breakdowns and insufficiently cured cement mortar pipe
linings or cement mortar linings applied when the alkalinity of the water is low. No
health-based guideline value has been proposed for pH (see section 12.1).

Sodium
The taste threshold concentration of sodium in water depends on the associated anion
and the temperature of the solution. At room temperature, the average taste threshold
for sodium is about 200 mg/l. No health-based guideline value has been derived (see
sections 8.5.1 and 12.1), as the contribution from drinking-water to daily intake is
small.

Styrene
Styrene has a sweet/sickly odour, and reported odour thresholds for styrene in water
range from 0.004 to 2.6 mg/l, depending on temperature. Styrene may therefore be
detected in water at concentrations below its health-based guideline value of 0.02 mg/l
(see sections 8.5.2 and 12.1).

Sulfate
The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can cause noticeable taste, and very high
levels might cause a laxative effect in unaccustomed consumers. Taste impairment
varies with the nature of the associated cation; taste thresholds have been found to
range from 250 mg/l for sodium sulfate to 1000 mg/l for calcium sulfate. It is generally
considered that taste impairment is minimal at levels below 250 mg/l. No health-based
guideline value has been derived for sulfate (see sections 8.5.1 and 12.1).

Synthetic detergents
In many countries, persistent types of anionic detergent have been replaced by others
that are more easily biodegraded, and hence the levels found in water sources have
decreased substantially. The concentration of detergents in drinking-water should not
be allowed to reach levels giving rise to either foaming or taste problems. The presence
of any detergent may indicate contamination of source water with sewage or ingress of
detergent solution into the distribution system, as a result of back-flow, for example.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Toluene
Toluene has a sweet, pungent, benzene-like odour. The reported taste threshold ranges
from 0.04 to 0.12 mg/l. The reported odour threshold for toluene in water ranges
from 0.024 to 0.17 mg/l. Toluene may therefore affect the acceptability of water at
concentrations below its health-based guideline value of 0.7 mg/l (see sections 8.5.2
and 12.1).

Total dissolved solids
The palatability of water with a total dissolved solids (TDS) level of less than about
600 mg/l is generally considered to be good; drinking-water becomes significantly and
increasingly unpalatable at TDS levels greater than about 1000 mg/l. The presence of
high levels of TDS may also be objectionable to consumers, owing to excessive scaling
in water pipes, heaters, boilers and household appliances. No health-based guideline
value for TDS has been proposed (see sections 8.5.1 and 12.1).

Turbidity
Turbidity, typically expressed as nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), describes the
cloudiness of water caused by suspended particles (e.g. clay and silts), chemical pre-
cipitates (e.g. manganese and iron), organic particles (e.g. plant debris) and organisms.
Turbidity can be caused by poor source water quality, poor treatment and, within dis-
tribution systems, disturbance of sediments and biofilms or the ingress of dirty water
through main breaks and other faults. At high levels, turbidity can lead to staining of
materials, fittings and clothes exposed during washing, in addition to interfering with
the effectiveness of treatment processes (see Tables 7.7 and 7.8 in chapter 7).
     Increasing turbidity reduces the clarity of water to transmitted light. Below
4 NTU, turbidity can be detected only using instruments, but at 4 NTU and above, a
milky-white, muddy, red-brown or black suspension can be visible. Large municipal
supplies should consistently produce water with no visible turbidity (and should be
able to achieve 0.5 NTU before disinfection at all times and average 0.2 NTU or less).
However, small supplies, particularly those where resources are limited, may not be
able to achieve such levels.
     Visible turbidity reduces the acceptability of drinking-water. Although most
particles that contribute to turbidity have no health significance (even though they
may indicate the presence of hazardous chemical and microbial contaminants), many
consumers associate turbidity with safety and consider turbid water as being unsafe
to drink. This response is exacerbated when consumers have been used to receiving
high-quality filtered water. If consumers lose confidence in a drinking-water supply,
they may drink less water or use lower turbidity alternatives that may not be safe. Any
complaints about unexpected turbidity should always be investigated because they
could reflect significant faults or breaches in distribution systems.
     Further information is available in Turbidity: information for regulators and opera-
tors of water supplies (see Annex 1).

Xylenes
Xylene concentrations in the range of 0.3 mg/l produce a detectable taste and odour.
The odour threshold for xylene isomers in water has been reported to range from 0.02
to 1.8 mg/l. The lowest odour threshold is well below the health-based guideline value
of 0.5 mg/l for xylene (see sections 8.5.2 and 12.1).

Zinc
Zinc imparts an undesirable astringent taste to water at a taste threshold concentra-
tion of about 4 mg/l (as zinc sulfate). Water containing zinc at concentrations in excess
of 3–5 mg/l may appear opalescent and develop a greasy film on boiling. Although
drinking-water seldom contains zinc at concentrations above 0.1 mg/l, levels in tap
water can be considerably higher because of the zinc used in older galvanized plumb-
ing materials; this may also be an indicator of elevated cadmium from such older

material. No health-based guideline value has been proposed for zinc in drinking-
water (see sections 8.5.4 and 12.1).

10.3 Treatment of taste, odour and appearance problems
In many cases, aesthetic problems will be prevented by optimizing conventional treat-
ment processes such as coagulation, sedimentation and chlorination. However, if
specific treatment is deemed necessary, aeration, granular or powdered activated car-
bon and ozonation are generally effective techniques in removing organic chemicals
and some inorganic chemicals, such as hydrogen sulfide, that cause tastes and odours.
(see Annex 5).
     Tastes and odours caused by disinfectants are best controlled through careful
operation of the disinfection process and pretreatment to remove precursors.
     Manganese can be removed by chlorination followed by filtration. Techniques for
removing hydrogen sulfide include aeration, granular activated carbon, filtration and
oxidation. Ammonia can be removed by biological nitrification. Precipitation soft­
ening or cation exchange can reduce hardness. Other taste- and odour-causing in-
organic chemicals (e.g. chloride and sulfate) are generally not amenable to treatment
(see the supporting document Chemical safety of drinking-water; Annex 1).

10.4 Temperature
Cool water is generally more palatable than warm water, and temperature will have an
impact on the acceptability of a number of other inorganic constituents and chemical
contaminants that may affect taste. High water temperature enhances the growth of
microorganisms and may increase problems related to taste, odour, colour and cor-
rosion.

pathogens, however, there are other important sources of infection, such as person-to-
person contact and food.
     Most waterborne pathogens are introduced into drinking-water supplies in hu-
man or animal faeces, do not grow in water and initiate infection in the gastrointestin­
al tract following ingestion. However, Legionella, atypical mycobacteria, Burkholderia
pseudomallei, Acanthamoeba spp. and Naegleria fowleri are environmental organisms
that can grow in water and soil. Besides ingestion, other routes of transmission can
include inhalation, leading to infections of the respiratory tract (e.g. Legionella, atypi-
cal mycobacteria), and contact, leading to infections at sites as diverse as the skin and
brain (e.g. Naegleria fowleri, Burkholderia pseudomallei).
     Of all the waterborne pathogens, the helminth Dracunculus medinensis is unique
in that it is the only pathogen that is solely transmitted through drinking-water.
     The fact sheets on potential pathogens include information on human health ef-
fects, sources and occurrence, routes of transmission and the significance of drinking-
water as a source of infection. The fact sheets on microorganisms that can be used
as indicators of the effectiveness of control measures or of the potential presence of
pathogenic microorganisms provide information on indicator value, source and oc-
currence, application and significance of detection.

11.1 Bacterial pathogens
Most bacterial pathogens potentially transmitted by water infect the gastrointes­
tinal tract and are excreted in the faeces of infected humans and animals. However,
there are also some waterborne bacterial pathogens, such as Legionella, Burkholderia
pseudomallei and atypical mycobacteria, that can grow in water and soil. The routes
of transmission of these bacteria include inhalation and contact (bathing), with infec-
tions occurring in the respiratory tract, in skin lesions or in the brain.

Acinetobacter
General description
Acinetobacter spp. are Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, non-motile coccobacilli (short
plump rods). Owing to difficulties in naming individual species and biovars, the term
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex is used in some classification schemes
to cover all subgroups of this species, such as A. baumannii, A. iwoffii and A. junii.

Human health effects
Acinetobacter spp. are usually commensal organisms, but they occasionally cause in-
fections, predominantly in susceptible patients in hospitals. They are opportunistic
pathogens that may cause urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bacteraemia, second-
ary meningitis and wound infections. These diseases are predisposed by factors such
as malignancy, burns, major surgery and weakened immune systems, such as in neo-
nates and elderly individuals. The emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant
A. calcoaceticus baumannii complex, causing nosocomial infections, are of concern in
health-care facilities.

                                    11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Source and occurrence
Acinetobacter spp. are ubiquitous inhabitants of soil, water and sewage environments.
Acinetobacter has been isolated from 97% of natural surface water samples in numbers
of up to 100/ml. The organisms have been found to represent 1.0–5.5% of the hetero-
trophic plate count (HPC) flora in drinking-water samples and have been isolated
from 5–92% of distribution water samples. In a survey of untreated groundwater sup-
plies in the United States of America (USA), Acinetobacter spp. were detected in 38%
of the groundwater supplies at an arithmetic mean density of 8/100 ml. The study
also revealed that slime production, a virulence factor for A. calcoaceticus, was not
significantly different between well water isolates and clinical strains, suggesting some
degree of pathogenic potential for strains isolated from groundwater. Acinetobacter
spp. are part of the natural microbial flora of the skin and occasionally the respiratory
tract of healthy individuals.

Routes of exposure
Environmental sources within hospitals and person-to-person transmission are the
likely sources for most outbreaks of hospital infections. Infection is most commonly
associated with contact with wounds and burns or inhalation by susceptible individ­
uals. In patients with Acinetobacter bacteraemia, intravenous catheters have also been
identified as a source of infection. Outbreaks of infection have been associated with
water baths and room humidifiers. Ingestion is not a usual source of infection.

Significance in drinking-water
Although Acinetobacter spp. are often detected in treated drinking-water supplies, an
association between the presence of Acinetobacter spp. in drinking-water and clinic­
al disease has not been confirmed. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal infection
through ingestion of Acinetobacter spp. in drinking-water among the general popula-
tion. However, transmission of non-gastrointestinal infections by drinking-water may
be possible in susceptible individuals, particularly in settings such as health-care facili-
ties and hospitals. As discussed in chapter 6, specific water safety plans should be de-
veloped for buildings, including hospitals and other health-care facilities. These plans
need to take account of particular sensitivities of occupants. Acinetobacter spp. are
sensitive to disinfectants such as chlorine, and numbers will be low in the presence of a
disinfectant residual. Control measures that can limit growth of the bacteria in distri-
bution systems include treatment to optimize organic carbon removal, restriction of
the residence time of water in distribution systems and maintenance of disinfectant
residuals. Acinetobacter spp. are detected by HPC, which can be used together with par­
ameters such as disinfectant residuals to indicate conditions that could support growth
of these organisms. However, Escherichia coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coli-
forms) cannot be used as an indicator for the presence/absence of Acinetobacter spp.

Aeromonas
General description
Aeromonas spp. are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultative anaerobic bacilli
belonging to the family Vibrionaceae. They bear many similarities to the Enterobac-
teriaceae. The genus is divided into two groups. The group of psychrophilic non-motile
aeromonads consists of only one species, A. salmonicida, an obligate fish pathogen
that is not considered further here. The group of mesophilic motile (single polar fla-
gellum) aeromonads is considered of potential human health significance and consists
of the species A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. veronii subsp. sobria, A. jandaei, A. veronii
subsp. veronii and A. schubertii. The bacteria are normal inhabitants of fresh water and
occur in water, soil and many foods, particularly meat and milk.

Human health effects
Aeromonas spp. can cause infections in humans, including septicaemia, particularly
in immunocompromised patients, wound infections and respiratory tract infections.
There have been some claims that Aeromonas spp. can cause gastrointestinal illness,
but epidemiological evidence is not consistent. Despite marked toxin production by
Aeromonas spp. in vitro, diarrhoea has not yet been introduced in test animals or hu-
man volunteers.

Source and occurrence
Aeromonas spp. occur in water, soil and food, particularly meat, fish and milk. Aero­
monas spp. are generally readily found in most fresh waters, and they have been de-
tected in many treated drinking-water supplies, mainly as a result of regrowth in dis-
tribution systems. The factors that affect the occurrence of Aeromonas spp. in water
distribution systems are not fully understood, but organic content, temperature, the
residence time of water in the distribution network and the presence of residual chlor­
ine have been shown to influence population sizes.

Routes of exposure
Wound infections have been associated with contaminated soil and water-related ac-
tivities, such as swimming, diving, boating and fishing. Septicaemia can follow from
such wound infections. In immunocompromised individuals, septicaemia may arise
from aeromonads present in their own gastrointestinal tract.

                                    11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Significance in drinking-water
Despite frequent isolation of Aeromonas spp. from drinking-water, the body of
evidence does not provide significant support for waterborne transmission. Aeromon­
ads typically found in drinking-water do not belong to the same deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) homology groups as those associated with cases of gastroenteritis. The
presence of Aeromonas spp. in drinking-water supplies is generally considered a nuis­
ance. Entry of aeromonads into distribution systems can be minimized by adequate
disinfection. Control measures that can limit growth of the bacteria in distribution
systems include treatment to optimize organic carbon removal, restriction of the resi-
dence time of water in distribution systems and maintenance of disinfectant residuals.
Aeromonas spp. are detected by HPC, which can be used together with parameters
such as disinfectant residuals to indicate conditions that could support growth of
these organisms. However, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) cannot
be used as an indicator for the presence/absence of Aeromonas spp.

Burkholderia pseudomallei
General description
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacillus commonly found in soil and
muddy water, predominantly in tropical regions such as northern Australia and south-
east Asia. The organism is acid tolerant and survives in water for prolonged periods in
the absence of nutrients.

Human health effects
Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause the disease melioidosis, which is endemic in
northern Australia and other tropical regions. The most common clinical manifesta-
tion is pneumonia, which may be fatal. In some of these areas, melioidosis is the most
common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Cases appear throughout the
year but peak during the rainy season. Many patients present with milder forms of
pneumonia, which respond well to appropriate antibiotics, but some may present with
a severe septicaemic pneumonia. Other symptoms include skin abscesses or ulcers,
abscesses in internal organs and unusual neurological illnesses, such as brainstem en-
cephalitis and acute paraplegia. Although melioidosis can occur in healthy children
and adults, it occurs mainly in people whose defence mechanisms against infection
are impaired by underlying conditions or poor general health associated with poor
nutrition or living conditions.

Source and occurrence
The organism occurs predominantly in tropical regions, typically in soil or surface-
accumulated muddy water, from where it may reach raw water sources and also drink-
ing-water supplies. The number of organisms in drinking-water that would constitute
a significant risk of infection is not known.


                                         236
                                   11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Routes of exposure
Most infections appear to be through contact of skin cuts or abrasions with contamin­
ated water. In south-east Asia, rice paddies represent a significant source of infection.
Infection may also occur via other routes, particularly through inhalation or inges-
tion. The relative importance of these routes of infection is not known.

Significance in drinking-water
In two Australian outbreaks of melioidosis, indistinguishable isolates of B. pseudomal­
lei were cultured from cases and the drinking-water supply. The detection of the
organisms in one drinking-water supply followed replacement of water pipes and
chlorination failure, whereas the second supply was unchlorinated. Within a water
safety plan, control measures that should provide effective protection against this
organism include application of established treatment and disinfection processes
for drinking-water coupled with protection of the distribution system from contam­
ination, including during repairs and maintenance. HPC and disinfectant residual
as measures of water treatment effectiveness and application of appropriate mains
repair procedures could be used to indicate protection against B. pseudomallei. Be-
cause of the environmental occurrence of B. pseudomallei, E. coli (or, alternatively,
thermotolerant coliforms) is not a suitable indicator for the presence/absence of this
organism.

Campylobacter
General description
Campylobacter spp. are microaerophilic (require decreased oxygen) and capnophilic
(require increased carbon dioxide), Gram-negative, curved spiral rods with a single
unsheathed polar flagellum. Campylobacter spp. are one of the most important causes
of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Campylobacter jejuni is the most frequently iso-
lated species from patients with acute diarrhoeal disease, whereas C. coli, C. laridis
and C. fetus have also been isolated in a small proportion of cases. Two closely related
genera, Helicobacter and Archobacter, include species previously classified as Campylo-
bacter spp.

Human health effects
An important feature of C. jejuni is relatively high infectivity compared with other
bacterial pathogens. As few as 1000 organisms can cause infection. Most symptomatic

                                              237
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


infections occur in infancy and early childhood. The incubation period is usually 2–4
days. Clinical symptoms of C. jejuni infection are characterized by abdominal pain,
diarrhoea (with or without blood or faecal leukocytes), vomiting, chills and fever. The
infection is self-limited and resolves in 3–7 days. Relapses may occur in 5–10% of
untreated patients. Other clinical manifestations of C. jejuni infections in humans in-
clude reactive arthritis and meningitis. Several reports have associated C. jejuni infec-
tion with Guillain-Barré syndrome, an acute demyelinating disease of the peripheral
nerves.

Source and occurrence
Campylobacter spp. occur in a variety of environments. Wild and domestic animals,
especially poultry, wild birds and cattle, are important reservoirs. Pets and other ani-
mals may also be reservoirs. Food, including meat and unpasteurized milk, are im-
portant sources of Campylobacter infections. Water is also a significant source. The
occurrence of the organisms in surface waters has proved to be strongly dependent on
rainfall, water temperature and the presence of waterfowl.

Routes of exposure
Most Campylobacter infections are reported as sporadic in nature, with food con-
sidered a common source of infection. Transmission to humans typically occurs by
the consumption of animal products. Meat, particularly poultry products, and un-
pasteurized milk are important sources of infection. Contaminated drinking-water
supplies have been identified as a source of outbreaks. The number of cases in these
outbreaks ranged from a few to several thousand, with sources including unchlorin­
ated or inadequately chlorinated surface water supplies and faecal contamination of
water storage reservoirs by wild birds.

Significance in drinking-water
Contaminated drinking-water supplies have been identified as a significant source of
outbreaks of campylobacteriosis. The detection of waterborne outbreaks and cases
appears to be increasing. Waterborne transmission has been confirmed by the isola-
tion of the same strains from patients and drinking-water they had consumed. Within
a water safety plan, control measures that can be applied to manage potential risk
from Campylobacter spp. include protection of raw water supplies from waste from
humans and animals, adequate treatment and protection of water during distribu-
tion. Storages of treated and disinfected water should be protected from bird faeces.
Campylobacter spp. are faecally borne pathogens and are not particularly resistant to
disinfection. Hence, E. coli (or thermotolerant coliforms) is an appropriate indicator
for the presence/absence of Campylobacter spp. in drinking-water supplies.

Enterobacter sakazakii
General description
Enterobacter sakazakii is a motile, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped
bacterium that has been found in infant formulas as a contaminant. Enterobacter spe-
cies are biochemically similar to Klebsiella; unlike Klebsiella, however, Enterobacter
is ornithine positive. Enterobacter sakazakii has been found to be more resistant to
osmotic and dry stress than other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family.

Human health effects
Enterobacter sakazakii has been associated with sporadic cases or small outbreaks of
sepsis, meningitis, cerebritis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Most of the infections are
seen in low-birth-weight infants (i.e. less than 2 kg) or infants born prematurely (i.e.
less than 37 weeks of gestation). Mortality has been reported to be as high as 50% but
has decreased to less than 20% in recent years.

Source and occurrence
The reservoir for E. sakazakii is unknown. Various environmental samples (surface
water, soil, mud, bird faeces) have tested negative. Enterobacter sakazakii has been
identified in the guts of certain flies. The organism has been frequently identified in
factories that produce milk powder and other food substances and in households.
Commercially produced non-sterile powdered infant formula has often been impli-
cated as the source of the bacteria during outbreaks. In a study of 141 powdered in-
fant formulas, 20 were found to be culture-positive for E. sakazakii, even though
the formulas complied with Codex microbial requirements for coliforms (< 3 colony-
forming units per gram). The bacteria have been found in samples from newly opened
sealed cans. Although sources of the bacteria other than infant formula have not been
identified, environmental sources probably exist.

Routes of exposure
Disease caused by E. sakazakii in infants has been associated with the consumption
of commercially prepared non-sterile infant formula. Contamination has been linked
back to either the infant formula itself or formula preparation equipment (e.g. blend-
ers). Many of the outbreaks have occurred without identified hygienic lapses during
formula preparation. The organism has not been found in drinking-water sources
used to prepare the formula. There is no evidence for person-to-person or more gen-
eral environmental transmission.

Significance in drinking-water
There is no evidence that these bacteria are transmitted through drinking-water, al-
though it is plausible that the organism could be present in water of poor quality.
Enterobacter sakazakii is sensitive to disinfectants, and its presence can be prevented
by adequate treatment.

Escherichia coli pathogenic strains
General description
Escherichia coli is present in large numbers in the normal intestinal flora of humans and
animals, where it generally causes no harm. However, in other parts of the body, E. coli
can cause serious disease, such as urinary tract infections, bacteraemia and meningitis.
A limited number of enteropathogenic strains can cause acute diarrhoea. Several class-
es of enteropathogenic E. coli have been identified on the basis of different virulence
factors, including enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC),
enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E.
coli (EAEC) and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). More is known about the first four
classes named; the pathogenicity and prevalence of EAEC and DAEC strains are less
well established.

Human health effects
EHEC serotypes, such as E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O111, cause diarrhoea that ranges
from mild and non-bloody to highly bloody, which is indistinguishable from haemor-
rhagic colitis. Between 2% and 7% of cases can develop the potentially fatal haemo-
lytic uraemic syndrome, which is characterized by acute renal failure and haemolytic
anaemia. Children under 5 years of age are at most risk of developing haemolytic
uraemic syndrome. The infectivity of EHEC strains is substantially higher than that of
the other strains. As few as 100 EHEC organisms can cause infection. ETEC produces
heat-labile or heat-stable E. coli enterotoxin, or both toxins simultaneously, and is an
important cause of diarrhoea in developing countries, especially in young children.
Symptoms of ETEC infection include mild watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, nau-
sea and headache. Infection with EPEC has been associated with severe, chronic, non-
bloody diarrhoea, vomiting and fever in infants. EPEC infections are rare in developed
countries, but occur commonly in developing countries, with infants presenting with
malnutrition, weight loss and growth retardation. EIEC causes watery and occasion-
ally bloody diarrhoea where strains invade colon cells by a pathogenic mechanism
similar to that of Shigella.



                                             240
                                  11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Source and occurrence
Enteropathogenic E. coli are enteric organisms, and humans are the major reservoir,
particularly of EPEC, ETEC and EIEC strains. Livestock, such as cattle and sheep and,
to a lesser extent, goats, pigs and chickens, are a major source of EHEC strains. The
latter have also been associated with raw vegetables, such as bean sprouts. The patho-
gens have been detected in a variety of water environments.
Routes of exposure
Infection is associated with person-to-person transmission, contact with animals,
food and consumption of contaminated water. Person-to-person transmissions are
particularly prevalent in communities where there is close contact between individ­
uals, such as nursing homes and day-care centres.

Significance in drinking-water
Waterborne transmission of pathogenic E. coli has been well documented for recre-
ational waters and contaminated drinking-water. A well-publicized waterborne out-
break of illness caused by E. coli O157:H7 (and Campylobacter jejuni) occurred in the
farming community of Walkerton in Ontario, Canada. The outbreak took place in
May 2000 and led to 7 deaths and more than 2300 illnesses. The drinking-water supply
was contaminated by rainwater runoff containing cattle excreta. Within a water safety
plan, control measures that can be applied to manage potential risk from enteropatho-
genic E. coli include protection of raw water supplies from human and animal waste,
adequate treatment and protection of water during distribution. There is no indica-
tion that the response of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli to water treatment and
disinfection procedures differs from that of other E. coli. Hence, conventional testing
for E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliform bacteria) provides an appropri-
ate indicator for the enteropathogenic serotypes in drinking-water. This applies even
though standard tests will generally not detect EHEC strains.

Helicobacter pylori
General description
Helicobacter pylori, originally classified as Campylobacter pylori, is a Gram-negative,
microaerophilic, spiral-shaped, motile bacterium. There are at least 14 species of
Helicobacter, but only H. pylori has been identified as a human pathogen.

Human health effects
Helicobacter pylori is found in the stomach; although most infections are asymptom-
atic, the organism is associated with chronic gastritis, which may lead to complications
such as peptic and duodenal ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Whether the organism

                                             241
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


is truly the cause of these conditions remains unclear. The majority of H. pylori infec-
tions are initiated in childhood and without treatment are chronic. The infections are
more prevalent in developing countries and are associated with overcrowded living
conditions. Interfamilial clustering is common.
Source and occurrence
Humans appear to be the primary host of H. pylori. Other hosts may include domestic
cats. There is evidence that H. pylori is sensitive to bile salts, which would reduce the
likelihood of faecal excretion, although it has been isolated from faeces of young chil-
dren. Helicobacter pylori has been detected in water. Although H. pylori is unlikely to
grow in the environment, it has been found to survive for 3 weeks in biofilms and up
to 20–30 days in surface waters. In a study conducted in the USA, H. pylori was found
in the majority of surface water and shallow groundwater samples. The presence of
H. pylori was not correlated with the presence of E. coli. Possible contamination of the
environment can be through children with diarrhoea or through vomiting by children
as well as adults.
Routes of exposure
Person-to-person contact within families has been identified as the most likely source
of infection through oral–oral transmission. Helicobacter pylori can survive well in
mucus or vomit. However, it is difficult to detect in mouth or faecal samples. Faecal–
oral transmission is also considered possible.
Significance in drinking-water
Consumption of contaminated drinking-water has been suggested as a potential source
of infection, but further investigation is required to establish any link with waterborne
transmission. Humans are the principal source of H. pylori, and the organism is sensi-
tive to oxidizing disinfectants. Hence, control measures that can be applied to protect
drinking-water supplies from H. pylori include preventing contamination by human
waste and adequate disinfection. Escherichia coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coli-
forms) is not a reliable indicator for the presence/absence of this organism.

Klebsiella
General description
Klebsiella spp. are Gram-negative, non-motile bacilli that belong to the family Entero-
bacteriaceae. The genus Klebsiella consists of a number of species, including K. pneu-
moniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola and K. terrigena. The outermost layer of Klebsiella

                                    11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


spp. consists of a large polysaccharide capsule that distinguishes the organisms from
other members of the family. Approximately 60–80% of all Klebsiella spp. isolated from
faeces and clinical specimens are K. pneumoniae and are positive in the thermotoler-
ant coliform test. Klebsiella oxytoca has also been identified as a pathogen.

Human health effects
Klebsiella spp. have been identified as colonizing hospital patients, where spread is as-
sociated with the frequent handling of patients (e.g. in intensive-care units). Patients
at highest risk are those with impaired immune systems, such as the elderly or very
young, patients with burns or excessive wounds, those undergoing immunosuppres-
sive therapy or those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. Colonization may lead to invasive infections.
On rare occasions, Klebsiella spp., notably K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, may cause
serious infections, such as destructive pneumonia.

Source and occurrence
Klebsiella spp. are natural inhabitants of many water environments, and they may
multiply to high numbers in waters rich in nutrients, such as pulp mill wastes, textile
finishing plants and sugar-cane processing operations. In drinking-water distribution
systems, they are known to colonize washers in taps. The organisms can grow in water
distribution systems. Klebsiella spp. are also excreted in the faeces of many healthy
humans and animals, and they are readily detected in sewage-polluted water.

Routes of exposure
Klebsiella can cause nosocomial infections, and contaminated water and aerosols may
be a potential source of the organisms in hospital environments and other health-care
facilities.

Significance in drinking-water
Klebsiella spp. are not considered to represent a source of gastrointestinal illness in
the general population through ingestion of drinking-water. Klebsiella spp. detected
in drinking-water are generally biofilm organisms and are unlikely to represent a
health risk. The organisms are reasonably sensitive to disinfectants, and entry into
distribution systems can be prevented by adequate treatment. Growth within distri-
bution systems can be minimized by strategies that are designed to minimize bio-
film growth, including treatment to optimize organic carbon removal, restriction of
the residence time of water in distribution systems and maintenance of disinfectant
residuals. Klebsiella is a coliform and can be detected by traditional tests for total
coliforms.

Legionella
General description
The genus Legionella, a member of the family Legionellaceae, has at least 50 species
comprising 70 distinct serogroups. Legionellae are Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-
spore-forming bacteria that require L-cysteine for growth and primary isolation.
Legionella spp. are heterotrophic bacteria found in a wide range of water environ-
ments and can proliferate at temperatures above 25 °C.

Human health effects
Although all Legionella spp. are considered potentially pathogenic for humans, L.
pneumophila is the major waterborne pathogen responsible for legionellosis, of which
two clinical forms are known: Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever. The former is
a pneumonic illness with an incubation period of 3–6 days. Host factors influence the
likelihood of illness: males are more frequently affected than females, and most cases
occur in the 40- to 70-year age group. Risk factors include smoking, alcohol abuse,
cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory or kidney disease and immunosuppression, as in
transplant recipients. Pontiac fever is a milder, self-limiting disease with a high attack
rate and an onset (5 hours to 3 days) and symptoms similar to those of influenza:
fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, aching muscles and coughing. Studies of seropreva-
lence of antibodies indicate that many infections are asymptomatic.

Source and occurrence
Legionella spp. are members of the natural flora of many freshwater environments,
such as rivers, streams and impoundments, where they occur in relatively low num-
bers. However, they thrive in certain human-made water environments, such as water
cooling devices (cooling towers and evaporative condensers) associated with air-
conditioning systems, hot water distribution systems and spas, which provide suitable
temperatures (25–50 °C) and conditions for their multiplication. Devices that sup-
port multiplication of Legionella have been associated with outbreaks of Legionnaires’
disease. Legionella survive and grow in biofilms and sediments and are more easily
detected from swab samples than from flowing water. Legionellae can be ingested by
trophozoites of certain amoebae such as Acanthamoeba, Hartmanella and Naegleria,
which play an important role in their persistence in water environments.

Routes of exposure
The most common route of infection is the inhalation of aerosols containing the bac-
teria. Such aerosols can be generated by contaminated cooling towers, warm water
showers, humidifiers and spas. Aspiration has also been identified as a route of in-
fection in some cases associated with contaminated water, food and ice. There is no
evidence of person-to-person transmission.

Significance in drinking-water
Legionella spp. are common waterborne organisms, and devices such as cooling tow-
ers, hot water systems and spas that utilize mains water have been associated with
outbreaks of infection. Owing to the prevalence of Legionella, the potential for ingress

                                   11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


into drinking-water systems should be considered as a possibility, and control meas­
ures should be employed to reduce the likelihood of survival and multiplication. Dis-
infection strategies designed to minimize biofilm growth and temperature control
can minimize the potential risk from Legionella spp. The organisms are sensitive to
disinfection. Monochloramine has been shown to be particularly effective, probably
due to its stability and greater effectiveness against biofilms. Water temperature is
an important element of control strategies. Wherever possible, water temperatures
should be kept outside the range of 25–50 °C and preferably 20–50 °C to prevent the
growth of the organism. In hot water systems, temperatures leaving heaters should
be above 60 °C, and temperatures above 50°C should be maintained throughout as-
sociated pipework. However, maintaining temperatures of hot water above 50 °C may
represent a scalding risk in young children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups.
Where temperatures in hot or cold water distribution systems cannot be maintained
outside the range of 25–50 °C, greater attention to disinfection and strategies aimed
at limiting development of biofilms are required. Accumulation of sludge, scale, rust,
algae or slime deposits in water distribution systems supports the growth of Legionella
spp., as does stagnant water. Systems that are kept clean and flowing are less likely to
support excess growth of Legionella spp. Care should also be taken to select plumbing
materials that do not support microbial growth and the development of biofilms.
     Legionella spp. represent a particular concern in devices such as cooling towers
and hot water systems in large buildings. As discussed in chapter 6, specific water
safety plans incorporating control measures for Legionella spp. should be developed
for these buildings. Legionella are not detected by HPC techniques, and E. coli (or,
alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not a suitable indicator for the presence/
absence of this organism.

Leptospira
General description
Leptospires are aerobic spirochetes that are typically 0.1 µm in diameter and 5–25 µm
in length. There are two genera: Leptospira, which includes the pathogenic L. interro-
gans, and Leptonoma. Leptospira interrogans causes the important zoonotic and wide-
spread disease leptospirosis. Pathogenic leptospires are maintained in host animals but,
depending on conditions, can survive for days to weeks in water. More than 200 patho-
genic serovars have been identified, and these have been divided into 25 serogroups
based on serologic relatedness.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Human health effects
Leptospirosis occurs globally, affecting people living in temperate and tropical cli-
mates in both rural and urban areas. The severity of illness and the types of symp-
toms vary widely. Infections are often subclinical or so mild that medical attention
is not sought. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, chills, redness in the
eyes, abdominal pain, jaundice, haemorrhages in skin and mucous membranes (in-
cluding pulmonary bleeding), vomiting, diarrhoea and rash. Pulmonary bleeding has
been recognized as a dangerous and often fatal result of leptospirosis, but the way it
develops after infection remains unclear. Long-lasting sequelae have been identified,
including depression, headaches, fatigue and joint pains. Weil disease, characterized
by jaundice, renal failure, haemorrhage and myocarditis, has been used as an alterna-
tive term for leptospirosis, but it represents a subset of the manifestations. Estimates
of case fatalities vary from less than 5% to 30%, but the figures are not considered
reliable owing to uncertainties over case prevalence. Fatality rates are influenced by
timeliness of treatment interventions. The number of cases is not well documented as
a result of lack of awareness and adequate methods of diagnosis. It has been estimated
that there are about 0.1–1 cases per 100 000 persons per year in temperate climates and
up to 10–100 cases per 100 000 persons per year in tropical climates.

Source and occurrence
Pathogenic Leptospira interrogans are maintained in the renal tubules of many ani-
mal hosts. This can take the form of chronic asymptomatic infections, with excre-
tion persisting for very long periods and even for life. Rats, especially the brown rat
(Rattus norvegicus), serve as a reservoir for Leptospira interrogans serovars Ictero-
haemorrhagiae and Copenhageni. Cattle are the most important reservoir for serovar
Hardjo, and field mice (Microtus arvalis) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are the
most important reservoirs for serovar Grippotyphosa. Recent research has shown
that the house mouse (Crocidura russula) may be a reservoir for serovar Mozdok
(type 3). Water contaminated with urine and tissues of infected animals is an estab-
lished source of pathogenic leptospires. Leptospires have a relatively low resistance to
adverse environmental conditions (e.g. low pH, desiccation, direct sunlight); in the
right circumstances (neutral pH, moderate temperatures), however, they can survive
for months in water.

Routes of exposure
Leptospira interrogans can enter the body through cuts and abrasions or via the mu-
cous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes. It is not transmitted by the faecal–
oral route. Leptospirosis is associated with a broad range of occupational activities
predominantly associated with direct contact with dead or living animals, but also
indirectly via urine-contaminated environments, especially surface water, plants and
mud. Ingestion of contaminated food and water or inhalation of aerosols may oc-
casionally cause infection. Direct person-to-person transmission is rarely observed.
Sexual contact, transplacental transmission and mothers’ milk are potential routes of
exposure. Transmission via urine of infected patients could represent a risk to those
who provide medical attention. There is an increasing trend of outbreaks associated


                                          246

with recreational exposure to water contaminated with urine from infected animals.
Outbreaks have also been associated with natural disasters involving flooding.
Significance in drinking-water
Waterborne leptospirosis is normally caused by contact with contaminated surface
water. Leptospires are sensitive to disinfectants; within a water safety plan, control
measures that should provide effective protection against this organism include appli-
cation of standard disinfection processes for drinking-water together with protection
of distribution systems from contamination associated with flooding events. Because
leptospires are excreted in urine and persist in favourable environments, E. coli (or,
alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not a suitable indicator for the presence/
absence of this organism.

Mycobacterium
General description
The tuberculous or “typical” species of Mycobacterium, such as M. tuberculosis, M.
bovis, M. africanum and M. leprae, have only human or animal reservoirs and are not
transmitted by water. In contrast, the non-tuberculous or “atypical” species of Myco-
bacterium are natural inhabitants of a variety of water environments. These aerobic,
rod-shaped and acid-fast bacteria grow slowly in suitable water environments and
on culture media. Typical examples include the species M. gordonae, M. kansasii, M.
marinum, M. scrofulaceum, M. xenopi, M. intracellulare and M. avium and the more
rapid growers M. chelonae and M. fortuitum. The term M. avium complex has been
used to describe a group of pathogenic species including M. avium and M. intracellu-
lare. However, other atypical mycobacteria are also pathogenic. A distinct feature of all
Mycobacterium spp. is a cell wall with high lipid content, which is used in identifica-
tion of the organisms using acid-fast staining.
Human health effects
Atypical Mycobacterium spp. can cause a range of diseases involving the skeleton,
lymph nodes, skin and soft tissues, as well as the respiratory, gastrointestinal and gen-
itourinary tracts. Manifestations include pulmonary disease, Buruli ulcer, osteomyel­
itis and septic arthritis in people with no known predisposing factors. These bacteria
are a major cause of disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients and are
a common cause of death in HIV-positive persons.
Source and occurrence
Atypical Mycobacterium spp. multiply in a variety of suitable water environments,
notably biofilms. One of the most commonly occurring species is M. gordonae. Other

                                              247
                             GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


species have also been isolated from water, including M. avium, M. intracellulare,
M. kansasii, M. fortuitum and M. chelonae. High numbers of atypical Mycobacterium
spp. may occur in distribution systems after events that dislodge biofilms, such as
flushing or flow reversals. They are relatively resistant to treatment and disinfection
and have been detected in well-operated and well-maintained drinking-water supplies
with HPC less than 500/ml and total chlorine residuals of up to 2.8 mg/l. The growth
of these organisms in biofilms reduces the effectiveness of disinfection. In one sur-
vey, the organisms were detected in 54% of ice and 35% of public drinking-water
samples.

Routes of exposure
Principal routes of infection appear to be inhalation, contact and ingestion of con-
taminated water. Infections by various species have been associated with their pres-
ence in drinking-water supplies. In 1968, an endemic of M. kansasii infections was
associated with the presence of the organisms in the drinking-water supply, and the
spread of the organisms was associated with aerosols from showerheads. In Rotter-
dam, the Netherlands, an investigation into the frequent isolation of M. kansasii from
clinical specimens revealed the presence of the same strains, confirmed by phage type
and weak nitrase activity, in tap water. An increase in numbers of infections by the
M. avium complex in Massachusetts, USA, has also been attributed to their incidence
in drinking-water. In all these cases, there is only circumstantial evidence of a causal
relationship between the occurrence of the bacteria in drinking-water and human
disease. Infections have been linked to contaminated water in spas.

Significance in drinking-water
Detections of atypical mycobacteria in drinking-water and the identified routes of
transmission suggest that drinking-water supplies are a plausible source of infection.
There are limited data on the effectiveness of control measures that could be applied
to reduce the potential risk from these organisms. One study showed that a water
treatment plant could achieve a 99% reduction in numbers of mycobacteria from raw
water. Atypical mycobacteria are relatively resistant to disinfection. Persistent resid-
ual disinfectant should reduce numbers of mycobacteria in the water column but is
unlikely to be effective against organisms present in biofilms. Control measures that
are designed to minimize biofilm growth, including treatment to optimize organic
carbon removal, restriction of the residence time of water in distribution systems
and maintenance of disinfectant residuals, could result in less growth of these organ-
isms. Mycobacteria are not detected by HPC techniques, and E. coli (or, alternatively,
thermotolerant coliforms) is not a suitable indicator for the presence/absence of this
organism.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa

General description
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a member of the family Pseudomonadaceae and is a polar­
ly flagellated, aerobic, Gram-negative rod. When grown in suitable media, it pro-
duces the non-fluorescent bluish pigment pyocyanin. Many strains also produce the
fluorescent green pigment pyoverdin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, like other fluorescent
pseudomonads, produces catalase, oxidase and ammonia from arginine and can grow
on citrate as the sole source of carbon.

Human health effects
Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause a range of infections but rarely causes serious ill-
ness in healthy individuals without some predisposing factor. It predominantly col­
onizes damaged sites such as burn and surgical wounds, the respiratory tract of people
with underlying disease and physically damaged eyes. From these sites, it may invade
the body, causing destructive lesions or septicaemia and meningitis. Cystic fibrosis
and immunocompromised patients are prone to colonization with P. aeruginosa,
which may lead to serious progressive pulmonary infections. Water-related folliculitis
and ear infections are associated with warm, moist environments such as swimming
pools and spas. Many strains are resistant to a range of antimicrobial agents, which can
increase the significance of the organism in hospital settings.

Source and occurrence
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common environmental organism and can be found in
faeces, soil, water and sewage. It can multiply in water environments and also on the
surface of suitable organic materials in contact with water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is
a recognized cause of hospital-acquired infections with potentially serious complica-
tions. It has been isolated from a range of moist environments such as sinks, water
baths, hot water systems, showers and spa pools.

Routes of exposure
The main route of infection is by exposure of susceptible tissue, notably wounds and
mucous membranes, to contaminated water or contamination of surgical instruments.


                                             249
                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Cleaning of contact lenses with contaminated water can cause a form of keratitis. In-
gestion of drinking-water is not an important source of infection.

Significance in drinking-water
Although P. aeruginosa can be significant in certain settings such as health-care
facilities, there is no evidence that normal uses of drinking-water supplies are a source
of infection in the general population. However, the presence of high numbers of
P. aeruginosa in potable water, notably in packaged water, can be associated with
complaints about taste, odour and turbidity. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is sensitive to
disinfection, and entry into distribution systems can be minimized by adequate dis-
infection. Control measures that are designed to minimize biofilm growth, includ-
ing treatment to optimize organic carbon removal, restriction of the residence time
of water in distribution systems and maintenance of disinfectant residuals, should
reduce the growth of these organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is detected by HPC,
which can be used together with parameters such as disinfectant residuals to indicate
conditions that could support growth of these organisms. However, as P. aeruginosa
is a common environmental organism, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coli-
forms) cannot be used for this purpose.

Salmonella
General description
Salmonella spp. belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae. They are motile, Gram-
negative bacilli that do not ferment lactose, but most produce hydrogen sulfide or
gas from carbohydrate fermentation. Originally, they were grouped into more than
2000 species (serotypes) according to their somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens
(Kauffmann-White classification). There has been much debate about nomencla-
ture and taxonomy of Salmonella, but it is now considered that there are actually two
species (Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori). Other previously named species,
including S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi, are considered to be serovars.

Human health effects
Salmonella infections typically cause four clinical manifestations: gastroenteritis (ran­
ging from mild to fulminant diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting), bacteraemia or septi-
caemia (high spiking fever with positive blood cultures), typhoid fever/enteric fever
(sustained fever with or without diarrhoea) and a carrier state in persons with previ-
ous infections. With regard to enteric illness, Salmonella spp. can be divided into two
fairly distinct groups: the typhoidal species/serovars (S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi) and

                                               250
                                   11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


the remaining non-typhoidal species/serovars. Symptoms of non-typhoidal gastro-
enteritis appear from 6 to 72 hours after ingestion of contaminated food or water.
Diarrhoea lasts 3–5 days and is accompanied by fever and abdominal pain. Usually the
disease is self-limiting. The incubation period for typhoid fever can be 1–14 days but is
usually 3–5 days. Typhoid fever is a more severe illness and can be fatal. Although ty-
phoid is uncommon in areas with good sanitary systems, it is still prevalent elsewhere,
and there are many millions of cases each year.

Source and occurrence
Salmonella spp. are widely distributed in the environment, but some species or sero­
vars show host specificity. Notably, S. Typhi and generally S. Paratyphi are restricted to
humans, although livestock can occasionally be a source of S. Paratyphi. A large num-
ber of serovars, including S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis, infect humans and also
a wide range of animals, including poultry, cows, pigs, sheep, birds and even reptiles.
The pathogens typically gain entry into water systems through faecal contamination
from sewage discharges, livestock and wild animals. Contamination has been detected
in a wide variety of foods and milk.

Routes of exposure
Salmonella is spread by the faecal–oral route. Infections with non-typhoidal serovars
are primarily associated with person-to-person contact, the consumption of a variety
of contaminated foods and exposure to animals. Infection by typhoid species is as-
sociated with the consumption of contaminated water or food, with direct person-to-
person spread being uncommon.

Significance in drinking-water
Waterborne typhoid fever outbreaks have devastating public health implications.
However, despite their widespread occurrence, non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. rare-
ly cause drinking-water-borne outbreaks. Transmission, most commonly involving
S. Typhimurium, has been associated with the consumption of contaminated ground-
water and surface water supplies. In an outbreak of illness associated with a communal
rainwater supply, bird faeces were implicated as a source of contamination. Salmonella
spp. are relatively sensitive to disinfection. Within a water safety plan, control meas­
ures that can be applied to manage risk include protection of raw water supplies from
human and animal waste, adequate treatment and protection of water during distri-
bution. Escherichia coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is a generally reli-
able indicator for Salmonella spp. in drinking-water supplies.

Shigella

General description
Shigella spp. are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-like members
of the family Enterobacteriaceae, which grow in the presence or absence of oxygen.
Members of the genus have a complex antigenic pattern, and classification is based on
their somatic O antigens, many of which are shared with other enteric bacilli, includ-
ing E. coli. There are four species: S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei.

Human health effects
Shigella spp. can cause serious intestinal diseases, including bacillary dysentery. Over
2 million infections occur each year, resulting in about 600 000 deaths, predominantly
in developing countries. Most cases of Shigella infection occur in children under 10
years of age. The incubation period for shigellosis is usually 24–72 hours. Ingestion
of as few as 10–100 organisms may lead to infection, which is substantially less than
the infective dose of most other enteric bacteria. Abdominal cramps, fever and watery
diarrhoea occur early in the disease. All species can produce severe disease, but illness
due to S. sonnei is usually relatively mild and self-limiting. In the case of S. dysenteriae,
clinical manifestations may proceed to an ulceration process, with bloody diarrhoea
and high concentrations of neutrophils in the stool. The production of Shiga toxin by
the pathogen plays an important role in this outcome. Shigella spp. seem to be better
adapted to cause human disease than most other enteric bacterial pathogens.

Source and occurrence
Humans and other higher primates appear to be the only natural hosts for the shi-
gellae. The bacteria remain localized in the intestinal epithelial cells of their hosts.
Epidemics of shigellosis occur in crowded communities and where hygiene is poor.
Many cases of shigellosis are associated with day-care centres, prisons and psychiatric
institutions. Military field groups and travellers to areas with poor sanitation are also
prone to infection.

Routes of exposure
Shigella spp. are enteric pathogens predominantly transmitted by the faecal–oral route
through person-to-person contact, contaminated food and water. Flies have also been
identified as a transmission vector from contaminated faecal waste.

Significance in drinking-water
A number of large waterborne outbreaks of shigellosis have been recorded. As the or-
ganisms are not particularly stable in water environments, their presence in drinking-
water indicates recent human faecal pollution. Available data on prevalence in water
supplies may be an underestimate, because detection techniques generally used can
have a relatively low sensitivity and reliability. The control of Shigella spp. in drinking-
water supplies is of special public health importance in view of the severity of the dis-
ease caused. Shigella spp. are relatively sensitive to disinfection. Within a water safety
plan, control measures that can be applied to manage potential risk include protection
of raw water supplies from human waste, adequate treatment and protection of water

during distribution. Escherichia coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is a

Staphylococcus aureus
General description
Staphylococcus aureus is an aerobic or anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming,
catalase- and coagulase-positive, Gram-positive coccus, usually arranged in grapelike
irregular clusters. The genus Staphylococcus contains at least 15 different species. Apart
from S. aureus, the species S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus are also associated with
disease in humans.
Human health effects
Although Staphylococcus aureus is a common member of the human microflora, it
can produce disease through two different mechanisms. One is based on the ability
of the organisms to multiply and spread widely in tissues, and the other is based on
the ability of the organisms to produce extracellular enzymes and toxins. Infections
based on the multiplication of the organisms are a significant problem in hospitals
and other health-care facilities. Multiplication in tissues can result in manifestations
such as boils, skin sepsis, post-operative wound infections, enteric infections, septi-
caemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis and pneumonia. The onset of clinical symptoms
for these infections is relatively long, usually several days. Gastrointestinal disease
(enterocolitis or food poisoning) is caused by a heat-stable staphylococcal enterotoxin
and characterized by projectile vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, abdominal cramps, electro-
lyte imbalance and loss of fluids. Onset of disease in this case has a characteristic short
incubation period of 1–8 hours. The same applies to the toxic shock syndrome caused
by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
Source and occurrence
Staphylococcus aureus is relatively widespread in the environment but is found mainly
on the skin and mucous membranes of animals. The organism is a member of the
normal microbial flora of the human skin and is found in the nasopharynx of 20–30%
of adults at any one time. Staphylococci are occasionally detected in the gastrointes-
tinal tract and can be detected in sewage. Staphylococcus aureus can be released by
human contact into water environments such as swimming pools, spa pools and other
recreational waters. It has also been detected in drinking-water supplies.
Routes of exposure
Hand contact is by far the most common route of transmission. Inadequate hygiene
can lead to contamination of food. Foods such as ham, poultry and potato and
egg salads kept at room or higher temperature offer an ideal environment for the


                                            253
                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


multiplication of S. aureus and the release of toxins. The consumption of foods con-
taining S. aureus toxins can lead to enterotoxin food poisoning within a few hours.
Significance in drinking-water
Although S. aureus can occur in drinking-water supplies, there is no evidence of trans-
mission through the consumption of such water. Although staphylococci are slightly
more resistant to chlorine residuals than E. coli, their presence in water is readily
controlled by conventional treatment and disinfection processes. As faecal material
is not their usual source, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not a
suitable indicator for S. aureus in drinking-water supplies.

Tsukamurella
General description
The genus Tsukamurella belongs to the family Nocardiaceae. Tsukamurella spp. are
Gram-positive, weakly or variably acid-fast, non-motile, obligate aerobic, irregular
rod-shaped bacteria. They are actinomycetes related to Rhodococcus, Nocardia and
Mycobacterium. The genus was created in 1988 to accommodate a group of chemically
unique organisms characterized by a series of very long chain (68–76 carbons), highly
unsaturated mycolic acids, meso-diaminopimelic acid and arabinogalactan, common
to the genus Corynebacterium. The type species is T. paurometabola, and the follow-
ing additional species were proposed in the 1990s: T. wratislaviensis, T. inchonensis,
T. pulmonis, T. tyrosinosolvens and T. strandjordae.
Human health effects
Tsukamurella spp. cause disease mainly in immunocompromised individuals. Infec-
tions with these microorganisms have been associated with chronic lung diseases,
immune suppression (leukaemia, tumours, HIV/AIDS infection) and post-operative
wound infections. Tsukamurella were reported in four cases of catheter-related bac-
teraemia and in individual cases including chronic lung infection, necrotizing teno-
synovitis with subcutaneous abscesses, cutaneous and bone infections, meningitis and
peritonitis.
Source and occurrence
Tsukamurella spp. exist primarily as environmental saprophytes in soil, water and
foam (thick stable scum on aeration vessels and sedimentation tanks) of activated
sludge. Tsukamurella are represented in HPC populations in drinking-water.
Routes of exposure
Tsukamurella spp. appear to be transmitted through devices such as catheters or
lesions. The original source of the contaminating organisms is unknown.

Significance in drinking-water
Tsukamurella organisms have been detected in drinking-water supplies, but the signifi-
cance is unclear. There is no evidence of a link between organisms in water and illness.
As Tsukamurella is an environmental organism, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotoler-
ant coliforms) is not a suitable indicator for this organism.

Vibrio

General description
Vibrio spp. are small, curved (comma-shaped), Gram-negative bacteria with a single
polar flagellum. Species are typed according to their O antigens. There are a number of
pathogenic species, including V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus. Vibrio
cholerae is the only pathogenic species of significance from freshwater environments.
Although a number of serotypes can cause diarrhoea, only O1 and O139 currently
cause the classical cholera symptoms in which a proportion of cases suffer fulminating
and severe watery diarrhoea. The O1 serovar has been further divided into “classical”
and “El Tor” biotypes. The latter is distinguished by features such as the ability to pro-
duce a dialysable heat-labile haemolysin, active against sheep and goat red blood cells.
The classical biotype is considered responsible for the first six cholera pandemics,
whereas the El Tor biotype is responsible for the seventh pandemic that commenced
in 1961. Strains of V. cholerae O1 and O139 that cause cholera produce an enterotoxin
(cholera toxin) that alters the ionic fluxes across the intestinal mucosa, resulting in
substantial loss of water and electrolytes in liquid stools. Other factors associated with
infection are an adhesion factor and an attachment pilus. Not all strains of serotypes
O1 or O139 possess the virulence factors, and they are rarely possessed by non-O1/
O139 strains.

Human health effects
Cholera outbreaks continue to occur in many areas of the developing world. Symptoms
are caused by heat-labile cholera enterotoxin carried by toxigenic strains of V. cholerae
O1/O139. A large percentage of infected persons do not develop illness; about 60%
of the classical and 75% of the El Tor group infections are asymptomatic. Symptom-
atic illness ranges from mild or moderate to severe disease. The initial symptoms of
cholera are an increase in peristalses followed by loose, watery and mucus-flecked
“rice-water” stools that may cause a patient to lose as much as 10–15 litres of liquid
per day. Decreasing gastric acidity by administration of sodium bicarbonate reduces
the infective dose of V. cholerae O1 from more than 108 to about 104 organisms. Case


                                               255
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


fatality rates vary according to facilities and preparedness. As many as 60% of un-
treated patients may die as a result of severe dehydration and loss of electrolytes, but
well-established diarrhoeal disease control programmes can reduce fatalities to less
than 1%. Non-toxigenic strains of V. cholerae can cause self-limiting gastroenteritis,
wound infections and bacteraemia.

Source and occurrence
Non-toxigenic V. cholerae is widely distributed in water environments, but toxigenic
strains are not distributed as widely. Humans are an established source of toxigenic
V. cholerae; in the presence of disease, the organism can be detected in sewage. Although
V. cholerae O1 can be isolated from water in areas without disease, the strains are not
generally toxigenic. Toxigenic V. cholerae has also been found in association with live
copepods as well as other aquatic organisms, including molluscs, crustaceans, plants,
algae and cyanobacteria. Numbers associated with these aquatic organisms are often
higher than in the water. Non-toxigenic V. cholerae has been isolated from birds and
herbivores in areas far away from marine and coastal waters. The prevalence of V. chol-
erae decreases as water temperatures fall below 20 °C.

Routes of exposure
Cholera is typically transmitted by the faecal–oral route, and the infection is pre-
dominantly contracted by the ingestion of faecally contaminated water and food. The
high numbers required to cause infection make person-to-person contact an unlikely
route of transmission.

Significance in drinking-water
Contamination of water due to poor sanitation is largely responsible for transmis-
sion, but this does not fully explain the seasonality of recurrence, and factors other
than poor sanitation must play a role. The presence of the pathogenic V. cholerae O1
and O139 serotypes in drinking-water supplies is of major public health importance
and can have serious health and economic implications in the affected communities.
Vibrio cholerae is highly sensitive to disinfection processes. Within a water safety plan,
control measures that can be applied to manage potential risk from toxigenic V. chol-
erae include protection of raw water supplies from human waste, adequate treatment
and protection of water during distribution. Vibrio cholerae O1 and non-O1 have been
detected in the absence of E. coli, and this organism (or, alternatively, thermotolerant
coliforms) is not a reliable indicator for V. cholerae in drinking-water.

Yersinia

General description
The genus Yersinia is classified in the family Enterobacteriaceae and comprises
seven species. The species Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis and certain serotypes of
Y. enterocolitica are pathogens for humans. Yersinia pestis is the cause of bubonic
plague through contact with rodents and their fleas. Yersinia spp. are Gram-negative
rods that are motile at 25 °C but not at 37 °C.

Human health effects
Yersinia enterocolitica penetrates cells of the intestinal mucosa, causing ulcerations of
the terminal ilium. Yersiniosis generally presents as an acute gastroenteritis with diar-
rhoea, fever and abdominal pain. Other clinical manifestations include greatly en-
larged painful lymph nodes referred to as “buboes”. The disease seems to be more
acute in children than in adults.

Source and occurrence
Domestic and wild animals are the principal reservoir for Yersinia spp.; pigs are the
major reservoir of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, whereas rodents and small animals are
the major reservoir of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Pathogenic Y. enterocolitica has been de-
tected in sewage and polluted surface waters. However, Y. enterocolitica strains detected
in drinking-water are more commonly non-pathogenic strains of probable environ-
mental origin. At least some species and strains of Yersinia seem to be able to replicate
in water environments if at least trace amounts of organic nitrogen are present, even at
temperatures as low as 4 °C.

Routes of exposure
Yersinia spp. are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, with the major source of in-
fection considered to be foods, particularly meat and meat products, milk and dairy
products. Ingestion of contaminated water is also a potential source of infection. Dir­
ect transmission from person to person and from animals to humans is also known
to occur.

Significance in drinking-water
Although most Yersinia spp. detected in water are probably non-pathogenic, cir-
cumstantial evidence has been presented to support transmission of Y. enterocolitica
and Y. pseudotuberculosis to humans from untreated drinking-water. The most likely
source of pathogenic Yersinia spp. is human or animal waste. The organisms are sensi-
tive to disinfection processes. Within a water safety plan, control measures that can be
used to minimize the presence of pathogenic Yersinia spp. in drinking-water supplies
include protection of raw water supplies from human and animal waste, adequate dis-
infection and protection of water during distribution. Owing to the long survival and/
or growth of some strains of Yersinia spp. in water, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotol-
erant coliforms) is not a suitable indicator for the presence/absence of these organisms
in drinking-water.

11.2 Viral pathogens
Viruses associated with waterborne transmission are predominantly those that can
infect the gastrointestinal tract and are excreted in the faeces of infected humans (en-
teric viruses). With the exception of hepatitis E virus, humans are considered to be the
only source of human infectious species. Enteric viruses typically cause acute disease
with a short incubation period. Water may also play a role in the transmission of
other viruses with different modes of action. As a group, viruses can cause a wide
variety of infections and symptoms involving different routes of transmission, routes
and sites of infection and routes of excretion. The combination of these routes and
sites of infection can vary and will not always follow expected patterns. For example,
viruses that are considered to primarily cause respiratory infections and symptoms
are usually transmitted by person-to-person spread of respiratory droplets. However,
some of these respiratory viruses may be discharged in faeces, leading to potential
contamination of water and subsequent transmission through aerosols and droplets.
Another example is viruses excreted in urine, such as polyomaviruses, which could
contaminate and then be potentially transmitted by water, with possible long-term
health effects, such as cancer, that are not readily associated epidemiologically with
waterborne transmission.

Adenoviruses

General description
The family Adenoviridae is classified into the two genera Mastadenovirus (mammal
hosts) and Aviadenovirus (avian hosts). Adenoviruses are widespread in nature,
infecting birds, mammals and amphibians. To date, 51 antigenic types of human
adenoviruses have been described. Human adenoviruses have been classified into
six groups (A–F) on the basis of their physical, chemical and biological properties.
Adenoviruses consist of a double-stranded DNA genome in a non-enveloped icosa-
hedral capsid with a diameter of about 80 nm and unique fibres. The subgroups
A–E grow readily in cell culture, but serotypes 40 and 41 are fastidious and do not
grow well. Identification of serotypes 40 and 41 in environmental samples is gener-
ally based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques with or without initial cell
culture amplification.

                                               258
                                11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Human health effects
Human adenoviruses cause a wide range of infections with a spectrum of clinical
manifestations. These include infections of the gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis),
the respiratory tract (acute respiratory diseases, pneumonia, pharyngoconjunctival
fever), the urinary tract (cervicitis, urethritis, haemorrhagic cystitis) and the eyes
(epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, also known as “shipyard eye”; pharyngoconjunctival
fever, also known as “swimming pool conjunctivitis”). Different serotypes are associ-
ated with specific illnesses; for example, types 40 and 41 are the main causes of enteric
illness. Adenoviruses are an important source of childhood gastroenteritis. In general,
infants and children are most susceptible to adenovirus infections, and many infec-
tions are asymptomatic. High attack rates in outbreaks imply that infecting doses are
low.
Source and occurrence
Adenoviruses are excreted in large numbers in human faeces and are known to occur
in sewage, raw water sources and treated drinking-water supplies worldwide. Although
the subgroup of enteric adenoviruses (mainly types 40 and 41) is a major cause of
gastroenteritis worldwide, notably in developing communities, little is known about
the prevalence of these enteric adenoviruses in water sources. The limited availability
of information on enteric adenoviruses is largely due to the fact that they are not de-
tectable by conventional cell culture isolation.
Routes of exposure
Owing to the diverse epidemiology of the wide spectrum of human adenoviruses,
exposure and infection are possible by a variety of routes. Person-to-person contact
plays a major role in the transmission of illness; depending on the nature of the ill-
ness, this can include faecal–oral, oral–oral and hand–eye contact transmission, as
well as indirect transfer through contaminated surfaces or shared utensils. There have
been numerous outbreaks associated with hospitals, military establishments, child-
care centres and schools. Symptoms recorded in most outbreaks were acute respira-
tory disease, keratoconjunctivitis and conjunctivitis. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis have
also been reported. The consumption of contaminated food or water may be an im-
portant source of enteric illness, although there is no substantial evidence supporting
this route of transmission. Eye infections may be contracted by the exposure of eyes
to contaminated water, the sharing of towels at swimming pools or the sharing of
goggles, as in the case of “shipyard eye”. Confirmed outbreaks of adenovirus infections
associated with water have been limited to pharyngitis or conjunctivitis, with expos­
ure arising from use of swimming pools.
Significance in drinking-water
Human adenoviruses have been shown to occur in substantial numbers in raw water
sources and treated drinking-water supplies. In one study, the incidence of human
adenoviruses in such waters was exceeded only by the group of enteroviruses among
viruses detectable by PCR-based techniques. In view of their prevalence as an enteric
pathogen and detection in water, contaminated drinking-water represents a likely but
unconfirmed source of human adenovirus infections. Human adenoviruses are also

                                          259
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


considered important because they are exceptionally resistant to some water treat-
ment and disinfection processes, notably ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. Human
adenoviruses have been detected in drinking-water supplies that met accepted speci-
fications for treatment, disinfection and conventional indicator organisms. Within a
water safety plan, control measures to reduce potential risk from human adenoviruses
should focus on prevention of source water contamination by human waste, followed
by adequate treatment and disinfection. The effectiveness of treatment processes
used to remove human adenoviruses will require validation. Drinking-water supplies
should also be protected from contamination during distribution. Because of the high
resistance of the viruses to disinfection, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coli-
forms) is not a reliable indicator of the presence/absence of human adenoviruses in
drinking-water supplies.

Astroviruses
General description
Human and animal strains of astroviruses are single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA)
viruses classified in the family Astroviridae. Astroviruses consist of a single-stranded
RNA genome in a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid with a diameter of about 28 nm.
In a proportion of the particles, a distinct surface star-shaped structure can be seen
by electron microscopy. Eight different serotypes of human astroviruses have been
described. The most commonly identified is human astrovirus serotype 1. Human
astroviruses can be detected in environmental samples using PCR techniques with or
without initial cell culture amplification.

Human health effects
Human astroviruses cause gastroenteritis, predominantly diarrhoea, mainly in chil-
dren under 5 years of age, although it has also been reported in adults. Seroprevalence
studies showed that more than 80% of children between 5 and 10 years of age have
antibodies against human astroviruses. Occasional outbreaks in schools, nurseries and
families have been reported. The illness is self-limiting, is of short duration and has a
peak incidence in the winter. Human astroviruses are the cause of only a small propor-
tion of reported gastroenteritis infections. However, the number of infections may be
underestimated, as the illness is usually mild, and many cases will go unreported.

Source and occurrence
Infected individuals generally excrete large numbers of human astroviruses in faeces;
hence, the viruses will be present in sewage. Human astroviruses have been detected
in water sources and in drinking-water supplies.

Routes of exposure
Human astroviruses are transmitted by the faecal–oral route. Person-to-person spread
is considered the most common route of transmission, and clusters of cases are seen
in child-care centres, paediatric wards, families, homes for the elderly and military
establishments. Ingestion of contaminated food or water could also be important.

Significance in drinking-water
The presence of human astroviruses in treated drinking-water supplies has been con-
firmed. As the viruses are typically transmitted by the faecal–oral route, transmis-
sion by drinking-water seems likely, but has not been confirmed. Human astroviruses
have been detected in drinking-water supplies that met accepted specifications for
treatment, disinfection and conventional indicator organisms. Within a water safety
plan, control measures to reduce potential risk from human astroviruses should focus
on prevention of source water contamination by human waste, followed by adequate
treatment and disinfection. The effectiveness of treatment processes used to remove
human astroviruses will require validation. Drinking-water supplies should also be
protected from contamination during distribution. Owing to the higher resistance of
the viruses to disinfection, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not
a reliable indicator of the presence/absence of human astroviruses in drinking-water
supplies.

Caliciviruses
General description
The family Caliciviridae consists of four genera of single-stranded RNA viruses with
a non-enveloped capsid (diameter 35–40 nm), which generally displays a typical sur-
face morphology resembling cup-like structures. Human caliciviruses include the
genera Norovirus (Norwalk-like viruses) and Sapovirus (Sapporo-like viruses). Sapo-
virus spp. demonstrate the typical calicivirus morphology and are called classical
caliciviruses. Noroviruses generally fail to reveal the typical morphology and were in
the past referred to as small round-structured viruses. The remaining two genera of
the family contain viruses that infect animals other than humans. Human caliciviruses
cannot be propagated in available cell culture systems. The viruses were originally

                                            261
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


discovered by electron microscopy. Some Norovirus spp. can be detected by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay using antibodies raised against baculovirus-expressed
Norovirus capsid proteins. Several reverse transcriptase PCR procedures have been
described for the detection of human caliciviruses.

Human health effects
Human caliciviruses are a major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in all age groups.
Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. Usually about 40% of
infected individuals present with diarrhoea; some have fever, chills, headache and mus-
cular pain. As some cases present with vomiting only and no diarrhoea, the condition
is also known as “winter vomiting disease”. Infections by human caliciviruses induce a
short-lived immunity. The symptoms are usually relatively mild and rarely last for more
than 3 days. High attack rates in outbreaks indicate that the infecting dose is low.

Source and occurrence
Human caliciviruses are excreted in faeces of infected individuals and will therefore
be present in domestic wastewaters as well as faecally contaminated food and water,
including drinking-water supplies.

Routes of exposure
The epidemiology of the disease indicates that person-to-person contact and the in-
halation of contaminated aerosols and dust particles, as well as airborne particles of
vomitus, are the most common routes of transmission. Drinking-water and a wide
variety of foods contaminated with human faeces have been confirmed as major
sources of exposure. Numerous outbreaks have been associated with contaminated
drinking-water, ice, water on cruise ships and recreational waters. Shellfish harvested
from sewage-contaminated waters have also been identified as a source of outbreaks.

Significance in drinking-water
Many human calicivirus outbreaks have been epidemiologically linked to contamin­
ated drinking-water supplies. Within a water safety plan, control measures to reduce
potential risk from human caliciviruses should focus on prevention of source water
contamination by human waste, followed by adequate treatment and disinfection. The
effectiveness of treatment processes used to remove human caliciviruses will require
validation. Drinking-water supplies should also be protected from contamination dur-
ing distribution. Owing to the higher resistance of the viruses to disinfection, E. coli
(or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not a reliable indicator of the presence/
absence of human caliciviruses in drinking-water supplies.

Enteroviruses

General description
The genus Enterovirus is a member of the family Picornaviridae. This genus consists of
69 serotypes (species) that infect humans: poliovirus types 1–3, coxsackievirus types
A1–A24, coxsackievirus types B1–B6, echovirus types 1–33 and the numbered entero-
virus types EV68–EV73. Members of the genus are collectively referred to as entero-
viruses. Other species of the genus infect animals other than humans—for instance,
the bovine group of enteroviruses. Enteroviruses are among the smallest known
viruses and consist of a single-stranded RNA genome in a non-enveloped icosahedral
capsid with a diameter of 20–30 nm. Some members of the genus, notably poliovirus,
coxsackievirus B, echovirus and enterovirus, are readily isolated by cytopathogenic
effect in cell cultures.

Human health effects
Enteroviruses are one of the most common causes of human infections. They have
been estimated to cause about 30 million infections in the USA each year. The
spectrum of diseases caused by enteroviruses is broad and ranges from a mild febrile
illness to myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, poliomyelitis, herpangina, hand-foot-
and-mouth disease and neonatal multi-organ failure. The persistence of the viruses in
chronic conditions such as polymyositis, dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic fatigue
syndrome has been described. Most infections, particularly in children, are asymp-
tomatic, but still lead to the excretion of large numbers of the viruses, which may
cause clinical disease in other individuals.

Source and occurrence
Enteroviruses are excreted in the faeces of infected individuals. Among the types of
viruses detectable by conventional cell culture isolation, enteroviruses are generally
the most numerous in sewage, water resources and treated drinking-water supplies.
The viruses are also readily detected in many foods.

Routes of exposure
Person-to-person contact and inhalation of airborne viruses or viruses in respiratory
droplets are considered to be the predominant routes of transmission of enteroviruses
in communities. Transmission from drinking-water could also be important, but this
has not yet been confirmed. Waterborne transmission of enteroviruses (coxsackie­
virus A16 and B5) has been epidemiologically confirmed for only two outbreaks, and
these were associated with children bathing in lake water in the 1970s.

Significance in drinking-water
Enteroviruses have been shown to occur in substantial numbers in raw water sources
and treated drinking-water supplies. In view of their prevalence, drinking-water rep-
resents a likely, although unconfirmed, source of enterovirus infection. The limited

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


knowledge on the role of waterborne transmission could be related to a number of
factors, including the wide range of clinical symptoms, frequent asymptomatic in-
fection, the diversity of serotypes and the dominance of person-to-person spread.
Enteroviruses have been detected in drinking-water supplies that met accepted speci-
fications for treatment, disinfection and conventional indicator organisms. Within a
water safety plan, control measures to reduce potential risk from enteroviruses should
focus on prevention of source water contamination by human waste, followed by
adequate treatment and disinfection. The effectiveness of treatment processes used
to remove enteroviruses will require validation. Drinking-water supplies should also
be protected from contamination during distribution. Owing to the higher resistance
of the viruses to disinfection, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is
not a reliable indicator of the presence/absence of enteroviruses in drinking-water
supplies.

Hepatitis A virus
General description
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the only species of the genus Hepatovirus in the family Pi-
cornaviridae. The virus shares basic structural and morphological features with other
members of the family, as described for enteroviruses. Human and simian HAVs are
genotypically distinguishable. HAV cannot be readily detected or cultivated in con-
ventional cell culture systems, and identification in environmental samples is based
on the use of PCR techniques.

Human health effects
HAV is highly infectious, and the infecting dose is considered to be low. The virus
causes the disease hepatitis A, commonly known as “infectious hepatitis”. Like other
members of the group enteric viruses, HAV enters the gastrointestinal tract by inges-
tion, where it infects epithelial cells. From here, the virus enters the bloodstream and
reaches the liver, where it may cause severe damage to liver cells. In as many as 90%
of cases, particularly in children, there is little, if any, liver damage, and the infec-
tion passes without clinical symptoms and elicits lifelong immunity. In general, the
severity of illness increases with age. The damage to liver cells results in the release of
liver-specific enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, which are detectable in the
bloodstream and used as a diagnostic tool. The damage also results in the failure of the
liver to remove bilirubin from the bloodstream; the accumulation of bilirubin causes
the typical symptoms of jaundice and dark urine. After a relatively long incubation
period of 28–30 days on average, there is a characteristic sudden onset of illness, in-
cluding symptoms such as fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort and
eventually jaundice. Although mortality is generally less than 1%, repair of the liver


                                            264
                                 11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


damage is a slow process that may keep patients incapacitated for 6 weeks or longer.
This has substantial burden of disease implications. Mortality is higher in those over
50 years of age.
Source and occurrence
HAV occurs worldwide, but the prevalence of clinical disease has typical geographic­
ally based characteristics. HAV is excreted in faecal material of infected people, and
there is strong epidemiological evidence that faecally contaminated food and water
are common sources of the virus. In areas with poor sanitation, children are often
infected at a very early age and become immune for life without clinical symptoms of
disease. In areas with good sanitation, infection tends to occur later in life.

Routes of exposure
Person-to-person spread is probably the most common route of transmission, but
contaminated food and water are important sources of infection. There is stronger
epidemiological evidence for waterborne transmission of HAV than for any other
virus. Foodborne outbreaks are also relatively common, with sources of infection
including infected food handlers, shellfish harvested from contaminated water and
contaminated produce. Travel of people from areas with good sanitation to those with
poor sanitation provides a high risk of infection. Infection can also be spread in as-
sociation with injecting and non-injecting drug use.
Significance in drinking-water
The transmission of HAV by drinking-water supplies is well established, and the pres-
ence of HAV in drinking-water constitutes a substantial health risk. Within a water
safety plan, control measures to reduce potential risk from HAV should focus on pre-
vention of source water contamination by human waste, followed by adequate treat-
ment and disinfection. The effectiveness of treatment processes used to remove HAV
will require validation. Drinking-water supplies should also be protected from con-
tamination during distribution. Owing to the higher resistance of the viruses to dis-
infection, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not a reliable indicator
of the presence/absence of HAV in drinking-water supplies.

Hepatitis E virus
General description
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) consists of a single-stranded RNA genome in a non-enveloped
icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 27–34 nm. HEV shares properties with a num-
ber of viruses, and classification is a challenge. At one stage, HEV was classified as a
member of the family Caliciviridae, but most recently it has been placed in a separ­
ate family called hepatitis E–like viruses. There are indications of antigenic variation,

                                            265
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


and possibly even differences in serotypes of the virus, whereas human HAV consists
of only one clearly defined serotype. HEV cannot be readily detected or cultivated
in conventional cell culture systems, and identification in environmental samples is
based on the use of PCR techniques.

Human health effects
HEV causes hepatitis that is in many respects similar to that caused by HAV. However,
the incubation period tends to be longer (average 40 days), and infections typically
have a mortality rate of up to 25% in pregnant women. In endemic regions, first infec-
tions are typically seen in young adults rather than young children. Despite evidence
of antigenic variation, single infection appears to provide lifelong immunity to HEV.
Global prevalence has a characteristic geographic distribution. HEV is endemic and
causes clinical diseases in certain developing parts of the world, such as India, Nepal,
central Asia, Mexico and parts of Africa. In many of these areas, HEV is the most
important cause of viral hepatitis. Although seroprevalence can be high, clinical cases
and outbreaks are rare in certain parts of the world, such as Japan, South Africa, the
United Kingdom, North and South America, Australasia and central Europe. The rea-
son for the lack of clinical cases in the presence of the virus is unknown.

Source and occurrence
HEV is excreted in faeces of infected people, and the virus has been detected in raw
and treated sewage. Contaminated water has been associated with very large out-
breaks. HEV is distinctive, in that it is the only enteric virus with a meaningful animal
reservoir, including domestic animals, particularly pigs, as well as cattle, goats and
even rodents.

Routes of exposure
Secondary transmission of HEV from cases to contacts and particularly nursing staff
has been reported, but appears to be much less common than for HAV. The lower level
of person-to-person spread suggests that faecally polluted water could play a much
more important role in the spread of HEV than of HAV. Waterborne outbreaks involv-
ing thousands of cases are on record. These include one outbreak in 1954 with approxi-
mately 40 000 cases in Delhi, India; one with more than 100 000 cases in 1986–1988
in the Xinjiang Uighar region of China; and one in 1991 with some 79 000 cases in
Kanpur, India. Animal reservoirs may also serve as a route of exposure, but the extent
to which humans contract HEV infection from animals remains to be elucidated.

Significance in drinking-water
The role of contaminated water as a source of HEV has been confirmed, and the
presence of the virus in drinking-water constitutes a major health risk. There is no
laboratory information on the resistance of the virus to disinfection processes, but
data on waterborne outbreaks suggest that HEV may be as resistant as other enteric
viruses. Within a water safety plan, control measures to reduce potential risk from
HEV should focus on prevention of source water contamination by human and ani-
mal waste, followed by adequate treatment and disinfection. The effectiveness of treat-
ment processes used to remove HEV will require validation. Drinking-water supplies

                                   11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


should also be protected from contamination during distribution. Owing to the like-
lihood that the virus has a higher resistance to disinfection, E. coli (or, alternatively,
thermotolerant coliforms) is not a reliable indicator of the presence/absence of HEV
in drinking-water supplies.

Rotaviruses and orthoreoviruses

General description
Members of the genus Rotavirus consist of a segmented double-stranded RNA
genome in a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 50–65 nm. This
capsid is surrounded by a double-layered shell, giving the virus the appearance of a
wheel—hence the name rotavirus. The diameter of the entire virus is about 80 nm.
Rotavirus and Orthoreovirus are the two genera of the family Reoviridae typically
associated with human infection. Orthoreoviruses are readily isolated by cytopatho-
genic effect on cell cultures. The genus Rotavirus is serologically divided into seven
groups, A–G, each of which consists of a number of subgroups; some of these sub-
groups specifically infect humans, whereas others infect a wide spectrum of animals.
Groups A–C are found in humans, with group A being the most important human
pathogens. Wild-type strains of rotavirus group A are not readily grown in cell cul-
ture, but there are a number of PCR-based detection methods available for testing
environmental samples.

Human health effects
Human rotaviruses are the most important single cause of infant death in the world.
Typically, 50–60% of cases of acute gastroenteritis of hospitalized children through-
out the world are caused by human rotaviruses. The viruses infect cells in the villi of
the small intestine, with disruption of sodium and glucose transport. Acute infec-
tion has an abrupt onset of severe watery diarrhoea with fever, abdominal pain and
vomiting; dehydration and metabolic acidosis may develop, and the outcome may be
fatal if the infection is not appropriately treated. The burden of disease of rotavirus
infections is extremely high. Members of the genus Orthoreovirus infect many hu-
mans, but they are typical “orphan viruses” and not associated with any meaningful
disease.

Source and occurrence
Human rotaviruses are excreted by patients in numbers up to 1011 per gram of faeces
for periods of about 8 days. This implies that domestic sewage and any environments

                                              267
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


polluted with the human faeces are likely to contain large numbers of human rota-
viruses. The viruses have been detected in sewage, rivers, lakes and treated drinking-
water. Orthoreoviruses generally occur in wastewater in substantial numbers.
Routes of exposure
Human rotaviruses are transmitted by the faecal–oral route. Person-to-person trans-
mission and the inhalation of airborne human rotaviruses or aerosols containing the
viruses would appear to play a much more important role than ingestion of contam­
inated food or water. This is confirmed by the spread of infections in children’s wards
in hospitals, which takes place much faster than can be accounted for by the ingestion
of food or water contaminated by the faeces of infected patients. The role of contam­
inated water in transmission is lower than expected, given the prevalence of human
rotavirus infections and presence in contaminated water. However, occasional water-
borne and foodborne outbreaks have been described. Two large outbreaks in China in
1982–1983 were linked to contaminated water supplies.
Significance in drinking-water
Although ingestion of drinking-water is not the most common route of transmis-
sion, the presence of human rotaviruses in drinking-water constitutes a public health
risk. There is some evidence that the rotaviruses are more resistant to disinfection
than other enteric viruses. Within a water safety plan, control measures to reduce
potential risk from human rotaviruses should focus on prevention of source water
contamination by human waste, followed by adequate treatment and disinfection.
The effectiveness of treatment processes used to remove human rotaviruses will re-
quire validation. Drinking-water supplies should also be protected from contamina-
tion during distribution. Owing to a higher resistance of the viruses to disinfection,
E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) is not a reliable indicator of the
presence/absence of human rotaviruses in drinking-water supplies.

11.3 Protozoan pathogens
Protozoa and helminths are among the most common causes of infection and disease
in humans and animals. The diseases have a major public health and socioeconomic
impact. Water plays an important role in the transmission of some of these pathogens.
The control of waterborne transmission presents real challenges, because most of
the pathogens produce cysts, oocysts or eggs that are extremely resistant to processes

                                             268
                                11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


generally used for the disinfection of water and in some cases can be difficult to remove
by filtration processes. Some of these organisms cause “emerging diseases”. In the last
30 years, the most notable example of an emerging disease caused by a protozoan
pathogen is cryptosporidiosis. Other examples are diseases caused by microsporidia
and Cyclospora. As evidence for waterborne transmission of “emerging diseases” has
been reported relatively recently, some questions about their epidemiology and behav-
iour in water treatment and disinfection processes remain to be elucidated. It would
appear that the role of water in the transmission of this group of pathogens may in-
crease substantially in importance and complexity as human and animal populations
grow and the demands for potable drinking-water escalate.
     Further information on emerging diseases is provided in Emerging issues in water
and infectious disease (WHO, 2003) and associated texts.

Acanthamoeba

General description
Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living amoebae (10–50 µm in diameter) common in aqua­
tic environments and one of the prominent protozoa in soil. The genus contains some
20 species, of which A. castellanii, A. polyphaga and A. culbertsoni are known to be hu-
man pathogens. However, the taxonomy of the genus may change substantially when
evolving molecular biological knowledge is taken into consideration. Acanthamoeba
has a feeding, replicative trophozoite, which, under unfavourable conditions, such as
an anaerobic environment, will develop into a dormant cyst that can withstand ex-
tremes of temperature (−20 to 56 °C), disinfection and desiccation.

Human health effects
Acanthamoeba culbertsoni causes granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, whereas A.
castellanii and A. polyphaga are associated with acanthamoebic keratitis and acanth­
amoebic uveitis.
     Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis is a multifocal, haemorrhagic and nec­
rotizing encephalitis that is generally seen only in debilitated or immunodeficient
persons. It is a rare, but usually fatal, disease. Early symptoms include drowsiness,
personality changes, intense headaches, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, sporadic low
fevers, focal neurological changes, hemiparesis and seizures. This is followed by
an altered mental status, diplopia, paresis, lethargy, cerebellar ataxia and coma.
Death follows within a week to a year after the appearance of the first symptoms,
usually as a result of bronchopneumonia. Associated disorders of granulomatous
amoebic encephalitis include skin ulcers, liver disease, pneumonitis, renal failure
and pharyngitis.
     Acanthamoebic keratitis is a painful infection of the cornea and can occur in
healthy individuals, especially among contact lens wearers. It is a rare disease that may
lead to impaired vision, permanent blindness and loss of the eye. The prevalence of
antibodies to Acanthamoeba and the detection of the organism in the upper airways of
healthy persons suggest that infection may be common with few apparent symptoms
in the vast majority of cases.


                                          269
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Source and occurrence
The wide distribution of Acanthamoeba in the natural environment makes soil,
airborne dust and water all potential sources. Acanthamoeba can be found in many
types of aquatic environments, including surface water, tap water, swimming pools
and contact lens solutions. Depending on the species, Acanthamoeba can grow over
a wide temperature range in water, with the optimum temperature for pathogenic
species being 30 °C. Trophozoites can exist and replicate in water while feeding on
bacteria, yeasts and other organisms.

Routes of exposure
Acanthamoebic keratitis has been associated with contact lenses being washed with
contaminated home-made saline solutions or contamination of the contact lens con-
tainers. Although the source of the contaminating organisms has not been established,
tap water is one possibility. Warnings have been issued by a number of health agencies
that only sterile water should be used to prepare wash solutions for contact lenses.
The mode of transmission of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis has not been estab-
lished, but water is not considered to be a source of infection. The more likely routes
of transmission are via the blood from other sites of colonization, such as skin lesions
or lungs.

Significance in drinking-water
Cases of acanthamoebic keratitis have been associated with drinking-water due to
use of tap water in preparing solutions for washing contact lenses. Cleaning of con-
tact lenses is not considered to be a normal use for tap water, and a higher-quality
water may be required. Compared with Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts,
Acanthamoeba cysts are relatively large and amenable to removal from raw water by
filtration. Reducing the presence of biofilm organisms is likely to reduce food sources
and growth of the organism in distribution systems, but the cyst is highly resistant to
disinfection. However, as normal uses of drinking-water lack significance as a source
of infection, setting a health-based target for Acanthamoeba spp. is not warranted.

Balantidium coli
General description
Balantidium coli is a unicellular protozoan parasite with a length up to 200 µm, mak-
ing it the largest of the human intestinal protozoa. The trophozoites are oval in shape
and covered with cilia for motility. The cysts are 60–70 µm in length and resistant to
unfavourable environmental conditions, such as pH and temperature extremes. Bal-
antidium coli belongs to the largest protozoan group, the ciliates, with about 7200
species, of which only B. coli is known to infect humans.

                                            270
                                  11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Human health effects
Infections in humans are relatively rare, and most are asymptomatic. The trophozoites
invade the mucosa and submucosa of the large intestine and destroy the host cells
when multiplying. The multiplying parasites form nests and small abscesses that break
down into oval, irregular ulcers. Clinical symptoms may include dysentery similar to
amoebiasis, colitis, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, headache and anorexia. The infec-
tions are generally self-limiting, with complete recovery.
Source and occurrence
Humans seem to be the most important host of B. coli, and the organism can be de-
tected in domestic sewage. Animal reservoirs, particularly swine, also contribute to
the prevalence of the cysts in the environment. The cysts have been detected in water
sources, but the prevalence in tap water is unknown.
Routes of exposure
Transmission of B. coli is by the faecal–oral route, from person to person, from contact
with infected swine or by consumption of contaminated water or food. One water-
borne outbreak of balantidiasis has been reported. This outbreak occurred in 1971
when a drinking-water supply was contaminated with stormwater runoff containing
swine faeces after a typhoon.
Significance in drinking-water
Although water does not appear to play an important role in the spread of this or-
ganism, one waterborne outbreak is on record. Balantidium coli is large and amen­
able to removal by filtration, but cysts are highly resistant to disinfection. Within a
water safety plan, control measures to reduce potential risk from B. coli should focus
on prevention of source water contamination by human and swine waste, followed
by adequate treatment. Owing to resistance to disinfection, E. coli (or, alternatively,
thermotolerant coliforms) is not a reliable indicator for the presence/absence of B. coli
in drinking-water supplies.

Blastocystis
General description
Blastocystis is a common anaerobic intestinal parasite that was first described in the
early 1900s. Despite this long history, there are large gaps in knowledge about the
organism, and the issue of pathogenicity remains a subject of some debate. Blasto-
cystis spp. have been detected in a range of animal hosts, with isolates from humans
identified as Blastocystis hominis. However, molecular studies suggest that there is con-
siderable antigenic and genetic heterogeneity within B. hominis and Blastocystis spp.
Blastocystis hominis lives in the colon and has several morphological forms, including
a faecal cyst that is believed to be the infective form.


                                            271
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Human health effects
Blastocystis hominis is probably the most common protozoan detected in hu-
man faecal samples worldwide. Infection occurs in both immunocompetent and
immunocompromised individuals. Reported prevalence ranges from 2% to 50%, with
the highest rates reported for developing countries with poor environmental hygiene.
Infection appears to be more common in adults than in children. However, one study
showed that peak infection occurs at 10 years of age and then later in life. Pathogenicity
of B. hominis is controversial because of the nonspecific symptoms and prevalence of
asymptomatic infections. Some case–control studies of individuals with and without
symptoms show no difference in the prevalence of B. hominis. Symptoms attributed
to B. hominis include watery or loose stools, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anal itching,
weight loss and excess gas. Duration of infection is not well known; some infections
can last for weeks, months or years. In some patients, the symptoms resolve, even
though Blastocystis can still be detected in stools. It has been suggested that B. hominis
may be a commensal organism that becomes pathogenic when the host is immuno-
suppressed, is malnourished or has other infections.

Source and occurrence
The source of human infectious Blastocystis is uncertain. Blastocystis occurs in many
animals, including insects, reptiles, birds and mammals. Some evidence suggests that
Blastocystis may not be host specific and that animal-to-human transmission is possible.
A recent survey in Malaysia showed that animal handlers and abattoir workers were at
greater risk of infection than a control group of high-rise city dwellers. Blastocystis is
excreted as a cyst, which could be environmentally persistent, but there are no data on
its survival in the environment. Blastocystis has been identified in sewage samples.

Routes of exposure
The routes of transmission have not been established, but the faecal–oral route is con-
sidered to be the main mode of transmission. Studies of transmission between mice
indicate infection after oral inoculation of faecal cysts. Water and foodborne trans-
mission have been suggested, but not confirmed.

Significance in drinking-water
The role of drinking-water as a source of Blastocystis infections has not been estab-
lished. However, an investigation in Thailand provided evidence of waterborne trans-
mission, and identification in sewage samples suggests potential for this to occur.
Within a water safety plan, control measures focused on prevention of source water
contamination by human and animal waste should reduce potential risks. There is
little information on the removal and/or inactivation of Blastocystis by water and
wastewater treatment processes. The morphology of Blastocystis varies over a broad
range, and size estimates vary. Faecal cysts can be as small as 3–10 µm in diameter,
and these are likely to be removed by conventional granular media-based filtration
methods in a similar manner to Cryptosporidium oocysts that are 4–6 µm in diam-

Cryptosporidium

General description
Cryptosporidium is an obligate, intracellular, coccidian parasite with a complex life
cycle including sexual and asexual replication. Thick-walled oocysts with a diameter
of 4–6 µm are shed in faeces. The genus Cryptosporidium has about 13 species, with
human infections predominantly caused by C. hominis and the cattle genotype of
C. parvum. Other Cryptosporidium species have been reported to cause infrequent
infections. Cryptosporidium was discovered to infect humans in 1976, and waterborne
transmission was confirmed for the first time in 1984.

Human health effects
Cryptosporidium generally causes self-limiting diarrhoea, sometimes including nausea,
vomiting and fever, which usually resolves within a week in normally healthy people,
but can last for a month or more. Severity of cryptosporidiosis varies according to age
and immune status, and infections in severely immunocompromised people can be
life-threatening. The impact of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks is relatively high due to
the large numbers of people that may be involved and the associated socioeconomic
implications. The total cost of illness associated with the 1993 outbreak in Milwaukee,
USA, has been estimated at US$ 96.2 million.

Source and occurrence
A large range of animals are reservoirs of C. hominis/parvum, but humans and live-
stock, particularly young animals, are the most significant source of human infec-
tious organisms. Calves can excrete 1010 oocysts per day. Concentrations of oocysts as
high as 14 000 per litre for raw sewage and 5800 per litre for surface water have been
reported. Oocysts can survive for weeks to months in fresh water. Cryptosporidium
oocysts have been detected in many drinking-water supplies. However, in most cases,
there is little information about whether human infectious species were present. The
currently available standard analytical techniques provide an indirect measure of
viability and no indication of human infectivity. Oocysts also occur in recreational
waters.

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Routes of exposure
Cryptosporidium is transmitted by the faecal–oral route. The major route of infec-
tion is person-to-person contact. Other sources of infection include the consump-
tion of contaminated food and water and direct contact with infected farm animals
and possibly domestic pets. Contaminated drinking-water, recreational water and, to
a lesser extent, food have been associated with outbreaks. In 1993, Cryptosporidium
caused the largest waterborne outbreak of disease on record, when more than 400 000
people were infected by the drinking-water supply of Milwaukee, USA. The infectivity
of Cryptosporidium oocysts is relatively high. Studies on healthy human volunteers
revealed that ingestion of fewer than 10 oocysts can lead to infection.
Significance in drinking-water
The role of drinking-water in the transmission of Cryptosporidium, including in large
outbreaks, is well established. Attention to these organisms is therefore important.
The oocysts are extremely resistant to oxidizing disinfectants such as chlorine, but
investigations based on assays for infectivity have shown that UV light irradiation
inactivates oocysts. Within a water safety plan, control measures to reduce potential
risk from Cryptosporidium should focus on prevention of source water contamination
by human and livestock waste, adequate treatment and protection of water during
distribution. Because of their relatively small size, the oocysts represent a challenge
for removal by conventional granular media–based filtration processes. Acceptable
removal requires well-designed and well-operated systems. Membrane filtration pro-
cesses that provide a direct physical barrier may represent a viable alternative for the
effective removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Owing to the exceptional resistance of
the oocysts to disinfectants, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) cannot
be relied upon as an indicator for the presence/absence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in
drinking-water supplies.

Cyclospora cayetanensis
General description
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a single-celled, obligate, intracellular, coccidian protozoan
parasite, which belongs to the family Eimeriidae. It produces thick-walled oocysts of

                                           274
                                 11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


8–10 µm in diameter that are excreted in the faeces of infected individuals. Cyclospora
cayetanensis is considered an emerging waterborne pathogen.

Human health effects
Sporozoites are released from the oocysts when ingested and penetrate epithelial cells
in the small intestine of susceptible individuals. Clinical symptoms of cyclosporiasis
include watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, weight loss, anorexia, myalgia and
occasionally vomiting and/or fever. Relapsing illness often occurs.

Source and occurrence
Humans are the only host identified for this parasite. The unsporulated oocysts pass
into the external environment with faeces and undergo sporulation, which is complete
in 7–12 days, depending on environmental conditions. Only the sporulated oocysts
are infectious. Owing to the lack of a quantification technique, there is limited infor-
mation on the prevalence of Cyclospora in water environments. However, Cyclospora
has been detected in sewage and water sources.

Routes of exposure
Cyclospora cayetanensis is transmitted by the faecal–oral route. Person-to-person
transmission is virtually impossible, because the oocysts must sporulate outside the
host to become infectious. The primary routes of exposure are contaminated water
and food. The initial source of organisms in foodborne outbreaks has generally not
been established, but consumption of food crops irrigated with contaminated water
has been implicated in several cases. Drinking-water has also been implicated as a
cause of outbreaks. The first report was among staff of a hospital in Chicago, USA, in
1990. The infections were associated with drinking tap water that had possibly been
contaminated with stagnant water from a rooftop storage reservoir. Another outbreak
was reported from Nepal, where drinking-water consisting of a mixture of river and
municipal water was associated with infections in 12 of 14 soldiers.

Significance in drinking-water
Transmission of the pathogens by drinking-water has been confirmed. The oocysts
are resistant to disinfection and are not inactivated by chlorination practices gener-
ally applied in the production of drinking-water. Within a water safety plan, con-
trol measures that can be applied to manage potential risk from Cyclospora include
prevention of source water contamination by human waste, followed by adequate
treatment and protection of water during distribution. Owing to the resistance of
the cysts to disinfectants, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) cannot
be relied upon as an indicator of the presence/absence of Cyclospora in drinking-
water supplies.

Entamoeba histolytica
General description
Entamoeba histolytica is the most prevalent intestinal protozoan pathogen worldwide
and belongs to the superclass Rhizopoda in the subphylum Sarcodina. Entamoeba has
a feeding, replicative trophozoite (diameter 10–60 µm), which, under unfavourable
conditions, will develop into a dormant cyst (diameter 10–20 µm). Infection is con-
tracted by the ingestion of cysts. Recent studies with RNA and DNA probes demon-
strated genetic differences between pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. histolytica; the
latter has been separated and reclassified as E. dispar.

Human health effects
About 85–95% of human infections with E. histolytica are asymptomatic. Acute in-
testinal amoebiasis has an incubation period of 1–14 weeks. Clinical disease results
from the penetration of the epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract by the amoebic
trophozoites. Approximately 10% of infected individuals present with dysentery or
colitis. Symptoms of amoebic dysentery include diarrhoea with cramping, lower ab-
dominal pain, low-grade fever and the presence of blood and mucus in the stool. The
ulcers produced by the invasion of the trophozoites may deepen into the classic flask-
shaped ulcers of amoebic colitis. Entamoeba histolytica may invade other parts of the
body, such as the liver, lungs and brain, sometimes with fatal outcome.
Source and occurrence
Humans are the reservoir of infection, and there would not appear to be other mean-
ingful animal reservoirs of E. histolytica. In the acute phase of infection, patients
excrete only trophozoites that are not infectious. Chronic cases and asymptomatic
carriers who excrete cysts are more important sources of infection and can dis-
charge up to 1.5 × 107 cysts daily. Entamoeba histolytica can be present in sewage
and contaminated water. Cysts may remain viable in suitable aquatic environments
for several months at low temperature. The potential for waterborne transmission
is greater in the tropics, where the carrier rate sometimes exceeds 50%, compared
with more temperate regions, where the prevalence in the general population may
be less than 10%.
Routes of exposure
Person-to-person contact and contamination of food by infected food handlers ap-
pear to be the most significant means of transmission, although contaminated water

                                              276
                                  11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


also plays a substantial role. Ingestion of faecally contaminated water and consump-
tion of food crops irrigated with contaminated water can both lead to transmission
of amoebiasis. Sexual transmission, particularly among male homosexuals, has also
been documented.

Significance in drinking-water
The transmission of E. histolytica by contaminated drinking-water has been con-
firmed. The cysts are relatively resistant to disinfection and may not be inactivated by
chlorination practices generally applied in the production of drinking-water. Within a
water safety plan, control measures that can be applied to manage potential risk from
E. histolytica include prevention of source water contamination by human waste, fol-
lowed by adequate treatment and protection of water during distribution. Owing to
the resistance of the cysts to disinfectants, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coli-
forms) cannot be relied upon as an indicator of the presence/absence of E. histolytica
in drinking-water supplies.

Giardia intestinalis
General description
Giardia spp. are flagellated protozoa that parasitize the gastrointestinal tract of humans
and certain other animals. The genus Giardia consists of a number of species, but human
infection (giardiasis) is usually assigned to G. intestinalis, also known as G. lamblia
or G. duodenalis. Giardia has a relatively simple life cycle consisting of a flagellate
trophozoite that multiplies in the gastrointestinal tract and an infective thick-walled
cyst that is shed intermittently but in large numbers in faeces. The trophozoites are
bilaterally symmetrical and ellipsoidal in shape. The cysts are ovoid in shape and 8–12
µm in diameter.

Human health effects
Giardia has been known as a human parasite for 200 years. After ingestion and excysta-
tion of cysts, the trophozoites attach to surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract. Infections
in both children and adults may be asymptomatic. In day-care centres, as many as 20%
of children may carry Giardia and excrete cysts without clinical symptoms. The symp-
toms of giardiasis may result from damage caused by the trophozoites, although the
mechanisms by which Giardia causes diarrhoea and intestinal malabsorption remain
controversial. Symptoms generally include diarrhoea and abdominal cramps; in se-
vere cases, however, malabsorption deficiencies in the small intestine may be present,
mostly among young children. Giardiasis is self-limiting in most cases, but it may be
chronic in some patients, lasting more than 1 year, even in otherwise healthy people.
Studies on human volunteers revealed that fewer than 10 cysts constitute a meaningful
risk of infection.

                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Source and occurrence
Giardia can multiply in a wide range of animal species and humans, which excrete
cysts into the environment. Numbers of cysts as high as 88 000 per litre in raw sew-
age and 240 per litre in surface water resources have been reported. These cysts are
robust and can survive for weeks to months in fresh water. The presence of cysts in
raw water sources and drinking-water supplies has been confirmed. However, there
is no information on whether human infectious species were present. The currently
available standard analytical techniques provide an indirect measure of viability and
no indication of human infectivity. Cysts also occur in recreational waters and con-
taminated food.

Routes of exposure
By far the most common route of transmission of Giardia is person-to-person con-
tact, particularly between children. Contaminated drinking-water, recreational water
and, to a lesser extent, food have been associated with outbreaks. Animals have been
implicated as a source of human infectious G. intestinalis, but further investigations
are required to determine their role.

Significance in drinking-water
Waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis have been associated with drinking-water sup-
plies for over 30 years; at one stage, Giardia was the most commonly identified cause
of waterborne outbreaks in the USA. Giardia cysts are more resistant than enteric bac-
teria to oxidative disinfectants such as chlorine, but they are not as resistant as Crypto-
sporidium oocysts. The time required for 90% inactivation at a free chlorine residual
of 1 mg/l is about 25–30 minutes. Within a water safety plan, control measures that
can be applied to manage potential risk from Giardia include prevention of source
water contamination by human and animal waste, followed by adequate treatment
and disinfection and protection of water during distribution. Owing to the resistance
of the cysts to disinfectants, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) cannot
be relied upon as an indicator of the presence/absence of Giardia in drinking-water
supplies.

Isospora belli
General description
Isospora is a coccidian, single-celled, obligate parasite related to Cryptosporidium and
Cyclospora. There are many species of Isospora that infect animals, but only I. belli is
known to infect humans, the only known host for this species. Isospora belli is one
of the few coccidia that undergo sexual reproduction in the human intestine. Sporu-
lated oocysts are ingested, and, after complete asexual and sexual life cycles in the
mucosal epithelium of the upper small intestine, unsporulated oocysts are released
in faeces.

Human health effects
Illness caused by I. belli is similar to that caused by Cryptosporidium and Giardia.
About 1 week after ingestion of viable oocysts, a low-grade fever, lassitude and malaise
may appear, followed soon by mild diarrhoea and vague abdominal pain. The infec-
tion is usually self-limited after 1–2 weeks, but occasionally diarrhoea, weight loss and
fever may last for 6 weeks to 6 months. Symptomatic isosporiasis is more common
in children than in adults. Infection is often associated with immunocompromised
patients, in whom symptoms are more severe and likely to be recurrent or chronic,
leading to malabsorption and weight loss. Infections are usually sporadic and most
common in the tropics and subtropics, although they also occur elsewhere, including
industrialized countries. They have been reported from Central and South America,
Africa and south-east Asia.

Source and occurrence
Unsporulated oocysts are excreted in the faeces of infected individuals. The oocysts
sporulate within 1–2 days in the environment to produce the potentially infectious
form of the organism. Few data are available on numbers of oocysts in sewage and raw
and treated water sources. This is largely because sensitive and reliable techniques for
the quantitative enumeration of oocysts in water environments are not available. Little
is known about the survival of oocysts in water and related environments.
Routes of exposure
Poor sanitation and faecally contaminated food and water are the most likely sources
of infection, but waterborne transmission has not been confirmed. The oocysts are
less likely than Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia cysts to be transmitted directly
from person to person, because freshly shed I. belli oocysts require 1–2 days in the
environment to sporulate before they are capable of infecting humans.
Significance in drinking-water
The characteristics of I. belli suggest that illness could be transmitted by contamin­
ated drinking-water supplies, but this has not been confirmed. No information is
available on the effectiveness of water treatment processes for removal of I. belli, but
it is likely that the organism is relatively resistant to disinfectants. It is considerably
larger than Cryptosporidium and should be easier to remove by filtration. Within a
water safety plan, control measures that can be applied to manage potential risk from


                                           279

I. belli include prevention of source water contamination by human waste, followed
by adequate treatment and disinfection and protection of water during distribution.
Owing to the likely resistance of the oocysts to disinfectants, E. coli (or, alternatively,
thermotolerant coliforms) cannot be relied upon as an indicator of the presence/ab-
sence of I. belli in drinking-water supplies.

Microsporidia
General description
Microsporidia are eukaryotic obligate intracellular parasites belonging to the phy-
lum Microspora. Although microsporidia were initially considered to be proto-
zoa, the scientific classification is uncertain, with recent studies indicating that they
could be classified as fungi. More than 100 microsporidial genera and almost 1000
species have been identified. Infections occur in every major animal group, including
vertebrates and invertebrates. A number of genera have been implicated in human
infections, including Enterocytozoon, Encephalitozoon (including Septata), Nosema,
Pleistophora, Vittaforma and Trachipleistophora, as well as a collective group of un-
classified microsporidia referred to as microsporidium. Microsporidia are among the
smallest eukaryotes. They produce unicellular spores with a diameter of 1.0–4.5 µm
and a characteristic coiled polar filament for injecting the sporoplasm into a host cell
to initiate infection. Within an infected cell, a complex process of multiplication takes
place, and new spores are produced and released in faeces, urine, respiratory secre-
tions or other body fluids, depending on the type of species and the site of infection.
Human health effects
Microsporidia are emerging human pathogens identified predominantly in persons
with AIDS, but their ability to cause disease in immunologically normal hosts has
been recognized. Reported human infections are globally dispersed and have been
documented in persons from all continents. The most common clinical manifestation
in AIDS patients is a severe enteritis involving chronic diarrhoea, dehydration and
weight loss. Prolonged illness for up to 48 months has been reported. Infections in the
general population are less pronounced. Enterocytozoon infection generally appears to
be limited to intestinal enterocytes and biliary epithelium. Encephalitozoon spp. infect
a variety of cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, kidney tubule
cells, macrophages and possibly other cell types. Unusual complications include kera-
toconjunctivitis, myositis and hepatitis.

                                 11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Source and occurrence
The sources of microsporidia infecting humans are uncertain. Spores are likely to be
excreted in faeces and are also excreted in urine and respiratory secretions. Owing to
the lack of a quantification technique, there is limited information on the prevalence
of microsporidia spores in water environments. However, microsporidia have been
detected in sewage and water sources. Indications are that their numbers in raw sew-
age may be similar to those of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and they may survive in
certain water environments for many months. Certain animals, notably swine, may
serve as a host for human infectious species.
Routes of exposure
Little is known about transmission of microsporidia. Person-to-person contact and
ingestion of spores in water or food contaminated with human faeces or urine are
probably important routes of exposure. A waterborne outbreak of microsporidi-
osis has been reported involving about 200 cases in Lyon, France, during the sum-
mer of 1995. However, the source of the organism and faecal contamination of the
drinking-water supply were not demonstrated. Transmission by the inhalation of
airborne spores or aerosols containing spores seems possible. The role of animals in
transmission to humans remains unclear. Epidemiological and experimental studies
in mammals suggest that Encephalitozoon spp. can be transmitted transplacentally
from mother to offspring. No information is available on the infectivity of the spores.
However, in view of the infectivity of spores of closely related species, the infectivity
of microsporidia may be high.
Significance in drinking-water
Waterborne transmission has been reported, and infection arising from contamin­
ated drinking-water is plausible but unconfirmed. Little is known about the response
of microsporidia to water treatment processes. One study has suggested that the
spores may be susceptible to chlorine. The small size of the organism is likely to make
them difficult to remove by filtration processes. Within a water safety plan, control
measures that can be applied to manage potential risk from microsporidia include
prevention of source water contamination by human and animal waste, followed by
adequate treatment and disinfection and protection of water during distribution.
Owing to the lack of information on sensitivity of infectious species of microsporidia
to disinfection, the reliability of E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms)
as an indicator for the presence/absence of these organisms from drinking-water
supplies is unknown.

Naegleria fowleri
General description
Naegleria are free-living amoeboflagellates distributed widely in the environment.
There are several species of Naegleria, of which N. fowleri is the primary infectious
species. Naegleria spp. exist as a trophozoite, a flagellate and a cyst stage. The tropho-
zoite (10–20 µm) moves by eruptive pseudopod formation, feeding on bacteria, and
reproduces by binary fission. The trophozoite can transform into a flagellate stage
with two anterior flagella. The flagellate does not divide but reverts to the trophozoite
stage. Under adverse conditions, the trophozoite transforms into a circular cyst (7–15
µm), which is resistant to unfavourable conditions.

Human health effects
Naegleria fowleri causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in healthy individuals.
The amoeba enters the brain by penetrating the olfactory mucosa and cribiform plate.
The disease is acute, and patients often die within 5–10 days and before the infectious
agent can be diagnosed. Treatment is difficult. Although the infection is rare, new
cases are reported every year.
Source and occurrence
Naegleria fowleri is thermophilic and grows well at temperatures up to 45 °C. It oc-
curs naturally in fresh water of suitable temperature, and prevalence is only indirectly
related to human activity, inasmuch as such activity may modify temperature or pro-
mote bacterial (food source) production. The pathogen has been reported from many
countries, usually associated with thermally polluted water environments such as geo-
thermal water or heated swimming pools. However, the organism has been detected in
drinking-water supplies, particularly where water temperature can exceed 25–30 °C.
Water is the only known source of infection. The first cases of amoebic meningitis
were diagnosed in 1965 in Australia and Florida. Since that time, about 100 cases of
primary amoebic meningoencephalitis have been reported throughout the world.

Routes of exposure
Infection with N. fowleri is almost exclusively contracted by exposure of the nasal pas-
sages to contaminated water. Infection is predominantly associated with recreational
use of water, including swimming pools and spas, as well as surface waters natu-
rally heated by the sun, industrial cooling waters and geothermal springs. In a limited
number of cases, a link to recreational water exposure is lacking. The occurrence of
primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is highest during hot summer months, when
many people engage in water recreation and when the temperature of water is con-
ducive to growth of the organism. Consumption of contaminated water or food and
person-to-person spread have not been reported as routes of transmission.

Significance in drinking-water
Naegleria fowleri has been detected in drinking-water supplies. Although unproven, a
direct or indirect role of drinking-water-derived organisms—for example, through use
of drinking-water in swimming pools—is possible. Any water supply that seasonally
exceeds 30 °C or that continually exceeds 25 °C can potentially support the growth of
N. fowleri. In such cases, a periodic prospective study would be valuable. Free chlorine
or monochloramine residuals in excess of 0.5 mg/l have been shown to control N. fowl-
eri, providing the disinfectant persists through the water distribution system. In addi-
tion to maintaining persistent disinfectant residuals, other control measures aimed at
limiting the presence of biofilm organisms will reduce food sources and hence growth
of the organism in distribution systems. Owing to the environmental nature of this
amoeba, E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) cannot be relied upon as
an indicator for the presence/absence of N. fowleri in drinking-water supplies.

Toxoplasma gondii
General description
Toxoplasma gondii is a coccidian parasite, and the cat is the definitive host. Felid ani-
mals harbour the parasite in the intestinal tract, where sexual reproduction takes place.
The actively multiplying asexual form in the human host is an obligate, intracellular
parasite (diameter 3–6 µm) called a tachyzoite. A chronic phase of the disease develops
as the tachyzoites transform into slowly replicating bradyzoites, which eventually be-
come cysts in the host tissue. In the natural cycle, mice and rats containing infective
cysts are eaten by cats, which host the sexual stage of the parasite. The cyst wall is
digested, and bradyzoites penetrate epithelial cells of the small intestine. Several gen-
erations of intracellular multiplication lead to the development of microgametes and
macrogametes. Fertilization of the latter leads to the development of oocysts that are
excreted in faeces as early as 5 days after a cat has ingested the cysts. Oocysts require
1–5 days to sporulate in the environment. Sporulated oocysts and tissue-borne cysts
can both cause infections in susceptible hosts.
Human health effects
Toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic in humans. In a small percentage of cases, flu-
like symptoms, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly present 5–23 days after

                                             283
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


the ingestion of cysts or oocysts. Dormant cysts, formed in organ tissue after primary
infection, can be reactivated when the immune system becomes suppressed, producing
disseminated disease involving the central nervous system and lungs and leading to
severe neurological disorders or pneumonia. When these infection sites are involved,
the disease can be fatal in immunocompromised patients. Congenital toxoplasmosis is
mostly asymptomatic, but can produce chorioretinitis, cerebral calcifications, hydro-
cephalus, severe thrombocytopenia and convulsions. Primary infection during early
pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or fetal abnormality.

Source and occurrence
Toxoplasmosis is found worldwide. Estimates indicate that in many parts of the world,
15–30% of lamb and pork meat is infected with cysts. The prevalence of oocyst-shedding
cats may be 1%. By the third decade of life, about 50% of the European population
is infected, and in France this proportion is close to 80%. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts
may occur in water sources and supplies contaminated with the faeces of infected cats.
Owing to a lack of practical methods for the detection of T. gondii oocysts, there is
little information on the prevalence of the oocysts in raw and treated water supplies.
Details on the survival and behaviour of the oocysts in water environments are also not
available. However, qualitative evidence of the presence of oocysts in faecally polluted
water has been reported, and results suggest that T. gondii oocysts may be as resistant to
unfavourable conditions in water environments as the oocysts of related parasites.

Routes of exposure
Both T. gondii oocysts that sporulate after excretion by cats and tissue-borne cysts are
potentially infectious. Humans can become infected by ingestion of oocysts excreted
by cats by direct contact or through contact with contaminated soil or water. Two
outbreaks of toxoplasmosis have been associated with consumption of contaminated
water. In Panama, creek water contaminated by oocysts from jungle cats was identi-
fied as the most likely source of infection, whereas in 1995, an outbreak in Canada
was associated with a drinking-water reservoir being contaminated by excreta from
domestic or wild cats. A study in Brazil during 1997–1999 identified the consumption
of unfiltered drinking-water as a risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity. More com-
monly, humans contract toxoplasmosis through the consumption of undercooked or
raw meat and meat products containing T. gondii cysts. Transplacental infection also
occurs.

Significance in drinking-water
Contaminated drinking-water has been identified as a source of toxoplasmosis out-
breaks. Little is known about the response of T. gondii to water treatment processes.
The oocysts are larger than Cryptosporidium oocysts and should be amenable to re-
moval by filtration. Within a water safety plan, control measures to manage potential
risk from T. gondii should be focused on prevention of source water contamination
by wild and domesticated cats. If necessary, the organisms can be removed by filtra-
tion. Owing to the lack of information on sensitivity of T. gondii to disinfection, the
reliability of E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) as an indicator for the
presence/absence of these organisms in drinking-water supplies is unknown.

11.4 Helminth pathogens
The word “helminth” comes from the Greek word meaning “worm” and refers to all
types of worms, both free-living and parasitic. The major parasitic worms are clas-
sified primarily in the phylum Nematoda (roundworms) and the phylum Platyhel-
minthes (flatworms including trematodes and cestodes). Helminth parasites infect a
large number of people and animals worldwide. For most helminths, drinking-water
is not a significant route of transmission. There are two exceptions: Dracunculus me-
dinensis (guinea worm) and Fasciola spp. (F. hepatica and F. gigantica) (liver flukes).
Dracunculiasis and fascioliasis both require intermediate hosts to complete their life
cycles but are transmitted through drinking-water by different mechanisms. Other
helminthiases can be transmitted through water contact (schistosomiasis) or are as-
sociated with the use of untreated wastewater in agriculture (ascariasis, trichuriasis,
hookworm infections and strongyloidiasis) but are not usually transmitted through
drinking-water.

Dracunculus medinensis
Dracunculus medinensis, commonly known as “guinea worm”, belongs to the phy-
lum Nematoda and is the only nematode associated with significant transmission by
drinking-water.
     The eradication of guinea worm infection from the world by 1995 was a target
of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981–1990), and
the World Health Assembly formally committed itself to this goal in 1991. The Dracu­
nculus Eradication Programme has achieved a massive reduction in the number of
cases. There were an estimated 3.3 million cases in 1986, 625 000 cases in 1990, fewer
than 60 000 cases in 2002 and only 3190 cases in 2009, with the majority occurring
in Sudan. Dracunculiasis is restricted to a central belt of countries in sub-Saharan
Africa.

General description
The D. medinensis worms inhabit the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues of infected
individuals, the female reaching a length of up to 700 mm, and the male, 25 mm.
When the female is ready to discharge larvae (embryos), its anterior end emerges from
a blister or ulcer, usually on the foot or lower limb, and releases large numbers of
rhabditiform larvae when the affected part of the body is immersed in water. The
larvae can move about in water for approximately 3 days and during that time can


                                             285
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


be ingested by many species of Cyclops (cyclopoid Copepoda, Crustacea). The larvae
penetrate into the haemocoelom, moult twice and are infective to a new host in about
2 weeks. If the Cyclops (0.5–2.0 mm) are swallowed in drinking-water, the larvae are
released in the stomach, penetrate the intestinal and peritoneal walls and inhabit the
subcutaneous tissues.
Human health effects
The onset of symptoms occurs just prior to the local eruption of the worm. The
early manifestations of urticaria, erythema, dyspnoea, vomiting, pruritus and gid­
diness are of an allergic nature. In about 50% of cases, the whole worm is extruded
in a few weeks; the lesion then heals rapidly, and disability is of limited duration.
In the remaining cases, however, complications ensue, and the track of the worm
becomes secondarily infected, leading to a severe inflammatory reaction that may
result in abscess formation with disabling pain that lasts for months. Mortality is
extremely rare, but permanent disability can result from contractures of tendons
and chronic arthritis. The economic impact can be substantial. One study reported
an 11% annual reduction in rice production from an area of eastern Nigeria, at a
cost of US$ 20 million.

Source and occurrence
Infection with guinea worm is geographically limited to a central belt of countries in
sub-Saharan Africa. Drinking-water containing infected Cyclops is the only source of
infection with Dracunculus. The disease typically occurs in rural areas where piped
water supplies are not available. Transmission tends to be highly seasonal, depending
on changes in water sources. For instance, transmission is highest in the early rainy
season in a dry savannah zone of Mali with under 800 mm annual rainfall but in the
dry season in the humid savannah area of southern Nigeria with over 1300 mm an-
nual rainfall. The eradication strategy combines a variety of interventions, including
integrated surveillance systems, intensified case containment measures, provision of
safe water and health education.

Routes of exposure
The only route of exposure is the consumption of drinking-water containing Cyclops
spp. carrying infectious Dracunculus larvae.

Significance in drinking-water
Dracunculus medinensis is the only human parasite that may be eradicated in the near
future by the provision of safe drinking-water. Infection can be prevented by a num-
ber of relatively simple control measures. These include intervention strategies to pre-
vent the release of D. medinensis larvae from female worms in infected patients into
water and control of Cyclops spp. in water resources by means of fish. Prevention can
also be achieved through the provision of boreholes and safe wells. Wells and springs
should be surrounded by cement curbings, and bathing and washing in these waters
should be avoided. Other control measures include filtration of water carrying infec-
tious Dracunculus larvae through a fine mesh cloth to remove Cyclops spp. or inactiva-
tion of Cyclops spp. in drinking-water by treatment with chlorine.

Fasciola spp.
Fascioliasis is caused by two trematode species of the genus Fasciola: F. hepatica,
present in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Americas and Oceania, and F. gigantica, mainly
distributed in Africa and Asia. Human fascioliasis was considered a secondary zoo-
notic disease until the mid-1990s. In most regions, fascioliasis is a foodborne disease.
However, the discovery of floating metacercariae in hyperendemic regions (including
the Andean Altiplano region in South America) indicates that drinking-water may be
a significant transmission route for fascioliasis in certain locations.
General description
The life cycle of F. hepatica and F. gigantica takes about 14–23 weeks and requires two
hosts. The life cycle comprises four phases. In the first phase, the definitive host ingests
metacercariae. The metacercariae excyst in the intestinal tract and then migrate to the
liver and bile ducts. After 3–4 months, the flukes attain sexual maturity and produce
eggs, which are excreted into the bile and intestine. Adult flukes can live for 9–14 years
in the host. In the second phase, the eggs are excreted by the human or animal. Once
in fresh water, a miracidium develops inside. In the third phase, miracidia penetrate
a snail host and develop into cercaria, which are released into the water. In the fourth
and final phase, cercariae swim for a short period of time until they reach a suit-
able attachment site (aquatic plants), where they encyst to form metacercariae, which
become infective within 24 hours. Some metacercariae do not attach to plants but
remain floating in the water.
Human health effects
The parasites inhabit the large biliary passages and the gall-bladder. Disease symptoms
are different for the acute and chronic phases of the infection. The invasive or acute
phase may last from 2 to 4 months and is characterized by symptoms such as dyspep-
sia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and a high fever (up to 40 °C). Anaemia
and allergic responses (e.g. pruritis, urticaria) may also occur. In children, the acute
infection can be accompanied by severe symptoms and sometimes causes death. The
obstructive or chronic phase (after months to years of infection) may be characterized
by painful liver enlargement and in some cases obstructive jaundice, chest pains, loss
of weight and cholelithiasis. The most important pathogenic sequelae are hepatic le-
sions and fibrosis and chronic inflammation of the bile ducts. Immature flukes may
deviate during migration, enter other organs and cause ectopic fascioliasis in a range
of subcutaneous tissues. Fascioliasis can be treated with triclabendazole.
Source and occurrence
Human cases have been increasing in 51 countries on five continents. Estimates of
the numbers of humans with fascioliasis range from 2.4 to 17 million people or even
higher, depending on unquantified prevalence in many African and Asian countries.

                                              287
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     Analysis of the geographical distribution of human cases shows that the correla-
tion between human fascioliasis and fascioliasis in animals occurs only at a basic level.
High prevalences in humans are not necessarily related to areas where fascioliasis is a
great veterinary problem. Major health problems associated with fascioliasis occur in
Andean countries (the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador), the Carib-
bean (Cuba), northern Africa (Egypt), the Near East (the Islamic Republic of Iran and
neighbouring countries) and western Europe (Portugal, France and Spain).
Routes of exposure
Humans can contract fascioliasis when they ingest infective metacercariae by eating
raw aquatic plants (and, in some cases, terrestrial plants, such as lettuce, irrigated with
contaminated water), drinking contaminated water, using utensils washed in contam-
inated water or eating raw liver infected with immature flukes.
Significance in drinking-water
Water is often cited as a human infection source. In the Bolivian Altiplano, 13% of
metacercariae isolates are floating. Untreated drinking-water in hyperendemic regions
often contains floating metacercariae; for example, a small stream crossing in the Alti-
plano region of the Plurinational State of Bolivia contained up to 7 metacercariae per
500 ml. The importance of fascioliasis transmission through water is supported by
indirect evidence. There are significant positive associations between liver fluke infec-
tion and infection by other waterborne protozoans and helminths in Andean coun-
tries and in Egypt. In many human hyperendemic areas of the Americas, people do
not have a history of eating watercress or other water plants. In the Nile Delta region,
people living in houses with piped water had a higher infection risk. Metacercariae
are likely to be resistant to chlorine disinfection but should be removed by various
filtration processes. For example, in Tiba, Egypt, human prevalence was markedly de-
creased after filtered water was supplied to specially constructed washing units.

Free-living nematodes
General description
Nematodes are the most numerous metazoan (many-celled) animals on Earth. Many
of them are parasites of insects, plants or animals, including humans. Free-living spe-
cies are abundant in aquatic environments, both freshwater and saltwater, and soil
habitats. Not only are the vast majority of species encountered poorly understood
biologically, but there may be thousands more unknown species of nematodes yet
to be discovered. Nematodes are structurally simple, with the digestive tract run-

                                             288
                                11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


ning from the mouth on the anterior end to the posterior opening near the tail, being
characterized as a tube in a tube. Nematodes found in drinking-water systems range
in size from 0.1 mm to over 0.6 mm.
     About 20 different orders have been distinguished within the phylum Nematoda.
Four of these orders (Rhabditida, Tylenchida, Aphelenchida and Dorylaimida) are par-
ticularly common in soil. Non-pathogenic free-living nematodes that have been found
in drinking-water include Cheilobus, Diplogaster, Tobrilus, Aphelenchus and Rhabditis.

Human health effects
The presence of free-living nematodes in drinking-water does not necessarily indi-
cate a direct health threat. It has largely been regarded by water suppliers as an “aes-
thetic” problem, either directly or through their association with discoloured water.
High concentrations of nematodes in drinking-water have been reported to impart
an unpleasant taste to the drinking-water. The presence of free-living nematodes in
drinking-water reduces its acceptability to the consumer.
     It has been suggested that free-living nematodes could carry pathogenic bacteria
in their gut. Such bacteria would be protected from chlorine disinfection and might
therefore present a health hazard. Enterobacteriaceae have been isolated from the
microflora in the guts of nematodes taken from a treated water supply and from the
raw water from which it was derived. However, they were of non-pathogenic genera.
Opportunistic pathogens such as Nocardia and Mycobacterium may also be carried
in the gut of the free-living nematodes. There is no reason to suppose that patho-
gens would be selectively favoured. The microorganisms present in the gut of the free-
living nematodes are much more likely to reflect those in the sediments and biofilms
where they are feeding.
     In some cases, the motile larvae of parasitic nematodes such as hookworms
(Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale) and threadworms (Strongyloides
stercoralis) are capable of moving themselves through sand filters or may be intro-
duced into drinking-water during distribution as the result of faecal contamination.
There are also some other species of nematodes that theoretically could infect hu-
mans through ingestion of contaminated water. Such a source of infection, however,
is difficult to prove. Dracunculus medinensis is a noticeable parasitic nematode that
may occur in drinking-water. This parasite is reported elsewhere in this section.

Source and occurrence
Because free-living nematodes are ubiquitous, they, as an egg or free-living larval or
adult form, can enter the drinking-water supply at the storage, treatment, distribu-
tion or household level. The concentration of free-living nematodes in the raw water
source generally corresponds to the turbidity of the water. The higher the turbidity,
the larger the concentration of free-living nematodes there will be.
     In warm or even temperate weather, slow sand filters may discharge nematodes—
and Origochaetes (e.g. Aeolosoma spp.), insect larvae (e.g. Chironomus spp.) and
mosquitoes (Culex spp.)—by drawdown into the filtered water. Aquatic animals that
successfully penetrate drinking-water treatment processes are largely benthic species,
living on the bottoms or margins of water bodies.

                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


Routes of exposure
Potential health concerns arise from exposure to the nematodes through ingestion
of drinking-water, during recreation and potentially through consumption of fresh
vegetables fertilized with sewage that received non-lethal treatment. Distinguishing
pathogenic larvae of the hookworm and threadworm from free-living non-pathogenic
nematodes in water is difficult and requires special knowledge of nematology.
Significance in drinking-water
Large numbers of nematodes are not normally found in well-maintained, piped
drinking-water systems. Eggs or infective larvae from species parasitic to humans (As-
caris, Trichuris, Ancylostoma, Necator and Strongyloides) and the many non-pathogenic
nematodes are not usually present in protected groundwater sources or are generally
removed during treatment processes.
      In some circumstances, when the water contains a high nutrient or organic mat-
ter content and the ambient temperatures are appropriate, it may be possible for free-
living nematodes to feed on microbial growth in the biofilms or slimes in treatment
processes or in water mains and thus multiply within the system. This is particularly true
if drinking-water sources have not been adequately protected, treatment systems are not
adequate or not operated and maintained properly, the distribution system is leaking or
there are many stagnant areas or “dead zones” in the distribution system. Detection of
large numbers of nematodes (live and dead) in drinking-water indicates that there is a
problem that needs to be resolved, without necessarily implying a direct health risk.

Schistosoma spp.

trematodes or blood flukes. The life cycle takes about 3–4 months and requires two

hosts. There are about 20 species of Schistosoma, and adult flukes are found in hu-
mans, other mammals and birds. Unlike other trematode species, Schistosoma has two
distinct sexual forms. In the most important human schistosomes, adult flukes are
12–20 mm in length and 0.3–0.6 mm in width; male flukes are shorter and thicker
than the females. Adult worms of schistosomes reside in the mesenteric blood vessels
of the definitive host. Once the worms mature, they mate, and the females produce
eggs that are round or oval and vary in length from 50 to 200 µm. Depending on the
infecting species, a large number of eggs released by the females reach either the intes-
tine or the bladder and are excreted in faeces or urine, respectively. The eggs hatch in
fresh water, and the larvae (miracidia) invade snail hosts, where they undergo asexual
reproduction and develop into the infective larvae (cercariae). Cercariae have pear-
shaped heads and forked tails and are 400–600 µm in length. They emerge into the
water from snails and invade the final hosts, including humans.
Human health effects
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a group of infectious diseases caused by
five major species of Schistosoma in humans. Intestinal schistosomiasis is caused by
Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi and S. intercalatum, whereas urin­
ary schistosomiasis is caused by S. haematobium. Most of the symptoms of schis-
tosomiasis are the manifestation of the body’s reaction to the eggs laid and are due
to the intensity of the immune response of the host, not to the worms themselves.
Therefore, the symptoms depend on the amount and location of eggs in the hu-
man host, and light infections can be asymptomatic. In some people, an initial al-
lergic reaction (Katayama fever), including fever, chills, muscle pains and cough,
can begin within 1–2 months of infection immediately before and during initial egg
deposition. Chronic infections with S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. intercalatum and S.
mekongi result primarily in intestinal and hepatic symptoms, including bloody diar-
rhoea (bilharzial dysentery), abdominal pains and hepatosplenomegaly, whereas S.
haematobium infection leads to urinary manifestation, including dysuria and haem­
aturia. Important life-threatening complications that arise from chronic infections
include liver fibrosis and portal hypertension. Later development of bladder cancer
and renal failure is associated with urinary schistosomiasis. Rarely, eggs are found
in the brain or spinal cord and can cause cerebral symptoms, such as seizures and
paralysis. Anaemia and malnutrition are also found in young infected cases. Impaired
growth, impaired development and poor cognition are signs of morbidity in infected
school-age children. In total, more than 200 million people are infected in 75 coun-
tries. The number of deaths associated with schistosomiasis is estimated at 20 000
annually. Schistosomiasis is of great public health and socioeconomic importance in
developing countries where it is endemic.

Source and occurrence
Schistosomes occur in tropical and subtropical freshwater sources. Schistosoma man-
soni is found in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Brazil, Suriname, the Bolivarian Re-
public of Venezuela and some Caribbean islands; S.haematobium is found in Africa
and the Middle East; S. japonicum is found in China, the Philippines and the Sulawesi

Island of Indonesia; S. intercalatum is found in some countries of Central Africa; and
S. mekongi is limited to the Mekong River in Cambodia and the Lao People’s Demo-
cratic Republic. Water resource development projects, including dam construction,
have been identified as potential sources of elevated rates of schistosomiasis as a result
of the production of increased habitats for freshwater snails. Humans are the principal
reservoirs of S. haematobium, S. intercalatum and S. mansoni, although the latter has
been reported in rodents. Various animals, such as humans, dogs, cats, rodents, pigs,
cattle and water buffalo, are potential reservoirs of S. japonicum, whereas humans and
dogs are potential reservoirs of S. mekongi.

Routes of exposure
Infection occurs through skin penetration when people are exposed to free-swimming
cercariae in infested water used for agricultural, domestic and recreational activities.
Infection does not occur through consumption of drinking-water. Cercariae of hu-
man infectious schistosomes penetrate the skin rapidly and transform into schisto-
somules, which migrate to the lungs through the circulatory system and develop into
adult flukes in the mesenteric veins. If cercariae of non-human infectious schistosomes
come in contact with human skin, they do not survive but can cause an inflammatory
response, especially in hosts that have been exposed previously. Papular rash, known
as schistosome cercarial dermatitis, can result at points of penetration of cercariae.
The cercariae of avian schistosomes and probably bovine schistosomes are responsible
for a majority of cases of this dermatitis, which has been reported throughout the
world. Person-to-person transmission does not occur.

Significance in drinking-water
Most infections occur in poor communities without access to safe drinking-water and
adequate sanitation. Ready availability of safe drinking-water contributes to disease
prevention by replacing use of infested water for domestic purposes. Within a water
safety plan, control measures include prevention of source water contamination by
human waste, snail control programmes and adequate treatment. Schistosoma cercar-
iae can be removed by filtration and inactivated by chlorination.

11.5 Toxic cyanobacteria
Detailed information on toxic cyanobacteria is available in the supporting document
Toxic cyanobacteria in water (Annex 1).
General description
Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that share some properties with algae.
Notably, they possess chlorophyll a and liberate oxygen during photosynthesis. The
species used for early nomenclature were blue-green in colour; hence, a common term
for these organisms is blue-green algae. However, owing to the production of differ-
ent pigments, there are a large number that are not blue-green, and they can range in
colour from blue-green to yellow-brown to red. Most cyanobacteria are phototrophs,
but some exhibit heterotrophic growth. They may grow as separate cells or in multi-
cellular filaments or colonies. They can be identified by their morphology to genus or
even to species level under a microscope. Some species form surface blooms or scums,
whereas others are evenly dispersed throughout the mixed layers of the water body or
are bottom dwelling (benthic). Some cyanobacteria possess the ability to regulate their
buoyancy via intracellular gas vacuoles, and some species can fix elemental nitrogen
dissolved in water. The most notable feature of cyanobacteria in terms of public health
impact is that a range of species can produce toxins.
Human health effects
Many cyanobacteria produce potent toxins, as shown in Table 11.1. Cyanobacterial tox-
ins are also discussed in section 8.5.1. Each toxin has specific properties, with distinct
concerns including liver damage, neurotoxicity and tumour promotion. Acute symp-
toms reported after exposure include gastrointestinal disorders, fever and irritations
of the skin, ears, eyes, throat and respiratory tract. Cyanobacteria do not multiply in
the human body and hence are not infectious.

                              11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Source and occurrence
Cyanobacteria are widespread and found in a diverse range of environments, includ-
ing soils, seawater and, most notably, freshwater environments. Some environmental




                                        293a
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


conditions, including sunlight, high nutrient levels, low turbulence and warm weather,
can promote growth. Depending on the species, this may result in greenish discolora­
tion of water due to a high density of suspended cells and, in some cases, the formation
of surface scums. Such cell accumulations may lead to high toxin concentrations.

Routes of exposure
Potential health concerns arise from exposure to the toxins through ingestion of
drinking-water, during recreation, through showering and potentially through con-
sumption of algal food supplement tablets. Repeated or chronic exposure is the pri-
mary concern for many of the cyanotoxins; in some cases, however, acute toxicity
is more important (e.g. lyngbyatoxins and the neurotoxins saxitoxin and anatoxin).
Human fatalities have occurred through use of inadequately treated water containing
high cyanotoxin levels for renal dialysis. Dermal exposure may lead to irritation of the
skin and mucous membranes and possibly also to allergic reactions.
Significance in drinking-water
Cyanobacteria occur in low cell density in most surface waters. However, under environ-
mental conditions supporting their proliferation, high-density “blooms” can occur.
Eutrophication (increased biological growth associated with increased nutrients) can
support the development of cyanobacterial blooms. Control measures to reduce the
potential for “blooms” include catchment management to minimize nutrient inputs to
source waters, maintaining flow in regulated rivers and water mixing techniques, both to
eliminate stratification and to reduce nutrient release from sediments in reservoirs.

11.6 Indicator organisms
Indicator organisms are used for a range of purposes, including as indicators of:
•   faecal pollution in verification and surveillance monitoring;
•   the effectiveness of processes such as filtration or disinfection in validation;
•   integrity and cleanliness of distribution systems in operational monitoring.
    Further discussion on indicator organisms is contained in section 7.4 and the
supporting document Assessing microbial safety of drinking water (Annex 1).

Total coliform bacteria
General description
Total coliform bacteria include a wide range of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic,
Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacilli capable of growing in the presence of

                                            294
                                  11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


relatively high concentrations of bile salts with the fermentation of lactose and
production of acid or aldehyde within 24 hours at 35–37 °C. Escherichia coli and
thermotolerant coliforms are a subset of the total coliform group that can ferment
lactose at higher temperatures (see below). As part of lactose fermentation, total
coliforms produce the enzyme β-galactosidase. Traditionally, coliform bacteria were
regarded as belonging to the genera Escherichia, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Enterobac-
ter, but the group is more heterogeneous and includes a wider range of genera, such
as Serratia and Hafnia. The total coliform group includes both faecal and environ-
mental species.

Indicator value
Total coliforms include organisms that can survive and grow in water. Hence, they
are not useful as an indicator of faecal pathogens, but they can be used to assess the
cleanliness and integrity of distribution systems and the potential presence of biofilms.
However, there are better indicators for these purposes. It has been proposed that total
coliforms could be used as a disinfection indicator. However, the test for total coliforms
is far slower and less reliable than direct measurement of disinfectant residual. In addi-
tion, total coliforms are far more sensitive to disinfection than are enteric viruses and
protozoa. HPC measurements detect a wider range of microorganisms and are gener-
ally considered a better indicator of distribution system integrity and cleanliness.

Source and occurrence
Total coliform bacteria (excluding E. coli) occur in both sewage and natural waters.
Some of these bacteria are excreted in the faeces of humans and animals, but many
coliforms are heterotrophic and able to multiply in water and soil environments. Total
coliforms can also survive and grow in water distribution systems, particularly in the
presence of biofilms.

Application in practice
Total coliforms are generally measured in 100 ml samples of water. A variety of rela-
tively simple procedures are available based on the production of acid from lactose
or the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase. The procedures include membrane
filtration followed by incubation of the membranes on selective media at 35–37 °C
and counting of colonies after 24 hours. Alternative methods include most probable
number procedures using tubes or microtitre plates and presence/absence tests. Field
test kits are available.

Significance in drinking-water
Total coliforms should be absent immediately after disinfection, and the presence of
these organisms indicates inadequate treatment. The presence of total coliforms in dis-
tribution systems and stored water supplies can reveal regrowth and possible biofilm for-
mation or contamination through ingress of foreign material, including soil or plants.

Escherichia coli and thermotolerant coliform bacteria

General description
Total coliform bacteria that are able to ferment lactose at 44–45 °C are known as
thermotolerant coliforms. In most waters, the predominant genus is Escherichia,
but some types of Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Enterobacter are also thermotolerant.
Escherichia coli can be differentiated from the other thermotolerant coliforms by
the ability to produce indole from tryptophan or by the production of the enzyme
β-glucuronidase. Escherichia coli is present in very high numbers in human and ani-
mal faeces and is rarely found in the absence of faecal pollution, although there is
some evidence for growth in tropical soils. Thermotolerant coliform species other
than E. coli can include environmental organisms.
Indicator value
Escherichia coli is considered the most suitable indicator of faecal contamination. In
most circumstances, populations of thermotolerant coliforms are composed pre-
dominantly of E. coli; as a result, this group is regarded as a less reliable but accept-
able indicator of faecal pollution. Escherichia coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant
coliforms) is the first organism of choice in monitoring programmes for verification,
including surveillance of drinking-water quality. These organisms are also used as dis-
infection indicators, but testing is far slower and less reliable than direct measurement
of disinfectant residual. In addition, E. coli is far more sensitive to disinfection than are
enteric viruses and protozoa.
Source and occurrence
Escherichia coli occurs in high numbers in human and animal faeces, sewage and water
subject to recent faecal pollution. Water temperatures and nutrient conditions present
in drinking-water distribution systems are highly unlikely to support the growth of
these organisms.
Application in practice
Escherichia coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) are generally measured
in 100 ml samples of water. A variety of relatively simple procedures are available
based on the production of acid and gas from lactose or the production of the enzyme
β-glucuronidase. The procedures include membrane filtration followed by incuba-
tion of the membranes on selective media at 44–45 °C and counting of colonies after
24 hours. Alternative methods include most probable number procedures using tubes
or microtitre plates and presence/absence tests, some for volumes of water larger than
100 ml. Field test kits are available.

Significance in drinking-water
The presence of E. coli (or, alternatively, thermotolerant coliforms) provides evidence
of recent faecal contamination, and detection should lead to consideration of further
action, which could include further sampling and investigation of potential sources
such as inadequate treatment or breaches in distribution system integrity.

Heterotrophic plate counts
A substantial review of the use of HPC is available (see the supporting document
Heterotrophic plate counts and drinking-water safety; Annex 1).
General description
HPC measurement detects a wide spectrum of heterotrophic microorganisms, includ-
ing bacteria and fungi, based on the ability of the organisms to grow on rich growth
media, without inhibitory or selective agents, over a specified incubation period and at
a defined temperature. The spectrum of organisms detected by HPC testing includes
organisms sensitive to disinfection processes, such as coliform bacteria; organisms re-
sistant to disinfection, such as spore formers; and organisms that rapidly proliferate
in treated water in the absence of residual disinfectants. The tests detect only a small
proportion of the microorganisms that are present in water. The population recovered
will differ according to the method and conditions applied. Although standard meth-
ods have been developed, there is no single universal HPC measurement. A range of
media is available, incubation temperatures used vary from 20 °C to 37 °C and incuba-
tion periods range from a few hours to 7 days or more.
Indicator value
The test has little value as an indicator of pathogen presence but can be useful in
operational monitoring as a treatment and disinfectant indicator, where the objective
is to keep numbers as low as possible. In addition, HPC measurement can be used
in assessing the cleanliness and integrity of distribution systems and the presence of
biofilms.

Source and occurrence
Heterotrophic microorganisms include both members of the natural (typically non-
hazardous) microbial flora of water environments and organisms present in a range

                                               297
                            GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


of pollution sources. They occur in large numbers in raw water sources. The actual
organisms detected by HPC tests vary widely between locations and between con-
secutive samples. Some drinking-water treatment processes, such as coagulation and
sedimentation, reduce the number of HPC organisms in water. However, the organ-
isms proliferate in other treatment processes, such as biologically active carbon and
sand filtration. Numbers of HPC organisms are reduced significantly by disinfec-
tion practices, such as chlorination, ozonation and UV light irradiation. However,
in practice, none of the disinfection processes sterilizes water; under suitable condi-
tions, such as the absence of disinfectant residuals, HPC organisms can grow rapidly.
HPC organisms can grow in water and on surfaces in contact with water as biofilms.
The principal determinants of growth or “regrowth” are temperature, availability of
nutrients, including assimilable organic carbon, lack of disinfectant residual and
stagnation.
Application in practice
No sophisticated laboratory facilities or highly trained staff are required. Results on
simple aerobically incubated agar plates are available within hours to days, depending
on the characteristics of the procedure used.

Significance in drinking-water
After disinfection, numbers would be expected to be low; for most uses of HPC
test results, however, actual numbers are of less value than changes in numbers at
particular locations. In distribution systems, increasing numbers can indicate a
deterioration in cleanliness, possibly stagnation and the potential development of
biofilms. HPC can include potentially “opportunistic” pathogens such as Acineto-
bacter, Aeromonas, Flavobacterium, Klebsiella, Moraxella, Serratia, Pseudomonas
and Xanthomonas. However, there is no evidence of an association of any of these
organisms with gastrointestinal infection through ingestion of drinking-water in the
general population.

Intestinal enterococci
General description
Intestinal enterococci are a subgroup of the larger group of organisms defined as
faecal streptococci, comprising species of the genus Streptococcus. These bacteria are
Gram-positive and relatively tolerant of sodium chloride and alkaline pH levels. They
are facultatively anaerobic and occur singly, in pairs or as short chains. Faecal strep-
tococci including intestinal enterococci all give a positive reaction with Lancefield’s

                                               298
                                  11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


Group D antisera and have been isolated from the faeces of warm-blooded animals.
The subgroup intestinal enterococci consists of the species Enterococcus faecalis,
E. faecium, E. durans and E. hirae. This group was separated from the rest of the faecal
streptococci because they are relatively specific for faecal pollution. However, some
intestinal enterococci isolated from water may occasionally also originate from other
habitats, including soil, in the absence of faecal pollution.
Indicator value
The intestinal enterococci group can be used as an indicator of faecal pollution. Most
species do not multiply in water environments. The numbers of intestinal enterococci
in human faeces are generally about an order of magnitude lower than those of E. coli.
Important advantages of this group are that they tend to survive longer in water en-
vironments than E. coli (or thermotolerant coliforms), are more resistant to drying
and are more resistant to chlorination. Intestinal enterococci have been used in testing
of raw water as an indicator of faecal pathogens that survive longer than E. coli and in
drinking-water to augment testing for E. coli. In addition, they have been used to test
water quality after repairs to distribution systems or after new mains have been laid.

Source and occurrence
Intestinal enterococci are typically excreted in the faeces of humans and other warm-
blooded animals. Some members of the group have also been detected in soil in the
absence of faecal contamination. Intestinal enterococci are present in large numbers
in sewage and water environments polluted by sewage or wastes from humans and
animals.

Application in practice
Enterococci are detectable by simple, inexpensive cultural methods that require basic
bacteriology laboratory facilities. Commonly used methods include membrane filtra-
tion with incubation of membranes on selective media and counting of colonies after
incubation at 35–37 °C for 48 hours. Other methods include a most probable number
technique using microtitre plates where detection is based on the ability of intestinal
enterococci to hydrolyse 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-β-D-glucoside in the presence of thal-
lium acetate and nalidixic acid within 36 hours at 41 °C.
Significance in drinking-water
The presence of intestinal enterococci provides evidence of recent faecal contamina-
tion, and detection should lead to consideration of further action, which could include
further sampling and investigation of potential sources such as inadequate treatment
or breaches in distribution system integrity.

Clostridium perfringens
General description
Clostridium spp. are Gram-positive, anaerobic, sulfite-reducing bacilli. They produce
spores that are exceptionally resistant to unfavourable conditions in water environ-
ments, including UV irradiation, temperature and pH extremes, and disinfection
processes, such as chlorination. The characteristic species of the genus, C. perfrin-
gens, is a member of the normal intestinal flora of 13–35% of humans and other
warm-blooded animals. Other species are not exclusively of faecal origin. Like E. coli,
C. perfringens does not multiply in most water environments and is a highly specific
indicator of faecal pollution.

Indicator value
In view of the exceptional resistance of C. perfringens spores to disinfection processes
and other unfavourable environmental conditions, C. perfringens has been proposed as
an indicator of protozoa in treated drinking-water supplies. In addition, C. perfringens
can serve as an indicator of faecal pollution that took place previously and hence can
indicate sources liable to intermittent contamination. The evidence that Clostridium is
a reliable indicator for enteric viruses is limited and inconsistent, largely based on one
study of reductions by drinking-water treatment. Results should be treated with some
caution, as the exceptionally long survival times of its spores are likely to far exceed
those of enteric pathogens. Clostridium perfringens spores are smaller than protozoan
(oo)cysts and may be useful indicators of the effectiveness of filtration processes.

Source and occurrence
Clostridium perfringens and its spores are virtually always present in sewage. The or-
ganism does not multiply in water environments. Clostridium perfringens is present
more often and in higher numbers in the faeces of some animals, such as dogs, than
in the faeces of humans and less often in the faeces of many other warm-blooded
animals. The numbers excreted in faeces are normally substantially lower than those
of E. coli.

Application in practice
Vegetative cells and spores of C. perfringens are usually detected by membrane filtra-
tion techniques in which membranes are incubated on selective media under strict
anaerobic conditions. These detection techniques are not as simple and inexpensive as
those for other indicators, such as E. coli and intestinal enterococci.

Significance in drinking-water
The presence of C. perfringens in drinking-water can be an indicator of intermittent
faecal contamination. Potential sources of contamination should be investigated.

Filtration processes designed to remove enteric viruses or protozoa should also re-
move C. perfringens. Detection in water immediately after treatment should lead to
investigation of filtration plant performance.

General description
Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that use only bacteria as hosts for replication.
Coliphages use E. coli and closely related species as hosts and hence can be released by
these bacterial hosts into the faeces of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Co-
liphages used in water quality assessment are divided into the major groups of somatic
coliphages and F-RNA coliphages. Differences between the two groups include the
route of infection.
     Somatic coliphages initiate infection by attaching to receptors permanently lo-
cated on the cell wall of hosts. They replicate more frequently in the gastrointestinal
tract of warm-blooded animals but can also replicate in water environments. Somatic
coliphages consist of a wide range of phages (members of the phage families Myo-
viridae, Siphoviridae, Podoviridae and Microviridae) with a spectrum of morpho-
logical types.
     F-RNA coliphages initiate infection by attaching to fertility (F-, sex) fimbriae
on E. coli hosts. These F-fimbriae are produced only by bacteria carrying the fertil-
ity (F-) plasmid. As F-fimbriae are produced only in the logarithmic growth phase at
temperatures above 30 °C, F-RNA phages are not likely to replicate in environments
other than the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. F-RNA coliphages
comprise a restricted group of closely related phages, which belong to the family
Leviviridae, and consist of a single-stranded RNA genome and an icosahedral capsid
that is morphologically similar to that of picornaviruses. F-RNA coliphages have been
divided into serological types I–IV, which can be identified as genotypes by molecular
techniques such as gene probe hybridization. Members of groups I and IV have to date
been found exclusively in (non-human) animal faeces, and group III in human faeces.
Group II phages have been detected in human faeces and no animal faeces other than
about 28% of porcine faeces. This specificity, which is not fully understood, offers a
potential tool to distinguish between faecal pollution of human and animal origin
under certain conditions and limitations.

Indicator value
Phages share many properties with human viruses, notably composition, morphol-
ogy, structure and mode of replication. As a result, coliphages are useful models or
surrogates to assess the behaviour of enteric viruses in water environments and the
sensitivity to treatment and disinfection processes. In this regard, they are superior to
faecal bacteria and could be considered for inclusion in verification and surveillance
monitoring where source waters are known to be affected by human faecal waste.
However, there is no direct correlation between numbers of coliphages and numbers
of enteric viruses. In addition, coliphages cannot be absolutely relied upon as an indi-
cator for enteric viruses. This has been confirmed by the isolation of enteric viruses
from treated and disinfected drinking-water supplies that yielded negative results in
conventional tests for coliphages.
     F-RNA coliphages provide a more specific indicator of faecal pollution than
somatic phages. In addition, F-RNA coliphages are better indicators of the behaviour
of enteric viruses in water environments and their response to treatment and disinfec-
tion processes than are somatic coliphages. This has been confirmed by studies in
which the behaviour and survival of F-RNA coliphages, somatic phages, faecal bacteria
and enteric viruses have been compared. Available data indicate that the specificity of
F‑RNA serogroups (genotypes) for human and animal excreta may prove useful in the
distinction between faecal pollution of human and animal origin. However, there are
shortcomings and conflicting data that need to be resolved, and the extent to which
this tool can be applied in practice remains to be elucidated. Owing to the limitations
of coliphages, they are best used in laboratory investigations, pilot trials and possibly
validation testing. They are not suitable for operational or verification (including sur-
veillance) monitoring.

Source and occurrence
Coliphages are excreted by humans and animals in relatively low numbers. As a re-
sult of their respective modes of replication and host specificity, somatic coliphages
are generally excreted by most humans and animals, whereas F-RNA coliphages are
excreted by a variable and generally lower percentage of humans and animals. Avail-
able data indicate that in some communities, F-RNA phages are detectable in 10% of
human, 45% of bovine, 60% of porcine and 70% of poultry faecal specimens. Somatic
coliphages have been found to generally outnumber F-RNA phages in water environ-
ments by a factor of about 5 and cytopathogenic human viruses by a factor of about
500, although these ratios vary considerably. Sewage contains somatic coliphages in
numbers of the order of 106–108 per litre; in one study, slaughterhouse wastewater was
found to contain somatic coliphages in numbers up to 1010 per litre. There are indica-
tions that they may multiply in sewage, and somatic coliphages may multiply in nat­
ural water environments using saprophytic hosts. Somatic phages and F-RNA phages
have been detected in numbers up to 105 per litre in lake and river water.
Application in practice
Somatic coliphages are detectable by relatively simple and inexpensive plaque assays,
which yield results within 24 hours. Plaque assays for F-RNA coliphages are not quite

                                  11. MICROBIAL FACT SHEETS


as simple, because the culture of host bacteria has to be in the logarithmic growth
phase at a temperature above 30 °C to ensure that F-fimbriae are present. Plaque
assays using large petri dishes have been designed for the quantitative enumeration
of plaques in 100 ml samples, and presence/absence tests have been developed for
volumes of water of 500 ml or more.
Significance in drinking-water
As coliphages typically replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and warm-
blooded animals, their presence in drinking-water provides an indicator of faecal
pollution and hence the potential presence of enteric viruses and possibly also other
pathogens. The presence of coliphages in drinking-water also indicates shortcomings
in treatment and disinfection processes designed to remove enteric viruses. F-RNA
coliphages provide a more specific indicator for faecal pollution. The absence of coli-
phages from treated drinking-water supplies does not confirm the absence of patho-
gens such as enteric viruses and protozoan parasites.

Bacteroides fragilis phages
General description
The bacterial genus Bacteroides inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract in greater
numbers than E. coli. Faeces can contain 109–1010 Bacteroides per gram compared with
106–108 E. coli per gram. Bacteroides are rapidly inactivated by environmental oxygen
levels, but Bacteroides bacteriophages are resistant to unfavourable conditions. Two
groups of B. fragilis phages are used as indicators in water quality assessment. One is
a restricted group of phages that specifically uses B. fragilis strain HSP40 as host. This
group of phages appears unique, because it is found only in human faeces and not in
faeces of animals. The numbers of these phages in sewage appear to be relatively low,
and they are almost absent in some geographical areas. The B. fragilis HSP40 phages
belong to the family Siphoviridae, with flexible non-contractile tails, double-stranded
DNA and capsids with a diameter of up to 60 nm. The second group of Bacteroides
phages used as indicators is those that use B. fragilis strain RYC2056 as a host. This

                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


group includes a substantially wider spectrum of phages, occurring in the faeces of
humans and many animals. The numbers of these phages in sewage are generally sub-
stantially higher than those of B. fragilis HSP40 phages.

Indicator value
Bacteroides bacteriophages have been proposed as a possible indicator of faecal pollu-
tion as a result of their specific association with faecal material and exceptional resist­
ance to environmental conditions. In particular, B. fragilis HSP40 phages are found
only in human faeces. Bacteroides fragilis phage B40-8, a typical member of the group
of B. fragilis HSP40 phages, has been found to be more resistant to inactivation by
chlorine than poliovirus type 1, simian rotavirus SA11, coliphage f2, E. coli and Strepto-
coccus faecalis. Bacteroides fragilis strain RYC2056 phages seem to be likewise relatively
resistant to disinfection. Indicator shortcomings of B. fragilis phages include relatively
low numbers in sewage and polluted water environments. This applies in particular to
B. fragilis HSP40 phages. Human enteric viruses have been detected in drinking-water
supplies that yielded negative results in conventional tests for B. fragilis HSP40 phages.
Owing to the limitations of Bacteroides bacteriophages, they are best used in labora-
tory investigations, pilot trials and possibly validation testing.
Source and occurrence
Bacteroides fragilis HSP40 phages are excreted by about 10–20% of humans in certain
parts of the world; consequently, their numbers in sewage are substantially lower than
those of somatic and even F-RNA coliphages. A mean count of 67 B. fragilis HSP40
phages per litre in a sewage-polluted river has been reported. In some parts of the
world, B. fragilis HSP40 phages would appear not to be detectable in sewage at all.
Phages using B. fragilis RYC2056 as host are excreted in larger numbers and seem to
occur more universally. On average, these phages are excreted by more than 25% of
humans. In a survey of water environments, B. fragilis HSP40 phages have been found
to outnumber cytopathogenic enteric viruses on average by only about 5-fold. Theor­
etically, wastewaters could be expected to contain higher levels of B. fragilis phages
than those detected. The reason for the discrepancy may be due to failure in main-
taining sufficiently anaerobic conditions during the performance of plaque assays.
Improvement of detection methods may result in the recording of higher numbers of
B. fragilis phages in sewage and polluted water environments.

Application in practice
Disadvantages of B. fragilis phages are that the detection methods are more com-
plex and expensive than those for coliphages. Costs are increased by the need to use
antibiotics for purposes of selection and to incubate cultures and plaque assays under
absolute anaerobic conditions. Results of plaque assays are usually available after about
24 hours compared with about 8 hours for coliphages.
Significance in drinking-water
The presence of B. fragilis phages in drinking-water is sound evidence of faecal pol-
lution as well as shortcomings in water treatment and disinfection processes. In addi-
tion, the presence of B. fragilis HSP40 phages strongly indicates faecal pollution of

human origin. However, B. fragilis phages occur in relatively low numbers in sewage,
polluted water environments and drinking-water supplies. This implies that the ab-
sence of B. fragilis phages from treated drinking-water supplies does not confirm the
absence of pathogens such as enteric viruses and protozoan parasites.

Enteric viruses
General description
The viruses referred to here are a combined group of those that infect the human
gastrointestinal tract and are predominantly transmitted by the faecal–oral route.
Well‑known members of this group include the enteroviruses, astroviruses, enteric
adenoviruses, orthoreoviruses, rotaviruses, caliciviruses and hepatitis A and E
viruses. The enteric viruses cover a wide spectrum of viruses, members of which
are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Members of the group
of enteric viruses differ with regard to structure, composition, nucleic acid and
morphology. There are also differences in the numbers and frequency of excretion,
survival in the environment and resistance to water treatment processes. Enteric
viruses have robust capsids that enable them to survive unfavourable conditions in
the environment as well as allowing passage through the acidic and proteolytic con-
ditions in the stomach on their way to the duodenum, where they infect susceptible
epithelial cells.
Indicator value
The use of enteric viruses as indicator organisms is based on the shortcomings of the
existing choices. The survival of faecal bacteria in water environments and the sensi-
tivity to treatment and disinfection processes differ substantially from those of enteric
viruses. Monitoring based on one or more representatives of the large group of enteric
viruses themselves would therefore be more valuable for assessment of the presence of
any of the enteric viruses in water and the response to control measures.
Source and occurrence
Enteric viruses are excreted by individuals worldwide at a frequency and in numbers
that result in many of these viruses being universally present in substantial numbers

                                               305
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


in wastewater. However, the prevalence of individual members may vary to a large ex-
tent as a result of variations in rates of infection and excretion. Much higher numbers
would be present during outbreaks.

Application in practice
Practical methods are not yet available for the routine monitoring of water supplies
for a broad spectrum of enteric viruses. Viruses that are more readily detectable
include members of the enterovirus, adenovirus and orthoreovirus groups. These
viruses occur in polluted environments in relatively high numbers and can be
detected by reasonably practical and moderate-cost techniques based on cytopatho-
genic effect in cell culture that yield results within 3–12 days (depending on the
type of virus). In addition, progress in technology and expertise is decreasing costs.
The cost for the recovery of enteric viruses from large volumes of drinking-water
has been reduced extensively. Some techniques—for instance, those based on glass
wool adsorption–elution—are inexpensive. The cost of cell culture procedures has
also been reduced. Consequently, the cost of testing drinking-water supplies for
cytopathogenic viruses has become acceptable for certain purposes. Testing could
be used to validate the effectiveness of treatment processes and, in certain circum-
stances, as part of specific investigations to verify the performance of processes. The
incubation times, cost and relative complexity of testing mean that enteric virus
testing is not suitable for operational or verification (including surveillance) mon­
itoring. Orthoreoviruses, and at least the vaccine strains of polioviruses detected in
many water environments, also have the advantage of not constituting a health risk
to laboratory workers.

Significance in drinking-water
The presence of any enteric viruses in drinking-water should be regarded as an indica-
tor for the potential presence of other enteric viruses, is conclusive evidence of faecal
pollution and also provides evidence of shortcomings in water treatment and dis­
infection processes.

                           detection
Treatment performance      Conventional treatment processes do not remove acrylamide. Acrylamide
                           concentrations in drinking-water are usually controlled by limiting either
                           the acrylamide content of polyacrylamide flocculants or the dose used,
                           or both. Advances in analytical techniques are also beginning to allow
                           control by direct measurement (see background document).
Additional comments        Every effort should be made to limit free acrylamide monomer in
                           polyacrylamide used for water treatment, and water suppliers should
                           also make every effort to ensure that residual acrylamide in drinking-
                           water is kept as low as is technically feasible. In particular, if acrylamide is
                           controlled by limiting the amount dosed, overdosing should always be
                           avoided.

      Following ingestion, acrylamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
and widely distributed in body fluids. Acrylamide can cross the placenta. It is neuro-
toxic, affects germ cells and impairs reproductive function. In mutagenicity assays,
acrylamide was negative in the Ames test but induced gene mutations in mammalian
cells and chromosomal aberrations in vitro and in vivo. In a long-term carcinogenicity
study in rats exposed via drinking-water, acrylamide induced scrotal, thyroid and
adrenal tumours in males and mammary, thyroid and uterine tumours in females. The
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has placed acrylamide in Group
2A (probably carcinogenic to humans). The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee
on Food Additives (JECFA) has recently noted concerns regarding the carcinogenicity
and neurotoxicity of acrylamide and concluded that dietary exposure should be re-
duced to as low a level as technically achievable. Recent data have shown that expo-
sure to acrylamide from cooked food is much higher than previously thought. As it
is difficult to control the intake of acrylamide from food, it is very important that the
acrylamide content of polyacrylamide used as a coagulant aid in water treatment, the
most important source of drinking-water contamination by acrylamide, be as low as
possible and that polyacrylamide not be overdosed in an attempt to take a shortcut to
improving coagulation.

Alachlor
Alachlor (Chemical Abstracts Service [CAS] No. 15972-60-8) is a pre-emergence and
post-emergence herbicide used to control annual grasses and many broad-leaved weeds

in maize and a number of other crops. It is lost from soil mainly through volatilization,
photodegradation and biodegradation. Many alachlor degradation products have
been identified in soil. Alachlor was included in the Prior Informed Consent proced­
ure of the Rotterdam Convention on the basis of the final regulatory actions taken by
the European Community and by Canada to ban alachlor as a pesticide.

     On the basis of available experimental data, evidence for the genotoxicity of ala-
chlor is considered to be equivocal. However, a metabolite of alachlor, 2,6-diethylanil­
ine, has been shown to be mutagenic. Available data from two studies in rats clearly
indicate that alachlor is carcinogenic, causing benign and malignant tumours of the
nasal turbinate, malignant stomach tumours and benign thyroid tumours.

Aldicarb
Aldicarb (CAS No. 116-06-3) is a systemic pesticide used to control nematodes in soil
and insects and mites on a variety of crops. It is very soluble in water and highly mo-
bile in soil. It degrades mainly by biodegradation and hydrolysis, persisting for weeks
to months.

Additional comments             The guideline value derived from the 1992 assessment of the Joint
                                FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) was very similar to
                                the guideline value derived in the second edition, which was therefore
                                retained.

      Aldicarb is one of the most acutely toxic pesticides in use, although the only con-
sistently observed toxic effect with both long-term and single-dose administration is
acetylcholinesterase inhibition. It is converted to the sulfoxide and sulfone. Aldicarb
sulfoxide is a more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase than aldicarb itself, where-
as aldicarb sulfone is considerably less toxic than either aldicarb or the sulfoxide. The
weight of evidence indicates that aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone are
not genotoxic or carcinogenic. IARC has concluded that aldicarb is not classifiable as
to its carcinogenicity (Group 3).

Aldrin and dieldrin
Aldrin (CAS No. 309-00-2) and dieldrin (CAS No. 60-57-1) are chlorinated pesti-
cides that are used against soil-dwelling pests, for wood protection and, in the case
of dieldrin, against insects of public health importance. Since the early 1970s, many
countries have either severely restricted or banned the use of both compounds, par-
ticularly in agriculture. The two compounds are closely related with respect to their
toxicology and mode of action. Aldrin is rapidly converted to dieldrin under most
environmental conditions and in the body. Dieldrin is a highly persistent organo-
chlorine compound that has low mobility in soil, can be lost to the atmosphere and
bioaccumulates. Dietary exposure to aldrin/dieldrin is very low and decreasing.


Guideline value               Aldrin and dieldrin (combined): 0.000 03 mg/l (0.03 µg/l)
Occurrence                    Seldom detected in drinking water; concentrations of aldrin and
                              dieldrin in drinking-water normally less than 0.01 µg/l; rarely present in
                              groundwater
Provisional tolerable daily   0.1 µg/kg body weight (combined total for aldrin and dieldrin), based on
intake (PTDI)                 no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) of 1 mg/kg diet in the dog
                              and 0.5 mg/kg diet in the rat, which are equivalent to 0.025 mg/kg body
                              weight per day in both species, and applying an uncertainty factor of 250
                              based on concern about carcinogenicity observed in mice
Limit of detection            0.003 µg/l for aldrin and 0.002 µg/l for dieldrin by GC with electron

Treatment performance         0.02 µg/l should be achievable using coagulation, GAC or ozonation
Guideline value derivation
•  allocation to water     1% of PTDI (In view of the reduction in exposure from food this value is
                           probably very conservative.)

Additional comments           Aldrin and dieldrin are listed under the Stockholm Convention on
                              Persistent Organic Pollutants. Hence, monitoring may occur in addition to
                              that required by drinking-water guidelines.

     Both compounds are highly toxic in experimental animals, and cases of poison-
ing in humans have occurred. Aldrin and dieldrin have more than one mechanism of
toxicity. The target organs are the central nervous system and the liver. In long-term
studies, dieldrin was shown to produce liver tumours in both sexes of two strains of
mice. It did not produce an increase in tumours in rats and does not appear to be
genotoxic. IARC has classified aldrin and dieldrin in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its
carcinogenicity to humans). Exposure through food has decreased significantly with
the dramatic reduction in use.

Aluminium
Aluminium is the most abundant metallic element and constitutes about 8% of
Earth’s crust. Aluminium salts are widely used in water treatment as coagulants to
reduce organic matter, colour, turbidity and microorganism levels. Such use may lead
to increased concentrations of aluminium in finished water. Where residual concen-
trations are high, undesirable colour and turbidity may ensue. Concentrations of
aluminium at which such problems may occur are highly dependent on a number of
water quality parameters and operational factors at the water treatment plant. Alum­
inium intake from foods, particularly those containing aluminium compounds used
as food additives, represents the major route of aluminium exposure for the general
public. The contribution of drinking-water to the total oral exposure to aluminium
is usually less than 5% of the total intake.

Reason for not establishing    A health-based value of 0.9 mg/l could be derived from the JECFA
a guideline value              provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), but this value exceeds
                               practicable levels based on optimization of the coagulation process in
                               drinking-water plants using aluminium-based coagulants: 0.1 mg/l or less
                               in large water treatment facilities and 0.2 mg/l or less in small facilities

     There is little indication that orally ingested aluminium is acutely toxic to humans
despite the widespread occurrence of the element in foods, drinking-water and many
antacid preparations. It has been hypothesized that aluminium exposure is a risk fac-
tor for the development or acceleration of onset of Alzheimer disease in humans. The
1997 WHO Environmental Health Criteria document for aluminium concludes that:


                                                   311
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


    On the whole, the positive relationship between aluminium in drinking-water and AD
    [Alzheimer disease], which was demonstrated in several epidemiological studies, cannot
    be totally dismissed. However, strong reservations about inferring a causal relationship are
    warranted in view of the failure of these studies to account for demonstrated confounding
    factors and for total aluminium intake from all sources.
        Taken together, the relative risks for AD from exposure to aluminium in drinking-water
    above 100 µg/l, as determined in these studies, are low (less than 2.0). But, because the risk
    estimates are imprecise for a variety of methodological reasons, a population-attributable
    risk cannot be calculated with precision. Such imprecise predictions may, however, be use-
    ful in making decisions about the need to control exposures to aluminium in the general
    population.

    In 2007, JECFA developed a PTWI for aluminium from all sources of 1 mg/kg
body weight. JECFA concluded the following:
    … the available studies have many limitations and are not adequate for defining the dose–
    response relationships. The Committee therefore based its evaluation on the combined
    evidence from several studies. The relevance of studies involving administration of alu-
    minium compounds by gavage was unclear because the toxicokinetics after gavage were
    expected to differ from toxicokinetics after dietary administration, and the gavage studies
    generally did not report total aluminium exposure including basal levels in the feed. The
    studies conducted with dietary administration of aluminium compounds were considered
    most appropriate for the evaluation. The lowest LOELs [lowest-observed-effect levels] for
    aluminium in a range of different dietary studies in mice, rats and dogs were in the region
    of 50–75 mg/kg bw [body weight] per day expressed as Al.
        The Committee applied an uncertainty factor of 100 to the lower end of this range of
    LOELs (50 mg/kg bw per day expressed as Al) to allow for inter- and intraspecies differen­
    ces. There are deficiencies in the database, notably the absence of NOELs [no-observed-
    effect levels] in the majority of the studies evaluated and the absence of long-term studies
    on the relevant toxicological end-points. The deficiencies are counterbalanced by the
    probable lower bioavailability of the less soluble aluminium species present in food.
    Overall, an additional uncertainty factor of three was considered to be appropriate. The
    Committee confirmed that the resulting health-based guidance value should be expressed
    as a PTWI, because of the potential for bioaccumulation. The Committee established a
    PTWI of 1 mg/kg bw for Al, which applies to all aluminium compounds in food, includ-
    ing additives.

     A health-based value derived from the JECFA PTWI would be 0.9 mg/l (rounded
value), based on an allocation of 20% of the PTWI to drinking-water and assuming
a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day. However, there remain uncertainties
as to the extent of aluminium absorption from drinking-water, which depends on a
number of parameters, such as the aluminium salt administered, pH (for aluminium
speciation and solubility), bioavailability and dietary factors.
     The beneficial effects of the use of aluminium as a coagulant in water treatment
are recognized. Taking this into account, and considering the health concerns about
aluminium (i.e. its potential neurotoxicity), a practicable level is derived, based on
optimization of the coagulation process in drinking-water plants using aluminium-
based coagulants, to minimize aluminium levels in finished water.

      Several approaches are available for minimizing residual aluminium concen-
trations in treated water. These include use of optimum pH in the coagulation pro-
cess, avoiding excessive aluminium dosage, good mixing at the point of application
of the coagulant, optimum paddle speeds for flocculation and efficient filtration of
the aluminium floc. Under good operating conditions, concentrations of aluminium
of 0.1 mg/l or less are achievable in large water treatment facilities. Small facilities
(e.g. those serving fewer than 10 000 people) might experience some difficulties in
attaining this level, because the small size of the plant provides little buffering for fluc-
tuation in operation; moreover, such facilities often have limited resources and limited
access to the expertise needed to solve specific operational problems. For these small
facilities, 0.2 mg/l or less is a practicable level for aluminium in finished water.
      As indicated above, a health-based value derived from the JECFA PTWI would
be 0.9 mg/l (rounded value) based on an allocation of 20% of the PTWI to drinking-
water and assuming a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day. However, as also
noted above, practicable levels based on optimization of the coagulation process in
drinking-water plants using aluminium-based coagulants are less than 0.1 mg/l in
large water treatment facilities and less than 0.2 mg/l in small facilities. In view of the
importance of optimizing coagulation to prevent microbial contamination and the
need to minimize deposition of aluminium floc in distribution systems, it is important
to ensure that average residuals do not exceed these values.

Ammonia
The term ammonia includes the non-ionized (NH3) and ionized (NH4+) species.
Ammonia in the environment originates from metabolic, agricultural and industrial
processes and from disinfection with chloramine. Natural levels in groundwater and sur-
face water are usually below 0.2 mg/l. Anaerobic groundwaters may contain up to 3 mg/l.
Intensive rearing of farm animals can give rise to much higher levels in surface water.
Ammonia contamination can also arise from cement mortar pipe linings. Ammonia in
water is an indicator of possible bacterial, sewage and animal waste pollution.

Assessment date             1993
Principal reference         WHO (2003) Ammonia in drinking-water


     Ammonia is a major component of the metabolism of mammals. Exposure from
environmental sources is insignificant in comparison with endogenous synthesis of
ammonia. Toxicological effects are observed only at exposures above about 200 mg/kg
body weight.
     Ammonia in drinking-water is not of immediate health relevance, and therefore
no health-based guideline value is proposed. However, ammonia can compromise
disinfection efficiency, result in nitrite formation in distribution systems, cause the
failure of filters for the removal of manganese and cause taste and odour problems
(see also chapter 10).

Antimony
Elemental antimony forms very hard alloys with copper, lead and tin. Antimony com-
pounds have various therapeutic uses. Antimony is used in solders as a replacement
for lead, but there is little evidence of any significant contribution to drinking-water
concentrations from this source. Total exposure from environmental sources, food
and drinking-water is very low compared with occupational exposure.

                             to be less than 5 µg/l

                             interspecies and intraspecies variation, 10 for the short duration of the

Treatment performance        Conventional treatment processes do not remove antimony. However,
                             antimony is not normally a raw water contaminant. As the most common
                             source of antimony in drinking-water appears to be dissolution from
                             metal plumbing and fittings, control of antimony from such sources
                             would be by product control.

      There has been a significant increase in the toxicity data available since the previ-
ous review, although much of it pertains to the intraperitoneal route of exposure. The
form of antimony in drinking-water is a key determinant of the toxicity, and it would
appear that antimony leached from antimony-containing materials would be in the
form of the antimony(V) oxo-anion, which is the less toxic form. The subchronic tox-
icity of antimony trioxide is lower than that of potassium antimony tartrate, which is
the most soluble form. Antimony trioxide, owing to its low bioavailability, is genotoxic
only in some in vitro tests, but not in vivo, whereas soluble antimony(III) salts exert
genotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Animal experiments from which the carcino-
genic potential of soluble or insoluble antimony compounds may be quantified are
not available. IARC has concluded that antimony trioxide is possibly carcinogenic to
humans (Group 2B) on the basis of an inhalation study in rats, but that antimony
trisulfide was not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3). However,


                                                   314
                                           12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


chronic oral uptake of potassium antimony tartrate may not be associated with an
additional carcinogenic risk, as antimony after inhalation exposure was carcinogenic
only in the lung but not in other organs and is known to cause direct lung damage fol-
lowing chronic inhalation as a consequence of overload with insoluble particulates. Al-
though there is some evidence for the carcinogenicity of certain antimony compounds
by inhalation, there are no data to indicate carcinogenicity by the oral route.

Arsenic1
Arsenic is found widely in Earth’s crust in oxidation states of –3, 0, +3 and +5, often as
sulfides or metal arsenides or arsenates. In water, it is mostly present as arsenate (+5),
but in anaerobic conditions, it is likely to be present as arsenite (+3). It is usually present
in natural waters at concentrations of less than 1–2 µg/l. However, in waters, particu-
larly groundwaters, where there are sulfide mineral deposits and sedimentary deposits
deriving from volcanic rocks, the concentrations can be significantly elevated.
     Arsenic is found in the diet, particularly in fish and shellfish, in which it is found
mainly in the less toxic organic form. There are only limited data on the proportion of
inorganic arsenic in food, but these indicate that approximately 25% is present in the
inorganic form, depending on the type of food. Apart from occupational exposure,
the most important routes of exposure are through food and drinking-water, includ-
ing beverages that are made from drinking-water. Where the concentration of arsenic
in drinking-water is 10 µg/l or greater, this will be the dominant source of intake. In
circumstances where soups or similar dishes are a staple part of the diet, the drinking-
water contribution through preparation of food will be even greater.

Provisional guideline value 0.01 mg/l (10 µg/l)
                                 The guideline value is designated as provisional on the basis of
                                 treatment performance and analytical achievability.
Occurrence                       Levels in natural waters generally range between 1 and 2 µg/l, although
                                 concentrations may be elevated (up to 12 mg/l) in areas containing natural
                                 sources
Basis of guideline value         There remains considerable uncertainty over the actual risks at low
derivation                       concentrations, and available data on mode of action do not provide a
                                 biological basis for using either linear or non-linear extrapolation. In view
                                 of the practical difficulties in removing arsenic from drinking-water, as
                                 well as the practical quantification limit in the region of 1–10 µg/l, the
                                 guideline value of 10 µg/l is retained and designated as provisional.
Limit of detection               0.1 µg/l by ICP-MS; 2 µg/l by hydride generation AAS or flame AAS
Treatment performance            It is technically feasible to achieve arsenic concentrations of 5 µg/l or
                                 lower using any of several possible treatment methods. However, this
                                 requires careful process optimization and control, and a more reasonable
                                 expectation is that 10 µg/l should be achievable by conventional
                                 treatment (e.g. coagulation).

      Both pentavalent and trivalent soluble arsenic compounds are rapidly and ex-
tensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolism is characterized by
1) reduction of pentavalent to trivalent arsenic and 2) oxidative methylation of tri-
valent arsenic to form monomethylated, dimethylated and trimethylated products.
Methylation of inorganic arsenic facilitates the excretion of inorganic arsenic from
the body, as the end-products monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid are
readily excreted in urine. There are major qualitative and quantitative interspecies
differences in methylation, but in humans and most common laboratory animals, in-
organic arsenic is extensively methylated, and the metabolites are excreted primarily
in the urine. There is large interindividual variation in arsenic methylation in humans,
probably due to a wide difference in the activity of methyltransferases and possible
polymorphism. Ingested organoarsenicals are much less extensively metabolized and
more rapidly eliminated in urine than inorganic arsenic.
      Arsenic has not been demonstrated to be essential in humans. The acute toxicity
of arsenic compounds in humans is predominantly a function of their rate of removal
from the body. Arsine is considered to be the most toxic form, followed by the arsen­
ites, the arsenates and organic arsenic compounds. Acute arsenic intoxication associ-
ated with the ingestion of well water containing very high concentrations (21.0 mg/l)
of arsenic has been reported.
      Signs of chronic arsenicism, including dermal lesions such as hyperpigmentation
and hypo¬pigmentation, peripheral neuropathy, skin cancer, bladder and lung cancers
and peripheral vascular disease, have been observed in populations ingesting arsen­
ic-contaminated drinking-water. Dermal lesions were the most commonly observed
symptom, occurring after minimum exposure periods of approximately 5 years. Effects
on the cardiovascular system were observed in children consuming arsenic-contamin­
ated water (mean concentration 0.6 mg/l) for an average of 7 years.
      Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the risk of cancers associated
with arsenic ingestion through drinking-water. Many are ecological-type studies, and
many suffer from methodological flaws, particularly in the measurement of expos­
ure. However, there is overwhelming evidence that consumption of elevated levels
of arsenic through drinking-water is causally related to the development of cancer at
several sites. Nevertheless, there remain considerable uncertainty and controversy over
both the mechanism of carcinogenicity and the shape of the dose–response curve at
low intakes. The International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) concluded that
long-term exposure to arsenic in drinking-water is causally related to increased risks
of cancer in the skin, lungs, bladder and kidney, as well as other skin changes, such


                                           316
                                 12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


as hyperkeratosis and pigmentation changes. These effects have been demonstrated
in many studies using different study designs. Exposure–response relationships and
high risks have been observed for each of these end-points. The effects have been most
thoroughly studied in Taiwan, China, but there is considerable evidence from studies
on populations in other countries as well. Increased risks of lung and bladder cancer
and of arsenic-associated skin lesions have been reported to be associated with inges-
tion of drinking-water at concentrations below 50 µg of arsenic per litre. There is a
need for more analytical epidemiological studies to determine the dose–time response
for skin lesions, as well as cancer, in order to assist in developing suitable interventions
and determining practical intervention policies.
     Inorganic arsenic compounds are classified by IARC in Group 1 (carcinogenic to
humans) on the basis of sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in humans and lim-
ited evidence for carcinogenicity in animals. Although there is a substantial database
on the association between both internal and skin cancers and the consumption of
arsenic in drinking-water, there remains considerable uncertainty over the actual risks
at low concentrations. In its updated evaluation, the United States National Research
Council concluded that “the available mode-of-action data on arsenic do not provide
a biological basis for using either a linear or nonlinear extrapolation”. The maximum
likelihood estimates, using a linear extrapolation, for bladder and lung cancer for
populations in the United States of America (USA) exposed to arsenic at concentra-
tions of 10 µg/l in drinking-water are, respectively, 12 and 18 per 10 000 population
for females and 23 and 14 per 10 000 population for males. The actual numbers indi-
cated by these estimated risks would be very difficult to detect by current epidemio-
logical methods. There is also uncertainty over the contribution of arsenic in food—a
higher intake of inorganic arsenic from food would lead to a lower risk estimate for
water—and the impact of factors such as variation in the metabolism of arsenic and
nutritional status. Some studies in areas with arsenic concentrations somewhat above
50 µg/l have not detected arsenic-related adverse effects in the residents. It remains
possible that the estimates of cancer risk associated with various arsenic intakes are
overestimates. The concentration of arsenic in drinking-water below which no effects
can be observed remains to be determined, and there is an urgent need for identifica-
tion of the mechanism by which arsenic causes cancer, which appears to be the most
sensitive toxicity end-point.
     The practical quantification limit for arsenic is in the region of 1–10 µg/l, and re-
moval of arsenic to concentrations below 10 µg/l is difficult in many circumstances. In
view of the practical difficulties in removing arsenic from drinking-water, particularly
from small supplies, and the practical quantification limit for arsenic, the guideline
value of 10 µg/l is retained as a goal and designated as provisional.
     The provisional guideline value of 10 µg/l was previously supported by a JECFA
PTWI of 15 µg/kg body weight, assuming an allocation of 20% to drinking-water.
However, JECFA recently re-evaluated arsenic and concluded that the existing PTWI
was very close to the lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose for a 0.5% re-
sponse (BMDL0.5) calculated from epidemiological studies and was therefore no long­
er appropriate. The PTWI was therefore withdrawn. Nevertheless, given that, in many
countries, even the provisional guideline value may not be attainable, it is retained on

the basis of treatment performance and analytical achievability with the proviso that
every effort should be made to keep concentrations as low as reasonably possible.

Practical considerations
A silver diethyldithiocarbamate spectrophotometric method (ISO 6595:1982)
is available for the determination of arsenic; the detection limit is about 1 µg/l.
Graphite furnace AAS, hydride generation AAS and ICP-MS are more sensitive.
HPLC in combination with ICP-MS can also be used to determine various arsenic
species.
     It is technically feasible to achieve arsenic concentrations of 5 µg/l or lower using
any of several possible treatment methods. However, this requires careful process opti-
mization and control, and a more reasonable expectation is that 10 µg/l should be
achievable by conventional treatment (e.g. coagulation). For local non-piped water
supplies, the first option is often substitution by, or dilution with, microbially safe
low-arsenic sources. It may also be appropriate to use alternative sources for drinking
and cooking but to use the contaminated sources for purposes such as washing and
laundry. There are also an increasing number of effective small-scale treatment tech-
niques, usually based around coagulation and precipitation or adsorption, available at
relatively low cost for removal of arsenic from small supplies.

Asbestos
Asbestos is introduced into water by the dissolution of asbestos-containing minerals
and ores as well as from industrial effluents, atmospheric pollution and asbestos-cement
pipes in the distribution system. Exfoliation of asbestos fibres from asbestos-cement
pipes is related to the aggressiveness of the water supply. Limited data indicate that
exposure to airborne asbestos released from tap water during showers or humidification
is negligible.

Assessment date               1993
Principal reference           WHO (2003) Asbestos in drinking-water


     Asbestos is a known human carcinogen by the inhalation route. Although it has
been well studied, there is little convincing evidence of the carcinogenicity of ingested
asbestos in epidemiological studies of populations with drinking-water supplies con-
taining high concentrations of asbestos. Moreover, in extensive studies in experimental
animal species, asbestos has not consistently increased the incidence of tumours of the
gastrointestinal tract. There is therefore no consistent evidence that ingested asbestos
is hazardous to health, and thus it is concluded that there is no need to establish a
health-based guideline value for asbestos in drinking-water. The primary issue sur-
rounding asbestos-cement pipes is for people working on the outside of the pipes (e.g.
cutting pipe), because of the risk of inhalation of asbestos dust.

Atrazine and its metabolites
Atrazine is a selective systemic herbicide of the chlorotriazine class, used for the control
of annual broadleaf and grassy weeds. Atrazine and its chloro-s-triazine metabolites—
deethyl-atrazine, deisopropyl-atrazine and diaminochlorotriazine—have been found
in surface water and groundwater as a result of the use of atrazine as a pre-emergent
or early post-emergent herbicide. The metabolite hydroxyatrazine is more commonly
detected in groundwater than in surface water.

Guideline values            Atrazine and its chloro-s-triazine metabolites: 0.1 mg/l (100 µg/l)

Additional comments         JMPR considered that the NOAEL for atrazine is protective for the
                            consequences of neuroendocrine and other adverse effects caused by
                            prolonged exposure to atrazine and its chloro-s-triazine metabolites.
                            JMPR was not able to assess the source allocation of atrazine to drinking-
                            water. As such, the default 20% allocation was chosen, as it will be very

      JMPR agreed that it is unlikely that atrazine is genotoxic and concluded that
atrazine is not likely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans, as the mode of carcino-
genic action in certain susceptible rat strains is not relevant for human risk assess-
ment. The weight of evidence from the epidemiological studies also did not support
a causal association between exposure to atrazine and the occurrence of cancer in
humans.
      In special studies of reproductive toxicity, exposure of rats during early pregnancy
(i.e. the luteinizing hormone–dependent period) caused increased pre-implantation
or post-implantation losses, including full-litter resorptions. Attenuation of the lutein-
izing hormone surge and subsequent disruption of the estrous cycle (characterized
by an increase in days in estrus) were observed at and above 3.65 mg/kg body weight
per day, with a NOAEL of 1.8 mg/kg body weight per day. The effects on the lutein-
izing hormone surge and disruption of the estrous cycle were further supported by a
number of short-term mechanistic studies. Additional experiments suggested that the
effects of atrazine on luteinizing hormone and prolactin secretion are mediated via a
hypothalamic site of action. JMPR concluded that atrazine was not teratogenic.
      Studies using a variety of test systems in vitro and in vivo indicated that modulat­
ion of the immune system occurs after exposure to atrazine. However, effects sugges-
tive of impaired function of the immune system were observed only at doses greater
than those shown to affect neuroendocrine function, leading to disruption of the
estrous cycle or developmental effects.
      The toxicity profiles and mode of action of the chloro-s-triazine metabolites
are similar to those of atrazine; the potency of these metabolites with regard to their
neuroendocrine-disrupting properties appeared to be similar to that of the parent
compound.
      The metabolite hydroxyatrazine does not have the same mode of action or
toxicity profile as atrazine and its chloro-s-triazine metabolites. The main effect of
hydroxyatrazine was kidney toxicity (owing to its low solubility in water, resulting
in crystal formation and a subsequent inflammatory response), and there was no
evidence that hydroxyatrazine has neuroendocrine-disrupting properties. There was
no evidence of carcinogenicity, and hydroxyatrazine did not show genotoxicity in an
adequate range of tests in vitro and in vivo.

Barium
Barium compounds are present in nature as ore deposits and in igneous and sedimen-
tary rocks, and are used in a variety of industrial applications. Barium in water comes
primarily from natural sources, although barium also enters the environment from
industrial emissions and anthropogenic uses. Food is the primary source of intake for
the non-occupationally exposed population. However, where barium concentrations
in water are high, drinking-water may contribute significantly to total intake.

Guideline value         1.3 mg/l (1300 µg/l)
Occurrence              Concentrations in drinking-water are generally below 100 µg/l, although
                        concentrations above 1 mg/l have been measured in drinking-water

•  weight                  60 kg adult

Additional comments        As rounding can have significant practical implications at milligram per
                           litre levels, it was concluded that a guideline value with two significant
                           figures was reasonable in this case.
                           The guideline value derived based on the long-term mouse study is not
                           inconsistent with health-based values that could be derived from limited
                           human studies.

     There is no evidence that barium is carcinogenic or genotoxic. Acute hyperten-
sion has been observed in case reports, but the effects may be secondary to hypokalae-
mia. The critical study that had been identified previously for deriving the guideline
value has several limitations (e.g. no effect observed at the single dose evaluated, limi-
tations in the exposure methodology and design, no control for important risk factors
for hypertension). Another human study that reported no effects on hypertension at
10 mg/l is limited by the small study size and short exposure duration. Barium has
been shown to cause nephropathy in laboratory animals, and this was selected as the
toxicological end-point of concern for the current guideline.

Bentazone
Bentazone (CAS No. 25057-89-0) is a post-emergence herbicide used for selective
control of broadleaf weeds and sedges occurring among a variety of crops. It is highly
soluble in water and very resistant to hydrolysis; it is also very mobile in soil. However,
photodegradation occurs in both soil and water. Bentazone may leach from soil into
groundwater, particularly during heavy rainfall, and may contaminate surface water
through effluents from production plants, drainage waters and actual use in the water
(rice fields). Exposure from food is likely to be low.

     Bentazone is not carcinogenic in rats or mice, and showed no evidence of geno-
toxicity in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. Consistent observations in repeated-
dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs are effects on haematology and blood
coagulation (e.g. prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time).

Benzene
Benzene is used principally in the production of other organic chemicals. It is present
in petrol, and vehicular emissions constitute the main source of benzene in the environ-
ment. Benzene may be introduced into water by industrial effluents and atmospheric
pollution.

                           epidemiological studies involving inhalation exposure, which formed the basis
                           for the previous guideline value. The previous guideline value is therefore
                           retained.

     Acute exposure of humans to high concentrations of benzene primarily affects
the central nervous system. At lower concentrations, benzene is toxic to the haemato-
poietic system, causing a continuum of haematological changes, including leukaemia.
Because benzene is carcinogenic to humans, IARC has classified it in Group 1. Haema-
tological abnormalities similar to those observed in humans have been observed in ex-
perimental animal species exposed to benzene. In animal studies, benzene was shown
to be carcinogenic following both inhalation and ingestion. It induced several types of
tumours in both rats and mice in a 2-year carcinogenesis bioassay by gavage in corn
oil. Benzene has not been found to be mutagenic in bacterial assays, but it has been
shown to cause chromosomal aberrations in vivo in a number of species, including
humans, and to be positive in the mouse micronucleus test.

Beryllium
The primary source of beryllium compounds in water appears to be release from coal
burning and other industries using beryllium. Other sources of beryllium in surface
water include deposition of atmospheric beryllium and weathering of rocks and soils

containing beryllium. Beryllium is not likely to be found in natural water above trace
levels as a result of the insolubility of beryllium oxides and hydroxides in the normal
pH range.

      As beryllium is rarely, if ever, found in drinking-water at concentrations of
concern, it is not considered necessary to set a formal guideline value.
      A health-based value for beryllium in drinking-water of 12 µg/l can be calculated
based on an allocation of 20% of the TDI of 2 µg/kg body weight, derived from a long-
term study in which dogs exhibited lesions of the small intestine, to drinking-water
and assuming a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day. This allocation is prob-
ably conservative, as the limited data on food indicate that exposure from this source
is likely to be well below the TDI.
      Although beryllium appears to be found in drinking-water sources and drinking-
water at low concentrations, the database on occurrence is limited, and there may be
specific circumstances in which concentrations can be elevated due to natural sources
where the pH is either below 5 or above 8 or there is high turbidity.
Boron
Boron compounds are used in the manufacture of glass, soaps and detergents and
as flame retardants. Naturally occurring boron is present in groundwater primarily
as a result of leaching from rocks and soils containing borates and borosilicates. The
borate content of surface water can be increased as a result of wastewater discharges,
but this use has decreased significantly, and levels of boron in wastewater discharges
continue to fall.

Guideline value            2.4 mg/l (2400 µg/l)
Occurrence                 Concentrations vary widely and depend on the surrounding geology and
                           wastewater discharges; for most of the world, the concentration of boron
                           in drinking-water is judged to be below 0.5 mg/l
TDI                        0.17 mg/kg body weight, based on a BMDL 05 of 10.3 mg/kg body weight
                           per day for developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight in rats)
                           and an uncertainty factor of 60 (10 for interspecies variation and 6 for
                           intraspecies variation)
Limit of detection         0.15 µg/l by ICP-MS; 6–10 µg/l by ICP–atomic emission spectrometry (AES)
Treatment performance      Conventional water treatment (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration)
                           does not significantly remove boron, and special methods need to be
                           used in order to remove boron from waters with high boron concentra‑
                           tions. Ion exchange and reverse osmosis processes may enable substantial
                           reduction but are likely to be prohibitively expensive. Blending with
                           low-boron supplies may be the only economical method to reduce boron
                           concentrations in waters where these concentrations are high.

     Short- and long-term oral exposures to boric acid or borax in laboratory animals
have demonstrated that the male reproductive tract is a consistent target of toxicity.
Testicular lesions have been observed in rats, mice and dogs given boric acid or borax
in food or drinking-water. Developmental toxicity has been demonstrated experi-
mentally in rats, mice and rabbits. Negative results in a large number of mutagenicity
assays indicate that boric acid and borax are not genotoxic. In long-term studies in
mice and rats, boric acid and borax caused no increase in tumour incidence.

Bromate
Sodium and potassium bromate are powerful oxidizers used mainly in permanent
wave neutralizing solutions and the dyeing of textiles using sulfur dyes. Potassium
bromate has also been used as an oxidizer to mature flour during milling, in treating
barley in beer making and in fish paste products, although JECFA has concluded that
the use of potassium bromate in food processing is not appropriate. Bromate is not
normally found in water, but can occur as a result of pollution from industrial sources,
sometimes as a consequence of its presence in contaminated soil. However, the main
source in drinking-water is its formation during ozonation when the bromide ion is
present in water. Bromate may also be formed in hypochlorite solutions produced by
electrolysis of bromide-containing salt.

Provisional guideline      0.01 mg/l (10 µg/l)
value                      The guideline value is provisional because of limitations in available

                           characteristics after ozonation at concentrations ranging from less than 2
                           to 293 µg/l, depending on bromide ion concentration, ozone dosage, pH,
                           alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon; can also be formed in the electro‑
                           lytic generation of chlorine and hypochlorite from brine with a high level of

                           upper-bound excess cancer risk of 10−5. A similar conclusion may be reached
                           through several other methods of extrapolation, leading to values in the

Treatment performance Bromate is difficult to remove once formed. By appropriate control of

     IARC has concluded that although there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity
in humans, there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of bromate from
high-dose studies in experimental animals; IARC has classified bromate in Group 2B
(possibly carcinogenic to humans). Bromate is mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo. At
this time, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude as to the mode of carcinogenic
action for bromate. Observation of tumours at a relatively early time and the positive
response of bromate in a variety of genotoxicity assays suggest that the predominant
mode of action at low doses is due to oxidative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) dam-
age. Although there is evidence to suggest that the DNA reactivity in kidney tumours
may have a non-linear dose–response relationship, there is no evidence to suggest that
this same dose–response relationship operates in the development of mesotheliomas
or thyroid tumours. Oxidative stress may play a role in the formation of kidney tu-
mours, but the evidence is insufficient to establish lipid peroxidation and free radical
production as key events responsible for the induction of kidney tumours. However,
emerging evidence points to rapid decomposition of bromate in the gastrointestinal
tract, blood and liver, which supports a non-linear dose–response relationship at low
doses.

Bromide
Bromide is commonly found in nature along with sodium chloride, owing to their
similar physical and chemical properties, but in smaller quantities. Bromide concen-
trations in seawater range from 65 mg/l to well over 80 mg/l, in fresh water from trace
amounts to about 0.5 mg/l and in desalinated waters up to 1 mg/l.

     Inorganic bromide was evaluated in 1966 by JMPR, which recommended an ADI
of 0–1 mg/kg body weight, based on a minimum pharmacologically effective dosage
in humans of about 900 mg of potassium bromide, equivalent to 600 mg of bromide

females) of 4 mg/kg body weight per day, giving an ADI of 0–0.4 mg/kg body weight,
including a safety factor of 10 for population diversity.
      The upper limit of the ADI of 0–0.4 mg/kg body weight yields an acceptable total
daily intake of 24 mg/person for a 60 kg person. Assuming a relative source contribu-
tion of 50%, the drinking-water value for a 60 kg adult consuming 2 litres/day would
be up to 6 mg/l; for a 10 kg child consuming 1 litre/day, the value would be up to
2 mg/l. However, the dietary bromide contribution for a 10 kg child would probably
be less than that for an adult. These are reasonably conservative values, and they are
unlikely to be encountered in drinking-water supplies.
      Bromide can be involved in the reaction between chlorine and naturally occur-
ring organic matter in drinking-water, forming brominated and mixed chloro-bromo
by-products, such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and halogenated acetic acids (HAAs),
or it can react with ozone to form bromate. The levels of bromide that can result in the
formation of these substances are well below the health-based values suggested above.
This guidance applies specifically to inorganic bromide ion and not to bromate or
organohalogen compounds, for which individual health-based guideline values have
been developed.

Brominated acetic acids
Brominated acetic acids are formed during disinfection of water that contains bro-
mide ions and organic matter. Bromide ions occur naturally in surface water and
groundwater and exhibit seasonal fluctuations in levels. Bromide ion levels can in-
crease as a result of either saltwater intrusion resulting from drought conditions or
pollution. Brominated acetates are generally present in surface water and groundwater
distribution systems at mean concentrations below 5 µg/l.

     The database for dibromoacetic acid is considered inadequate for the derivation
of a guideline value. There are no systemic toxicity studies of subchronic duration or
longer. The database also lacks suitable toxicokinetic studies, a carcinogenicity study, a
developmental study in a second species and a multigeneration reproductive toxicity
study. Available mutagenicity data suggest that dibromoacetate is genotoxic.
     Data are also limited on the oral toxicity of monobromoacetic acid and bromo­
chloroacetic acid. Limited mutagenicity and genotoxicity data give mixed results for
monobromoacetic acid and generally positive results for bromochloroacetic acid. Data
gaps include subchronic or chronic toxicity studies, multigeneration reproductive
toxicity studies, standard developmental toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies.
The available data are considered inadequate to establish guideline values for these
chemicals.

Cadmium
Cadmium metal is used in the steel industry and in plastics. Cadmium compounds
are widely used in batteries. Cadmium is released to the environment in wastewater,
and diffuse pollution is caused by contamination from fertilizers and local air pollu-
tion. Contamination in drinking-water may also be caused by impurities in the zinc
of galvanized pipes and solders and some metal fittings. Food is the main source of
daily exposure to cadmium. The daily oral intake is 10–35 µg. Smoking is a significant
additional source of cadmium exposure.

Additional comments        Although new information indicates that a proportion of the general
                           population may be at increased risk for tubular dysfunction when
                           exposed at the current PTMI, the risk estimates that can be made at
                           present are imprecise.
                           It is recognized that the margin between the PTMI and the actual monthly
                           intake of cadmium by the general population is small and that this
                           margin may be even smaller in smokers.

     Absorption of cadmium compounds is dependent on the solubility of the com-
pounds. Cadmium accumulates primarily in the kidneys and has a long biological
half-life in humans of 10–35 years. There is evidence that cadmium is carcinogenic by
the inhalation route, and IARC has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds in
Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans). However, there is no evidence of car-
cinogenicity by the oral route and no clear evidence for the genotoxicity of cadmium.
The kidney is the main target organ for cadmium toxicity.
     In its recent evaluation of cadmium, JECFA found that data relating excretion of
the biomarker β2-microglobulin in urine to cadmium excretion in urine for individ­
uals who are 50 years of age and older provided the most reliable basis on which to
determine a critical concentration of cadmium in the urine. Urinary excretion of less

than 5.24 µg of cadmium per gram creatinine was not associated with an increased
excretion of β2-microglobulin, and the dietary exposure that would result in a urinary
cadmium concentration at the breakpoint of 5.24 µg/g creatinine was estimated to be
0.8 µg/kg body weight per day or about 25 μg/kg body weight per month. Because of
cadmium’s exceptionally long half-life, the previous PTWI of 7 µg/kg body weight was
withdrawn, and a PTMI of 25 µg/kg body weight was established.

Carbaryl
Carbaryl (CAS No. 63-25-2) is a broad-spectrum carbamate insecticide that is used
to control insect pests in crops, trees and ornamental plants. It also has some uses in
public health and veterinary practice. Carbaryl has not been reported in drinking-
water; however, it could occur following overspraying or spillage into surface water.
Exposure through drinking-water is therefore considered to be low unless in excep-
tional circumstances. The major route of carbaryl intake for the general population is
food, but residues are considered to be relatively low.

     Carbaryl acts through inhibition of brain cholinesterase, and this is also its
primary mode of toxicity. However, carbaryl is also considered to be a non-genotoxic
carcinogen in mice, in which it causes vascular tumours in males. On this basis, JMPR
established an ADI of 0–0.008 mg/kg body weight. This was based on a lowest-observed-
adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 15 mg/kg body weight per day and application of a
safety factor of 2000 (10 for interspecies variation, 10 for intraspecies variation and 20
to reflect the occurrence of the rare and malignant tumour for which a no-effect level
could not be identified).
     A health-based value of 50 µg/l (rounded value) can be determined from the
JMPR ADI of 0–0.008 mg/kg body weight, assuming a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres
of water per day and allowing 20% of the upper limit of the ADI from drinking-
water. However, carbaryl does not appear to be found in drinking-water at significant
concentrations, and so it is not considered necessary to propose a formal guideline
value.

Carbofuran
Carbofuran (CAS No. 1563-66-2) is used worldwide as a pesticide for many crops.
Residues in treated crops are generally very low or not detectable. The physicochem-
ical properties of carbofuran and the few data on occurrence indicate that drinking-
water from both groundwater and surface water sources is potentially the major route
of exposure.

                           based on a reversible acute effect; the NOAEL will also be protective for
                           chronic effects.

     Carbofuran is highly toxic after acute oral administration. The main systemic
effect of carbofuran poisoning in short-term and long-term toxicity studies appears
to be cholinesterase inhibition. No evidence of teratogenicity has been found in
reproductive toxicity studies. On the basis of available studies, carbofuran does not
appear to be carcinogenic or genotoxic.

Carbon tetrachloride
Carbon tetrachloride is used mainly in the production of chlorofluorocarbon
refrigerants, foam-blowing agents and solvents. However, since the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987) and its amendments (1990 and
1992) established a timetable for the phase-out of the production and consumption of
carbon tetrachloride, manufacture and use have dropped and will continue to drop.
Carbon tetrachloride is released mostly into the atmosphere but also into industrial
wastewater. Although it readily migrates from surface water to the atmosphere, levels
in anaerobic groundwater may remain elevated for months or even years. Although
available data on concentrations in food are limited, the intake from air is expected to
be much greater than that from food or drinking-water.

     The primary targets for carbon tetrachloride toxicity are liver and kidney. In ex-
periments with mice and rats, carbon tetrachloride proved to be capable of inducing
hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. The doses inducing hepatic tumours were
higher than those inducing cell toxicity. It is likely that the carcinogenicity of carbon
tetrachloride is secondary to its hepatotoxic effects. On the basis of available data, car-
bon tetrachloride can be considered to be a non-genotoxic compound. Carbon tetra-
chloride is classified by IARC as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B):
there is sufficient evidence that carbon tetrachloride is carcinogenic in laboratory
animals, but inadequate evidence in humans.

Chloral hydrate
Chloral hydrate, or trichloroacetaldehyde, can be formed as a by-product of the
chlorination of water containing organic precursor material, such as fulvic and
humic acids. It has been found in drinking-water at concentrations of up to 100 µg/l,
but concentrations are usually below 10 µg/l. Concentrations are generally higher
in surface water than in groundwater, and concentrations appear to increase during
distribution.

      Chloral hydrate is used as an intermediate in the production of insecticides,
herbicides and hypnotic drugs. It has also been widely used as a sedative or hypnotic
drug in humans at oral doses of up to about 750–1000 mg/day. Although intake from
clinical use is considerably higher than intake from drinking-water, clinical exposure
is of shorter-term duration.
      No epidemiological or carcinogenic studies were found in humans that associated
exposure to chloral hydrate with cancer, despite the fact that chloral hydrate has been
used for many decades (and still is used) as a sedative and hypnotic drug in adults
and children (specifically for dental procedures). IARC classified chloral hydrate as
not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3), based on inadequate
evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals. There is equivocal
evidence for the genotoxicity of chloral hydrate.
      A health-based value of 0.1 mg/l (rounded figure) can be calculated on the basis
of a TDI of 0.0045 mg/kg body weight derived based on an increased incidence of liver
histopathology observed in mice in a 2-year drinking-water study, allocating 80% of
the TDI to drinking-water (because most exposure to chloral hydrate is from drink-
ing-water) and assuming a 60 kg adult consuming 2 litres of water per day. However,
because chloral hydrate usually occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below
those of health concern, it is not considered necessary to derive a guideline value.
      Chloral hydrate levels in drinking-water can be controlled by changes to disinfec-
tion practice (e.g. enhanced coagulation and softening to remove organic precursor
compounds, moving the point of disinfection to reduce the reaction between chlorine
and precursor compounds and using chloramines for residual disinfection instead of
chlorine) and by GAC treatment.

Chloramines (monochloramine, dichloramine, trichloramine)
Monochloramine, dichloramines and trichloramines are considered by-products of
drinking-water chlorination, being formed when chlorine and ammonia are added to
water. Monochloramine may also be added to maintain residual disinfection activity
in potable water distribution systems. Because higher chloramines are formed only
occasionally and cause taste and odour problems at concentrations lower than those
at which monochloramine causes taste and odour problems, only monochloramine
has been considered for development of a health-based guideline value. Chloramine
is rapidly decomposed in the stomach by gastric juice. The use of chloramines for
disinfection instead of chlorine reduces the formation of THMs in drinking-water
supplies. However, formation of other by-products, such as haloketones, chloropicrin,
cyanogen chloride, HAAs, haloacetonitriles, aldehydes and chlorophenols, has been
reported. Monochloramine, the most abundant chloramine, is recognized as a less
effective disinfectant than chlorine and is used as a secondary disinfectant to maintain
a residual in distribution systems.

Guideline value         Monochloramine: 3 mg/l (3000 µg/l)
Occurrence              Typical chloramine concentrations of 0.5–2 mg/l are found in drinking-
                        water supplies where chloramine is used as a primary disinfectant or to
                        provide a chlorine residual in the distribution system

Monochloramine
Although monochloramine has been shown to be mutagenic in some in vitro studies,
it has not been found to be genotoxic in vivo. IARC has classified chloramine in Group
3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans). In the NTP bioassay in two spe-
cies, the incidence of mononuclear cell leukaemias in female rats was increased, but no
other increases in tumour incidence were observed. IPCS did not consider the increase
in mononuclear cell leukaemia to be treatment related.

Dichloramine and trichloramine
Dichloramine and trichloramine have not been extensively studied, and available data
are inadequate to permit derivation of health-based guideline values for either of these
chemicals. However, these substances can cause taste and odour problems (see chapter
10) if formation of monochloramine is not controlled adequately.

Chlordane
Chlordane (CAS No. 57-47-9) is a broad-spectrum insecticide that has been used since
1947. Its use has recently been increasingly restricted in many countries, and it is now
used mainly to destroy termites by subsurface injection into soil. Chlordane may be a
low-level source of contamination of groundwater when applied by subsurface injec-
tion. Technical chlordane is a mixture of compounds, with the cis and trans forms of
chlordane predominating. It is very resistant to degradation, highly immobile in soil
and unlikely to migrate to groundwater, where it has only rarely been found. It is read-
ily lost to the atmosphere. Although levels of chlordane in food have been decreasing,
it is highly persistent and has a high bioaccumulation potential.

     In experimental animals, prolonged exposure in the diet causes liver damage.
Chlordane produces liver tumours in mice, but the weight of evidence indicates
that it is not genotoxic. Chlordane can interfere with cell communication in vitro, a
characteristic of many tumour promoters. IARC re-evaluated chlordane in 1991 and
concluded that there is inadequate evidence for its carcinogenicity in humans and
sufficient evidence for its carcinogenicity in animals, classifying it in Group 2B.

Chloride
Chloride in drinking-water originates from natural sources, sewage and industrial
effluents, urban runoff containing de-icing salt and saline intrusion.

                              GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     The main source of human exposure to chloride is the addition of salt to food, and
the intake from this source is usually greatly in excess of that from drinking-water.

Reason for not establishing   Not of health concern at levels found in drinking-water

Assessment date               1993
Principal reference           WHO (2003) Chloride in drinking-water


     Excessive chloride concentrations increase rates of corrosion of metals in the dis-
tribution system, depending on the alkalinity of the water. This can lead to increased
concentrations of metals in the supply.
     No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water. How-
ever, chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/l can give rise to detectable
taste in water (see chapter 10).

Chlorine
Chlorine is produced in large amounts and widely used both industrially and do-
mestically as an important disinfectant and bleach. In particular, it is widely used in
the disinfection of swimming pools and is the most commonly used disinfectant and
oxidant in drinking-water treatment. In water, chlorine reacts to form hypochlorous
acid and hypochlorites. Concentrations of chlorate and some perchlorates increase
in hypochlorite solutions upon storage at high ambient temperatures or when new
hypochlorite is added to old hypochlorite.

Guideline value           5 mg/l (5000 µg/l)
Occurrence                Present in most disinfected drinking-water at concentrations of 0.2–1 mg/l

Limit of detection        0.01 µg/l following pre-column derivatization to 4-bromoacetanilide by HPLC;
                          10 µg/l as free chlorine by colorimetry; 200 µg/l by ion chromatography
Treatment performance     It is possible to reduce the concentration of chlorine effectively to zero
                          (< 0.1 mg/l) by reduction. However, it is normal practice to supply water
                          with a chlorine residual of a few tenths of a milligram per litre to act as a
                          preservative during distribution.
Guideline value derivation

•  weight                  60 kg adult
•  consumption             2 litres/day
Additional comments       The guideline value is conservative, as no adverse effect level was
                          identified in the critical study.
                          Most individuals are able to taste chlorine at the guideline value.

Assessment date            1993
Principal reference        WHO (2003) Chlorine in drinking-water


    In humans and experimental animals exposed to chlorine in drinking-water,
no specific adverse treatment-related effects have been observed. IARC has classified
hypochlorite in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans).

Chlorine dioxide, chlorite and chlorate
Chlorite and chlorate are DBPs resulting from the use of chlorine dioxide as a dis-
infectant and for odour and taste control in water. Sodium chlorite and sodium
chlorate are both used in the production of chlorine dioxide as well as for other
commercial purposes. Chlorite and chlorate are also formed during the decomposi-
tion of hypochlorite solutions that are stored for long periods, particularly at warm
temperatures. Where hypochlorite or chlorine dioxide is used as a disinfectant, the
major route of environmental exposure to chlorite and chlorate is expected to be
through drinking-water.


Provisional guideline values Chlorite: 0.7 mg/l (700 µg/l)
                              Chlorate: 0.7 mg/l (700 µg/l)
                              The guideline values for chlorite and chlorate are designated as
                              provisional because use of aged hypochlorite or of chlorine dioxide as
                              disinfectants may result in the chlorite and chlorate guideline values
                              being exceeded, and difficulties in meeting the guideline values must
                              never be a reason for compromising adequate disinfection
Occurrence                    When chlorine dioxide is used as the final disinfectant at typical doses,
                              the resulting chlorite concentration would normally be less than
                              0.2 mg/l. Chlorate concentrations above 1 mg/l have been reported
                              when hypochlorite was used, but such high concentrations would be
                              unusual unless hypochlorite is stored under adverse conditions.
ADIs                          Chlorite: 0–0.03 mg/kg bw based on a NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw per day for

                              GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY



Prevention and treatment     When using hypochlorite, the following control approach is
                             recommended to minimize formation of chlorite and chlorate: purchase
                             fresh solutions that are of an appropriate quality, store them in a cool
                             place and out of direct sunlight, and use the hypochlorite as soon as
                             possible after purchase (e.g. within a month, if possible). Further, new
                             hypochlorite solutions should not be added to containers containing old
                             hypochlorite solutions, as this will accelerate chlorate formation.
                             It is possible to reduce the concentration of chlorine dioxide and chlorite
                             effectively to zero (<0.1 mg/l) by reduction; however, it is normal
                             practice to supply water with a chlorine dioxide residual of a few tenths
                             of a milligram per litre to provide some protection against microbial
                             regrowth during distribution. With chlorine dioxide disinfection, the
                             concentrations of chlorate and chlorite depend on process conditions
                             (in both the chlorine dioxide generator and the water treatment plant)
                             and applied dose of chlorine dioxide. As there is no low-cost option
                             for reducing concentrations of chlorate once it is formed, control of
                             chlorate concentration must rely on preventing its addition (from sodium
                             hypochlorite) or formation (from chlorine dioxide). If chlorine dioxide is
                             used as a pre-oxidant, the resulting chlorite concentration may need to
                             be reduced using ferrous iron, sulfur reducing agents or activated carbon.
Guideline value derivation
•  allocation to water       80% of ADI
•  weight                    60 kg adult
•  consumption               2 litres/day
Additional comments          Concentrations should be maintained as low as reasonably practical,
                             without compromising adequate disinfection. Although a health-based
                             value of 0.3 mg/l could be derived from the ADI for chlorate, in some
                             circumstances, it may not be possible to adequately disinfect potable
                             water and maintain chlorate concentrations at or below the health-based
                             value as chlorate is a byproduct of hypochlorite. Therefore, the previous
                             provisional guideline value is retained. Moreover, even this provisional
                             guideline value may be exceeded when aged hypochlorite is used and
                             difficulties in meeting the guideline value must never be a reason for
                             compromising adequate disinfection.

Chlorine dioxide
Any chlorine dioxide remaining at the consumer’s tap will be reduced to chlorite
and chloride upon ingestion. Consequently, a guideline value for chlorine dioxide has
not been established. The provisional guideline values for chlorite and chlorate are
adequately protective for potential toxicity from chlorine dioxide. The taste and odour
threshold for chlorine dioxide is 0.2–0.4 mg/l.

Chlorite

mans. The primary and most consistent finding arising from exposure to chlorite in a

number of species was oxidative stress resulting in changes in the red blood cells. This
observation was supported by a number of biochemical studies conducted in vitro.
Studies with human volunteers for up to 12 weeks did not identify any effect on blood
parameters at the highest dose tested, 36 µg/kg bw per day.

Chlorate
Although chlorate has also been reported to have effects on red blood cells, the most
sensitive effects observed in rats administered sodium chlorate in drinking-water for
21 or 90 days were changes in thyroid histology (e.g. colloid depletion, hypertrophy,
incidence and severity of hyperplasia) and in thyroid hormones. As with chlorite, a
chlorate dose of 36 µg/kg bw per day for 12 weeks did not result in any adverse effects
in human volunteers.

Chloroacetones
1,1-Dichloroacetone is formed from the reaction between chlorine and organic pre-
cursors and has been detected in chlorinated drinking-water. Concentrations are
estimated to be less than 10 µg/l and usually less than 1 µg/l.

Reason for not establishing    Available data inadequate to permit derivation of health-based
guideline values               guideline values for any of the chloroacetones

Principal reference            WHO (2003) Chloroacetones in drinking-water


     The toxicological data on 1,1-dichloroacetone are very limited, although studies
with single doses indicate that it affects the liver.
     There are insufficient data at present to permit the setting of guideline values for
1,1-dichloroacetone or any of the other chloroacetones.

Chlorophenols (2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol)
Chlorophenols are present in drinking-water as a result of the chlorination of phenols,
as by-products of the reaction of hypochlorite with phenolic acids, as biocides or as deg-
radation products of phenoxy herbicides. Those most likely to occur in drinking-water as
by-products of chlorination are 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichloro-
phenol. The taste thresholds for chlorophenols in drinking-water are low.

2-Chlorophenol
Data on the toxicity of 2-chlorophenol are limited. Therefore, no health-based
guideline value has been derived.

2,4-Dichlorophenol
Data on the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenol are limited. Therefore, no health-based
guideline value has been derived.

2,4,6-Trichlorophenol
2,4,6-Trichlorophenol has been reported to induce lymphomas and leukaemias in
male rats and hepatic tumours in male and female mice. The compound has not been
shown to be mutagenic in the Ames test but has shown weak mutagenic activity in
other in vitro and in vivo studies. IARC has classified 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in Group
2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).

Chloropicrin
Chloropicrin, or trichloronitromethane, is formed by the reaction of chlorine with
humic and amino acids and with nitrophenols. Its formation is increased in the pres-
ence of nitrates. Limited data from the USA indicate that concentrations in drink-
ing-water are usually less than 5 µg/l.

     Decreased survival and body weights have been reported following long-term
oral exposure in laboratory animals. Chloropicrin has been shown to be mutagenic
in bacterial tests and in in vitro assays in lymphocytes. Because of the high mortality
in a carcinogenesis bioassay and the limited number of end-points examined in the
78-week toxicity study, the available data were considered inadequate to permit the
establishment of a guideline value for chloropicrin.

     Chlorotoluron is of low toxicity following single, short-term and long-term ex-
posures in experimental animals, but it has been shown to cause an increase in ad-
enomas and carcinomas of the kidneys of male mice given high doses for 2 years. As
no carcinogenic effects were reported in a 2-year study in rats, it has been suggested
that chlorotoluron has a carcinogenic potential that is both species and sex specific.
Chlorotoluron and its metabolites have shown no evidence of genotoxicity.

Chlorpyrifos
Chlorpyrifos (CAS No. 2921-88-2) is a broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide
used for the control of mosquitoes, flies, various crop pests in soil and on foliage, house-
hold pests and aquatic larvae. Although it is not recommended for addition to water for
public health purposes by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES), it may
be used in some countries as an aquatic larvicide for the control of mosquito larvae.
Chlorpyrifos is strongly absorbed by soil and does not readily leach from it, degrading
slowly by microbial action. It has a low solubility in water and great tendency to parti-
tion from aqueous phases into organic phases in the environment.

     JMPR concluded that chlorpyrifos is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to hu-
mans. Chlorpyrifos was not genotoxic in an adequate range of studies in vitro and
in vivo. In long-term studies, inhibition of cholinesterase activity was the main
toxicological finding in all species.

Chromium
Chromium is widely distributed in Earth’s crust. It can exist in valences of +2 to +6. In
general, food appears to be the major source of intake. Chromium(III) is an essential
nutrient.

Provisional guideline value Total chromium: 0.05 mg/l (50 µg/l)
                            The guideline value is designated as provisional because of uncertainties
                            in the toxicological database.
Occurrence                  Total chromium concentrations in drinking-water usually less than 2 µg/l,
                            although concentrations as high as 120 µg/l have been reported
Basis of guideline value    There are no adequate toxicity studies available to provide a basis for a
derivation                  NOAEL. The guideline value was first proposed in 1958 for hexavalent
                            chromium, based on health concerns, but was later changed to a
                            guideline for total chromium because of difficulties in analysing for the
                            hexavalent form only.

     In a long-term carcinogenicity study in rats given chromium(III) by the oral
route, no increase in tumour incidence was observed. In rats, chromium(VI) is
a carcinogen via the inhalation route, although an NTP study has shown evidence
for carcinogenicity via the oral route at high doses. However, there is evidence that
the dose–response relationship at low doses is non-linear, because chromium(VI) is
reduced to chromium(III) in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. In epidemio-
logical studies, an association has been found between exposure to chromium(VI) by
the inhalation route and lung cancer. IARC has classified chromium(VI) in Group 1
(human carcinogen) and chromium(III) in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcino-
genicity to humans). Chromium(VI) compounds are active in a wide range of in vitro
and in vivo genotoxicity tests, whereas chromium(III) compounds are not.

Copper
Copper is both an essential nutrient and a drinking-water contaminant. It is used to
make pipes, valves and fittings and is present in alloys and coatings. Copper sulfate

pentahydrate is sometimes added to surface water for the control of algae. Copper
concentrations in drinking-water vary widely, with the primary source most often
being the corrosion of interior copper plumbing. Levels in running or fully flushed
water tend to be low, whereas those in standing or partially flushed water samples are
more variable and can be substantially higher (frequently above 1 mg/l). Copper con-
centrations in treated water often increase during distribution, especially in systems
with an acid pH or high-carbonate waters with an alkaline pH. Food and water are the
primary sources of copper exposure in developed countries. Consumption of stand-
ing or partially flushed water from a distribution system that includes copper pipes or
fittings can considerably increase total daily copper exposure, especially for infants fed
formula reconstituted with tap water.

Guideline value            2 mg/l (2000 µg/l)
Occurrence                 Concentrations in drinking-water range from ≤ 0.005 to > 30 mg/l, primarily
                           as a result of the corrosion of interior copper plumbing
Basis of guideline value   To be protective against acute gastrointestinal effects of copper and

Treatment performance      Copper is not removed by conventional treatment processes. However,
                           copper is not normally a raw water contaminant.
Additional comments        For adults with normal copper homeostasis, the guideline value should
                           permit consumption of 2 or 3 litres of water per day, use of a nutritional
                           supplement and copper from foods without exceeding the tolerable upper
                           intake level of 10 mg/day or eliciting an adverse gastrointestinal response.
                           Staining of laundry and sanitary ware occurs at copper concentrations
                           above 1 mg/l. At levels above 2.5 mg/l, copper imparts an undesirable bitter
                           taste to water; at higher levels, the colour of water is also impacted.
                           In most instances where copper tubing is used as a plumbing material,
                           concentrations of copper will be below the guideline value. However, there
                           are some conditions, such as highly acidic or aggressive waters, that will
                           give rise to much higher copper concentrations, and the use of copper
                           tubing may not be appropriate in such circumstances.

response. The data on the gastrointestinal effects of copper must be used with cau-
tion, as the effects observed are influenced by the concentration of ingested copper
to a greater extent than the total mass or dose ingested in a 24-hour period. Recent
studies have delineated the threshold for the effects of copper in drinking-water on the
gastrointestinal tract, but there is still some uncertainty regarding the long-term ef­
fects of copper on sensitive populations, such as carriers of the gene for Wilson disease
and other metabolic disorders of copper homeostasis.

Cyanazine
Cyanazine (CAS No. 21725-46-2) is a member of the triazine family of herbicides. It
is used as a pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicide for the control of annual
grasses and broadleaf weeds. It can be degraded in soil and water by microorganisms
and by hydrolysis.

     On the basis of the available mutagenicity data on cyanazine, evidence for geno-
toxicity is equivocal. Cyanazine causes mammary gland tumours in rats but not in
mice. The mechanism of mammary gland tumour development in rats is currently
under investigation and may prove to be hormonal. Cyanazine is also teratogenic in
rats at dose levels of 25 mg/kg body weight per day and higher.

Cyanide
Cyanides can be found in some foods, particularly in some developing countries, and
they are occasionally found in drinking-water, but usually only at very low concentra-
tions. However, there are occasions on which large spills of cyanide, associated with
industry, occur, and these can give rise to very high concentrations in drinking-water
source waters, particularly surface waters.

                             WHO (2009) Cyanide in drinking-water


      Cyanide is highly acutely toxic. It is detoxified in the liver by first-pass metab-
olism following oral exposure. As a consequence, exposure to a dose spread over
a longer period, through a day, for example, will result in lower toxicity, or higher
tolerance, than the same dose given in a single bolus dose. Exposure to high doses
can give rise to thyroid toxicity as a secondary effect of exposure due to the inhibition
of iodine uptake from the thiocyanate generated through the detoxifying action of
rhodanese. It is difficult to interpret human data in view of the difficulty in assessing
the actual absorbed dose in humans following acute fatal intoxication and the lack of
well-conducted studies on sublethal toxicity.
      There is a need for guidance regarding concentrations that would not be of concern
for public health following short-term exposure to cyanide. However, because cyanide is
unlikely to occur in drinking-water at concentrations of health concern, it is considered
unnecessary to derive a formal guideline value for short-term exposure to cyanide.
      The data on acute exposure to cyanide are unsuitable for use in deriving a health-
based value for short-term exposure because of the high uncertainty surrounding the
data. Using the NOAEL for effects on the reproductive organs of male rats in a 13-
week study and an uncertainty factor of 100, a TDI of 0.045 mg/kg body weight can be
derived. Because this health-based value is intended for short-term use and exposure
would not exceed 5 days, it is considered to be acceptable to allocate 40% of the TDI
to drinking-water to allow for exposure to cyanogenic glycosides in food. Therefore,
assuming a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day with an allocation of 40%
of the TDI to drinking-water, a health-based value of 0.5 mg/l (rounded value) for
short-term exposure can be calculated.
      This health-based value is well below the level that is normally considered to be
of health concern for humans. Cyanide is rapidly detoxified, and exposure spread
throughout the day will further reduce the potential for effects. This health-based
value would be suitable for use for a limited period of up to 5 days, which is the longest
period likely to be required under the circumstances of such an emergency. However,
it is probable that, in most circumstances, this value will be highly conservative for
short-term exposure.
      It should be noted that the lowest reported odour threshold for cyanide in
drinking-water is 0.17 mg/l, which is below the short-term health-based value. It is
therefore possible that a small number of individuals will detect cyanide by odour at
concentrations below the health-based value.
      The health-based value relates to total cyanide concentration at the tap, including
cyanide from cyanogen chloride in drinking-water as a by-product of disinfection with
chlorine. Cyanogen chloride rapidly breaks down to cyanide in the distribution sys-
tem or when ingested. As the low levels of cyanide normally found in drinking-water

                               GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


are mostly a consequence of the presence of cyanogen chloride, it is not considered
necessary to develop a guideline value for long-term exposure to cyanide.

Cyanobacterial toxins: Microcystin-LR
Among the cyanobacterial toxins, microcystins are the best-researched group and
probably occur most frequently in fresh waters. Many practical considerations for
the abatement of microcystins apply similarly to the other cyanotoxins (i.e. cylindro-
spermopsins, saxitoxins, anatoxin-a and anatoxin-a(s)), with one key difference that
is relevant to the efficacy of their removal in drinking-water treatment: microcystins
are usually cell-bound, and substantial amounts are released to the surrounding water
only in situations of cell rupture (i.e. lysis), whereas the other cyanotoxins may occur
to a larger extent dissolved in water.
      Although microcystins may occur in fish, molluscs and shellfish from water bodies
with cyanobacterial proliferation, human exposure to microcystins is largely through
drinking-water or recreational use of water bodies with cyanobacterial blooms.
      Among the more than 80 microcystins identified to date, only a few occur fre-
quently and in high concentrations. Microcystin-LR is among the most frequently
occurring and most toxic microcystin congeners. It is the only one for which enough
toxicological data are available with which to derive a provisional guideline value. Fre-
quently occurring cyanobacterial genera that may contain microcystins are Microcystis,
Planktothrix and Anabaena (see also section 11.5).

Prevention and treatment    Actions to decrease the probability of bloom occurrence include
                            catchment and source water management, such as reducing nutrient
                            loading or changing reservoir stratification and mixing. Treatment
                            effective for the removal of cyanobacteria includes filtration to remove
                            intact cells. Treatment effective against free microcystins in water (as
                            well as most other free cyanotoxins) includes oxidation through ozone
                            or chlorine at sufficient concentrations and contact times, as well as GAC
                            and some PAC applications (see the supporting document Management

                            WHO (2003) Cyanobacterial toxins: Microcystin-LR in drinking-water


     Microcystin-LR is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic protein serine/threonine phos-
phatases 1 and 2A. The primary target for microcystin toxicity is the liver, as micro-
cystins cross cell membranes chiefly through the bile acid transporter. Guideline value
derivation was based on an oral 13-week study with mice, supported by an oral 44-day
study with pigs. A large number of poisonings of livestock and wildlife have been re-
corded. Evidence of tumour promotion has been published. In 2006, IARC classified
microcystin-LR as a possible carcinogen (Group 2B).
Practical considerations
Cyanobacteria occur widely in lakes, reservoirs, ponds and slow-flowing rivers. Where
their excessive growth leads to high cell numbers, sometimes termed “bloom” events,
their toxins can reach concentrations in raw water that are potentially hazardous to
human health. Blooms occur if concentrations of nutrients (phosphorus and nitro-
gen) are elevated, particularly in stagnant or very slowly flowing water bodies. Blooms
tend to recur in the same water bodies. Cells of some cyanobacterial species may ac­
cumulate at the surface as scums or at the thermocline of thermally stratified res-
ervoirs. Such accumulations may develop rapidly, and they may be of very variable
duration (hours to weeks). In many circumstances, blooms and accumulations are
seasonal.
     A variety of resource protection and source management actions are available to
decrease the probability of bloom occurrence. Among these, the most sustainable and
effective measure is to reduce nutrient (particularly phosphorus) concentrations in
the water body to levels sufficiently low to substantially limit the amount of cyano-
bacterial biomass that can grow. This is achieved by controlling nutrient loads from
sewage effluents and from land areas. The latter involves controlling erosion as well as
the amount of manure and fertilizers spread in the catchment. Further, hydrological
management actions such as water body mixing and flushing can render hydrophysic­
al conditions less suitable for cyanobacteria and thus shift plankton species from
cyanobacteria to others (i.e. planktonic algae such as diatoms) that are less relevant to
human health.

                             GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


      As microcystins almost always occur largely cell-bound, any drinking-water treat-
ment that removes particles—i.e. soil or riverbank filtration, flocculation and filtra-
tion or dissolved air filtration—controls them effectively if the process is optimized to
target their removal. This also applies to the cell-bound fraction of other cyanotoxins.
Process operation should avoid cell rupture and toxin release. Hazardously high con-
centrations of dissolved cyanotoxins appear to occur less frequently. They are well
removed by most types of activated carbon. Chlorination and ozonation are effective
for the removal of many cyanotoxins at sufficiently high doses and contact times, but
not very effective for saxitoxins. Potassium permanganate is effective for microcystins,
whereas limited or no data are available at present for other toxins. Chlorine dioxide
and chloramine are ineffective for removing cyanotoxins.
      Cyanotoxin monitoring is most effectively based on surveillance of source water
for evidence of cyanobacterial blooms or bloom-forming potential (i.e. nutrient levels
and phytoplankton species composition), with vigilance increased where such events
occur. In contrast, monitoring finished water against target cyanotoxin concentrations
is unsatisfactory for determining whether or not it is safe, because of the large variety
of toxins (particularly of microcystins), the lack of guideline values for all but one
(i.e. microcystin-LR) against which to monitor and the lack of analytical standards
for many. Analysis of cyanotoxins is particularly useful for validating and optimizing
the efficacy of control measures such as riverbank filtration or treatment. A caveat in
cyanotoxin analysis is the need for extraction of the cell-bound fraction from the cells;
although this is easy to do, particularly for microcystins, neglecting extraction from
cells will lead to dramatic underestimation of concentrations.

Cyanogen chloride
Cyanogen chloride may be formed as a by-product of chloramination or chlorination
of water. It is also formed by the chlorination of cyanide ion present in raw water.

     Cyanogen chloride is rapidly metabolized to cyanide in the body. There are few
data available on the oral toxicity of cyanogen chloride.
     As cyanogen chloride is unlikely to be found in drinking-water at concentrations
that are of health concern, it is considered unnecessary to develop a formal guideline

derived based on cyanide.
     Using a NOAEL for cyanide of 4.5 mg/kg body weight per day for minor changes
in the testis in a subchronic study in which rats were exposed through their drink-

derived. In view of the minor nature of the changes observed and the NOAEL in a pre-
vious chronic study, it is not considered necessary to include an additional uncertainty
factor to allow for the length of the study. Further, it appears that a dose that may be
toxic in acute poisoning would certainly be tolerated under chronic conditions, owing
to efficient detoxification. Assuming a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day
and allowing 20% of the TDI to come from water because of the potential for expos­
ure to cyanogenic glycosides in food, the health-based value for long-term exposure is
0.3 mg/l for cyanide or 0.6 mg/l for cyanogen chloride (rounded values).
     Although low concentrations of cyanide in raw waters will be converted to cy-
anogen chloride by chlorination, cyanogen chloride may also be formed during the
production of chloramines in situ as a residual disinfectant to maintain the hygienic
condition of the distribution system. It is important that treatment be optimized to
minimize the formation of cyanogen chloride while maintaining adequate chloramine
residuals where chloramination is practised.

and amine salts and ester formulations. 2,4-D itself is chemically stable, but its esters
are rapidly hydrolysed to the free acid. 2,4-D is a systemic herbicide used for control
of broad-leaved weeds, including aquatic weeds. 2,4-D is rapidly biodegraded in the
environment. Residues of 2,4-D in food rarely exceed a few tens of micrograms per
kilogram.

Guideline value            0.03 mg/l (30 µg/l)
Occurrence                 Levels in water usually below 0.5 µg/l, although concentrations as high as
                           30 µg/l have been measured
ADI                        0–0.01 mg/kg body weight for the sum of 2,4-D and its salts and esters,
                           expressed as 2,4-D, on the basis of a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg body weight per
                           day in a 1-year study of toxicity in dogs (for a variety of effects, including
                           histopathological lesions in kidneys and liver) and a 2-year study of
                           toxicity and carcinogenicity in rats (for renal lesions)
Limit of detection         0.1 µg/l by gas–liquid chromatography with electrolytic conductivity
                           detection
Treatment performance      1 µg/l should be achievable using GAC
Guideline value derivation
•  allocation to water     10% of upper limit of ADI
•  weight                  60 kg adult
•  consumption             2 litres/day
Additional comments        The guideline value applies to 2,4-D, as salts and esters of 2,4-D are rapidly
                           hydrolysed to the free acid in water.

     Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between exposure to
chlorophenoxy herbicides, including 2,4-D, and two forms of cancer in humans: soft
tissue sarcomas and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The results of these studies, however,
are inconsistent; the associations found are weak, and conflicting conclusions have
been reached by the investigators. Most of the studies did not provide information
on exposure specifically to 2,4-D, and the risk was related to the general category of
chlorophenoxy herbicides, a group that includes 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid
(2,4,5-T), which was potentially contaminated with dioxins. JMPR concluded that
it was not possible to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of 2,4-D on the basis of the
available epidemiological studies. JMPR also concluded that 2,4-D and its salts and
esters are not genotoxic. The toxicity of the salts and esters of 2,4-D is comparable to
that of the acid.

2,4-DB
The half-lives for degradation of chlorophenoxy herbicides, including 2,4-DB, or 2,4-
dichlorophenoxybutyric acid (CAS No. 94-82-6), in the environment are in the order
of several days. Chlorophenoxy herbicides are not often found in food.

Guideline value              0.09 mg/l (90 µg/l)
Occurrence                   Chlorophenoxy herbicides not frequently found in drinking-water; when
                             detected, concentrations usually no greater than a few micrograms per
                             litre
TDI                          30 µg/kg body weight, based on a NOAEL of 3 mg/kg body weight per
                             day for effects on body and organ weights, blood chemistry and haema‑
                             tological parameters in a 2-year study in rats, with an uncertainty factor
                             of 100 (for interspecies and intraspecies variation)

Limit of detection           1 µg/l to 1 mg/l for various methods commonly used for the
                             determination of chlorophenoxy herbicides in water, including solvent
                             extraction, separation by GC, gas–liquid chromatography, thin-layer
                             chromatography or HPLC, with ECD or UV detection

Treatment performance        0.1 µg/l should be achievable using GAC

•     weight                 60 kg adult
•     consumption            2 litres/day

Additional comments          The NOAEL used in the guideline value derivation is similar to the NOAEL
                             of 2.5 mg/kg body weight per day obtained in a short-term study in dogs
                             and the NOAEL for hepatocyte hypertrophy of 5 mg/kg body weight per
                             day obtained in a 3-month study in rats.

     Chlorophenoxy herbicides, as a group, have been classified in Group 2B (pos-
sibly carcinogenic to humans) by IARC. However, the available data from studies in
exposed populations and experimental animals do not permit assessment of the car-
cinogenic potential to humans of any specific chlorophenoxy herbicide. Therefore,
drinking-water guidelines for these compounds are based on a threshold approach for
other toxic effects.

DDT and metabolites
The structure of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, or DDT (CAS No. 107917-42-0),
permits several different isomeric forms; commercial products consist predominantly
of p,p′-DDT. Its use has been restricted or banned in several countries, although DDT
is still used in some countries for the control of vectors that transmit yellow fever,
sleeping sickness, typhus, malaria and other insect-transmitted diseases. DDT and
its metabolites are persistent in the environment and resistant to complete degrada-
tion by microorganisms. Food is the major source of intake of DDT and related com-
pounds for the general population, although exposure has significantly decreased as a
consequence of the greatly reduced use of DDT for all except specialist applications.

Guideline value              0.001 mg/l (1 µg/l)

Occurrence                   Detected in surface water at concentrations below 1 µg/l; also detected in
                             drinking-water at 100-fold lower concentrations

PTDI                         0.01 mg/kg body weight based on a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg body weight per
                             day for developmental toxicity in rats, applying an uncertainty factor of
                             100 (for interspecies and intraspecies variation)

Limit of detection           0.011 µg/l by GC using ECD

Treatment performance        0.1 µg/l should be achievable using coagulation or GAC
Guideline value derivation
•   allocation to water      1% of PTDI
•   weight                   10 kg child
•   consumption              1 litre/day
Additional comments          DDT is listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
                             Pollutants. Hence, monitoring may occur in addition to that required by
                             drinking-water guidelines.

                             It should be noted that the level of DDT and its metabolites in food has
                             been falling steadily, and the allocation of 1% of the PTDI may be very
                             conservative.

                             The guideline value is derived on the basis of a 10 kg child consuming
                             1 litre of drinking-water per day, because infants and children may be
                             exposed to greater amounts of chemicals in relation to their body weight
                             and because of concern over the bioaccumulation of DDT.

                             It should be emphasized that the benefits of DDT use in malaria and
                             other vector control programmes outweigh any health risk from the
                             presence of DDT in drinking-water.

     A working group convened by IARC classified the DDT complex (the mixture
of the various isomers of DDT and associated compounds) as a non-genotoxic
carcinogen in rodents and a potent promoter of liver tumours. IARC has concluded
that there is insufficient evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in experimental
animals for the carcinogenicity of DDT (Group 2B) based upon liver tumours ob-
served in rats and mice. The results of epidemiological studies of pancreatic cancer,
multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and uterine cancer did not support
the hypothesis of an association with environmental exposure to the DDT complex.
Conflicting data were obtained with regard to some genotoxic end-points. In most
studies, DDT did not induce genotoxic effects in rodent or human cell systems, nor
was it mutagenic to fungi or bacteria. The United States Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry concluded that the DDT complex could impair reproduction
and development in several species. Hepatic effects of DDT in rats include increased
liver weights, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, induction of microsomal enzymes, includ-
ing cytochrome P450, cell necrosis, increased activity of serum liver enzymes and
mitogenic effects, which might be related to a regenerative liver response to high
doses of DDT.

Dialkyltins
The group of chemicals known as the organotins is composed of a large number of
compounds with differing properties and applications. The most widely used organ-
otins are the disubstituted compounds, which are employed as stabilizers in plastics,
including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) water pipes, and the trisubstituted compounds,
which are widely used as biocides.

Reason for not establishing     Available data inadequate to permit derivation of health-based
a guideline value               guideline values for any of the dialkyltins
Assessment date                 2003
Principal reference             WHO (2004) Dialkyltins in drinking-water


     The disubstituted compounds that may leach from PVC water pipes at low con-
centrations for a short time after installation are primarily immunotoxins, although
they appear to be of low general toxicity. The data available are insufficient to permit
the proposal of guideline values for individual dialkyltins.

1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane
1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane (CAS No. 96-12-8), or DBCP, is a soil fumigant that is
highly soluble in water. It has a taste and odour threshold in water of 10 µg/l. DBCP was
detected in vegetables grown in treated soils, and low levels have been detected in air.

Occurrence                 Limited survey found levels of up to a few micrograms per litre in drinking-
                           water

Additional comments        The guideline value of 1 µg/l should be protective for the reproductive
                           toxicity of DBCP.
Assessment date            1993
Principal reference        WHO (2003) 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane in drinking-water


     On the basis of data from different strains of rats and mice, DBCP was determined
to be carcinogenic in both sexes by the oral, inhalation and dermal routes. DBCP was
also determined to be a reproductive toxicant in humans and several species of lab­
oratory animals. DBCP was found to be genotoxic in a majority of in vitro and in
vivo assays. IARC has classified DBCP in Group 2B based upon sufficient evidence of
carcinogenicity in animals. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests an increase in
cancer mortality in individuals exposed to high levels of DBCP.

1,2-Dibromoethane
1,2-Dibromoethane (CAS No. 106-93-4), or ethylene dibromide, is used as a lead scav­
enger in tetraalkyl lead petrol and antiknock preparations and as a fumigant for soils,
grains and fruits. However, with the phasing out of leaded petrol and of the use of
1,2-dibromoethane in agricultural applications in many countries, use of this sub-
stance has declined significantly. In addition to its continued use as a petrol additive
in some countries, 1,2-dibromoethane is currently used principally as a solvent and as
an intermediate in the chemical industry.

Provisional guideline value   0.0004 mg/l (0.4 µg/l)
                              The guideline value is provisional owing to serious limitations of the
                              critical studies.
Occurrence                    Detected in groundwater following its use as a soil fumigant at

     1,2-Dibromoethane has induced an increased incidence of tumours at several
sites in all carcinogenicity bioassays identified in which rats or mice were exposed
to the compound by gavage, ingestion in drinking-water, dermal application and
inhalation. However, many of these studies were characterized by high early mortality,
limited histopathological examination, small group sizes or use of only one exposure
level. The substance acted as an initiator of liver foci in an initiation/promotion assay
but did not initiate skin tumour development. 1,2-Dibromoethane was consistently
genotoxic in in vitro assays, although results of in vivo assays were mixed. Biotrans-
formation to active metabolites, which have been demonstrated to bind to DNA, is
probably involved in the induction of tumours. Available data do not support the
existence of a non-genotoxic mechanism of tumour induction. The available data
thus indicate that 1,2-dibromoethane is a genotoxic carcinogen in rodents. Data on
the potential carcinogenicity in humans are inadequate; however, it is likely that 1,2-
dibromoethane is metabolized similarly in rodent species and in humans (although
there may be varying potential for the production of active metabolites in humans,
owing to genetic polymorphism). IARC classified 1,2-dibromoethane in Group 2A
(probably carcinogenic to humans).

Dichloroacetic acid
Chlorinated acetic acids, including dichloroacetic acid (DCA), are formed from or-
ganic material during water chlorination. DCA has been used as a therapeutic agent
to treat lactic acidosis, diabetes and familial hyperlipidaemia in humans.

Provisional guideline value    0.05 mg/l (50 µg/l)
                               The guideline value is designated as provisional on the basis of technical
                               achievability.
Occurrence                     Found in groundwater and surface water distribution systems at
                               concentrations up to about 100 µg/l, with mean concentrations below

Limit of detection             < 0.1–0.4 µg/l by GC with ECD; practical quantification limit 1 µg/l
Treatment performance          Concentrations may be reduced by installing or optimizing coagulation
                               to remove precursors or by controlling the pH during chlorination.
Additional comments            The concentration associated with a 10−5 upper-bound excess lifetime
                               cancer risk is 40 µg/l. In some circumstances, however, it may not be
                               possible to adequately disinfect potable water and maintain DCA levels
                               below 40 µg/l, so the provisional guideline value of 50 µg/l is retained.

     IARC reclassified DCA as Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) in 2002,
based on the absence of data on human carcinogenicity and sufficient evidence of its
carcinogenicity in experimental animals. This classification was based primarily on
findings of liver tumours in rats and mice. Genotoxicity data are considered to be in-
conclusive, particularly at lower doses. Glycogen deposition, peroxisome proliferation,
changes in signal transduction pathways and DNA hypomethylation have all been ob-
served following DCA exposure and have been hypothesized to be involved in its car-
cinogenicity. However, the available data are not sufficient to establish a cancer mode
of action with reasonable certainty, especially at the very low exposure levels expected
to apply to humans ingesting chlorinated drinking-water. Recent data suggest that
there may be more than one mechanism leading to tumours, as altered hepatic foci
from treated mice were found to have three different types of cellular characteristics.

Dichlorobenzenes (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene,
1,4-dichlorobenzene)
The dichlorobenzenes (DCBs) are widely used in industry and in domestic products
such as odour-masking agents, chemical dyestuffs and pesticides. Sources of human
exposure are predominantly air and food.

1,2-Dichlorobenzene
1,2-DCB is of low acute toxicity by the oral route of exposure. Oral exposure to high
doses of 1,2-DCB affects mainly the liver and kidneys. The balance of evidence sug-
gests that 1,2-DCB is not genotoxic, and there is no evidence for its carcinogenicity in
rodents.
1,3-Dichlorobenzene
There are insufficient toxicological data on this compound to permit a guideline value
to be proposed, but it should be noted that it is rarely found in drinking-water.
1,4-Dichlorobenzene
1,4-DCB is of low acute toxicity, but there is evidence that it increases the incidence
of renal tumours in rats and of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in mice after
long-term exposure. IARC has placed 1,4-DCB in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to
humans). 1,4-DCB is not considered to be genotoxic, and the relevance for humans of
the tumours observed in experimental animals is doubtful.

1,1-Dichloroethane
1,1-Dichloroethane is used as a chemical intermediate and solvent. There are limited
data showing that it can be present at concentrations of up to 10 µg/l in drinking-
water. It is primarily of concern for groundwater.

     1,1-Dichloroethane is rapidly metabolized by mammals to acetic acid and a
variety of chlorinated compounds. It is of relatively low acute toxicity, and limited
data are available on its toxicity from short-term and long-term studies. There is
limited in vitro evidence of genotoxicity. One carcinogenicity study by gavage in mice
and rats provided no conclusive evidence of carcinogenicity, although there was some
evidence of an increased incidence of haemangiosarcomas in treated animals.

    In view of the very limited database on toxicity and carcinogenicity, it was
concluded that no guideline value should be proposed.

1,2-Dichloroethane
1,2-Dichloroethane is used mainly as an intermediate in the production of vinyl chlor­
ide and other chemicals and to a lesser extent as a solvent. It was used as a scavenger
for tetraethyl lead in gasoline. It may enter surface waters via effluents from industries
that manufacture or use the substance. It may also enter groundwater, where it may
persist for long periods, following disposal in waste sites. It is found in urban air.

     IARC has classified 1,2-dichloroethane in Group 2B (possible human carcino-
gen). It has been shown to produce statistically significant increases in a number of
tumour types in laboratory animals, including the relatively rare haemangiosarcoma,
and the balance of evidence indicates that it is potentially genotoxic. Targets of 1,2-
dichloroethane toxicity in orally exposed animals included the immune system, cen-
tral nervous sytem, liver and kidney. Data indicate that 1,2-dichloroethane is less
potent when inhaled.

1,1-Dichloroethene
1,1-Dichloroethene, or vinylidene chloride, is used mainly as a monomer in the pro-
duction of polyvinylidene chloride co-polymers and as an intermediate in the syn-
thesis of other organic chemicals. It is an occasional contaminant of drinking-water,
usually being found together with other chlorinated hydrocarbons. There are no data
on levels in food, but levels in air are generally less than 40 ng/m3 except at some
manufacturing sites. 1,1-Dichloroethene is detected in finished drinking-water taken
from groundwater sources at median concentrations of 0.28–1.2 µg/l and in public
drinking-water supplies at concentrations up to 0.5 µg/l.

     1,1-Dichloroethene is a central nervous system depressant and may cause liver
and kidney toxicity in occupationally exposed humans. It causes liver and kidney
damage in laboratory animals. IARC has placed 1,1-dichloroethene in Group 3 (not
classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans). It was found to be genotoxic in a
number of test systems in vitro but was not active in the dominant lethal and micro-
nucleus assays in vivo. It induced kidney tumours in mice in one inhalation study but
was reported not to be carcinogenic in a number of other studies, including several in
which it was given in drinking-water.
     A health-based value of 140 μg/l (rounded value) can be calculated on the basis
of a TDI of 0.046 mg/kg body weight, derived using the benchmark dose (BMD)
approach from a study in which the critical effect was minimal hepatocellular mid-
zonal fatty change in female rats. However, this value is significantly higher than the
concentrations of 1,1-dichloroethene normally found in drinking-water. It is there-
fore considered unnecessary to set a formal guideline value for 1,1-dichloroethene in
drinking-water.

1,2-Dichloroethene
1,2-Dichloroethene exists in a cis and a trans form. The cis form is more frequently
found as a water contaminant. The presence of these two isomers, which are metab­
olites of other unsaturated halogenated hydrocarbons in wastewater and anaerobic
groundwater, may indicate the simultaneous presence of other organochlorine
chemicals, such as vinyl chloride. Accordingly, their presence indicates that more
intensive monitoring should be conducted. There are no data on exposure from
food. Concentrations in air are low, with higher concentrations, in the microgram
per cubic metre range, near production sites. The cis isomer was previously used as
an anaesthetic.

Guideline value               0.05 mg/l (50 µg/l)
Occurrence                    Has been found in drinking-water supplies derived from groundwater at

Additional comments         Data on the trans isomer were used to calculate a joint guideline value
                            for both isomers because toxicity for the trans isomer occurred at a lower
                            dose than for the cis isomer and because data suggest that the mouse is a
                            more sensitive species than the rat.

     There is little information on the absorption, distribution or excretion of 1,2-
dichloroethene. However, by analogy with 1,1-dichloroethene, 1,2-dichloroethene
would be expected to be readily absorbed, distributed mainly to the liver, kidneys and
lungs and rapidly excreted. The cis isomer is more rapidly metabolized than the trans
isomer in in vitro systems. Both isomers have been reported to cause increased serum
alkaline phosphatase levels in rodents. In a 3-month study in mice given the trans
isomer in drinking-water, there was a reported increase in serum alkaline phosphat­
ase and reduced thymus and lung weights. Transient immunological effects were also
reported, the toxicological significance of which is unclear. Trans-1,2-dichloroethene
also caused reduced kidney weights in rats, but at higher doses. Only one rat toxicity
study is available for the cis isomer, which produced toxic effects in rats similar in
magnitude to those induced by the trans isomer in mice, but at higher doses. There are
limited data to suggest that both isomers may possess some genotoxic activity. There
is no information on carcinogenicity.

Dichloromethane
Dichloromethane, or methylene chloride, is widely used as a solvent for many pur-
poses, including coffee decaffeination and paint stripping. Exposure from drinking-
water is likely to be insignificant compared with that from other sources.

Guideline value             0.02 mg/l (20 µg/l)
Occurrence                  Has been found in surface water samples at concentrations ranging
                            from 0.1 to 743 µg/l; levels usually higher in groundwater because
                            volatilization is restricted, with concentrations as high as 3600 µg/l

     Dichloromethane is of low acute toxicity. An inhalation study in mice provided
conclusive evidence of carcinogenicity, whereas drinking-water studies in rats and
mice provided only suggestive evidence. IARC has placed dichloromethane in Group
2B (possible human carcinogen); however, the balance of evidence suggests that it is
not a genotoxic carcinogen and that genotoxic metabolites are not formed in relevant
amounts in vivo.

1,2-Dichloropropane
1,2-Dichloropropane (CAS No. 78-87-5), or 1,2-DCP, is used as an insecticide fumi-
gant on grain and soil and to control peach tree borers. It is also used as an intermedi-
ate in the production of tetrachloroethene and other chlorinated products and as a
solvent. 1,2-DCP is relatively resistant to hydrolysis, is poorly adsorbed onto soil and
can migrate into groundwater.

     1,2-DCP was evaluated by IARC in 1986 and 1987. The substance was classified in
Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) on the basis of limited evi-
dence for its carcinogenicity in experimental animals and insufficient data with which to
evaluate its carcinogenicity in humans. Results from in vitro assays for mutagenicity were
mixed. The in vivo studies, which were limited in number and design, were negative. In
accordance with the IARC evaluation, the evidence from the long-term carcinogenicity
studies in mice and rats was considered limited, and it was concluded that the use of a
threshold approach for the toxicological evaluation of 1,2-DCP was appropriate.

     1,3 Dichloropropene is a direct-acting mutagen that has been shown to produce
forestomach tumours following long term oral gavage exposure in rats and mice.
Tumours have also been found in the bladder and lungs of female mice and the liver
of male rats. Long term inhalation studies in the rat have proved negative, whereas
some benign lung tumours have been reported in inhalation studies in mice. IARC has
classified 1,3 dichloropropene in Group 2B (possible human carcinogen).

Dichlorprop
The half-lives for degradation of chlorophenoxy herbicides, including dichlorprop

Dichlorvos
Dichlorvos (CAS No. 62-73-7) is a broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide
used primarily for controlling household pests and for protecting stored products
from insects. It is no longer approved for use in some jurisdictions because of con-
cerns over its acute toxicity. Dichlorvos is expected to be very mobile in soils. It is
rapidly degraded by microbial activity and hydrolysis in soil, and does not adsorb
to sediments. Degradation in water occurs primarily through hydrolysis. There are
relatively few studies on its occurrence in source waters. Exposure from food varies
widely, depending on local circumstances and usage. Dichlorvos can be inhaled from
its use as a domestic insecticide.

      As with other organophosphorus insecticides, the inhibition of cholinesterase ac-
tivity, causing neurotoxicity, is the most sensitive toxicological end-point following
acute or repeated exposures to dichlorvos. Dichlorvos is unlikely to be genotoxic in
vivo or to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. Some reproductive toxicity has been
observed in rats, but dichlorvos was not found to cause developmental toxicity or to
be teratogenic.

Dicofol
Dicofol (CAS No. 115-32-2) is an organochlorine acaricide that has been registered
for broad-spectrum contact, non-systemic control of plant-eating mites in cotton,
tea and a wide variety of fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops. Products containing
dicofol, which is manufactured from DDT, are being phased out in the USA and are
no longer approved for use in the European Union. Dicofol is unlikely to reach water,
but may do so if bound to particulate matter subject to runoff. Dicofol is only slightly
soluble in water and binds strongly to soil. There are few data on the occurrence of
dicofol in water. Exposure from food varies widely, depending on local circumstances
and usage. Dicofol has been proposed as a persistent organic pollutant under the
Stockholm Convention.

     The primary effects of dicofol after short- or long-term exposure of experimen-
tal animals were body weight reduction associated with decreased feed intake, and
increased liver weight accompanied by changes in liver enzyme activities. Dicofol
caused liver tumours in male mice at doses associated with significant enzyme induc-
tion and liver hypertrophy. However, on the basis of the absence of genotoxicity in an
adequate range of in vitro genotoxicity and in vivo chromosomal aberration tests, the
absence of carcinogenic effects in rats and the expectation that the adenomas pres-
ent in mice will exhibit a threshold, dicofol is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to
humans at anticipated dietary exposure levels. There is a margin of 20 000 between
the upper bound of the ADI and the LOAEL for liver adenomas in the male mouse.

Di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate
Di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate (DEHA) is used mainly as a plasticizer for synthetic resins
such as PVC. Reports of the presence of DEHA in surface water and drinking-water
are scarce, but DEHA has occasionally been identified in drinking-water at levels of a
few micrograms per litre. As a consequence of its use in PVC films, food is the most
important source of human exposure (up to 20 mg/day).

Reason for not establishing    Occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health
a guideline value              concern
Assessment date                2003
Principal reference            WHO (2003) Di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate in drinking-water


     DEHA is of low short-term toxicity; however, dietary levels above 6000 mg/kg
of feed induce peroxisomal proliferation in the liver of rodents. This effect is often
associated with the development of liver tumours. DEHA induced liver carcinomas
in female mice at very high doses, but not in male mice or rats. It is not geno-
toxic. IARC has placed DEHA in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity
to humans).
     A health-based value of 80 µg/l can be calculated for DEHA on the basis of a
TDI of 280 µg/kg body weight, based on fetotoxicity in rats, and allocating 1% of
the TDI to drinking-water. However, because DEHA occurs at concentrations well
below those of health concern, it is not considered necessary to derive a formal
guideline value.

Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate
Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is used primarily as a plasticizer. Exposure among
individuals may vary considerably because of the broad nature of products into which
DEHP is incorporated. In general, food will be the main exposure route.

Additional comments         The reliability of some data on environmental water samples is
                            questionable because of secondary contamination during sampling and

                            than 10-fold have been reported.

      In rats, DEHP is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In primates
(including humans), absorption after ingestion is lower. Species differences are also
observed in the metabolic profile. Most species excrete primarily the conjugated
mono-ester in urine. Rats, however, predominantly excrete terminal oxidation prod-
ucts. DEHP is widely distributed in the body, with highest levels in liver and adipose
tissue, without showing significant accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is low. The
most striking effect in short-term toxicity studies is the proliferation of hepatic per-
oxisomes, indicated by increased peroxisomal enzyme activity and histopathological
changes. The available information suggests that primates, including humans, are
far less sensitive to this effect than rodents. In long-term oral carcinogenicity stud-
ies, hepatocellular carcinomas were found in rats and mice. IARC has concluded that
DEHP is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). In 1988, JECFA evaluated
DEHP and recommended that human exposure to this compound in food be reduced
to the lowest level attainable. JECFA considered that this might be achieved by using
alternative plasticizers or alternatives to plastic material containing DEHP. In a variety
of in vitro and in vivo studies, DEHP and its metabolites have shown no evidence of
genotoxicity, with the exception of induction of aneuploidy and cell transformation.

Dimethoate
Dimethoate (CAS No. 60-51-5) is an organophosphorus insecticide used to control a
broad range of insects in agriculture, as well as the housefly. It has a half-life of 18 hours
to 8 weeks and is not expected to persist in water, although it is relatively stable at pH
2–7. A total daily intake from food of 0.001 µg/kg body weight has been estimated.

     In studies with human volunteers, dimethoate has been shown to be a cholin-
esterase inhibitor and a skin irritant. Dimethoate is not carcinogenic to rodents.
JMPR concluded that although in vitro studies indicate that dimethoate has muta-
genic potential, this potential does not appear to be expressed in vivo. In a multi­
generation study of reproductive toxicity in rats, the NOAEL appeared to be 1.2
mg/kg body weight per day, but there was some indication that reproductive per-
formance may have been affected at lower doses. No data were available to assess
whether the effects on reproductive performance were secondary to inhibition of
cholinesterase. JMPR concluded that it was not appropriate to base the ADI on the
results of the studies of volunteers, as the crucial end-point (reproductive perform­
ance) has not been assessed in humans. It was suggested that there may be a need
to re-evaluate the toxicity of dimethoate after the periodic review of the residue
and analytical aspects of dimethoate has been completed if it is determined that
omethoate is a major residue.

                              multistage modelling (because the compound clearly induces multiple

     1,4-Dioxane caused hepatic and nasal cavity tumours in rodents in most long-
term oral studies conducted. Tumours in peritoneum, skin and mammary gland were
also observed in rats given a high dose. Lung tumours were specifically detected after
intraperitoneal injection. Although cohort studies of workers did not reveal any ele­
vation in the incidence of death by cancer, a significant increase in the incidence of
liver cancer was found in a comparative mortality study. However, the evidence is
inadequate for human carcinogenicity assessment because of small samples or lack of
exposure data. A possibly weak genotoxic potential of 1,4-dioxane has been suggested.
IARC has classified 1,4-dioxane in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).

Diquat
Diquat (CAS No. 85-00-7; CAS No. 2764-72-9 for diquat ion) is a non-selective, quick-
acting contact herbicide that is used for weed control on several food crops, for resi-
dential weed control on lawns and ornamental plants, and as an aquatic herbicide
for the control of free-floating and submerged aquatic weeds in ponds and irrigation
ditches. It is highly soluble in water but is strongly adsorbed to soil and is resistant to
degradation in the sorbed state. Photochemical degradation in soil and water occurs
in the presence of sunlight. Exposure from food is likely to be low.

* When a formal guideline value is not established, a “health-based value” may be determined in order to provide
   guidance to Member States when there is reason for local concern. Establishing a formal guideline value for such
   substances may encourage Member States to incorporate a value into their national standards when this may be
   unnecessary.
** For more information on acute health-based values, see section 8.7.5.


     The eye is the main target organ following short-term repeated exposure in rats
and dogs. Effects on kidney, liver and haematological parameters are also observed.
Diquat is not carcinogenic in mice or rats. In tests for genotoxicity, diquat gave equivo-
cal or positive responses in the mammalian cell cytogenetic assay, but was negative
in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay and dominant lethal assay. No reproductive
effects were observed in a two-generation reproductive toxicity study in rats, and
diquat was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits.

Edetic acid
Human exposure to edetic acid, also known as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or
EDTA, arises directly from its use in food additives, medicines and personal care and

hygiene products. Exposure to EDTA from drinking-water will be mostly very low
in comparison with that from other sources. Once EDTA is present in the aquatic
environment, its speciation will depend on the water quality and the presence of trace
metals with which it will combine. The removal of EDTA from communal wastewater
by biodegradation in sewage purification plants is very limited.

Guideline value              EDTA (as the free acid): 0.6 mg/l (600 µg/l)
Occurrence                   Present in surface waters generally at concentrations below 70 µg/l,
                             although higher concentrations (900 µg/l) have been measured;
                             detected in drinking-water prepared from surface waters at
                             concentrations of 10–30 µg/l

Limit of detection           1 µg/l by potentiometric stripping analyis

Additional comments          Concern has been expressed over the ability of EDTA to complex and
                             therefore reduce the availability of zinc. However, this is of significance
                             only at elevated doses substantially in excess of those encountered in the
                             environment.
Assessment date              1998
Principal reference          WHO (2003) Edetic acid (EDTA) in drinking-water


     Calcium disodium edetate is poorly absorbed from the gut. The long-term
toxicity of EDTA is complicated by its ability to chelate essential and toxic metals.
Those toxicological studies that are available indicate that the apparent toxicological
effects of EDTA have in fact been due to zinc deficiency as a consequence of com-
plexation. EDTA does not appear to be teratogenic or carcinogenic in experimental
animals. The vast clinical experience of the use of EDTA in the treatment of metal
poisoning has demonstrated its safety in humans.

Endosulfan
Endosulfan (CAS No. 115-29-7) is an insecticide used in countries throughout the
world to control pests on fruit, vegetables and tea and on non-food crops such as
tobacco and cotton. In addition to its agricultural use, it is used in the control of the
tsetse fly, as a wood preservative and for the control of home garden pests. Endosulfan
contamination does not appear to be widespread in the aquatic environment, but
the chemical has been found in agricultural runoff and rivers in industrialized areas

where it is manufactured or formulated, as well as in surface water and groundwater
samples collected from hazardous waste sites in the USA. Surface water samples in the
USA generally contain less than 1 µg/l. The main source of exposure of the general
population is food, but residues have generally been found to be well below the FAO/
WHO maximum residue limits. Another important route of exposure to endosulfan
for the general population is the use of tobacco products.

     JMPR concluded that endosulfan is not genotoxic, and no carcinogenic effects
were noted in long-term studies using mice and rats. The kidney is the target organ
for toxicity. Several recent studies have shown that endosulfan, alone or in combination
with other pesticides, may bind to estrogen receptors and perturb the endocrine system.
A health-based value of 20 µg/l can be calculated for endosulfan on the basis of an ADI
of 0–0.006 mg/kg body weight, based on results from a 2-year dietary study of toxicity
in rats and supported by a 78-week study in mice, a 1-year study in dogs and a develop­
mental toxicity study in rats. However, because endosulfan occurs at concentrations well
below those of health concern, it is not considered necessary to derive a formal guideline
value.

Endrin
Endrin (CAS No. 72-20-8) is a broad-spectrum foliar insecticide that acts against a
wide range of agricultural pests. It is also used as a rodenticide. There is now very little
use of endrin. Small amounts of endrin are present in some foods, but the total intake
from food has decreased significantly.

Guideline value               0.0006 mg/l (0.6 µg/l)

Additional comments          Endrin is listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
                             Pollutants. Hence, monitoring may occur in addition to that required by
                             drinking-water guidelines.

    Toxicological data are insufficient to indicate whether endrin is a carcinogenic
hazard to humans. The primary site of action of endrin is the central nervous system.

Epichlorohydrin
Epichlorohydrin is used for the manufacture of glycerol, unmodified epoxy resins and
water treatment coagulant polymers and some ion exchange resins. No quantitative
data are available on its occurrence in food or drinking-water. Epichlorohydrin is
slowly hydrolysed in aqueous media.

Provisional guideline value 0.0004 mg/l (0.4 µg/l)
                             The guideline value is considered to be provisional because of the
                             uncertainties surrounding the toxicity of epichlorohydrin and the use of
                             a large uncertainty factor in deriving the guideline value.

Treatment performance        Conventional treatment processes do not remove epichlorohydrin.
                             Epichlorohydrin concentrations in drinking-water are controlled by
                             limiting either the epichlorohydrin content of polyamine flocculants or
                             the dose used, or both.

Additional comments          Although epichlorohydrin is a genotoxic carcinogen, the use of the
                             linearized multistage model for estimating cancer risk was considered
                             inappropriate because tumours are seen only at the site of administra‑
                             tion, where epichlorohydrin is highly irritating.

     Epichlorohydrin is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral, inhalation
or dermal exposure. It binds easily to cellular components. Major toxic effects are
local irritation and damage to the central nervous system. It induces squamous cell
carcinomas in the nasal cavity by inhalation and forestomach tumours by the oral
route. It has been shown to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. IARC has placed epi-
chlorohydrin in Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans).

Ethylbenzene
The primary sources of ethylbenzene in the environment are the petroleum industry
and the use of petroleum products. Because of its physicochemical properties, more
than 96% of ethylbenzene in the environment can be expected to be present in air.
Values of up to 26 µg/m3 in air have been reported. Ethylbenzene is found in trace
amounts in surface water, groundwater, drinking-water and food.

Guideline value            0.3 mg/l (300 µg/l)
Occurrence                 Concentrations in drinking-water generally below 1 µg/l; levels up to
                           300 µg/l have been reported in groundwater contaminated by point

     Ethylbenzene is readily absorbed by the oral, inhalation or dermal route. In hu-
mans, storage in fat has been reported. Ethylbenzene is almost completely converted
to soluble metabolites, which are excreted rapidly in urine. The acute oral toxicity is
low. No definite conclusions can be drawn from limited teratogenicity data. No data
on reproduction, long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity are available. Ethylbenzene has
shown no evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro or in vivo systems.

Fenitrothion
Fenitrothion (CAS No. 122-14-5) is mainly used in agriculture for controlling insects
on rice, cereals, fruits, vegetables, stored grains and cotton and in forest areas. It is also


                                                 368
                                       12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


used for the control of flies, mosquitoes and cockroaches in public health programmes
and indoor use. Fenitrothion is stable in water only in the absence of sunlight or
microbial contamination. In soil, biodegradation is the primary route of degrada-
tion, although photolysis may also play a role. Fenitrothion residues detected in water
were low (maximum 1.30 µg/l) during the spruce budworm spray programme. Fol-
lowing the spraying of forests to control spruce budworm, water samples did not
contain detectable amounts of fenitrothion; post-spray samples contained less than
0.01 µg/l. Levels of fenitrothion residues in fruits, vegetables and cereal grains decline
rapidly after treatment, with a half-life of 1–2 days. Intake of fenitrothion appears to
be primarily (95%) from food.

      On the basis of testing in an adequate range of studies in vitro and in vivo, JMPR
concluded that fenitrothion is unlikely to be genotoxic. It also concluded that fenitro-
thion is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. In long-term studies of tox­
icity, inhibition of cholinesterase activity was the main toxicological finding in all spe-
cies. A health-based value of 8 µg/l can be calculated for fenitrothion on the basis of
an ADI of 0–0.005 mg/kg body weight, based on a NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg body weight
per day for inhibition of brain and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity in a 2-year study
of toxicity in rats and supported by a NOAEL of 0.57 mg/kg body weight per day
for inhibition of brain and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity in a 3-month study of
ocular toxicity in rats and a NOAEL of 0.65 mg/kg body weight per day for reduced
food consumption and body weight gain in a study of reproductive toxicity in rats,
and allocating 5% of the upper limit of the ADI to drinking-water. However, because
fenitrothion occurs at concentrations well below those of health concern, it is not
considered necessary to derive a formal guideline value.

Fenoprop
The half-lives for degradation of chlorophenoxy herbicides, including fenoprop (CAS
No. 93-72-1), also known as 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy propionic acid or 2,4,5-TP, in the
environment are in the order of several days. Chlorophenoxy herbicides are not often
found in food.

      Chlorophenoxy herbicides, as a group, have been classified in Group 2B (pos-
sibly carcinogenic to humans) by IARC. However, the available data from studies in
exposed populations and experimental animals do not permit assessment of the car-
cinogenic potential to humans of any specific chlorophenoxy herbicide. Therefore,
drinking-water guidelines for these compounds are based on a threshold approach for
other toxic effects. Effects observed in long-term studies with dogs given fenoprop in
the diet include mild degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes and fibroblastic pro-
liferation in one study and severe liver pathology in another study. In rats, increased
kidney weight was observed in two long-term dietary studies.

Fluoride1
Fluorine is a common element that is widely distributed in Earth’s crust and exists in
the form of fluorides in a number of minerals, such as fluorspar, cryolite and fluorapa-
tite. Traces of fluorides are present in many waters, with higher concentrations often
associated with groundwaters. In some areas rich in fluoride-containing minerals, well
water may contain up to about 10 mg of fluoride per litre, although much higher con-
centrations can be found. High fluoride concentrations can be found in many parts of
the world, particularly in parts of India, China, Central Africa and South America, but
high concentrations can be encountered locally in most parts of the world. Virtually
all foodstuffs contain at least traces of fluorine. All vegetation contains some fluoride,
which is absorbed from soil and water. Tea in particular can contain high fluoride
concentrations, and levels in dry tea are on average 100 mg/kg.
      Fluoride is widely used in dental preparations to combat dental caries, particu-
larly in areas of high sugar intake. These can be in the form of tablets, mouthwashes,
toothpaste, varnishes or gels for local application. In some countries, fluoride may also
be added to table salt or drinking-water in order to provide protection against dental
caries. The amounts added to drinking-water are such that final concentrations are
usually between 0.5 and 1 mg/l. The fluoride in final water is always present as fluoride
ions, whether from natural sources or from artificial fluoridation.

    As fluoride is one of the chemicals of greatest health concern in some natural waters, its chemical fact sheet
    has been expanded.

     Total daily fluoride exposure can vary markedly from one region to another.
This will depend on the concentration of fluoride in drinking-water and the amount
drunk, levels in foodstuffs and the use of fluoridated dental preparations. In addition,
fluoride exposure in some areas is considerably higher as a consequence of a range of
practices, including the consumption of brick tea and the cooking and drying of food
with high-fluoride coal.

Guideline value            1.5 mg/l (1500 µg/l)
Occurrence                 In groundwater, concentrations vary with the type of rock through which
                           the water flows but do not usually exceed 10 mg/l; highest natural level
                           reported is 2800 mg/l
Basis of guideline value   Epidemiological evidence that concentrations above this value carry an
derivation                 increasing risk of dental fluorosis and that progressively higher concentra‑
                           tions lead to increasing risks of skeletal fluorosis. The value is higher than
                           that recommended for artificial fluoridation of water supplies, which is
                           usually 0.5–1.0 mg/l.

                           In setting national standards for fluoride or in evaluating the possible health
                           consequences of exposure to fluoride, it is essential to consider the intake
                           of water by the population of interest and the intake of fluoride from other
                           sources (e.g. from food, air and dental preparations). Where the intakes from
                           other sources are likely to approach, or be greater than, 6 mg/day, it would
                           be appropriate to consider setting standards at concentrations lower than
                           the guideline value.
                           In areas with high natural fluoride levels in drinking-water, the guideline
                           value may be difficult to achieve, in some circumstances, with the treatment
                           technology available.

     After oral uptake, water-soluble fluorides are rapidly and almost completely
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, although this may be reduced by complex
formation with aluminium, phosphorus, magnesium or calcium. There is no differ-
ence in absorption between natural or added fluoride in drinking-water. Fluoride in
inhaled particles—from high-fluoride coal, for example—is also absorbed, depending
on the particle size and solubility of the fluoride compounds present. Absorbed fluor­
ide is rapidly distributed throughout the body, where it is incorporated into teeth
and bones, with virtually no storage in soft tissues. Fluoride in teeth and bone can be

mobilized after external exposure has ceased or been reduced. Fluoride is excreted via
urine, faeces and sweat.
     Fluoride may be an essential element for humans; however, essentiality has not
been demonstrated unequivocally. Meanwhile, there is evidence of fluoride being a
beneficial element with regard to the prevention of dental caries.
     To produce signs of acute fluoride intoxication, minimum oral doses of about
1 mg of fluoride per kilogram of body weight were required. Many epidemiological
studies of possible adverse effects of the long-term ingestion of fluoride via drinking-
water have been carried out. These studies clearly establish that high fluoride intakes
primarily produce effects on skeletal tissues (bones and teeth). Low concentrations
provide protection against dental caries, both in children and in adults. The protective
effects of fluoride increase with concentration up to about 2 mg of fluoride per litre of
drinking-water; the minimum concentration of fluoride in drinking-water required to
produce it is approximately 0.5 mg/l. However, fluoride can also have an adverse ef-
fect on tooth enamel and may give rise to mild dental fluorosis (prevalence: 12–33%)
at drinking-water concentrations between 0.9 and 1.2 mg/l, depending on drinking-
water intake and exposure to fluoride from other sources. Mild dental fluorosis may
not be detectable except by specialist examination. The risk of dental fluorosis will
depend on the total intake of fluoride from all sources and not just the concentration
in drinking-water.
     Elevated fluoride intakes can have more serious effects on skeletal tissues. Skeletal
fluorosis (with adverse changes in bone structure) may be observed when drinking-
water contains 3–6 mg of fluoride per litre, particularly with high water consumption.
Crippling skeletal fluorosis usually develops only where drinking-water contains over
10 mg of fluoride per litre. IPCS concluded that there is clear evidence from India and
China that skeletal fluorosis and an increased risk of bone fractures occur at a total
intake of 14 mg of fluoride per day. This conclusion was supported by a review by the
United States National Research Council in 2006. The relationship between exposure
and response for adverse effects in bone is frequently difficult to ascertain because of
inadequacies in most of the epidemiological studies. IPCS concluded from estimates
based on studies from China and India that for a total intake of 14 mg/day, there is
a clear excess risk of skeletal adverse effects; and there is suggestive evidence of an
increased risk of effects on the skeleton at total fluoride intakes above about 6 mg/day.
     Several epidemiological studies are available on the possible association between
fluoride in drinking-water and cancer. IPCS evaluated these studies and concluded that,
overall, the evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals is inconclusive and that
the available evidence does not support the hypothesis that fluoride causes cancer in
humans; however, the data on bone cancer are limited. The results of several epidemio-
logical studies on the possible adverse effects of fluoride in drinking-water on pregnancy
outcome indicate that there is no relationship between the rates of Down syndrome or
congenital malformation and the consumption of fluoridated drinking-water.
     There is no evidence to suggest that the guideline value of 1.5 mg/l set in 1984
and reaffirmed in 1993 needs to be revised. Concentrations above this value carry an
increasing risk of dental fluorosis, and much higher concentrations lead to skeletal

fluorosis. The value is higher than that recommended for artificial fluoridation of
water supplies, which is usually 0.5–1.0 mg/l.
     In setting national standards or local guidelines for fluoride or in evaluating the
possible health consequences of exposure to fluoride, it is essential to consider the
average daily intake of water by the population of interest and the intake of fluoride
from other sources (e.g. from food and air). Where the intakes are likely to approach,
or be greater than, 6 mg/day, it would be appropriate to consider setting a standard or
local guideline at a concentration lower than 1.5 mg/l.

Practical considerations
Fluoride is usually determined by means of an ion-selective electrode, which makes
it possible to measure the total amount of free and complex-bound fluoride dis-
solved in water. The method can detect fluoride concentrations in water well below
the guideline value. However, appropriate sample preparation is a critical step in
the accurate quantification of fluoride, especially where only the free fluoride ion is
measured.
     A range of treatment technologies are available for both large and small supplies.
Different methods for small supplies are favoured in different countries; these are
based on bone charcoal, contact precipitation, activated alumina and clay. However, in
some areas with high natural fluoride levels in drinking-water, the guideline value may
be difficult to achieve in some circumstances with the treatment technology available.
Large supplies tend to rely on activated alumina or advanced treatment processes such
as reverse osmosis.

Formaldehyde
Formaldehyde occurs in industrial effluents and is emitted into air from plastic ma-
terials and resin glues. Formaldehyde in drinking-water results primarily from the oxi-
dation of natural organic matter during ozonation and chlorination. Concentrations
of up to 30 µg/l have been found in ozonated drinking-water. Formaldehyde can also
be found in drinking-water as a result of release from polyacetal plastic fittings. For­
maldehyde’s physicochemical properties suggest that it is unlikely to volatilize from
water, so exposure by inhalation during showering is expected to be low.

      Rats and mice exposed to formaldehyde by inhalation exhibited an increased
incidence of carcinomas of the nasal cavity at doses that caused irritation of the nasal
epithelium. Ingestion of formaldehyde in drinking-water for 2 years caused stomach
irritation in rats. Papillomas of the stomach associated with severe tissue irritation were
observed in one study. IARC has classified formaldehyde in Group 1 (carcinogenic to

humans). The weight of evidence indicates that formaldehyde is not carcinogenic by
the oral route.
     Owing to formaldehyde’s high reactivity, effects in the tissue of first contact fol-
lowing ingestion are more likely to be related to the concentration of the formal-
dehyde consumed than to its total intake. A tolerable concentration of 2.6 mg/l for
ingested formaldehyde has been established based on a NOEL of 260 mg/l for histo-
pathological effects in the oral and gastric mucosa of rats administered formaldehyde
in their drinking-water for 2 years, using an uncertainty factor of 100 (for interspecies
and intraspecies variation). In view of the significant difference between the expected
concentrations of formaldehyde in drinking-water and the tolerable concentration, it
is not considered necessary to set a formal guideline value for formaldehyde.

Glyphosate and AMPA
Glyphosate (CAS No. 1071-83-6) is a broad-spectrum herbicide used in both agri­
culture and forestry and for aquatic weed control. Microbial biodegradation of
glyphosate occurs in soil, aquatic sediment and water, the major metabolite be-
ing aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) (CAS No. 1066-51-9). Glyphosate
is chemically stable in water and is not subject to photochemical degradation. The
low mobility of glyphosate in soil indicates minimal potential for the contamina-
tion of groundwater. Glyphosate can, however, enter surface and subsurface waters
after direct use near aquatic environments or by runoff or leaching from terrestrial
applications.

     Glyphosate and AMPA have similar toxicological profiles, and both are con­
sidered to exhibit low toxicity. A health-based value of 0.9 mg/l can be derived based
on the group ADI for AMPA alone or in combination with glyphosate of 0–0.3 mg/
kg body weight, based upon a NOAEL of 32 mg/kg body weight per day, the high-
est dose tested, identified in a 26-month study of toxicity in rats fed technical-grade
glyphosate and using an uncertainty factor of 100 (for interspecies and intraspecies
variation).
     Because of their low toxicity, the health-based value derived for AMPA alone or
in combination with glyphosate is orders of magnitude higher than concentrations
of glyphosate or AMPA normally found in drinking-water. Under usual conditions,
therefore, the presence of glyphosate and AMPA in drinking-water does not represent
a hazard to human health. For this reason, the establishment of a formal guideline
value for glyphosate and AMPA is not deemed necessary.

Halogenated acetonitriles (dichloroacetonitrile, dibromoacetonitrile,
bromochloroacetonitrile, trichloroacetonitrile)
Halogenated acetonitriles are produced during water chlorination or chloramination
from naturally occurring substances, including algae, fulvic acid and proteinaceous
material. In general, increasing temperature or decreasing pH is associated with in-
creasing concentrations of halogenated acetonitriles. Ambient bromide levels appear
to influence, to some degree, the speciation of halogenated acetonitrile compounds.
Dichloroacetonitrile is by far the most predominant halogenated acetonitrile species
detected in drinking-water.

     IARC has concluded that dichloroacetonitrile, dibromoacetonitrile, bromo­
chloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetonitrile are not classifiable as to their carcinogen­
icity in humans. Dichloroacetonitrile and bromochloroacetonitrile have been shown
to be mutagenic in bacterial assays, whereas results for dibromoacetonitrile and tri-
chloroacetonitrile were negative. All four of these halogenated acetonitriles induced
sister chromatid exchange and DNA strand breaks and adducts in mammalian cells in
vitro but were negative in the mouse micronucleus test.
     The majority of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies of the halogenat­
ed acetonitriles were conducted using tricaprylin as a vehicle for gavage administration
of the compound under study. As tricaprylin was subsequently demonstrated to be a
developmental toxicant that potentiated the effects of trichloroacetonitrile and, pre-
sumably, other halogenated acetonitriles, results reported for developmental studies
using tricaprylin as the gavage vehicle are likely to overestimate the developmental
toxicity of these halogenated acetonitriles.

Dichloroacetonitrile
Dichloroacetonitrile induced decreases in body weight and increases in relative liver
weight in short-term studies. Although developmental toxicity has been demonstrated,
the studies used tricaprylin as the vehicle for gavage administration.

Dibromoacetonitrile
Dibromoacetonitrile is currently under analysis for chronic toxicity in mice and rats.
None of the available reproductive or developmental studies were adequate to use in
the quantitative dose–response assessment. The data gap may be particularly relevant
because cyanide, a metabolite of dibromoacetonitrile, induces male reproductive sys-
tem toxicity and because of uncertainty regarding the significance of the testes effects
observed in a 14-day NTP rat study.

Bromochloroacetonitrile
Available data are insufficient to serve as a basis for derivation of a guideline value for
bromochloroacetonitrile.

Trichloroacetonitrile
Available data are also insufficient to serve as a basis for derivation of a guideline value
for trichloroacetonitrile. The previous provisional guideline value of 1 µg/l was based
on a developmental toxicity study in which trichloroacetonitrile was administered by
gavage in tricaprylin vehicle, and a re-evaluation judged this study to be unreliable in
light of the finding in a more recent study that tricaprylin potentiates the develop-
mental and teratogenic effects of halogenated acetonitriles and alters the spectrum of
malformations in the fetuses of treated dams.

Hardness
Hardness in water is caused by a variety of dissolved polyvalent metallic ions, pre-
dominantly calcium and magnesium cations. It is usually expressed as milligrams of
calcium carbonate per litre. Hardness is the traditional measure of the capacity of

     Natural and treated waters have a wide range of mineral content, from very low
levels in rainwater and naturally soft and softened water to higher levels in naturally
hard waters. Bottled and packaged waters can be naturally mineralized or naturally soft
or demineralized. Thus, the mineral consumption from drinking-water and cooking
water will vary widely, depending upon location, treatment and water source.
     The degree of hardness of drinking-water is important for aesthetic acceptabil-
ity by consumers (see chapter 10) and for economic and operational considerations.
Many hard waters are softened for those reasons using several applicable technologies.
The choice of the most appropriate conditioning technology will depend on local cir-
cumstances (e.g. water quality issues, piping materials, corrosion) and will be applied
either centrally or in individual homes as a consumer preference.
     Consumers should be informed of the mineral composition of their water,
whether or not it is modified. The contribution of drinking-water minerals to mineral
nutrition should be considered where changes in supply are proposed or where less
traditional sources, such as recycled water, seawater or brackish water, are processed
and exploited for drinking-water. The treatments used remove most minerals, and
stabilization of water is always necessary prior to distribution.
     Drinking-water can be a contributor to calcium and magnesium intake and
could be important for those who are marginal for calcium and magnesium. Where
drinking-water supplies are supplemented with or replaced by demineralized water
that requires conditioning, consideration should be given to adding calcium and mag-
nesium salts to achieve concentrations similar to those that the population received
from the original supply. Modification of calcium and magnesium concentrations in
drinking-water for health reasons should comply with the technical requirements to
provide water suitable for distribution.
     Although there is evidence from epidemiological studies for a protective effect
of magnesium or hardness on cardiovascular mortality, the evidence is being debated
and does not prove causality. Further studies are being conducted. There are insuffi-
cient data to suggest either minimum or maximum concentrations of minerals at this
time, as adequate intake will depend on a range of other factors. Therefore, no guide-
line values are proposed.

Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide
Heptachlor (CAS No. 76-44-8) is a broad-spectrum insecticide, the use of which has
been banned or restricted in many countries. At present, the major use of heptachlor

is for termite control by subsurface injection into soil. Heptachlor is quite persistent in
soil, where it is mainly transformed to its epoxide. Heptachlor epoxide (CAS No. 1024-
57-3) is very resistant to further degradation. Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide bind
to soil particles and migrate very slowly. Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide have been
found in drinking-water at nanogram per litre levels. Diet is considered to represent
the major source of exposure to heptachlor, although intake is decreasing significantly,
as its use has substantially declined.

     Prolonged exposure to heptachlor has been associated with damage to the liver
and central nervous system toxicity. In 1991, IARC reviewed the data on heptachlor
and concluded that the evidence for carcinogenicity was sufficient in animals and in-
adequate in humans, classifying it in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).
A health-based value of 0.03 µg/l can be calculated for heptachlor and heptachlor
epoxide on the basis of a PTDI of 0.1 µg/kg body weight, based on a NOAEL for
heptachlor of 0.025 mg/kg body weight per day from two studies in the dog, taking
into consideration inadequacies of the database and allocating 1% of the PTDI to
drinking-water. However, because heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide occur at con-
centrations well below those of health concern, it is not considered necessary to derive
a formal guideline value. It should also be noted that concentrations below 0.1 µg/l are
generally not achievable using conventional treatment technology.

Hexachlorobenzene
The major agricultural application for hexachlorobenzene (CAS No. 118-74-1), or
HCB, was as a seed dressing for crops to prevent the growth of fungi, but its use is now
uncommon. At present, it appears mainly as a by-product of several chemical pro-
cesses or an impurity in some pesticides. HCB is distributed throughout the environ-
ment because it is mobile and resistant to degradation. It bioaccumulates in organisms
because of its physicochemical properties and its slow elimination. HCB is commonly
detected at low levels in food, and it is generally present at low concentrations in ambi-
ent air. It has been detected only infrequently, and at very low concentrations (below
0.1 µg/l), in drinking-water supplies.

      IARC has evaluated the evidence for the carcinogenicity of HCB in animals and
humans and assigned it to Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans). HCB has been
shown to induce tumours in three animal species and at a variety of sites. A health-
based value of 1 µg/l can be derived for HCB by applying the linearized multistage
low-dose extrapolation model to liver tumours observed in female rats in a 2-year
dietary study. Using an alternative (tumorigenic dose05, or TD05 ) approach, a TDI of
0.16 µg/kg body weight can be calculated, which corresponds to a health-based value of
approximately 0.05 µg/l, if one assumes a 1% allocation of the TDI to drinking-water.
It should be noted that concentrations in food have been falling steadily, and this al-
location factor may be considered very conservative.
      Because the health-based values derived from both of these approaches are con-
siderably higher than the concentrations at which HCB is detected in drinking-water
(i.e. sub-nanograms per litre), when it is detected, it is not considered necessary to
establish a formal guideline value for HCB in drinking-water. HCB is listed under the
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

Hexachlorobutadiene
Hexachlorobutadiene, or HCBD, is used as a solvent in chlorine gas production, a
pesticide, an intermediate in the manufacture of rubber compounds and a lubricant.
Concentrations of up to 6 µg/l have been reported in the effluents from chemical

Additional comments        The practical quantification limit for HCBD is of the order of 2 µg/l, but
                           concentrations in drinking-water can be controlled by specifying the

     HCBD is easily absorbed and metabolized via conjugation with glutathione. This
conjugate can be further metabolized to a nephrotoxic derivative. Kidney tumours
were observed in a long-term oral study in rats. HCBD has not been shown to be
carcinogenic by other routes of exposure. IARC has placed HCBD in Group 3 (not
classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans). Positive and negative results for
HCBD have been obtained in bacterial assays for point mutation; however, several
metabolites have given positive results.

Hydrogen sulfide
Hydrogen sulfide is a gas with an offensive “rotten eggs” odour that is detectable at very
low concentrations, below 0.8 µg/m3 in air. It is formed when sulfides are hydrolysed
in water. However, the level of hydrogen sulfide found in drinking-water will usually
be low, because sulfides are readily oxidized in well-aerated or chlorinated water.

Assessment date               1993
Principal reference           WHO (2003) Hydrogen sulfide in drinking-water


     The acute toxicity to humans of hydrogen sulfide following inhalation of the gas
is high; eye irritation can be observed at concentrations of 15–30 mg/m3. Although
oral toxicity data are lacking, it is unlikely that a person could consume a harmful
dose of hydrogen sulfide from drinking-water. Consequently, no guideline value is
proposed. However, hydrogen sulfide can be easily detected in drinking-water by taste
or odour (see chapter 10).

Inorganic tin
Tin is used principally in the production of coatings used in the food industry. Food,
particularly canned food, therefore represents the major route of human exposure
to tin. For the general population, drinking-water is not a significant source of tin,
and levels in drinking-water greater than 1–2 µg/l are exceptional. However, there is
increasing use of tin in solder, which may be used in domestic plumbing, and tin has
been proposed for use as a corrosion inhibitor.

     Tin and inorganic tin compounds are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract, do not accumulate in tissues and are rapidly excreted, primarily in faeces.

      No increased incidence of tumours was observed in long-term carcinogenicity
studies conducted in mice and rats fed tin(II) chloride. Tin has not been shown to be
teratogenic or fetotoxic in mice, rats or hamsters. In rats, the NOAEL in a long-term
feeding study was 20 mg/kg body weight per day.
      The main adverse effect on humans of excessive levels of tin in canned beverages
(above 150 mg/kg) or other canned foods (above 250 mg/kg) has been acute gastric
irritation. There is no evidence of adverse effects in humans associated with chronic
exposure to tin.
      In 1989, JECFA established a PTWI of 14 mg/kg body weight from a TDI of
2 mg/kg body weight on the basis that the problem with tin is associated with acute
gastrointestinal irritancy, the threshold for which is about 200 mg/kg in food. This
was reaffirmed by JECFA in 2000. In view of its low toxicity, the presence of tin in
drinking-water does not, therefore, represent a hazard to human health. For this rea-
son, the establishment of a guideline value for inorganic tin is not deemed necessary.

Iodine
Iodine occurs naturally in water in the form of iodide. Traces of iodine are produced
by oxidation of iodide during water treatment. Iodine is occasionally used for water
disinfection in the field or in emergency situations.

Reason for not establishing   Available data inadequate to permit derivation of health-based
a guideline value             guideline value, and lifetime exposure to iodine through water
                              disinfection is unlikely
Assessment date               1993
Principal reference           WHO (2003) Iodine in drinking-water


     Iodine is an essential element for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Estimates of
the dietary requirement for adult humans range from 80 to 150 µg/day; in many parts
of the world, there are dietary deficiencies in iodine, resulting in severe adverse effects
on neurological development. In 1988, JECFA set a provisional maximum tolerable
daily intake (PMTDI) for iodine of 1 mg/day (17 µg/kg body weight per day) from
all sources, based primarily on data on the effects of iodide. However, recent data
from studies in rats indicate that the effects of iodine in drinking-water on thyroid
hormone concentrations in the blood differ from those of iodide.
     Available data therefore suggest that derivation of a guideline value for iodine on
the basis of information on the effects of iodide is inappropriate, and there are few rel-
evant data on the effects of iodine. Because iodine is not recommended for long-term
disinfection, lifetime exposure to iodine concentrations such as might occur from
water disinfection is unlikely. For these reasons, a guideline value for iodine has not
been established at this time. There is, however, a need for guidance concerning the
use of iodine as a disinfectant in emergency situations and for travellers.

Iron
Iron is one of the most abundant metals in Earth’s crust. It is found in natural fresh
waters at levels ranging from 0.5 to 50 mg/l. Iron may also be present in drinking-water

during water distribution.

Assessment date                1993
Principal reference            WHO (2003) Iron in drinking-water


     Iron is an essential element in human nutrition, particularly in the iron(II) oxi-
dation state. Estimates of the minimum daily requirement for iron depend on age,
sex, physiological status and iron bioavailability and range from about 10 to 50 mg/
day.
     As a precaution against storage in the body of excessive iron, in 1983, JECFA es-
tablished a PMTDI of 0.8 mg/kg body weight, which applies to iron from all sources
except for iron oxides used as colouring agents and iron supplements taken during
pregnancy and lactation or for specific clinical requirements. An allocation of 10% of
this PMTDI to drinking-water gives a value of about 2 mg/l, which does not present a
hazard to health. The taste and appearance of drinking-water will usually be affected
below this level (see chapter 10).
     No guideline value for iron in drinking-water is proposed.

Isoproturon
Isoproturon (CAS No. 34123-59-6) is a selective, systemic herbicide used in the control
of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds in cereals. It can be photodegraded, hydro-
lysed and biodegraded and persists for periods ranging from days to weeks. It is mobile
in soil. There is evidence that exposure to this compound through food is low.

Guideline value               0.009 mg/l (9 µg/l)
Occurrence                    Has been detected in surface water and groundwater, usually at
                              concentrations below 0.1 µg/l; levels above 0.1 µg/l have occasionally

Principal reference           WHO (2003) Isoproturon in drinking-water


     Isoproturon is of low acute toxicity and low to moderate toxicity following short-
term and long-term exposures. It does not possess significant genotoxic activity, but
it causes marked enzyme induction and liver enlargement. Isoproturon caused an
increase in hepatocellular tumours in male and female rats, but this was apparent only
at doses that also caused liver toxicity. Isoproturon appears to be a tumour promoter
rather than a complete carcinogen.

Lead
Lead is used principally in the production of lead-acid batteries, solder and alloys. The
organolead compounds tetraethyl and tetramethyl lead have also been used extensively
as antiknock and lubricating agents in petrol, although their use for these purposes in
many countries has largely been phased out. Owing to the decreasing use of lead-
containing additives in petrol and of lead-containing solder in the food processing
industry, concentrations in air and food are declining; in most countries, lead levels
in blood are also declining unless there are specific sources, such as dust from leaded
paint or occupational/household recycling of lead-containing materials. Lead is rarely
present in tap water as a result of its dissolution from natural sources; rather, its pres-
ence is primarily from corrosive water effects on household plumbing systems con-
taining lead in pipes, solder or fittings (including alloy fittings with high lead content),
or from the service connections to homes. The amount of lead dissolved from the
plumbing system depends on several factors, including pH, temperature, alkalinity,
scale in pipe and standing time of the water, with soft, acidic water being the most
plumbosolvent. Free chlorine residuals in drinking-water tend to form more insoluble
lead-containing deposits, whereas chloramine residuals may form more soluble sedi-
ments in lead pipe. Accordingly, significant changes in the water quality of a supply,
resulting from, for example, changes in treatment or changes of source, can result in
changes in plumbosolvency or solubilization of lead deposits, or both.

Provisional guideline value   0.01 mg/l (10 µg/l)
                              The guideline value is designated as provisional on the basis of treatment
                              performance and analytical achievability. As this is no longer a health-
                              based guideline value, concentrations should be maintained as low as
                              reasonably practical. New sources of lead, such as service connections
                              and lead solder, should not be introduced into any system, and low lead
                              alloy fittings should be used in repairs and new installations.
Occurrence                    Concentrations in drinking-water are generally below 5 µg/l, although
                              much higher concentrations (above 100 µg/l) have been measured
                              where lead service connections or fittings are present. The primary
                              source of lead is from service connections and plumbing in buildings;
                              therefore, lead should be measured at the tap. Lead concentrations can
                              also vary according to the period in which the water has been in contact
                              with the lead-containing materials.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY



Basis of guideline       The guideline value was previously based on a JECFA PTWI, which
derivation               has since been withdrawn, and no new PTWI has been established,
                         on the basis that there does not appear to be a threshold for the key
                         effects of lead. However, substantial efforts have been made to reduce
                         lead exposure from a range of sources, including drinking-water. The
                         guideline value is maintained at 10 µg/l but is designated as provisional
                         on the basis of treatment performance and analytical achievabiilty
                         because it is extremely difficult to achieve a lower concentration than
                         this by central conditioning, such as phosphate dosing.
Limit of detection       1 µg/l by AAS; practical quantification limit in the region of 1–10 µg/l

                         Lead is exceptional compared with other chemical hazards, in that
                         most lead in drinking-water arises from lead service connections and
                         plumbing in buildings, and the remedy consists principally of removing
                         service connections, plumbing and fittings containing lead. This requires
                         much time and money, and it is recognized that not all water will
                         meet the guideline value immediately. Meanwhile, all other practical
                         measures to reduce total exposure to lead, including corrosion control,
                         should be implemented. In new installations or repairs, lead-free service
                         connections and solder and low lead alloy fittings should be used to
                         prevent the introduction of contamination.
                         The sampling protocol adopted – e.g. first draw, random daytime
                         sampling or flushed – will depend on the objective of taking the
                         samples. Where there is a need to verify that lead solder and/or high-lead
                         fittings have not been installed in new or repaired systems, the approach
                         used is to take a worst-case sample that reflects an extended period of
                         stagnation, to maximize the chance of identifying the presence of lead.

     Exposure to lead is associated with a wide range of effects, including various
neurodevelopmental effects, mortality (mainly due to cardiovascular diseases), im-
paired renal function, hypertension, impaired fertility and adverse pregnancy out-
comes. Impaired neurodevelopment in children is generally associated with lower
blood lead concentrations than the other effects, the weight of evidence is greater for
neurodevelopmental effects than for other health effects and the results across studies
are more consistent than those for other effects. For adults, the adverse effect associ-
ated with lowest blood lead concentrations for which the weight of evidence is great-
est and most consistent is a lead-associated increase in systolic blood pressure. JECFA
concluded that the effects on neurodevelopment and systolic blood pressure provided
the appropriate bases for dose–response analyses.
     Based on the dose–response analyses, JECFA estimated that the previously estab-
lished PTWI of 25 µg/kg body weight is associated with a decrease of at least 3 intel-
ligence quotient (IQ) points in children and an increase in systolic blood pressure of


                                              384
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


approximately 3 mmHg (0.4 kPa) in adults. These changes are important when viewed
as a shift in the distribution of IQ or blood pressure within a population. JECFA there-
fore concluded that the PTWI could no longer be considered health protective, and it
was withdrawn.
      Because the dose–response analyses do not provide any indication of a threshold
for the key effects of lead, JECFA concluded that it was not possible to establish a new
PTWI that would be considered to be health protective. JECFA reaffirmed that because
of the neurodevelopmental effects, fetuses, infants and children are the subgroups that
are most sensitive to lead.
      It needs to be recognized that lead is exceptional compared with other chemical
hazards, in that most lead in drinking-water arises from lead service connections and
plumbing in buildings, and the remedy consists principally of removing plumbing
and fittings containing lead, which requires much time and money. It is therefore em-
phasized that all other practical measures to reduce total exposure to lead, including
corrosion control, should be implemented. New sources of lead, such as lead service
connections and solder, should not be introduced into any system, and low lead alloy
fittings should be used in repairs and new installations.
      In terms of monitoring, if the monitoring objective is to identify the presence
of lead in the internal plumbing of a building, then the sample should be from the
tap. The sampling protocols also depend on the objective of taking the samples. First-
draw samples typically will have the highest lead concentrations, but this may not
be reflected in normal use if the same system provides water for toilet flushing, etc.
Flushed samples, in contrast, give consistent values, but reflect the minimum contact
time between the water and the lead-containing material. The random daytime sam-
ples, although most truly reflecting the water that the consumer drinks, give the most
variable levels; hence, it is necessary to collect more samples to determine the mean
level of exposure. Where there is a need to verify that lead service connections, lead
solder and/or high-lead fittings have not been installed in new or repaired systems,
the approach used is to take a worst-case sample that reflects an extended period of
stagnation and to maximize the chance of identifying the presence of lead. Extended
stagnation with sequential volume can also be used to identify sources or locations of
lead as an investigative activity.

Lindane
Lindane (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane; γ-HCH) (CAS No. 58-89-9) is used as an insecti-
cide on fruit and vegetable crops, for seed treatment and in forestry. It is also used as a
therapeutic pesticide in humans and animals. Several countries have restricted the use
of lindane. Lindane can be degraded in soil and rarely leaches to groundwater. In sur-
face waters, it can be removed by evaporation. Exposure of humans occurs mainly via
food, but this is decreasing. There may also be exposure from its use in public health
and as a wood preservative.


Guideline value              0.002 mg/l (2 µg/l)

Additional comments          It should be noted that concentrations in food have been falling steadily,

     Lindane was toxic to the kidney and liver after administration orally, dermally
or by inhalation in short-term and long-term studies of toxicity and reproductive
toxicity in rats. The renal toxicity of lindane was specific to male rats and was con-
sidered not to be relevant to human risk assessment, as it is a consequence of ac-
cumulation of α2u-globulin, a protein that is not found in humans. Hepatocellular
hypertrophy was observed in a number of studies in mice, rats and rabbits and was
reversed only partially after recovery periods of up to 6 weeks. Lindane did not induce
a carcinogenic response in rats or dogs, but it caused an increased incidence of aden­
omas and carcinomas of the liver in agouti and pseudoagouti mice, but not in black
or any other strains of mice, in a study of the role of genetic background in the latency
and incidence of tumorigenesis. JMPR concluded that there was no evidence of geno-
toxicity. In the absence of genotoxicity and on the basis of the weight of the evidence

from the studies of carcinogenicity, JMPR concluded that lindane is not likely to pose
a carcinogenic risk to humans. Further, in an epidemiological study designed to assess
the potential association between breast cancer and exposure to chlorinated pesti-
cides, no correlation with lindane was found.

Malathion
Malathion (CAS No. 121-75-5) is commonly used to control mosquitoes and a var­
iety of insects that attack fruits, vegetables, landscaping plants and shrubs. It can also
be found in other pesticide products used indoors, on pets to control ticks and in-
sects and to control human head and body lice. Under least favourable conditions
(i.e. low pH and little organic content), malathion may persist in water with a half-life
of months or even years. However, under most conditions, the half-life appears to be
roughly 7–14 days. Malathion has been detected in surface water and drinking-water
at concentrations below 2 µg/l.

     Malathion inhibits cholinesterase activity in mice, rats and human volunteers.
It increased the incidence of liver adenomas in mice when administered in the diet.
Most of the evidence indicates that malathion is not genotoxic, although some studies
indicate that it can produce chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange
in vitro. JMPR has concluded that malathion is not genotoxic.
     A health-based value of 0.9 mg/l can be calculated for malathion based on an al-

body weight per day in a 2-year study of toxicity and carcinogenicity in rats, using an
uncertainty factor of 100 for interspecies and intraspecies variation and supported by
a NOAEL of 25 mg/kg body weight per day in a developmental toxicity study in rab-
bits—to drinking-water. However, intake of malathion from all sources is generally low
and well below the upper limit of the ADI. As the chemical occurs in drinking-water
at concentrations much lower than the health-based value, the presence of malathion
in drinking-water under usual conditions is unlikely to represent a hazard to human
health. For this reason, it is considered unnecessary to derive a formal guideline value
for malathion in drinking-water.

Manganese
Manganese is one of the most abundant metals in Earth’s crust, usually occurring
with iron. It is used principally in the manufacture of iron and steel alloys, as an
oxidant for cleaning, bleaching and disinfection (as potassium permanganate) and
as an ingredient in various products. More recently, it has been used in an organic
compound, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, or MMT, as an octane

enhancer in petrol in North America. Manganese greensands are used in some loca-
tions for potable water treatment. Manganese is naturally occurring in many surface
water and groundwater sources, particularly in anaerobic or low oxidation condi-
tions, and this is the most important source for drinking-water. Manganese occurs
naturally in many food sources, and the greatest exposure to manganese is usually
from food.

Reason for not establishing   Not of health concern at levels normally causing acceptability problems
a guideline value             in drinking-water. However, there are circumstances where manganese
                              can remain in solution at higher concentrations in some acidic or
                              anaerobic waters, particularly groundwater.

     Manganese is an essential element for humans and other animals. Several epide-
miological studies have suggested that soluble manganese is associated with adverse
effects on learning in children. These findings remain to be confirmed and the as-
sociation has yet to be demonstrated as causal. Experimental animal data, especially
rodent data, are not appropriate for human risk assessment because the physiological
requirements for manganese vary among different species. Further, rodents are of
limited value in assessing neurobehavioural effects, because the neurological effects
(e.g. tremor, gait disorders) seen in primates are often preceded or accompanied by
psychological symptoms (e.g. irritability, emotional lability), that are not apparent
in rodents. The only primate study is of limited use in a quantitative risk assessment
because only one dose group was studied in a small number of animals and the man-
ganese content in the basal diet was not provided.
     A health-based value of 0.4 mg/l can be derived for manganese based on the up-
per range value of manganese intake of 11 mg/day, identified using dietary surveys, at
which there are no observed adverse effects, using an uncertainty factor of 3 to take
into consideration the possible increased bioavailability of manganese from water, al-
locating 20% of the TDI to drinking-water and assuming the consumption of 2 litres
of water per day by a 60 kg adult. As this health-based value is well above concentra-
tions of manganese normally causing acceptability problems in drinking-water (see
chapter 10), it is not considered necessary to derive a formal guideline value. Accord-
ingly, aesthetic as well as health aspects should be considered when setting national
standards and regulations, and confirming the acceptability of drinking-water. There
are circumstances, however, where manganese can remain in solution at higher con-
centrations in some acidic or anaerobic waters, particularly groundwater.

MCPA
MCPA is a phenoxyacetic acid herbicide that is found in various formulations: as the
free acid (CAS No. 94-74-6), as a dimethylamine salt (CAS No. 2039-46-5), as a
sodium salt (CAS No. 3653-48-3) and as a 2-ethylhexyl ester (CAS No. 29450-45‑1).
It is a post-emergence herbicide that is widely used against broadleaf weeds in agricul-

ture and horticulture and on grassland and lawns. All forms of MCPA will dissociate
in water to the acid (anion) form. MCPA is highly soluble in water. Biological degra-
dation is an important process in determining MCPA’s environmental fate. Chloro-
phenols and chlorocresols are potential soil metabolites and may, if present in water,
give rise to unacceptable tastes. Surface water may be contaminated via spray drift and
runoff, whereas groundwater may be contaminated via leaching from soil. Exposure
from food is likely to be low.

                              the fact that the available food exposure data, which suggest that
                              exposure via this route is low, do not generally include information from
                              developing countries, where exposure via this route may be higher

* When a formal guideline value is not established, a “health-based value” may be determined in order to provide
   guidance to Member States when there is reason for local concern. Establishing a formal guideline value for such
   substances may encourage Member States to incorporate a value into their national standards when this may be

     The target organs for the MCPA ion are the kidney, liver and blood. MCPA is not
carcinogenic in mice or rats, and the MCPA ion exhibits no genotoxic potential. In
multigeneration studies in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity up to
the highest dose tested. The MCPA ion was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits.

Mecoprop
The half-lives for degradation of chlorophenoxy herbicides, including mecoprop
(CAS No. 93-65-2; 7085-19-0 racemic mixture), also known as 2(2-methyl-chloro-
phenoxy) propionic acid or MCPP, in the environment are in the order of several days.
Chlorophenoxy herbicides are not often found in food.

                               detected, concentrations usually no greater than a few micrograms per

                             drinking-water



     Chlorophenoxy herbicides, as a group, have been classified in Group 2B (pos-
sibly carcinogenic to humans) by IARC. However, the available data from studies in
exposed populations and experimental animals do not permit assessment of the car-
cinogenic potential to humans of any specific chlorophenoxy herbicide. Therefore,
drinking-water guidelines for these compounds are based on a threshold approach for
other toxic effects. Effects of dietary administration of mecoprop in short-term and
long-term studies include decreased relative kidney weight (rats and dogs), increased
relative liver weight (rats), effects on blood parameters (rats and dogs) and depressed
body weight gain (dogs).

Mercury
Mercury is used in the electrolytic production of chlorine, in electrical appliances, in
dental amalgams and as a raw material for various mercury compounds. Methyla-
tion of inorganic mercury has been shown to occur in fresh water and in seawater,
although almost all mercury in uncontaminated drinking-water is thought to be in
the form of Hg2+. Thus, it is unlikely that there is any direct risk of the intake of or-
ganic mercury compounds, especially of alkylmercurials, as a result of the ingestion of
drinking-water. However, there is a possibility that methylmercury will be converted
into inorganic mercury. Food is the main source of mercury in non-occupationally
exposed populations; the mean dietary intake of mercury in various countries ranges
from 2 to 20 µg/day per person.

Guideline value              0.006 mg/l (6 µg/l) for inorganic mercury
Occurrence                   Mercury is present in the inorganic form in surface water and

•  weight                  60 kg adult
•  consumption             2 litres/day
Additional comments         A similar TDI may be obtained by applying an uncertainty factor of 1000
                            (an additional uncertainty factor of 10 for adjustment from a LOAEL to a
                            NOAEL) to the LOAEL for renal effects of 1.9 mg/kg body weight per day
                            in a 2-year NTP study in rats.
                            The current guideline value applies to inorganic mercury, which is the
                            form found in drinking-water, whereas the previous guideline value
                            applied to total (inorganic and organic) mercury.

                            WHO (2005) Mercury in drinking-water


     The toxic effects of inorganic mercury compounds are seen mainly in the kidney
in both humans and laboratory animals following short-term and long-term expo-
sure. In rats, effects include increased absolute and relative kidney weights, tubular
necrosis, proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia. In humans, acute oral poisoning results
primarily in haemorrhagic gastritis and colitis; the ultimate damage is to the kidney.
The overall weight of evidence is that mercury(II) chloride has the potential to in-
crease the incidence of some benign tumours at sites where tissue damage is apparent
and that it possesses weak genotoxic activity but does not cause point mutations.

Methoxychlor
Methoxychlor (CAS No. 72-43-5) is an insecticide used on vegetables, fruit, trees, fod-
der and farm animals. It is poorly soluble in water and highly immobile in most agri­
cultural soils. Under normal conditions of use, methoxychlor does not seem to be
of environmental concern. Daily intake from food and air is expected to be below 1
µg per person. Environmental metabolites are formed preferentially under anaerobic
rather than aerobic conditions and include mainly the dechlorinated and demethyl-
ated products. There is some potential for the accumulation of the parent compound
and its metabolites in surface water sediments.

Guideline value            0.02 mg/l (20 µg/l)

     The genotoxic potential of methoxychlor appears to be negligible. In 1979, IARC
assigned methoxychlor to Group 3. Subsequent data suggest a carcinogenic potential
of methoxychlor for liver and testes in mice. This may be due to the hormonal activity
of proestrogenic mammalian metabolites of methoxychlor and may therefore have a
threshold. The study, however, was inadequate, because only one dose was used and
because this dose may have been above the maximum tolerated dose. The database for
studies on long-term, short-term and reproductive toxicity is inadequate. A teratology
study in rabbits reported a systemic NOAEL of 5 mg/kg body weight per day, which is
lower than the LOAELs and NOAELs from other studies. This NOAEL was therefore
selected for use in the derivation of a TDI.

Methyl parathion
Methyl parathion (CAS No. 298-00-0) is a non-systemic insecticide and acaricide that
is produced throughout the world and has been registered for use on many crops,
in particular cotton. It partitions mainly to air and soil in the environment. There
is virtually no movement through soil, and neither the parent compound nor its
breakdown products will reach groundwater. By far the most important route for the
environmental degradation of methyl parathion is microbial degradation. Half-lives
of methyl parathion in water are in the order of weeks to months. Concentrations
of methyl parathion in natural waters of agricultural areas in the USA ranged up to
0.46 µg/l, with highest levels in summer. The general population can come into contact
with methyl parathion via air, water or food.

      A NOAEL of 0.3 mg/kg body weight per day was derived from the combined re-
sults of several studies conducted in humans, based on the depression of erythrocyte
and plasma cholinesterase activities. Methyl parathion decreased cholinesterase ac-
tivities in long-term studies in mice and rats, but did not induce carcinogenic effects.
Methyl parathion was mutagenic in bacteria, but there was no evidence of genotoxicity
in a limited range of studies in mammalian systems.

                              GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     A health-based value of 9 µg/l can be calculated for methyl parathion on the basis
of an ADI of 0–0.003 mg/kg body weight, based on a NOAEL of 0.25 mg/kg body
weight per day in a 2-year study in rats for retinal degeneration, sciatic nerve de-
myelination, reduced body weight, anaemia and decreased brain acetylcholinesterase
activity, using an uncertainty factor of 100 for interspecies and intraspecies variation.
As the toxicological end-points seen in experimental animals were other than acetyl-
cholinesterase inhibition, it was considered more appropriate to use these data rather
than the NOAEL derived for cholinesterase inhibition in humans.
     Intake of methyl parathion from all sources is generally low and well below the
upper limit of the ADI. As the health-based value is much higher than concentrations
of methyl parathion likely to be found in drinking-water, the presence of methyl para-
thion in drinking-water under usual conditions is unlikely to represent a hazard to hu-
man health. For this reason, the establishment of a formal guideline value for methyl
parathion is not deemed necessary.

Methyl tertiary-butyl ether
The major use of methyl tert-butyl ether, or MTBE, is as a gasoline additive. Surface
water can be contaminated by gasoline spills; however, owing to the high volatility of
MTBE, most is lost to evaporation. Spills and leaking storage tanks can cause more
serious problems in groundwater, where MTBE is more persistent. MTBE has been
detected in groundwater and drinking-water at concentrations in the nanogram to
microgram per litre range.

Reason for not establishing   Any guideline that would be derived would be significantly higher than
a guideline value             concentrations at which MTBE would be detected by odour

     No human cancer studies have been published for either the general population
or occupationally exposed cohorts. There have been a number of human studies of
neurological and clinical effects of exposure to MTBE by inhalation, with mixed re-
sults. In general, no objective changes could be seen at levels of MTBE normally found,
even in such microenvironments as gasoline filling stations.
     The weight of evidence suggests that MTBE is not genotoxic. A large number of
studies using in vitro and in vivo mammalian and non-mammalian systems have been
conducted to assess the mutagenicity of MTBE, almost all of which have produced
negative results. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of MTBE is more
likely to be non-genotoxic than genotoxic, although no one mechanism appears to
explain all of the observed effects.
     It has been concluded that MTBE should be considered a rodent carcinogen but
that it is not genotoxic, and the carcinogenic response is evident only at high levels of
exposure that also induce other adverse effects. The available data are therefore con-
sidered inconclusive and prohibit their use for human carcinogenic risk assessment.

A health-based guideline value has not been derived for MTBE, owing to the fact that
any guideline value that would be derived would be significantly higher than the con-
centration at which it would be detected by odour (15 µg/l is the lowest level eliciting
a response in a study using taste- and odour-sensitive participants).

Metolachlor
Metolachlor (CAS No. 51218-45-2) is a selective pre-emergence herbicide used on a
number of crops. It can be lost from the soil through biodegradation, photodegrada-
tion and volatilization. It is fairly mobile and under certain conditions can contaminate
groundwater, but it is mostly found in surface water.

     In a 1-year study in dogs, administration of metolachlor resulted in decreased
kidney weight at the two highest dose levels. In 2-year studies with rodents fed metola-
chlor in the diet, the only toxicological effects observed in mice were decreased body
weight gain and decreased survival in females at the highest dose level, whereas rats
showed decreased body weight gain and food consumption at the highest dose level.
There is no evidence from available studies that metolachlor is carcinogenic in mice.
In rats, an increase in liver tumours in females as well as a few nasal tumours in males
have been observed. Metolachlor is not genotoxic.

Molinate
Molinate (CAS No. 2212-67-1) is a herbicide used to control broad-leaved and grassy
weeds in rice. The available data suggest that groundwater pollution by molinate is
restricted to some rice growing regions. Data on the occurrence of molinate in the en-
vironment are limited. Molinate is of low persistence in water and soil, with a half life
of about 5 days.

     On the basis of the limited information available, molinate does not seem to be car-
cinogenic or mutagenic in experimental animals. Evidence suggests that impairment of
the reproductive performance of the male rat represents the most sensitive indicator of
molinate exposure. However, epidemiological data based on the examination of work-
ers involved in molinate production do not indicate any effect on human fertility.

Molybdenum
Molybdenum is found naturally in soil and is used in the manufacture of special steels
and in the production of tungsten and pigments, and molybdenum compounds are
used as lubricant additives and in agriculture to prevent molybdenum deficiency in
crops. Concentrations in drinking-water are usually less than 0.01 mg/l, although
concentrations as high as 200 µg/l have been reported in areas near mining sites.

Principal references           WHO (2011) Molybdenum in drinking-water


     Molybdenum is considered to be an essential element, with an estimated daily
requirement of 0.1–0.3 mg for adults.
     As molybdenum occurs at very low concentrations in drinking-water, it is not
considered necessary to set a formal guideline value. For guidance purposes, a health-
based value can be derived.
     In a 2-year study of humans exposed via drinking-water, the NOAEL was found to
be 0.2 mg/l, but there are some concerns about the quality of this study. As molybdenum
is an essential element, a factor of 3 is considered to be adequate to reflect intraspecies
variation. This gives a health-based value of 0.07 mg/l (rounded figure), which is in the
same range as that derived on the basis of the results of toxicological studies in experi-
mental animals and is consistent with the essential daily requirement for molybdenum.

    No evidence of carcinogenicity of monochloroacetate was found in 2-year gavage
bioassays with rats and mice. Monochloroacetate has given mixed results in a limited
number of mutagenicity assays and has been negative for clastogenicity in genotoxicity
studies. IARC has not classified the carcinogenicity of monochloroacetic acid.

Monochlorobenzene
Releases of monochlorobenzene (MCB) to the environment are thought to be mainly
due to volatilization losses associated with its use as a solvent in pesticide formula-
tions, as a degreasing agent and from other industrial applications. MCB has been de-
tected in surface water, groundwater and drinking-water; mean concentrations were
less than 1 µg/l in some potable water sources (maximum 5 µg/l) in Canada. The
major source of human exposure is probably air.

Principal reference          WHO (2004) Monochlorobenzene in drinking-water


    MCB is of low acute toxicity. Oral exposure to high doses of MCB results in effects
mainly on the liver, kidneys and haematopoietic system. There is limited evidence of

                                                 395

carcinogenicity in male rats, with high doses increasing the occurrence of neoplastic
nodules in the liver. The majority of evidence suggests that MCB is not mutagenic;
although it binds to DNA in vivo, the level of binding is low.
     A health-based value of 300 µg/l can be calculated for MCB on the basis of a TDI
of 85.7 µg/kg body weight, based on neoplastic nodules identified in a 2-year rat study
with dosing by gavage, and taking into consideration the limited evidence of carcino-
genicity. However, because MCB occurs at concentrations well below those of health
concern, it is not considered necessary to derive a formal guideline value. It should
also be noted that the health-based value far exceeds the lowest reported taste and
odour threshold for MCB in water.

MX
MX, which is the common name for 3-chloro-4-dichloromethyl-5-hydroxy-2­
(5H)‑furanone, is formed by the reaction of chlorine with complex organic matter
in drinking-water. It has been identified in chlorinated humic acid solutions and
drinking-water in Finland, the United Kingdom and the USA and was found to be
present in 37 water sources at levels of 2–67 ng/l. Five drinking-water samples from
different Japanese cities contained MX at concentrations ranging from less than 3 to
9 ng/l.

                              WHO (2003) MX in drinking-water


      MX is a potent mutagen in bacteria and in cells in vitro and has undergone a
lifetime study in rats in which some tumorigenic responses were observed. These data
indicate that MX induces thyroid and bile duct tumours. IARC has classified MX in
Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) on the basis of rat tumorigenicity and
its strong mutagenicity.
      A health-based value of 1.8 µg/l can be calculated for MX on the basis of the in-
crease in cholangiomas and cholangiocarcinomas in female rats using the linearized
multistage model (without a body surface area correction). However, this is signifi-
cantly above the concentrations that would be found in drinking-water, and, in view of
the analytical difficulties in measuring this compound at such low concentrations, it is
considered unnecessary to propose a formal guideline value for MX in drinking-water.

Nickel
Nickel is used mainly in the production of stainless steel and nickel alloys. Food is the
dominant source of nickel exposure in the non-smoking, non-occupationally exposed
population; water is generally a minor contributor to the total daily oral intake. How-
ever, where there is heavy pollution, where there are areas in which nickel that occurs
naturally in groundwater is mobilized or where there is use of certain types of kettles,

of non-resistant material in wells or of water that has come into contact with nickel-
or chromium-plated taps, the nickel contribution from water may be significant.

Guideline value              0.07 mg/l (70 µg/l)

Occurrence                   Concentration in drinking-water normally less than 0.02 mg/l, although
                             nickel released from taps and fittings may contribute up to 1 mg/l; in
                             special cases of release from natural or industrial nickel deposits in the
                             ground, concentrations in drinking-water may be higher

Treatment performance        20 µg/l should be achievable by conventional treatment (e.g. coagulation).
                             Where naturally occurring nickel is mobilized in groundwater, removal
                             is by ion exchange or adsorption. Where nickel leaches from alloys in
                             contact with drinking-water or from chromium- or nickel-plated taps,
                             control is by appropriate control of materials in contact with the drinking-
                             water and flushing taps before using the water.

Additional comments          Although the guideline value is close to the acute LOAEL, the LOAEL
                             is based on total exposure from drinking-water, and absorption from
                             drinking-water on an empty stomach is 10- to 40-fold higher than
                             absorption from food. Basing the total acceptable intake for oral
                             challenge from studies using drinking-water on an empty stomach in
                             fasted patients can therefore be considered a worst-case scenario.

                             A general toxicity value of 130 µg/l could be determined from a well-
                             conducted two-generation study in rats. However, this general toxicity
                             value may not be sufficiently protective of individuals sensitized to nickel,
                             for whom a sufficiently high oral challenge has been shown to elicit an
                             eczematous reaction.

     IARC concluded that inhaled nickel compounds are carcinogenic to humans
(Group 1) and that metallic nickel is possibly carcinogenic (Group 2B). However,
there is a lack of evidence of a carcinogenic risk from oral exposure to nickel. In a
well-conducted two-generation reproductive study in rats administered nickel by
gavage, a clear NOEL was observed for adult rats and their offspring for all the end-
points studied, including integrity and performance of male and female reproduct­
ive systems, growth and development of offspring and post-implantation/perinatal
lethality. Allergic contact dermatitis is the most prevalent effect of nickel in the general
population.

Nitrate and nitrite1
Nitrate (NO3−) is found naturally in the environment and is an important plant nutri-
ent. It is present at varying concentrations in all plants and is a part of the nitrogen
cycle. Nitrite (NO2−) is not usually present in significant concentrations except in a
reducing environment, because nitrate is the more stable oxidation state. It can be
formed by the microbial reduction of nitrate and in vivo by reduction from ingested
nitrate. Nitrite can also be formed chemically in distribution pipes by Nitrosomonas
bacteria during stagnation of nitrate-containing and oxygen-poor drinking-water in
galvanized steel pipes, or if chloramination is used to provide a residual disinfectant.
An excess of free ammonia entering the distribution system can lead to nitrification
and the potential increase of nitrate and nitrite in drinking-water. Nitrate can reach
both surface water and groundwater as a consequence of agricultural activity (includ-
ing excess application of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers and manures), from waste-
water disposal and from oxidation of nitrogenous waste products in human and other
animal excreta, including septic tanks. Nitrate can also occasionally reach ground-
water as a consequence of natural vegetation. Surface water nitrate concentrations
can change rapidly owing to surface runoff of fertilizer, uptake by phytoplankton and
denitrification by bacteria, but groundwater concentrations generally show relatively
slow changes. Nitrate and nitrite can also be produced as a result of nitrification in
source water or distribution systems.
     In general, the most important source of human exposure to nitrate and nitrite is
through vegetables (nitrate and nitrite) and through meat in the diet (nitrite is used as
a preservative in many cured meats). In some circumstances, however, drinking-water
can make a significant contribution to nitrate and, occasionally, nitrite intake. In the
case of bottle-fed infants, drinking-water can be the major external source of exposure
to nitrate and nitrite.

                           less likely to fluctuate. Concentrations often approach or exceed 50 mg/l
                           where there are significant sources of contamination. Nitrite levels are
                           normally lower, less than a few milligrams per litre.

derivation                 effects (methaemoglobinaemia or thyroid effects) were reported in
                           infants in areas where drinking-water consistently contained nitrate at
                           concentrations below 50 mg/l
                           Nitrite (bottle-fed infants): Based on: 1) no incidence of methaemoglobinaemia
                           at nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l (as nitrate ion) in drinking-water for
                           bottle-fed infants less than 6 months of age (assuming body weight of 2 kg);
                           2) converting 50 mg/l as nitrate to corresponding molar concentration for
                           nitrite; 3) multiplying by a factor of 0.1 to account for the estimated conver‑

                           for drinking-water of 100% or 1, as a bottle-fed infant’s primary exposure to
                           nitrite is through consumption of formula reconstituted with drinking-water
                           that contains nitrate or nitrite. As the guideline value is based on the most
                           sensitive subgroup of the population (bottle-fed infants less than 6 months

Treatment performance Nitrate: Effective central treatment technologies involve the physical/
                      chemical and biological removal of nitrate and include ion exchange,
                      reverse osmosis, biological denitrification and electrodialysis, which are
                      capable of removing over 80% of nitrate from water to achieve effluent
                      nitrate concentrations as low as 13 mg/l; conventional treatment processes
                      (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination) are not effective
                           Nitrite: Treatment usually focuses on nitrate, because nitrite is readily
                           converted to nitrate by many disinfectants
Additional comments        The guideline values for both nitrate and nitrite are based on short-term
                           effects; however, they are also considered protective for any possible long-
                           term effects .
                           Methaemoglobinaemia is complicated by the presence of microbial
                           contamination and subsequent gastrointestinal infection, which can
                           increase the risk for bottle-fed infants significantly. Authorities should
                           therefore be all the more vigilant that water to be used for bottle-fed infants
                           is microbiologically safe when nitrate is present at concentrations near or
                           above the guideline value. It is particularly important to ensure that these
                           infants are not currently exhibiting symptoms of gastrointestinal infection
                           (diarrhoea). Also, as excessive boiling of water to ensure microbiological
                           safety can concentrate levels of nitrate in the water, care should be taken
                           to ensure that water is heated only until it reaches a rolling boil. In extreme
                           situations, alternative sources of water (e.g. bottled water) can be used.
                           Nitrite is relatively unstable and can be rapidly oxidized to nitrate. Nitrite
                           can occur in the distribution system at higher concentrations when
                           chloramination is used, but the occurrence is almost invariably intermittent.
                           Methaemoglobinaemia is therefore the most important consideration, and
                           the guideline value derived for protection against methaemoglobinaemia
                           would be the most appropriate under these circumstances, allowing for any
                           nitrate that may also be present.

                       All water systems that practise chloramination should closely and regularly
                       monitor their systems to verify disinfectant levels, microbiological quality
                       and nitrite levels. If nitrification is detected (e.g. reduced disinfectant
                       residuals and increased nitrite levels), steps can be taken to modify the
                       treatment train or water chemistry in order to minimize nitrite formation.
                       Effective disinfection must never be compromised. Excessively high
                       levels may occur in small supplies; where this is suspected from the risk
                       assessment, testing may be appropriate.

     Absorption of nitrate ingested from vegetables, meat or water is rapid and in
excess of 90%; final excretion is in the urine. In humans, about 25% of ingested
nitrate is recirculated in saliva, of which about 20% is converted to nitrite by the ac-
tion of bacteria in the mouth. There is also endogenous formation of nitrate from
nitric oxide and protein breakdown as part of normal metabolism. In normal healthy
adults, this endogenous synthesis leads to the excretion of about 62 mg of nitrate ion
per day in the urine. Endogenous formation of nitrate or nitrite can be significantly
increased in the presence of infections, particularly gastrointestinal infections. When
nitrate intake is low, endogenous formation may be the major source of nitrate in
the body. Nitrate metabolism is different in humans and rats, as rats may not actively
secrete nitrate in their saliva.
     Nitrate probably has a role in protecting the gastrointestinal tract against a variety
of gastrointestinal pathogens, as nitrous oxide and acidified nitrite have antibacterial
properties. It may have other beneficial physiological roles. Hence, there may be a
benefit from exogenous nitrate uptake, and there remains a need to balance the
potential risks with the potential benefits.
     Significant bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite does not normally take place
in the stomach, except in individuals with low gastric acidity or with gastrointestinal
infections. These may include individuals using antacids, particularly those that block
acid secretion. In humans, methaemoglobinaemia is a consequence of the reaction of
nitrite with haemoglobin in the red blood cells to form methaemoglobin, which binds
oxygen tightly and does not release it, thus blocking oxygen transport. Although most
absorbed nitrite is oxidized to nitrate in the blood, residual nitrite can react with hae-
moglobin. High levels of methaemoglobin (>10%) formation in infants can give rise
to cyanosis, referred to as blue-baby syndrome. Although clinically significant meth-
aemoglobinaemia can occur as a result of extremely high nitrate intake in adults and
children, the most familiar situation is its occurrence in bottle-fed infants. This was
considered to be primarily a consequence of high levels of nitrate in water, although
there have been cases of methaemoglobinaemia in weaned infants, associated with
high nitrate intake from vegetables. Bottle-fed infants are considered to be at greater
risk because the intake of water in relation to body weight is high and, in infants,
the development of repair enzymes is limited. In clinical epidemiological studies of


                                              400
                                 12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


methaemoglobinaemia and subclinical increases in methaemoglobin levels associ-
ated with drinking-water nitrate, 97% of cases occurred at concentrations in excess
of 44.3 mg/l, with clinical symptoms associated with the higher concentrations. The
affected individuals were almost exclusively under 3 months of age.
     Although drinking-water nitrate may be an important risk factor for meth­
aemoglobinaemia in bottle-fed infants, there is compelling evidence that the risk of
methaemoglobinaemia is primarily increased in the presence of simultaneous gastro-
intestinal infections, which increase endogenous nitrite formation, may increase
reduction of nitrate to nitrite and may also increase the intake of water in combat-
ting dehydration. Cases have been described in which gastrointestinal infection seems
to have been the primary cause of methaemoglobinaemia. Most cases of methaemo­
globinaemia reported in the literature are associated with contaminated private wells
(predominantly when the drinking-water is anaerobic) that also have a high probabil-
ity of microbial contamination, which should not occur if it is properly disinfected.
     Although numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship
between exposure to nitrate or nitrite in drinking-water and cancer occurrence, the
weight of evidence does not support an association between cancer and exposure to
nitrate or nitrite per se. Nitrite can react with nitrosatable compounds, primarily sec-
ondary amines, in the body to form N-nitroso compounds. A number of these are
considered to be carcinogenic to humans, whereas others, such as N-nitrosoproline,
are not. Several studies have been carried out on the formation of N-nitroso com-
pounds in relation to nitrate intake in humans, but there is large variation in the intake
of nitrosatable compounds and in gastric physiology. Higher mean levels of N-nitroso
compounds, along with high nitrate levels, have been found in the gastric juice of
individuals who are achlorhydric (i.e. have very low levels of hydrochloric acid in the
stomach). However, other studies have been largely inconclusive, and there appears
to be no clear relationship with drinking-water nitrate compared with overall nitrate
intake in relation to formation of N-nitroso compounds. Moderate consumption of
a number of dietary antioxidant components, such as ascorbic acid and green tea,
appears to reduce endogenous N-nitrosamine formation.
     A significant number of epidemiological studies have been carried out on the
association of nitrate intake with primarily gastric cancers. Although the epidemio-
logical data are considered to be inadequate to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn
regarding all cancers, there is no convincing evidence of a causal association with any
cancer site. The weight of evidence indicates that there is unlikely to be a causal as-
sociation between gastric cancer and nitrate in drinking-water. This is consistent with
the conclusion by IARC that ingested nitrate or nitrite under conditions that result
in endogenous nitrosation is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A), but not
nitrate alone.
     There have been suggestions that nitrate in drinking-water could be associ­
ated with congenital malformations, but the overall weight of evidence does not sup-
port this.
     Nitrate appears to competitively inhibit iodine uptake, with the potential for an
adverse effect on the thyroid. Current evidence also suggests that exposure to nitrate
in drinking-water may alter human thyroid gland function by competitively inhibiting


                                           401
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


thyroidal iodide uptake, leading to altered thyroid hormone concentrations and func-
tions. Although studies found that exposure to nitrate concentrations above 50 mg/l
are weakly associated with altered thyroid function, the evidence is limited, conflicting
and based on studies with important methodological limitations. Mode of action data
suggest that pregnant women and infants are the most sensitive populations, owing
primarily to the importance of adequate thyroid hormones for normal neurodevelop-
ment in the fetus and infant, but also to increased thyroid hormone turnover and low
intrathyroidal stores in fetal and early life.
     There have been suggestions of an association between nitrate in drinking-water
and the incidence of childhood diabetes mellitus. However, subsequent studies have
not found a significant relationship, and no mechanism has been identified.
     In some studies on rats treated with high doses of nitrite, a dose-related hyper-
trophy of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal was seen; one strain of rats appeared to
be more sensitive than others. However, this minimal hyperplasia was considered
to be due to physiological adaptation to small fluctuations in blood pressure in re-
sponse to high nitrite doses.
     Nitrate is not carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Nitrite has been frequently
studied, and there have been suggestions of carcinogenic activity, but only at very
high doses. The most recent long-term studies have shown only equivocal evidence
of carcinogenicity in the forestomach of female mice, but not in rats or male mice. In
view of the lack of evidence for genotoxicity, this led to the conclusion that sodium
nitrite was not carcinogenic in mice and rats. In addition, as humans do not possess
a forestomach and the doses were high, the significance of these data for humans is
very doubtful.
     The guideline value for nitrate of 50 mg/l, as nitrate ion, is based on an absence of
health effects (methaemoglobinaemia and thyroid effects) in epidemiological studies
and is protective for bottle-fed infants and, consequently, other parts of the population.
Methaemoglobinaemia is complicated by the presence of microbial contamination and
subsequent gastrointestinal infection, which can increase the risk for this group sig-
nificantly. Authorities should therefore be all the more vigilant that water to be used
for bottle-fed infants is microbiologically safe when nitrate is present at concentrations
near the guideline value. It is particularly important to ensure that these infants are
not currently exhibiting symptoms of significant gastrointestinal infection (diarrhoea).
Also, as excessive boiling of water to ensure microbiological safety can concentrate
levels of nitrate in the water, care should be taken to ensure that water is heated only
until it reaches a rolling boil. In extreme situations, alternative sources of water (e.g.
bottled water) can be used.
     The guideline for nitrite of 3 mg/l, as nitrite ion, is based on: 1) no incidence of
methaemoglobinaemia at nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l in drinking-water
for bottle-fed infants less than 6 months of age (assuming body weight of 2 kg),
2) converting 50 mg/l nitrate to the corresponding molar concentration for nitrite,
3) multiplying by a factor of 0.1 to account for the estimated conversion rate of nitrate
to nitrite in infants where nitrite is formed endogenously from nitrate at a rate of
5–10% and 4) multiplying by a source allocation factor for drinking water of 100% or
1, as a bottle-fed infant’s primary exposure to nitrite is through consumption of for-


                                           402

mula reconstituted with nitrate- or nitrite-containing drinking-water. As the health-
based value is based on the most sensitive subgroup of the population (bottle-fed
infants less than 6 months of age), application of an uncertainty factor is not deemed
necessary.
     Because of the possibility of the simultaneous occurrence of nitrate and nitrite in
drinking-water, the sum of the ratios of the concentration (C) of each to its guideline
value (GV) should not exceed 1:

                            Cnitrate         Cnitrite
                                        +                ≤1
                            GVnitrate        GVnitrite

     The guideline values are based on short-term effects; however, they are also con-
sidered protective for long-term effects.

Practical considerations
The most appropriate means of controlling nitrate concentrations, particularly in
groundwater, is the prevention of contamination. This may take the form of appro-
priate management of agricultural practices (e.g. management of fertilizer and manure
application and storage of animal manures) and sanitation practices (e.g. the careful
siting of pit latrines and septic tanks, sewer leakage control).
      Methaemoglobinaemia has most frequently been associated with private wells. It
is particularly important to ensure that septic tanks and pit latrines are not sited near
a well or where a well is to be dug and to ensure that animal manure is kept at a suf-
ficient distance to ensure that runoff cannot enter the well or the ground near the well.
It is particularly important that the household use of manures and fertilizers on small
plots near wells should be managed with care to avoid potential contamination. The
well should be sufficiently protected to prevent runoff from entering the well. Where
there are elevated concentrations of nitrate or where inspection of the well indicated
that there are sources of nitrate close by that could be causing contamination, par-
ticularly where there are also indications that microbiological quality might also be
poor, a number of actions can be taken. As noted above, water should be heated only
until the water reaches a rolling boil or disinfected by an appropriate means before
consumption. Where alternative supplies are available for bottle-fed infants, these can
be used, taking care to ensure that they are microbiologically safe. Steps should then
be taken to protect the well and ensure that sources of both nitrate and microbial con-
tamination are removed from the vicinity of the well.
      In areas where household wells are common, health authorities may wish to take
a number of steps to ensure that nitrate contamination is not or does not become a
problem. Such steps could include targeting mothers, particularly expectant mothers,
with appropriate information about water safety, assisting with visual inspection of
wells to determine whether a problem may exist, providing testing facilities where a
problem is suspected, providing guidance on disinfecting water or, where nitrate levels
are particularly high, providing bottled water from safe sources or providing advice as
to where such water can be obtained.
      With regard to piped supplies, where nitrate is present, the first potential ap-
proach to treatment of drinking-water supplies, if source substitution is not feasible,

                                            403
                                     12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


is to dilute the contaminated water with a low-nitrate source. Where blending is not
feasible, a number of treatment techniques are available for drinking-water. The first
is disinfection, which may serve to oxidize nitrite to the less toxic nitrate as well as
minimize the pathogenic and non-pathogenic reducing bacterial population in the
water. Nitrate removal methods include ion exchange, biological denitrification, re-
verse osmosis and electrodialysis. However, there are disadvantages associated with
all of these approaches, including cost, operational complexities and the need for dis-
posal of resin, brine or reject water. Conventional municipal water treatment pro-
cesses (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination) are not effective for
nitrate removal, as nitrate is a stable and highly soluble ion with low potential for co-
precipitation and adsorption.
      In systems with a water source containing naturally occurring ammonia or that
add ammonia for chloramination, free ammonia entering the distribution system can
be one of the causative factors of nitrification and the potential increase of nitrate and
nitrite in the distribution system. Care should be taken with the use of chloramination
for providing a residual disinfectant in the distribution system. It is important to man-
age this to minimize nitrite formation, either in the main distribution system or in the
distribution systems of buildings.

Nitrilotriacetic acid, or NTA, is used primarily in laundry detergents as a replace-

     NTA is not metabolized in experimental animals and is rapidly eliminated, al-
though some may be briefly retained in bone. It is of low acute toxicity to experimental
animals, but it has been shown to produce kidney tumours in rodents following long-
term exposure to doses higher than those required to produce nephrotoxicity. IARC
has placed NTA in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans). It is not genotoxic,
and the reported induction of tumours is believed to be due to cytotoxicity resulting
from the chelation of divalent cations such as zinc and calcium in the urinary tract,
leading to the development of hyperplasia and subsequently neoplasia.

Nitrobenzene
Nitrobenzene is used primarily in the production of aniline, but it is also used as a sol-
vent, as an ingredient of metal polishes and soaps and in the synthesis of other organic
compounds, including acetaminophen. Nitrobenzene can be released to water during
these production processes.
     Concentrations of nitrobenzene in environmental samples, such as surface water,
groundwater and air, are generally low, except in areas with industrial pollution.
Based on limited data, it appears that the potential for contamination is greater for
groundwater than for surface water.
     The general population can be exposed to variable concentrations of nitrobenzene
in air and possibly drinking-water. Only populations in the vicinity of manufacturing
activities and petroleum refining plants are likely to have any significant exposure to
nitrobenzene; however, people living in and around abandoned hazardous waste sites
may also have potential for higher exposure, due to possible groundwater and soil
contamination and uptake of nitrobenzene by plants.

     Nitrobenzene is toxic to humans by the inhalation, dermal and oral routes of
exposure. The main systemic effect associated with human exposure to nitrobenzene
is methaemoglobinaemia. Although some recent studies have reported positive re-
sults in mutagenicity tests, it cannot be excluded that nitrobenzene is a non-genotoxic
chemical. No long-term oral administration studies are available. Based on inhalation
studies, IARC concluded that there was inadequate evidence in humans but suffi-
cient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of nitrobenzene and
classified nitrobenzene in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).
     Because nitrobenzene occurrence in drinking-water at concentrations above
trace levels is infrequent, it is not considered necessary to derive a formal guideline
value. However, health-based values can be calculated to provide guidance in the event

                                                   404

of spills and where there are higher concentrations in industrial areas. Two health-
based values are derived based on the limited available information: one for short-
term exposure (30 µg/l) and the other for long-term exposure (8–63 µg/l, depending
on end-point and approach used). It should be emphasized that the derivation of
the long-term health-based values includes large uncertainties because of the dose
metric conversion from inhalation studies and the possibility of increased metabolism
to aniline in the gastrointestinal tract.
     It should be emphasized that nitrobenzene is a potent methaemoglobinaemic
agent in humans, which is of particular concern for bottle-fed infants. Currently, data
are not adequate to determine a separate health-based value for this end-point.
     It should also be noted that the reported odour threshold for nitrobenzene in
water is 30–110 µg/l.

N-Nitrosodimethylamine
N-Nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA, can occur in drinking-water through the deg-
radation of dimethylhydrazine (a component of rocket fuel) as well as from several
other industrial processes. It is also a contaminant of certain pesticides. NDMA has
recently been identified as a disinfection by-product of chloramination (by the reac-
tion of monochloramine with dimethylamine, a ubiquitous component of waters af-
fected by wastewater discharges) and, to some extent, chlorination. NDMA can also be
formed as a by-product of anion exchange treatment of water.

                           provided that the water is not grossly contaminated. NDMA is not
                           removable by air stripping, activated carbon adsorption, reverse osmosis or
                           biodegradation.
Additional comments        Potential methods for reducing the formation of NDMA during disinfection
                           include avoiding the use of chloramination, use of breakpoint chlorination

     There is conclusive evidence that NDMA is a potent carcinogen in experimental
animals by several routes of exposure, including through ingestion of drinking-water.
NDMA has been classified by IARC as probably carcinogenic to humans. The mech­
anism by which NDMA produces cancer is well understood to involve biotransforma-
tion by liver microsomal enzymes, generating the methyldiazonium ion. This reactive
metabolite forms DNA adducts, with most evidence pointing to O 6-methylguanine as
the likely proximal carcinogenic agent. As a consequence of the clear evidence of car-
cinogenicity, there have been few studies of other possible toxicity end-points.
     There is also ample evidence that NDMA is genotoxic both in vivo and in vitro.
Activation by liver microsomal S9 fractions is necessary for a positive in vitro result.
The recent observation that human S9 fractions are much more active in promot-
ing genotoxicity in the Ames test than rat S9 fractions suggests that humans may be
especially sensitive to the carcinogenicity of NDMA.
     Although there have been several case–control studies and one cohort study of
NDMA in humans, none of them can be used to derive a quantitative risk of cancer.
The results are supportive of the assumption that NDMA consumption is positively
associated with either gastric or colorectal cancer. However, none of the studies fo-
cused on drinking-water as the route of exposure; instead, they used estimations of
total dietary intake of NDMA.

Parathion
Parathion (CAS No. 56-38-2) is a non-systemic insecticide that is used in many coun-
tries throughout the world. It is used as a fumigant and acaricide and as a pre-harvest
soil and foliage treatment on a wide variety of crops, both outdoors and in green-
houses. Parathion released to the environment will adsorb strongly to the top layer of
soil and is not likely to leach significantly. Parathion disappears from surface waters in
about a week. The general population is not usually exposed to parathion from air or
water. Parathion residues in food are the main source of exposure.

because of the availability of a NOAEL for erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase inhibition
in humans, which was 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day.
     Intake of parathion from all sources is generally low and well below the upper limit
of the ADI. As the health-based value is much higher than concentrations of parathion
likely to be found in drinking-water, the presence of parathion in drinking-water under
usual conditions is unlikely to represent a hazard to human health. For this reason, the
establishment of a formal guideline value for parathion is not deemed necessary.

Pendimethalin
Pendimethalin (CAS No. 40487-42-1) is a pre-emergence herbicide that is fairly im-
mobile and persistent in soil. It is used in large amounts in Japan (5000 tonnes per
year). It is lost through photodegradation, biodegradation and volatilization. The
leaching potential of pendimethalin appears to be very low, but little is known about
its more polar degradation products.

     In a short-term dietary study in rats, a variety of indications of hepatotoxicity
as well as increased kidney weights in males were observed at the highest dose level.
In a long-term dietary study, some toxic effects (hyperglycaemia in the mouse and
hepatotoxicity in the rat) were present even at the lowest dose level. On the basis of
available data, pendimethalin does not appear to have significant mutagenic activity.
Long-term studies in mice and rats have not provided evidence of carcinogenicity;
however, these studies have some important methodological limitations.

Pentachlorophenol
Pentachlorophenol (CAS No. 87-86-5), or PCP, and other chlorophenols are used pri-
marily for protecting wood from fungal growth. Food is usually the major source of
exposure to PCP unless there is a specific local contamination of drinking-water by
PCP or exposure from log homes treated with PCP.

Provisional guideline      0.009 mg/l (9 µg/l)
value
                           The guideline value is considered provisional because of the variations in
                           metabolism between experimental animals and humans.
Occurrence                 Concentrations in water samples are usually below 10 µg/l, although much
                           higher concentrations in groundwater may be measured under certain
                           conditions

                           interspecies differences in metabolism between experimental animals and
                           humans, with an important metabolite formed in rats being only a minor
                           metabolite in humans
Limit of detection         0.005–0.01 µg/l by GC with ECD

Additional comments        The concentration of PCP associated with a 10−5 upper-bound excess
                           lifetime cancer risk is similar to the guideline value established in the
                           second edition, so that guideline value is retained.

    IARC classified PCP in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) on the basis of
inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence in experimental
animals. There is suggestive, although inconclusive, evidence of the carcinogenicity of
PCP from epidemiological studies of populations exposed to mixtures that include PCP.
Conclusive evidence of carcinogenicity has been obtained in one animal species (mice).
Although there are notable variations in metabolism between experimental animals and
humans, it was considered prudent to treat PCP as a potential carcinogen.

Perchlorate
Perchlorate is a naturally occurring anion that is frequently detected in the environ-
ment. It is used primarily as an oxidizer for solid rocket fuels, automotive airbags,
fireworks and road flares. Perchlorate is found in water due to contamination from
perchlorate manufacturing or use, natural deposits of perchlorate, use of fertilizers
containing natural deposits of perchlorate, and natural formation of perchlorate in the
atmosphere and its deposition during rain or snow events. It also forms in hypochlo-
rite solutions to varying degrees, depending on the hypochlorite concentration, age
and storage conditions.

Guideline value              0.07 mg/l (70 µg/l)

     The primary effect of perchlorate is its ability to competitively inhibit uptake of
iodide by the thyroid gland. Inhibition of iodide uptake by perchlorate reduces the
amount of iodide available for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Sustained reduc-
tion in iodide uptake by the thyroid may result in hypothyroidism, which has adverse
implications for structural and functional brain development in the fetus, infant and
child, and for metabolism and the functioning of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
skeletal, neuromuscular and reproductive systems in adults. As the rat is not a good
model for humans for substances known to affect the thyroid and having a mode of
action involving inhibition of the uptake of iodide, the guideline value was derived
from human studies.

Petroleum products
Petroleum products are used in large quantities, primarily as fuels. They are complex
mixtures of chemicals derived from crude oil by distillation and fractionation. They
consist primarily of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, many of
which are of extremely low solubility in water. Petroleum products are widely stored
and handled and are often spilt. The primary concern for drinking-water is the poten-
tial for spills into source water, penetration of distribution systems and contamination
of drinking-water treatment works.

Reason for not establishing    Taste and odour will in most cases be detectable at concentrations

Assessment date                2004
Principal reference            WHO (2008) Petroleum products in drinking-water


     Exposure to the constituents of petroleum products through drinking-water is
frequently short term, as the result of an accidental spill or short-term incident. Such
incidents may lead to high concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons. However,

                                                    408a
                                     12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


a number of the most soluble aromatic hydrocarbons will be detectable by taste or
odour at concentrations below those concentrations of concern for health, particu-
larly for short-term exposure. Substances such as the alkyl benzenes and the alkyl
naphthalenes have taste and odour thresholds of a few micrograms per litre. In view of
the above, it is not considered appropriate to set a formal health-based guideline value
for petroleum products in drinking-water.
     In the event of a spill, it may be necessary to carry out a context-specific assess-
ment of the risk to health. The fact that petroleum products are complex mixtures of
many individual hydrocarbons is a complicating factor in determining the potential
risks to consumers. The traditional approach of evaluating individual chemicals in
assessing the risks from drinking-water is therefore largely inappropriate. In order to
overcome this difficulty, it is more practical to consider a series of hydrocarbon frac-
tions and to determine appropriate tolerable concentrations for those fractions. The
most widely accepted approach is that developed by the Total Petroleum Hydrocar-
bons Criteria Working Group in the USA, which divided total petroleum hydrocar-
bons into a series of aliphatic and aromatic fractions based on the number of carbon
atoms and the boiling point, to give equivalent carbon numbers.
     This pragmatic approach provides a suitable basis for assessing the potential
health risks associated with larger-scale contamination of drinking-water by petroleum
products. The allocation of 10% of each of the reference doses, equivalent to TDIs, for
the various fractions to drinking-water provides a conservative assessment of the risks.
Although the approach is based on the analysis of hydrocarbon fractions, most are of
low solubility, and the most soluble fractions, consisting largely of lower molecular
weight aromatic hydrocarbons, will be present in the greatest concentration.

pH
No health-based guideline value is proposed for pH. Although pH usually has no dir­
ect impact on consumers, it is one of the most important operational water quality
parameters (see chapter 10).

2-Phenylphenol and its sodium salt
2-Phenylphenol (CAS No. 90-43-7) is used as a disinfectant, bactericide and virucide.
In agriculture, it is used in disinfecting fruits, vegetables and eggs. It is also used as a
general surface disinfectant in hospitals, nursing homes, veterinary hospitals, poultry
farms, dairy farms, commercial laundries, barbershops and food processing plants.
2-Phenylphenol is readily degraded in surface waters, with a half-life of about 1 week
in river water.

      2-Phenylphenol has been determined to be of low toxicity. Both 2-phenylphenol
and its sodium salt are carcinogenic in male rats, and 2-phenylphenol is carcinogenic
in male mice. However, urinary bladder tumours observed in male rats and liver
tumours observed in male mice exposed to 2-phenylphenol appear to be threshold
phenomena that are species and sex specific. JMPR concluded that 2-phenylphenol
is unlikely to represent a carcinogenic risk to humans. Although a working group
convened by IARC classified 2-phenylphenol, sodium salt, in Group 2B (possibly
carcinogenic to humans) and 2-phenylphenol in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its
carcinogenicity to humans), JMPR noted that the IARC classification is based on
hazard identification, not risk assessment, and is furthermore limited to published
literature, excluding unpublished studies on toxicity and carcinogenicity. JMPR
also concluded that there are unresolved questions about the genotoxic potential of
2-phenylphenol.
      A health-based value of 1 mg/l can be calculated for 2-phenylphenol on the basis
of an ADI of 0–0.4 mg/kg body weight, based on a NOAEL of 39 mg/kg body weight
per day in a 2-year toxicity study on the basis of decreased body weight gain and
hyperplasia of the urinary bladder and carcinogenicity of the urinary bladder in male
rats, using an uncertainty factor of 100 for interspecies and intraspecies variation.
Because of its low toxicity, however, the health-based value derived for 2-phenyl-
phenol is much higher than concentrations of 2-phenylphenol likely to be found in
drinking-water. Under usual conditions, therefore, the presence of 2-phenylphenol
in drinking-water is unlikely to represent a hazard to human health. For this reason,
the establishment of a formal guideline value for 2-phenylphenol is not deemed ne­
cessary.

Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, form a class of diverse organic com-
pounds each containing two or more fused aromatic rings of carbon and hydro-
gen atoms. Most PAHs enter the environment via the atmosphere from a variety
of combustion processes and pyrolysis sources. Owing to their low solubility and
high affinity for particulate matter, they are not usually found in water in notable
concentrations. The main source of PAH contamination in drinking-water is usu-
ally the coal tar coating of drinking-water distribution pipes, used to protect the
pipes from corrosion. Fluoranthene is the most commonly detected PAH in drink-
ing-water and is associated primarily with coal tar linings of cast iron or ductile iron
distribution pipes. PAHs have been detected in a variety of foods as a result of the
deposition of airborne PAHs and in fish from contaminated waters. PAHs are also
formed during some methods of food preparation, such as char-broiling, grilling,

                                                 410

roasting, frying or baking. For the general population, the major routes of exposure
to PAHs are from food and ambient and indoor air. The use of open fires for heat-
ing and cooking, which is common especially in developing countries, may increase
PAH exposure. Where there are elevated levels of contamination by coal tar coatings
of water pipes, PAH intake from drinking-water could equal or even exceed that
from food.

Guideline value             Benzo[a]pyrene: 0.0007 mg/l (0.7 µg/l)
Occurrence                  PAH levels in uncontaminated groundwater usually in range 0–5 ng/l;

                            typical concentration range for sum of selected PAHs in drinking-water is
                            from about 1 ng/l to 11 µg/l

                            benzo[a]pyrene was examined following oral administration in mice, but
                            for which the number of dose groups was smaller, confirms this value

Treatment performance       0.05 µg/l should be achievable using coagulation
Additional comments         The presence of significant concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene in drinking-
                            water in the absence of very high concentrations of fluoranthene indicates
                            the presence of coal tar particles, which may arise from seriously deterior­
                            ating coal tar pipe linings.
                            It is recommended that the use of coal tar–based and similar materials
                            for pipe linings and coatings on storage tanks be discontinued.

     Evidence that mixtures of PAHs are carcinogenic to humans comes primarily
from occupational studies of workers following inhalation and dermal exposure.
No data are available for humans for the oral route of exposure. There are few data
on the oral toxicity of PAHs other than benzo[a]pyrene, particularly in drinking-
water. Relative potencies of carcinogenic PAHs have been determined by compari-
son of data from dermal and other studies. The order of potencies is consistent, and
this scheme therefore provides a useful indicator of PAH potency relative to that of
benzo[a]pyrene.

                              GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


     A health-based value of 4 µg/l can be calculated for fluoranthene on the basis of
a NOAEL of 125 mg/kg body weight per day for increased serum glutamate–pyruvate
transaminase levels, kidney and liver pathology, and clinical and haematological
changes in a 13-week oral gavage study in mice, using an uncertainty factor of 10 000
(100 for interspecies and intraspecies variation, 10 for the use of a subchronic study
and inadequate database and 10 because of clear evidence of co-carcinogenicity with
benzo[a]pyrene in mouse skin painting studies). However, this health-based value is
significantly above the concentrations normally found in drinking-water. Under usual
conditions, therefore, the presence of fluoranthene in drinking-water does not repre-
sent a hazard to human health. For this reason, the establishment of a formal guideline
value for fluoranthene is not deemed necessary.

Potassium
Potassium is an essential element in humans and is seldom, if ever, found in drinking-
water at levels that could be a concern for healthy humans. The recommended daily
requirement is greater than 3000 mg. Potassium occurs widely in the environment,
including all natural waters. It can also occur in drinking-water as a consequence of
the use of potassium permanganate as an oxidant in water treatment. In some coun-
tries, potassium chloride is being used in ion exchange for household water softening
in place of, or mixed with, sodium chloride, so potassium ions would exchange with
calcium and magnesium ions. Possible replacement or partial replacement of sodium
salts with potassium salts for conditioning desalinated water has been suggested. The
latter seems to be an unlikely development at this stage, in view of the cost difference.

Reason for not establishing   Occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health

Assessment date               2009
Principal reference           WHO (2009) Potassium in drinking-water


     Currently, there is no evidence that potassium levels in municipally treated drink-
ing-water, even water treated with potassium permanganate, are likely to pose any risk
for the health of consumers. It is not considered necessary to establish a health-based
guideline value for potassium in drinking-water.
     Although potassium may cause some health effects in susceptible individ­
uals, potassium intake from drinking-water is well below the level at which adverse
health effects may occur. Health concerns would be related to the consumption of
drinking-water treated by potassium-based water treatment (principally potassium
chloride for regeneration of ion exchange water softeners), affecting only individuals
in high-risk groups (i.e. individuals with kidney dysfunction or other diseases, such
as heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency,
pre-existing hyperkalaemia; people taking medications that interfere with normal
potassium-dependent functions in the body; and older individuals or infants). It is
recommended that susceptible individuals seek medical advice to determine wheth-
er they should avoid the consumption of water (for drinking or cooking) treated by
water softeners using potassium chloride.

     When high-risk individuals have been advised by a physician to avoid elevated
potassium intake from water, the recommended strategy is to limit the addition of
potassium to water that will be ingested or to avoid ingesting such water. This can be
done by having a proportion of the water bypass the softener altogether; this approach
is recommended by several countries. Although technologies are available to remove
potassium, they are generally more expensive and redundant when combined with the
softening treatment.

Propanil
Propanil (CAS No. 709-98-8) is a contact post-emergence herbicide used to con-
trol broad-leaved and grassy weeds, mainly in rice. It is a mobile compound with
affinity for the water compartment. Propanil is not, however, persistent, being easily
transformed under natural conditions to several metabolites. Two of these metabol­
ites, 3,4-dichloroaniline and 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachloroazobenzene, are more toxic and more
persistent than the parent compound. Although used in a number of countries, pro-
panil has only occasionally been detected in groundwater.

Reason for not establishing    Readily transformed into metabolites that are more toxic; a guideline
a guideline value              value for the parent compound is considered inappropriate, and there
                               are inadequate data to enable the derivation of guideline values for the
                               metabolites
Assessment date                2003
Principal reference            WHO (2003) Propanil in drinking-water


     Although a health-based value for propanil can be derived, this has not been
done, because propanil is readily transformed into metabolites that are more toxic.
Therefore, a guideline value for the parent compound is considered inappropriate,
and there are inadequate data on the metabolites to allow the derivation of guideline
values for them. Authorities should consider the possible presence in water of more
toxic environmental metabolites.

Selenium
Selenium is present in Earth’s crust, often in association with sulfur-containing min-
erals. Selenium is an essential trace element, and foodstuffs such as cereals, meat and
fish are the principal source of selenium for the general population. Levels in food
also vary greatly according to geographical area of production. However, even in high-
selenium areas, the relative contribution of selenium from drinking-water is likely to
be small in comparison with that from locally produced food.

Provisional guideline value 0.04 mg/l (40 µg/l)
                              The guideline value is designated as provisional because of the
                              uncertainties inherent in the scientific database.
Occurrence                    Most drinking-water contains concentrations of selenium that are much

                             adsorption, ion exchange, reverse osmosis and nanofiltration have been
                             reported.
Guideline value derivation
•  allocation to water       20% of upper tolerable intake
•  consumption               2 litres/day
Additional comments          It is important that a proper balance be achieved between recom‑
                             mended intakes and undesirable intakes in determining an appropriate
                             guideline value for selenium in drinking-water. While for most parts
                             of the world, the concentration of selenium in drinking-water will not
                             exceed 10 µg/l, there are circumstances in which selenium may be
                             elevated significantly above normal concentrations, and guidance may
                             be required. Where selenium intake from the diet is known, this should
                             be used in determining a concentration that ensures that intake is
                             safe and sufficient. Where selenium intake from the diet is not known,
                             guidance may be required.
                             For most Member States, a drinking-water guideline for selenium is
                             unnecessary. Where there are regions of high intake from a number of
                             sources, of which drinking-water may be one, then Member States should
                             take into consideration exposure from all sources in determining actions
                             to reduce exposure. For drinking-water, this may include using alternative
                             sources, blending low-selenium sources with high-selenium sources as
                             well as considering selenium removal.

     Selenium is an essential element for humans, and there are indications that sel­
enium status may be marginal in many parts of the world, including western Europe.
The potential for adverse effects from selenium deficiency appears to be dependent on
a number of factors, including overall health and nutritional status. Very low selenium
status in humans has been associated with a juvenile, multifocal myocarditis called
Keshan disease and a chondrodystrophy called Kaschin-Beck disease. Several studies
have also found blood selenium levels to be inversely associated with the prevalence
of several types of cancer.
     High intakes of selenium are also associated with a number of specific diseases
and the potential for adverse effects, but, again, this seems to be strongly influenced by
other factors. Symptoms in people with high urinary selenium levels included gastro-
intestinal disturbances, discoloration of the skin, decayed teeth, hair or nail loss, nail
abnormalities and changes in peripheral nerves. Slight biochemical changes have also
been observed. One case of selenium toxicity directly attributable to a water source
(well water containing selenium at a concentration of 9 mg/l) has been reported. The

average dietary intake that is associated with selenosis has been found to be in excess
of 900 µg/day.
     As selenium is an essential element, various national and international organiza-
tions have established recommended daily intakes of selenium. A joint FAO/WHO
consultation recommended intakes of 6–21 µg of selenium per day for infants and
children, according to age, 26 and 30 µg of selenium per day for adolescent females
and males, respectively, and 26 and 35 µg of selenium per day for adult females and
males, respectively.
     Because of concern about the adverse effects resulting from exposure to excessive
levels of selenium, various national and international organizations have established
upper limits of exposure for selenium. FAO/WHO established an upper tolerable limit
for selenium of 400 µg/day.

Silver
Silver occurs naturally, mainly in the form of its very insoluble and immobile oxides,
sulfides and some salts. It has occasionally been found in groundwater, surface water
and drinking-water at concentrations above 5 µg/l. Levels in drinking-water treated
with silver for disinfection may be above 50 µg/l. Recent estimates of daily intake are
about 7 µg per person.

Assessment date               1993
Principal reference           WHO (2003) Silver in drinking-water


     Only a small percentage of silver is absorbed. Retention rates in humans and
laboratory animals range between 0% and 10%.
     The only obvious sign of silver overload is argyria, a condition in which skin and
hair are heavily discoloured by silver in the tissues. An oral NOAEL for argyria in hu-
mans for a total lifetime intake of 10 g of silver was estimated on the basis of human
case reports and long-term experiments with laboratory animals.
     The low levels of silver in drinking-water, generally below 5 µg/l, are not relevant
to human health with respect to argyria. In contrast, special situations exist where sil-
ver salts may be used to maintain the bacteriological quality of drinking-water. Higher
levels of silver, up to 0.1 mg/l (this concentration gives a total dose over 70 years of half
the human NOAEL of 10 g), could be tolerated in such cases without risk to health.
     There are no adequate data with which to derive a health-based guideline value
for silver in drinking-water.

Simazine
Simazine (CAS No. 122-34-9) is a pre-emergence herbicide used on a number of crops
as well as in non-crop areas. It is fairly resistant to physical and chemical dissipation
processes in the soil. It is persistent and mobile in the environment.

     Simazine does not appear to be genotoxic in mammalian systems. Recent studies
have shown an increase in mammary tumours in the female rat but no effects in the
mouse. IARC has classified simazine in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity
to humans).

Sodium
Sodium salts (e.g. sodium chloride) are found in virtually all food (the main source
of daily exposure) and drinking-water. Although concentrations of sodium in pot­
able water are typically less than 20 mg/l, they can greatly exceed this in some coun-
tries. The levels of sodium salts in air are normally low in relation to those in food or
water. It should be noted that some water softeners can add significantly to the sodium
content of drinking-water.

Principal reference            WHO (2003) Sodium in drinking-water


     No firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the possible association between
sodium in drinking-water and the occurrence of hypertension. Therefore, no health-
based guideline value is proposed. However, concentrations in excess of 200 mg/l may
give rise to unacceptable taste (see chapter 10).

Sodium dichloroisocyanurate
Sodium dichloroisocyanurate is the sodium salt of a chlorinated hydroxytriazine and
is used as a source of free available chlorine, in the form of hypochlorous acid, for the
disinfection of water. It is widely used as a stable source of chlorine for the disinfection
of swimming pools and in the food industry. It is also used as a means of disinfecting
drinking-water, primarily in emergencies, when it provides an easy-to-use source of
free chlorine, and, more recently, as the form of chlorine for household point-of-use
water treatment.

Guideline values            Sodium dichloroisocyanurate: 50 mg/l (50 000 µg/l)
                            Cyanuric acid: 40 mg/l (40 000 µg/l)
Occurrence                  Where sodium dichloroisocyanurate is used for the disinfection of
                            drinking-water, exposure will be to both the chlorinated species and
                            residual cyanuric acid. The concentrations will relate directly to the
                            quantities added to achieve adequate disinfection.
TDI                         2.2 mg/kg body weight for anhydrous sodium dichloroisocyanurate and
                            1.54 mg/kg body weight for cyanuric acid, based on a NOEL of 154 mg/
                            kg body weight per day (equivalent to 220 mg/kg body weight per day
                            as anhydrous sodium dichloroisocyanurate) for urinary tract and cardiac
                            lesions from a 2-year study of rats exposed to sodium cyanurate and using
                            an uncertainty factor of 100 for interspecies and intraspecies variation
Limit of detection          0.001 mg/l by GC with flame thermionic specific detection; 0.05 mg/l by
                            reversed-phase LC with UV detection; 0.09 mg/l by GC with MS selective
                            ion monitoring
Treatment performance       At very high chlorine doses (up to 10 mg/l), the sodium cyanurate
                            concentration would be below 11 mg/l. In emergency situations, “topping
                            up” might be done in an attempt to maintain a free chlorine residual, but
                            this practice should be discouraged. In this case, it would be possible for
                            the sodium cyanurate concentration to build up to undesirable levels. In
                            such cases, it would be very desirable to monitor the concentration of
                            sodium cyanurate.
Guideline value derivation
•  allocation to water     80% of TDI
•  weight                  60 kg adult
•  consumption             2 litres/day
Additional comments         The controlling factors are the level of free chlorine and the residue of
                            cyanuric acid, particularly if there is topping up of chlorine in a static
                            system under emergency conditions. The concentration of free chlorine
                            should normally be such that it should not give rise to unacceptable
                            tastes and should not normally exceed the guideline value of 5 mg/l for
                            free chlorine.
                            Sodium dichloroisocyanurate used for disinfecting drinking-water should
                            be of adequate purity so that there is no increase in any inorganic or
                            organic contaminants in the drinking-water. The amounts of sodium
                            dichloroisocyanurate used should be the lowest consistent with
                            adequate disinfection, and the concentrations of cyanuric acid should be
                            managed to be kept as low as is reasonably possible.

     Studies of the toxicity of sodium cyanurate are appropriate for assessing the safety
of sodium dichloroisocyanurate, because any residues of intact sodium dichloroisocya­
nurate in drinking-water would be rapidly converted to cyanuric acid on contact with
saliva. Both sodium dichloroisocyanurate and sodium cyanurate have low acute oral
toxicity. Sodium cyanurate does not induce any genotoxic, carcinogenic or teratogenic
effects. The NOEL from which the guideline value was derived was based on multiple
lesions of the urinary tract (calculi and hyperplasia, bleeding and inflammation of the
bladder epithelium, dilated and inflamed ureters and renal tubular nephrosis) and
cardiac lesions (acute myocarditis, necrosis and vascular mineralization) in male rats
exposed at the next higher dose.

Styrene
Styrene, which is used primarily for the production of plastics and resins, is found in
trace amounts in surface water, drinking-water and food. In industrial areas, expos­
ure via air can result in intake of a few hundred micrograms per day. Smoking may
increase daily exposure by up to 10-fold.

     Following oral or inhalation exposure, styrene is rapidly absorbed and widely
distributed in the body, with a preference for lipid depots. It is metabolized to the
active intermediate styrene-7,8-oxide, which is conjugated with glutathione or further
metabolized. Metabolites are rapidly and almost completely excreted in urine. Styrene

has a low acute toxicity. In short-term toxicity studies in rats, impairment of glutathi-
one transferase activity and reduced glutathione concentrations were observed. In in
vitro tests, styrene has been shown to be mutagenic in the presence of metabolic acti-
vation only. In in vitro as well as in vivo studies, chromosomal aberrations have been
observed, mostly at high doses of styrene. The reactive intermediate styrene-7,8-oxide
is a direct-acting mutagen. In long-term studies, orally administered styrene increased
the incidence of lung tumours in mice at high dose levels but had no carcinogenic effect
in rats. Styrene-7,8-oxide was carcinogenic in rats after oral administration. IARC has
classified styrene in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans). The available data
suggest that the carcinogenicity of styrene is due to overloading of the detoxification
mechanism for styrene-7,8-oxide (e.g. glutathione depletion).

Sulfate
Sulfates occur naturally in numerous minerals and are used commercially, principal-
ly in the chemical industry. They are discharged into water in industrial wastes and
through atmospheric deposition; however, the highest levels usually occur in ground-
water and are from natural sources. In general, the average daily intake of sulfate from
drinking-water, air and food is approximately 500 mg, food being the major source.
However, in areas with drinking-water supplies containing high levels of sulfate,
drinking-water may constitute the principal source of intake.


Reason for not establishing   Not of health concern at levels found in drinking-water

Assessment date               2003
Principal reference           WHO (2004) Sulfate in drinking-water


     The existing data do not identify a level of sulfate in drinking-water that is likely to
cause adverse human health effects. The data from a liquid diet study with piglets and
from tap water studies with human volunteers indicate a laxative effect at concentrations
of 1000–1200 mg/l, but no increase in diarrhoea, dehydration or weight loss.
     No health-based guideline is proposed for sulfate. However, because of the gastro-
intestinal effects resulting from ingestion of drinking-water containing high sulfate
levels, it is recommended that health authorities be notified of sources of drinking-
water that contain sulfate concentrations in excess of 500 mg/l. The presence of sulfate
in drinking-water may also cause noticeable taste (see chapter 10) and may contribute
to the corrosion of distribution systems.

2,4,5-T
The half-lives for degradation of chlorophenoxy herbicides, including 2,4,5-T (CAS

     Chlorophenoxy herbicides, as a group, have been classified in Group 2B (pos-
sibly carcinogenic to humans) by IARC. However, the available data from studies in
exposed populations and experimental animals do not permit assessment of the car-
cinogenic potential to humans of any specific chlorophenoxy herbicide. Therefore,
drinking-water guidelines for these compounds are based on a threshold approach
for other toxic effects. The NOAEL for reproductive effects (reduced neonatal sur-
vival, decreased fertility, reduced relative liver weights and thymus weights in litters)
of dioxin-free (< 0.03 µg/kg) 2,4,5-T in a three-generation reproduction study in rats
is the same as the NOAEL for reduced body weight gain, increased liver and kidney
weights and renal toxicity in a toxicity study in which rats were fed 2,4,5-T (practically
free from dioxin contamination) in the diet for 2 years.

depends on the presence of sediments and biological activity.

    There is no evidence that TBA is carcinogenic or mutagenic. In long-term dietary
studies in rats, effects on red blood cell parameters in females, an increased incidence
of non-neoplastic lesions in the liver, lung, thyroid and testis and a slight decrease in
body weight gain were observed.

Tetrachloroethene
Tetrachloroethene has been used primarily as a solvent in dry cleaning industries and
to a lesser extent as a degreasing solvent. It is widespread in the environment and is
found in trace amounts in water, aquatic organisms, air, foodstuffs and human tissue.
The highest environmental levels of tetrachloroethene are found in the commercial
dry cleaning and metal degreasing industries. Emissions can sometimes lead to high
concentrations in groundwater. Tetrachloroethene in anaerobic groundwater may
degrade to more toxic compounds, including vinyl chloride.


Guideline value              0.04 mg/l (40 µg/l)

     At high concentrations, tetrachloroethene causes central nervous system depres-
sion. Lower concentrations of tetrachloroethene have been reported to damage the
liver and the kidneys. IARC has classified tetrachloroethene in Group 2A (probably
carcinogenic to humans). Tetrachloroethene has been reported to produce liver tu-
mours in male and female mice, with some evidence of mononuclear cell leukaemia
in male and female rats and kidney tumours in male rats. The overall evidence from
studies conducted to assess the genotoxicity of tetrachloroethene, including induction
of single-strand DNA breaks, mutation in germ cells and chromosomal aberrations in
vitro and in vivo, indicates that tetrachloroethene is not genotoxic.

Toluene
Most toluene (in the form of benzene–toluene–ethylbenzene–xylene mixtures) is used
in the blending of petrol. It is also used as a solvent and as a raw material in chemical
production. The main exposure is via air. Exposure is increased by smoking and in
traffic.

Guideline value             0.7 mg/l (700 µg/l)
Occurrence                  Concentrations of a few micrograms per litre have been found in surface
                            water, groundwater and drinking-water; point emissions can lead to
                            higher concentrations in groundwater (up to 1 mg/l); it may also penetrate
                            plastic pipes from contaminated soil

Additional comments         The guideline value exceeds the lowest reported odour threshold for
                            toluene in water.
Assessment date             2003
Principal reference         WHO (2003) Toluene in drinking-water


     Toluene is absorbed completely from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly dis-
tributed in the body, with a preference for adipose tissue. Toluene is rapidly metabol­
ized and, following conjugation, excreted predominantly in urine. With occupational
exposure to toluene by inhalation, impairment of the central nervous system and irri­
tation of mucous membranes are observed. The acute oral toxicity is low. Toluene
exerts embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects, but there is no clear evidence of teratogenic
activity in laboratory animals and humans. In long-term inhalation studies in rats


                                                  422

and mice, there is no evidence for carcinogenicity of toluene. Genotoxicity tests in
vitro were negative, whereas in vivo assays showed conflicting results with respect to
chromosomal aberrations. IARC has concluded that there is inadequate evidence for
the carcinogenicity of toluene in both experimental animals and humans and classi-
fied it as Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans).

Total dissolved solids
Total dissolved solids (TDS) comprise inorganic salts (principally calcium, magne-
sium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates) and small amounts
of organic matter that are dissolved in water. TDS in drinking-water originates from
natural sources, sewage, urban runoff and industrial wastewater. Salts used for road
de-icing in some countries may also contribute to the TDS content of drinking-water.
Concentrations of TDS in water vary considerably in different geological regions
owing to differences in the solubilities of minerals.

Reason for not establishing    Not of health concern at levels found in drinking-water

Additional comments            May affect acceptability of drinking-water
Assessment date                1993

     Reliable data on possible health effects associated with the ingestion of TDS in
drinking-water are not available, and no health-based guideline value is proposed.
However, the presence of high levels of TDS in drinking-water may be objectionable
to consumers (see chapter 10).

Trichloroacetic acid
Chlorinated acetic acids are formed from organic material during water chlorination.

Treatment performance         Concentrations may be reduced by installing or optimizing coagulation
                              to remove precursors or by controlling the pH during chlorination.

Additional comments           A similar TDI for trichloroacetate was established by IPCS based on a
                              NOAEL for hepatic toxicity in a long-term study in mice.
Assessment date               2003
Principal reference           WHO (2003) Trichloroacetic acid in drinking-water


     Trichloroacetic acid has been shown to induce tumours in the liver of mice. It has
given mixed results in in vitro assays for mutations and chromosomal aberrations and
has been reported to cause chromosomal aberrations in in vivo studies. IARC has classi-
fied trichloroacetic acid in Group 3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.
The weight of evidence indicates that trichloroacetic acid is not a genotoxic carcinogen.

Trichlorobenzenes (total)
Releases of trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) into the environment occur through their
manufacture and use as industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and solvents.
TCBs are found in drinking-water, but rarely at levels above 1 µg/l. General population
exposure will primarily result from air and food.

Reason for not establishing    Occur in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health
a guideline value              concern, and health-based value would exceed lowest reported odour
                               threshold
Assessment date                2003
Principal reference            WHO (2003) Trichlorobenzenes in drinking-water


     The TCBs are of moderate acute toxicity. After short-term oral exposure, all three
isomers show similar toxic effects, predominantly on the liver. Long-term toxicity
and carcinogenicity studies via the oral route have not been carried out, but the data
available suggest that all three isomers are non-genotoxic.
     A health-based value of 20 µg/l can be calculated for total TCBs on the basis of a
TDI of 7.7 µg/kg body weight, based on liver toxicity identified in a 13-week rat study,
taking into consideration the short duration of the study. However, because TCBs
occur at concentrations well below those of health concern, it is not considered neces-
sary to derive a formal guideline value. It should be noted that the health-based value
exceeds the lowest reported odour threshold in water.

1,1,1-Trichloroethane
1,1,1-Trichloroethane is widely used as a cleaning solvent for electrical equipment, as
a solvent for adhesives, coatings and textile dyes and as a coolant and lubricant. It is

                                                   424
                                       12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


found mainly in the atmosphere, although it is mobile in soils and readily migrates
to groundwaters. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane has been found in only a small proportion of
surface waters and groundwaters, usually at concentrations of less than 20 µg/l; higher
concentrations (up to 150 µg/l) have been observed in a few instances. There appears
to be increasing exposure to 1,1,1-trichloroethane from other sources.

Reason for not establishing    Occur in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health
a guideline value              concern
Assessment date                2003
Principal reference            WHO (2003) 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in drinking-water


      1,1,1-Trichloroethane is rapidly absorbed from the lungs and gastrointestinal
tract, but only small amounts—about 6% in humans and 3% in experimental ani-
mals—are metabolized. Exposure to high concentrations can lead to hepatic steatosis
(fatty liver) in both humans and laboratory animals. In a well-conducted oral study in
mice and rats, effects included reduced liver weight and changes in the kidney consist­
ent with hyaline droplet neuropathy. IARC has placed 1,1,1-trichloroethane in Group
3. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane does not appear to be mutagenic.
      A health-based value of 2 mg/l can be calculated for 1,1,1-trichloroethane on the
basis of a TDI of 0.6 mg/kg body weight, based on changes in the kidney that were
consistent with hyaline droplet nephropathy observed in a 13-week oral study in male
rats, and taking into account the short duration of the study. However, because 1,1,1-
trichloroethane occurs at concentrations well below those of health concern, it is not
considered necessary to derive a formal guideline value.

Trichloroethene
Trichloroethene is used primarily in metal degreasing. It is emitted mainly to the
atmosphere, but it may also be introduced into groundwater and, to a lesser extent,
surface water in industrial effluents. Poor handling as well as improper disposal of
trichloroethene in landfills have been the main causes of groundwater contamination.
It is expected that exposure to trichloroethene from air will be greater than that from
food or drinking-water, unless the drinking-water contains trichloroethene at levels
above about 10 µg/l.

Provisional guideline value 0.02 mg/l (20 µg/l)
                              The guideline value is designated as provisional because of deficiencies
                              in the toxicological database.
Occurrence                    Owing to its high volatility, concentrations are normally low (< 1 µg/l)
                              in surface water; concentrations may be higher (usually below 100
                              µg/l) in groundwater systems where volatilization and biodegradation
                              are limited

                            exposures through the dermal and inhalation routes into consideration in
                            developing national standards from the provisional guideline value.

Principal reference         WHO (2005) Trichloroethene in drinking-water


      Although trichloroethene appears to be weakly genotoxic in in vitro and in vivo
assays, several of its metabolites are genotoxic, and some are established as known or
likely human carcinogens. In view of the sufficient weight of evidence of carcinogen­
icity in two species of experimental animals with supporting human data, IARC classi-
fied trichloroethene as Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans). Developmental
toxicity is considered to be the critical non-cancer effect, because of the low adverse
effect level, the severity of the end-point (heart malformations) and the presence of
evidence for similar effects (e.g. cardiac anomalies) from epidemiological studies.

Trifluralin
Trifluralin (CAS No. 1582-09-8) is a pre-emergence herbicide used in a number of
crops. It has low water solubility and a high affinity for soil. However, biodegradation
and photodegradation processes may give rise to polar metabolites that may contam­
inate drinking water sources. Although this compound is used in many countries,
relatively few data are available concerning contamination of drinking water.

Additional comments         Authorities should note that some impure technical grades of trifluralin
                            could contain potent carcinogenic compounds and therefore should not
                            be used.
Assessment date             1993
Principal reference         WHO (2003) Trifluralin in drinking-water


      Trifluralin of high purity does not possess mutagenic properties. Technical
trifluralin of low purity may contain nitroso contaminants and has been found to
be mutagenic. No evidence of carcinogenicity was demonstrated in a number of
long‑term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies with pure (99%) test material. IARC has
assigned technical-grade trifluralin to Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogen­
icity to humans).

Trihalomethanes (bromoform, bromodichloromethane, chloroform,
dibromochloromethane)
THMs are formed in drinking-water primarily as a result of chlorination of organic
matter present naturally in raw water supplies. The rate and degree of THM formation
increase as a function of the chlorine and humic acid concentration, temperature, pH
and bromide ion concentration. Chloroform is the most common THM and the prin-
cipal disinfection by-product in chlorinated drinking-water. In the presence of bro-
mides, brominated THMs are formed preferentially, and chloroform concentrations
decrease proportionally. It is assumed that most THMs present in water are ultimately
transferred to air as a result of their volatility. For chloroform, for example, individ­
uals may be exposed during showering to elevated concentrations from chlorinated
tap water. For the volatile THMs, approximately equal contributions to total exposure
come from four areas: ingestion of drinking-water, inhalation of indoor air largely due
to volatilization from drinking-water, inhalation and dermal exposure during shower-
ing or bathing and ingestion of food, with all but food exposure arising primarily from
drinking-water. Indoor air exposure to the volatile THMs is particularly important
in countries with low rates of ventilation in houses and high rates of showering and
bathing.

                             Authorities wishing to use a guideline value for total THMs should not

                             to arrive at a standard.
                             It is emphasized that adequate disinfection should never be compromised
                             in attempting to meet guidelines for THMs. Nevertheless, in view of the
                             potential link between adverse reproductive outcomes and THMs,
                             particularly brominated THMs, it is recommended that THM levels in
                             drinking-water be kept as low as practicable.

Additional comments on   In countries with low rates of ventilation in houses and high rates of
chloroform               showering and bathing, the guideline value could be lowered to account
                         for the additional exposures from inhalation of indoor air largely due to
                         volatilization from drinking-water and inhalation and dermal exposure
                         during showering or bathing.
                         The guideline value is based on the same study as in the third edition;
                         the increase in value is primarily a result of an increase in the allocation
                         of exposure in drinking-water from 50% to 75% to account for the fact
                         that chloroform is used less now than it was in 1993 when the original
                         guideline was developed.
Additional comments on   Although a health-based value of 21 µg/l is derived, the previous guideline
BDCM                     value of 60 µg/l has been retained for two reasons: 1) both calculations
                         were based on the same study, the only differences being the model and
                         model assumptions used to derive the guideline value; there is therefore
                         no scientific basis on which to justify a change in the guideline value; and
                         2) BDCM concentrations below 50 µg/l may be difficult to achieve using
                         currently available technology without compromising the effectiveness of
                         disinfection.
                         As with chloroform, countries with low rates of ventilation and high
                         rates of showering and bathing may wish to lower the guideline value
                         to account for dermal and inhalation exposures, although, as noted
                         above, concentrations below 50 µg/l may be difficult to achieve using
                         currently available technology without compromising the effectiveness
                         of disinfection.
                         As BDCM was negative for carcinogenicity in a recent NTP bioassay in
                         which it was dosed in drinking-water, exceedances of the guideline value
                         are not likely to result in an increased risk of cancer.

Chloroform
The weight of evidence for genotoxicity of chloroform is considered negative. IARC
has classified chloroform as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) based on
limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenic-
ity in experimental animals. The weight of evidence for liver tumours in mice is con-
sistent with a threshold mechanism of induction. Although it is plausible that kidney
tumours in rats may similarly be associated with a threshold mechanism, there are
some limitations of the database in this regard. The most universally observed toxic
effect of chloroform is damage to the centrilobular region of the liver. The severity of
these effects per unit dose administered depends on the species, vehicle and method
by which the chloroform is administered.

the large intestine in rats of both sexes but did not induce tumours in mice. Data from

a variety of assays on the genotoxicity of bromoform are equivocal. IARC has classified
bromoform in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans).
Dibromochloromethane
In an NTP bioassay, DBCM induced hepatic tumours in female mice and possibly in
male mice but not in rats. The genotoxicity of DBCM has been studied in a number of
assays, but the available data are considered inconclusive. IARC has classified DBCM
in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans).
Bromodichloromethane
IARC has classified BDCM in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans). BDCM
gave both positive and negative results in a variety of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity
assays. In an NTP bioassay, BDCM induced renal adenomas and adenocarcinomas in
both sexes of rats and male mice, rare tumours of the large intestine (adenomatous
polyps and adenocarcinomas) in both sexes of rats and hepatocellular adenomas and
adenocarcinomas in female mice. However, BDCM was negative for carcinogenicity
in a recent NTP bioassay in which it was dosed in drinking-water. Exposure to BDCM
has also been linked to a possible increase in reproductive effects (increased risk for
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth).

Uranium
Uranium is widespread in nature, occurring in granites and various other mineral
deposits. It is used mainly as fuel in nuclear power stations. Uranium is present in
the environment as a result of leaching from natural deposits, release in mill tailings,
emissions from the nuclear industry, the combustion of coal and other fuels and the
use of phosphate fertilizers that contain uranium. Intake of uranium through air is
low, and it appears that intake through food is between 1 and 4 µg/day. Intake through
drinking-water is normally extremely low; however, in circumstances in which ur­
anium is present in a drinking-water source, the majority of intake can be through
drinking-water.

Provisional guideline value 0.03 mg/l (30 µg/l)
                            The guideline value is designated as provisional because of scientific
                            uncertainties surrounding uranium toxicity.
Occurrence                  Levels in drinking-water are generally less than 1 µg/l, although
                            concentrations as high as 700 µg/l have been measured in private
                            supplies.

Guideline value derivation
•  consumption               2 litres/day
Additional comments          Where supplies exceed 30 µg/l, it is important that precipitate action be
                             avoided. Consideration should first be given to exposure from all sources
                             and the availability of alternative safe sources.

Principal reference          WHO (2012) Uranium in drinking-water


      There are insufficient data regarding the carcinogenicity of uranium in humans
and experimental animals. Nephritis is the primary chemically induced effect of ura-
nium in humans. Little information is available on the chronic health effects of ex-
posure to environmental uranium in humans. A number of epidemiological studies
of populations exposed to uranium in drinking-water have shown a correlation with
alkaline phosphatase and β-microglobulin in urine along with modest alterations in
proximal tubular function. However, the actual measurements were still within the
normal physiological range, and these findings are not consistent between studies.
      No clear no-effect concentration has emerged from the human studies to date. This
is not surprising, as most of the study populations are quite small, and there is substan-
tial normal variation in the measured parameters in the human population. However,
the overall indications are that there is no clear evidence of effects below an exposure
concentration of 30 µg/l. In fact, the evidence for effects on the kidney, which appears to
be the most sensitive organ, is equivocal until much higher exposure concentrations.
      The provisional guideline value of 30 μg/l, which is derived from new epidemio-
logical studies on populations exposed to high uranium concentrations, replaces the
previous value derived from experimental animal studies and designated as provision-
al on the basis of uncertainties regarding the toxicology and epidemiology of uranium
as well as difficulties concerning its technical achievability in smaller supplies. It is
noted that studies on human populations, when available and of good quality, are
the preferred source of health-related information to be used in deriving guideline
values.

Vinyl chloride
Vinyl chloride is used primarily for the production of PVC. Owing to its high volatility,
vinyl chloride has rarely been detected in surface waters, except in contaminated areas.
Unplasticized PVC is increasingly being used in some countries for water mains sup-
plies. Migration of vinyl chloride monomer from unplasticized PVC is a possible source
of vinyl chloride in drinking-water. It appears that inhalation is the most important
route of vinyl chloride intake, although drinking-water may contribute a substantial
portion of daily intake where PVC piping with a high residual content of vinyl chlor­
ide monomer is used in the distribution network. Vinyl chloride has been reported in
groundwater as a degradation product of the chlorinated solvents trichloroethene and
tetrachloroethene.

                           As vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen, exposure to this compound
                           should be avoided as far as practicable, and levels should be kept as low as
                           technically feasible.
                           Vinyl chloride is primarily of concern as a potential contaminant from
                           some grades of PVC pipe and is best controlled by specification of

     There is sufficient evidence of the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride in humans
from industrial populations exposed to high concentrations via the inhalation route,
and IARC has classified vinyl chloride in Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans). Studies of
workers employed in the vinyl chloride industry showed a marked exposure–response
for all liver cancers, angiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, but no strong rela-
tionship between cumulative vinyl chloride exposure and other cancers. Experimental
animal data show vinyl chloride to be a multisite carcinogen. When administered orally
or by inhalation to mice, rats and hamsters, it produced tumours in the mammary gland,
lungs, Zymbal gland and skin, as well as angiosarcomas of the liver and other sites. Evi-
dence indicates that vinyl chloride metabolites are genotoxic, interacting directly with
DNA. DNA adducts formed by the reaction of DNA with a vinyl chloride metabolite
have also been identified. Occupational exposure has resulted in chromosomal aberra-
tions, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges; response levels were correlated with
exposure levels.

Xylenes
Xylenes are used in blending petrol, as a solvent and as a chemical intermediate. They
are released to the environment largely via air. Exposure to xylenes is mainly from air,
and exposure is increased by smoking.

     Xylenes are rapidly absorbed by inhalation. Data on oral exposure are lacking.
Xylenes are rapidly distributed in the body, predominantly in adipose tissue. They
are almost completely metabolized and excreted in urine. The acute oral toxicity of
xylenes is low. No convincing evidence for teratogenicity has been found. Long-term
carcinogenicity studies have shown no evidence for carcinogenicity. In vitro as well as
in vivo mutagenicity tests have proved negative.

Zinc
Zinc is an essential trace element found in virtually all food and potable water in the
form of salts or organic complexes. The diet is normally the principal source of zinc.
Although levels of zinc in surface water and groundwater normally do not exceed 0.01
and 0.05 mg/l, respectively, concentrations in tap water can be much higher as a result
of dissolution of zinc from pipes.

12.2 Pesticides used for vector control in drinking-water sources and
     containers
In setting local guidelines or standards in the context of local storage practices and real­
istic insecticide application regimes, health authorities should take into consideration
the potential for higher rates of water consumption in the area or region under con-
sideration. However, exceeding the ADIs will not necessarily result in adverse effects.
The diseases spread by vectors are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. It is
therefore important to achieve an appropriate balance between the intake of the pesti­
cides from drinking-water and the control of disease-carrying insects. Better than
establishing guideline values are the formulation and implementation of a comprehen-
sive management plan for household water storage and domestic waste management
that does not rely exclusively on larviciding by insecticides, but also includes other en-
vironmental management measures and social behavioural changes.
      Formulations of pesticides used for vector control in drinking-water should

Bacillus thuringensis israelensis
Two Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) (strain AM65-52) products (water-dispersible
granule and ready-to-use tablet) have been evaluated by WHOPES and recommended
as mosquito larvicides, including their use against container-breeding mosquitoes.
Quality control specifications and efficacy evaluations for Bti water-dispersible gran-
ule have been published. WHO recommendations on the use of pesticides in public
health are valid only if linked to WHO specifications for their quality control.

Bti in water. Bti is recommended under WHOPES for use in vector control, including
against container-breeding mosquitoes, and can be used in drinking-water that will re-
ceive little or no further treatment for control of Aedes aegypti. It is essential that Bti for
larvicidal use be prepared under carefully controlled conditions and properly assayed
before use for evidence of potency, for excessive levels of expressed Bti constituents or
metabolites that are toxic and for contamination by other undesirable microbes.
     Bti itself is not considered to pose a hazard to humans through drinking-water.
Therefore, it is not considered necessary or appropriate to establish a health-based
value for its use for controlling vector larvae in drinking-water. However, it is vital that
authorities can be assured that Bti has been prepared to the highest quality and hy-
gienic standards under appropriate conditions that will meet the WHOPES specifica-
tions. It is important that the possible risks are set against the risks from vector-borne
diseases such as dengue fever.
     Application should be carried out by trained applicators and Bti used in conjunc-
tion with other approaches to vector control, including exclusion of mosquitoes from
containers and other control options.

Diflubenzuron
Diflubenzuron is a direct-acting insecticide normally applied directly to plants or
water. It is used in public health applications against mosquito and noxious fly lar-
vae. WHO is considering diflubenzuron for use as a mosquito larvicide in drinking-
water in containers, particularly to control dengue fever. The recommended dosage
of diflubenzuron in potable water in containers should not exceed 0.25 mg/l under
WHOPES.
     It is reported that public exposure to diflubenzuron through either food or
drinking-water is negligible. However, there is a potential for direct exposure through
drinking-water when diflubenzuron is directly applied to drinking-water storage
containers.

     Diflubenzuron is considered to be of very low acute toxicity. The primary target
for toxicity is the erythrocytes, although the mechanism of haematotoxicity is uncer-
tain. There is no evidence that diflubenzuron is either genotoxic or carcinogenic. It
also does not appear to be fetotoxic or teratogenic and does not show significant signs
of reproductive toxicity. There is evidence that young animals are not significantly
more sensitive than adults to the effects of diflubenzuron.
     It is not considered appropriate to set a formal guideline value for diflubenzuron
used as a vector control agent in drinking-water. Where diflubenzuron is used for vec-
tor control in potable water, this will involve considerably less than lifetime exposure.

The ADI determined by JMPR in 2001 was 0–0.02 mg/kg body weight. The maximum
dosage in drinking-water of 0.25 mg/l would be equivalent to approximately 40%
of the upper limit of the ADI allocated to drinking-water for a 60 kg adult drinking
2 litres of water per day. For a 10 kg child drinking 1 litre of water, the exposure would
be 0.25 mg, compared with an exposure of 0.2 mg at the upper limit of the ADI. For
a 5 kg bottle-fed infant drinking 0.75 litre per day, the exposure would be 0.19 mg,
compared with an exposure of 0.1 mg at the upper limit of the ADI. Diflubenzuron is
unlikely to remain in solution at the maximum recommended applied dose, and the
actual levels of exposure are likely to be much lower than those calculated.
      Consideration should be given to using alternative sources of water for bottle-
fed infants for a period after an application of diflubenzuron, where this is practical.
However, exceeding the ADI will not necessarily result in adverse effects.

Methoprene
WHO has assessed methoprene for use as a mosquito larvicide in drinking-water in con-
tainers, particularly to control dengue fever. The recommended dosage of methoprene
in potable water in containers should not exceed 1 mg/l under WHOPES.

                              WHO (2008) Methoprene in drinking-water


     In 2001, JMPR reaffirmed the basis of the ADI for racemic methoprene estab-
lished in 1987, but lowered the value to 0–0.09 mg/kg body weight to correct for the
purity of the racemate tested. The basis for the ADI was the NOAEL of 500 mg/kg
diet, equivalent to 8.6 mg/kg body weight per day (corrected for purity), in a 90-day
study in dogs (the main effect was increased relative liver weight) and a safety factor
of 100. Young animals do not appear to be significantly more sensitive than adults.
As no bridging studies with repeated doses were available for (S)-methoprene,
JMPR made the conservative assumption that, in the absence of any information to
the contrary, all the toxicity of the racemate was due to the S enantiomer. On this
basis, JMPR established an ADI for (S)-methoprene of 0–0.05 mg/kg body weight,
equal to one half the ADI for the racemate (which is a 1:1 mixture of the R and S
enantiomers).
     It is not considered appropriate to set a formal guideline value for methoprene
used as a vector control agent in drinking-water. Where methoprene is used for vector
control in potable water, this will involve less than lifetime exposure. The maximum
dosage in drinking-water of 1 mg/l would be equivalent to approximately 66% of the
upper limit of the ADI (0.033 mg/kg body weight) for a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres
of water per day. The exposure for a 10 kg child drinking 1 litre of water would be
approximately 0.1 mg/kg body weight, and for a 5 kg bottle-fed infant, the exposure


                                                 436
                                     12. CHEMICAL FACT SHEETS


would be approximately 0.15 mg/kg body weight, compared with the upper limit of
the ADI of 0.05 mg/kg body weight. However, the low solubility and the high log
octanol–water partition coefficient of methoprene indicate that it is unlikely to re-
main in solution at the maximum recommended applied dose, and the actual levels
of exposure are likely to be much lower than those calculated. Exposure from food is
considered to be low.
     Consideration should be given to using alternative sources of water for small
children and bottle-fed infants for a period after an application of methoprene,
where this is practical. However, exceeding the ADI will not necessarily result in ad-
verse effects.

Novaluron
Novaluron has been registered as an insecticide for food crops and ornamentals in a
number of countries. WHO has assessed novaluron for use as a mosquito larvicide in
drinking-water in containers, particularly to control dengue fever. The recommended
dosage of novaluron in potable water in containers should not exceed 0.05 mg/l under
WHOPES.

                              WHO (2008) Novaluron in drinking-water.


      In view of the absence of a carcinogenic potential in rodents and the lack of geno-
toxic potential in vitro and in vivo, JMPR concluded that novaluron is unlikely to
pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. JMPR also concluded that novaluron is not a
developmental toxicant. JMPR established an ADI of 0–0.01 mg/kg body weight on
the basis of the NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg body weight per day for erythrocyte damage and
secondary splenic and liver changes in a 2-year dietary study in rats, using a safety
factor of 100.
      It is not considered appropriate to set a formal guideline value for novaluron
as a vector control agent in drinking-water. At the maximum recommended dosage
for drinking-water of 0.05 mg/l, the intake of a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water
would represent only 17% of the upper limit of the ADI. Similarly, the intake for a
10 kg child drinking 1 litre of water would be 50% of the upper limit of the ADI,
whereas a 5 kg bottle-fed infant drinking 0.75 litre of water would receive an intake of
75% of the upper limit of the ADI.
      The high log octanol–water partition coefficient of 4.3 indicates that novaluron
is likely to adsorb to the sides of containers, and so the actual concentration is likely
to be less than the recommended dose. Exposure to novaluron through food is not
expected to be significant.

Permethrin
Permethrin (CAS No. 52645-53-1) is a contact insecticide effective against a broad
range of pests in agriculture, forestry and public health. It has been used as a larvicide
to control aquatic invertebrates in water mains. Permethrin is photodegraded both
in water and on soil surfaces. In soil, permethrin is rapidly degraded by hydrolysis
and microbial action under aerobic conditions. Exposure of the general population to
permethrin is mainly via the diet.

Reason for not establishing   Not recommended for direct addition to drinking-water as part of
a guideline value             WHO’s policy to exclude the use of any pyrethroids for larviciding of
                              mosquito vectors of human disease

                              WHO (2011) Permethrin in drinking-water


     Technical-grade permethrin is of low acute toxicity. The cis isomer is considerably
more toxic than the trans isomer. IARC has classified permethrin in Group 3 (not classi­
fiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans), as there are no human data and only limited
data from experimental animal studies. Permethrin is not genotoxic. JMPR concluded
that technical-grade permethrin is not a reproductive or developmental toxin.
     For guidance purposes, a health-based value can be derived from an ADI of
0–0.05 mg/kg body weight, established for technical-grade permethrin with cis:trans
ratios of 25:75 to 40:60 on the basis of a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg body weight per day in a
2-year dietary study in rats, which was based on clinical signs and changes in body and
organ weights and blood chemistry at the next higher dose, and a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg
body weight per day in a 1-year study in dogs, based on reduced body weight at 100
mg/kg body weight per day, and applying an uncertainty factor of 100 for interspecies
and intraspecies variation. Assuming a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day
and allocating 20% of the upper limit of the ADI to drinking-water, a health-based
value of 0.3 mg/l can be derived.
     Adding permethrin directly to drinking-water for public health purposes is not
recommended by WHO, as part of its policy to exclude the use of any pyrethroids for
larviciding of mosquito vectors of human disease. This policy is based on concern
over the possible accelerated development of vector resistance to synthetic pyreth­
roids, which, in their application to insecticide-treated mosquito nets, are crucial in
the current global anti-malaria strategy.

Pirimiphos-methyl
Pirimiphos-methyl is an organophosphorus compound that is used in a wide range
of pesticidal applications. Pirimiphos-methyl is being considered by WHO for addi-
tion to potable water in containers as a mosquito larvicide treatment, particularly to
control dengue fever. The manufacturer recommends the direct addition of 1 mg/l to
water.

     The only biochemical effect consistently observed with pirimiphos-methyl in
acute, short-term or long-term studies is cholinesterase inhibition. Studies with mice,
rats and dogs showed NOAELs of 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day and above. Young
animals do not appear to be significantly more sensitive than adults. In human studies,
no cholinesterase inhibition was seen at 0.25 mg/kg body weight per day (the highest
dose tested). On this basis, JMPR revised the ADI to 0–0.03 mg/kg body weight by
applying a 10-fold safety factor to the NOAEL in the human studies.
     At the maximum recommended dosage for drinking-water of 1 mg/l, a 60 kg
adult drinking 2 litres of water would have an intake of 0.033 mg/kg body weight,
compared with the upper limit of the ADI of 0.03 mg/kg body weight. The intake
for a 10 kg child drinking 1 litre of water would be 0.1 mg/kg body weight; for a 5 kg
bottle-fed infant drinking 0.75 litre, it would be 0.15 mg/kg body weight. There is
uncertainty regarding the level that would cause effects in humans, as the NOAEL
on which the ADI is based was the highest dose tested, and so the ADI may be more
conservative than is at first apparent. These intake figures are all below the acute
reference dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight and would not result in an acute exposure
risk from the initial application of pirimiphos-methyl to drinking-water containers
at the recommended dose. In addition, the low solubility and the high log octanol–
water partition coefficient of pirimiphos-methyl indicate that the larvicide is very
unlikely to remain in solution at the maximum recommended applied dose, so the
actual levels of exposure are expected to be lower than those calculated. Exposure
from food is generally considered to be low, but occasional high exposures can be
experienced.
     Based on the above calculations, pirimiphos-methyl is not recommended for dir­
ect application to drinking-water unless no other effective and safe treatments are
available. If pirimiphos-methyl is applied directly to drinking-water, consideration
should be given to using alternative sources of water for bottle-fed infants and small
children for a period after its application, where this is practical. However, it is noted
that exceeding the ADI will not necessarily result in adverse effects.

Pyriproxyfen
Pyriproxyfen is a broad-spectrum insect growth regulator with insecticidal activity
against public health insect pests, including mosquitoes. WHO has assessed pyr­
iproxyfen for use as a mosquito larvicide in drinking-water in containers, particularly
to control dengue fever. The recommended dosage of pyriproxyfen in potable water in
containers should not exceed 0.01 mg/l under WHOPES.

     JMPR evaluated pyriproxyfen and concluded that it was not genotoxic and does
not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. Young animals do not appear to be significantly
more sensitive than adults.
     JMPR established an ADI of 0–0.1 mg/kg body weight on the basis of an overall
NOAEL of 10 mg/kg body weight per day, based on increased relative liver weight and
increased total plasma cholesterol concentration in male dogs in two 1-year studies of
toxicity and using a safety factor of 100.
     It is not considered appropriate to set a formal guideline value for pyriproxyfen
used for vector control in drinking-water. The maximum recommended dosage in
drinking-water of 0.01 mg/l would be equivalent to less than 1% of the upper limit
of the ADI allocated to drinking-water for a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per
day. For a 10 kg child drinking 1 litre of water, the exposure would be 0.01 mg, com-
pared with an exposure of 1 mg at the upper limit of the ADI. For a 5 kg bottle-fed
infant drinking 0.75 litre per day, the exposure would be 0.0075 mg, compared with
an exposure of 0.5 mg at the upper limit of the ADI. The low solubility and the high
log octanol–water partition coefficient of pyriproxyfen indicate that it is unlikely to
remain in solution at the maximum recommended applied dose, and the actual levels
of exposure are likely to be even lower than those calculated.

Spinosad
Spinosad is a natural product derived from the bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa.
Spinosad DT is a mixture of spinosyn A and spinosyn D. It is used for mosquito
control in potable water in containers.
     Spinosad DT 7.48% is specified for use as a vector control agent in drinking-water
sources against Aedes aegypti by WHO under WHOPES. Formulations for control of
vectors are specified by WHO at a dose of 0.25–0.5 mg/l. The expected duration of
efficacy under field conditions is 4–6 weeks.
     Three formulations of spinosad have been evaluated by WHOPES for mosquito
larviciding. WHO specifications for quality control and international trade have been
published for the three formulations: i.e. spinosad granules (636/GR), aqueous sus-
pension concentrate (636/SC) and tablets for direct application (636/DT). Only the
tablet formulation is used for mosquito larviciding in potable water at the dosage of
0.25–0.5 mg/l of the active ingredient.
     In a 14-day study conducted by the manufacturer, a single tablet was added to a
200-litre container of water, and 10% of the water in this container was replenished
each day of the study. The concentration of spinosad was found to be in the range
26.5–51.7 µg/l.

                              WHO (2010) Spinosad in drinking-water


     It is not appropriate to set a formal guideline value for spinosad DT for use to
control vectors breeding in drinking-water containers; however, it is appropriate to
compare the probable intakes with the ADI of 0–0.02 mg/kg body weight, with no
acute reference dose set because of its low acute toxicity. The maximum concentration
actually achieved with the slow-release formulation was approximately 52 µg/l. The
intake would therefore be:
•    39 µg for a 5 kg bottle-fed infant assuming consumption of 0.75 litre = 7.8 µg/kg
     body weight
•    52 µg for a 10 kg child assuming consumption of 1 litre = 5.2 µg/kg body weight
•    104 µg for a 60 kg adult assuming consumption of 2 litres = 1.7 µg/kg body weight.
However, this could be higher if drinking-water consumption is also higher.
     This means that the exposure is well below the upper limit of the ADI for all sec-
tors of the population. Even the application of a double dose would result in exposure
below the upper limit of the ADI.
     The ADI is, of course, set for lifetime exposure, and the average exposure over
time will be lower than the exposures indicated above.

Temephos
Temephos is an organophosphorus insecticide that is used mainly as a larvicide to
control mosquitoes on ponds, marshes and swamps and midges, black flies and other
insects in public health. It is also used for mosquito control in potable water in con-
tainers. It is specified for use as a vector control agent in drinking-water sources by
WHO under WHOPES. Formulations for control of vectors are specified by WHO,
and only those approved by WHOPES should be used for this purpose. The recom-
mendation for the use of temephos in potable water is that the dosage should not
exceed 1 mg/l.

    The NOAEL for human risk assessment for temephos is 2.3 mg/kg body weight
per day on the basis of inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase activity in rats, as
determined by JMPR in 2006. Although JMPR considered that the database was

insufficiently robust to serve as the basis for establishing an ADI, for the purposes
of these Guidelines, a TDI of 0.023 mg/kg body weight can be calculated from this
NOAEL, using an uncertainty factor of 100. Young animals do not appear to be signifi-
cantly more sensitive than adults, and exposure from food is considered to be low.
      It is not appropriate to set a formal guideline value for temephos used as a vector
control agent in drinking-water. Where temephos is used for vector control in potable
water, this will involve less than lifetime exposure. The maximum dosage in drinking-
water of 1 mg/l for a 60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water per day would be equivalent
to approximately 0.033 mg/kg body weight, compared with the TDI of 0.023 mg/kg
body weight. The exposure for a 10 kg child drinking 1 litre of water would be ap-
proximately 0.1 mg/kg body weight; for a 5 kg bottle-fed infant, the exposure would
be approximately 0.15 mg/kg body weight, compared with the TDI of 0.023 mg/kg
body weight.
      Consideration should be given to using alternative sources of water for small chil-
dren and bottle-fed infants for a period after an application of temephos, where this
is practical.
      However, exceeding the TDI does not necessarily mean that this will result in
adverse effects. Indeed, the low solubility and the high log octanol–water partition co-
efficient of temephos indicate that it is unlikely to remain in solution at the maximum
recommended applied dose, and the use of the slow-release formulation should result
in very much lower concentrations than the approved dose of 1 mg/l and actual expo-
sures much lower than the theoretical exposures calculated above.

     Analytical methods and achievability




A4.1 Analytical methods
In volumetric titration, chemicals are analysed by titration with a standardized titrant.
The titration end-point is identified by the development of colour resulting from the
reaction with an indicator, by the change of electrical potential or by the change of
pH value.
     Colorimetric methods are based on measuring the intensity of colour of a col­
oured target chemical or reaction product. The optical absorbance is measured using
light of a suitable wavelength. The concentration is determined by means of a cali-
bration curve obtained using known concentrations of the determinant. The ultra-
violet (UV) method is similar to this method except that UV light is used. For ionic
materials, the ion concentration can be measured using an ion selective electrode. The
measured potential is proportional to the logarithm of the ion concentration. Some
organic compounds absorb UV light (wavelength 190–380 nm) in proportion to
their concentration. UV absorption is useful for qualitative estimation of organic sub-
stances, because a strong correlation may exist between UV absorption and organic
carbon content.
     Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) is used for the determination of metals. It
is based on the phenomenon that the atom in the ground state absorbs the light of
wavelengths that are characteristic to each element when light is passed through the
atoms in the vapour state. Because this absorption of light depends on the concen-
tration of atoms in the vapour, the concentration of the target element in the water
sample is determined from the measured absorbance. The Beer-Lambert law describes
the relationship between concentration and absorbance.
     In flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), a sample is aspirated into a flame
and atomized. A light beam from a hollow cathode lamp of the same element as the
target metal is radiated through the flame, and the amount of absorbed light is meas­
ured by the detector. This method is much more sensitive than other methods and free
from spectral or radiation interference by co-existing elements. Pretreatment is either
unnecessary or straightforward. However, it is not suitable for simultaneous analysis of
many elements, because the light source is different for each target element.



                                          476
                     ANNEX 4. ANALYTICAL METHODS AND ACHIEVABILITY


      Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS) is based on the same prin-
ciple as FAAS, but an electrically heated atomizer or graphite furnace replaces the
standard burner head for determination of metals. In comparison with FAAS, EAAS
gives higher sensitivities and lower detection limits, and a smaller sample volume is
required. EAAS suffers from more interference through light scattering by co-existing
elements and requires a longer analysis time than FAAS.
      The principle of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-
AES) for determination of metals is as follows. An ICP source consists of a flow-
ing stream of argon gas ionized by an applied radio frequency. A sample aerosol
is generated in a nebulizer and spray chamber and then carried into the plasma
through an injector tube. A sample is heated and excited in the high-temperature
plasma. The high temperature of the plasma causes the atoms to become excited. On
returning to the ground state, the excited atoms produce ionic emission spectra. A
monochromator is used to separate specific wavelengths corresponding to different
elements, and a detector measures the intensity of radiation of each wavelength. A
significant reduction in chemical interference is achieved. In the case of water with
low pollution, simultaneous or sequential analysis is possible without special pre-
treatment to achieve low detection limits for many elements. This, coupled with the
extended dynamic range from three digits to five digits, means that multielement
determination of metals can be achieved. ICP-AES has similar sensitivity to FAAS
or EAAS.
      In inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), elements are atomized
and excited as in ICP-AES, then passed to a mass spectrometer. Once inside the mass
spectrometer, the ions are accelerated by high voltage and passed through a series of
ion optics, an electrostatic analyser and, finally, a magnet. By varying the strength of
the magnet, ions are separated according to mass/charge ratio and passed through a
slit into the detector, which records only a very small atomic mass range at a given
time. By varying the magnet and electrostatic analyser settings, the entire mass range
can be scanned within a relatively short period of time. In the case of water with low
pollution, simultaneous or sequential analysis is possible without special pretreatment
to achieve low detection limits for many elements. This, coupled with the extended
dynamic range from three digits to five digits, means that multielement determination
of metals can be achieved.
      Chromatography is a separation method based on the affinity difference between
two phases, the stationary and mobile phases. A sample is injected into a column,
either packed or coated with the stationary phase, and separated by the mobile phase
based on the difference in interaction (distribution or adsorption) between com-
pounds and the stationary phase. Compounds with a low affinity for the stationary
phase move more quickly through the column and elute earlier. The compounds that
elute from the end of the column are determined by a suitable detector.
      In ion chromatography, an ion exchanger is used as the stationary phase, and the
eluant for determination of anions is typically a dilute solution of sodium hydrogen
carbonate and sodium carbonate. Colorimetric, electrometric or titrimetric detectors
can be used for determining individual anions. In suppressed ion chromatography, an-
ions are converted to their highly conductive acid forms; in the carbonate–bicarbonate

eluant, anions are converted to weakly conductive carbonic acid. The separated acid
forms are measured by conductivity and identified on the basis of retention time as
compared with their standards.
      High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is an analytical technique using
a liquid mobile phase and a column containing a liquid stationary phase. Detection
of the separated compounds is achieved through the use of absorbance detectors for
organic compounds and through conductivity or electrochemical detectors for metal-
lic and inorganic compounds.
      Gas chromatography (GC) permits the identification and quantification of trace
organic compounds. In GC, gas is used as the mobile phase, and the stationary phase
is a liquid that is coated either on an inert granular solid or on the walls of a capil-
lary column. When the sample is injected into the column, the organic compounds
are vaporized and moved through the column by the carrier gas at different rates
depending on differences in partition coefficients between the mobile and station-
ary phases. The gas exiting the column is passed to a suitable detector. A variety of
detectors can be used, including flame ionization (FID), electron capture (ECD) and
nitrogen–phosphorus. As separation ability is good in this method, mixtures of sub-
stances with similar structure are systematically separated, identified and determined
quantitatively in a single operation.
      The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method is based on the
same principle as the GC method, using a mass spectrometer as the detector. As
the gas emerges from the end of the GC column opening, it flows through a capil-
lary column interface into the MS. The sample then enters the ionization chamber,
where a collimated beam of electrons impacts the sample molecules, causing ion-
ization and fragmentation. The next component is a mass analyser, which uses a
magnetic field to separate the positively charged particles according to their mass.
Several types of separating techniques exist; the most common are quadrupoles
and ion traps. After the ions are separated according to their masses, they enter a
detector.
      The purge-and-trap packed column GC-MS method or purge-and-trap packed
column GC method is applicable to the determination of various purgeable organic
compounds that are transferred from the aqueous to the vapour phase by bubbling
purge gas through a water sample at ambient temperature. The vapour is trapped with
a cooled trap. The trap is heated and backflushed with the same purge gas to desorb
the compounds onto a GC column. The principles of GC or GC-MS are as referred
to above.
      The principle of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is as follows. The
protein (antibody) against the chemical of interest (antigen) is coated onto the solid
material. The target chemical in the water sample binds to the antibody, and a second
antibody with an enzyme attached is also added that will attach to the chemical of
interest. After washing to remove any of the free reagents, a chromogen is added that
will give a colour reaction due to cleavage by the enzyme that is proportional to the
quantity of the chemical of interest. The ELISA method can be used to determine
microcystin and synthetic surfactants.

     Treatment methods and performance




A5.1 Treatment methods
A5.1.1 Chlorination
Chlorination can be achieved by using liquefied chlorine gas, sodium hypochlorite
solution or calcium hypochlorite granules and on-site chlorine generators. Lique-
fied chlorine gas is supplied in pressurized containers. The gas is withdrawn from the
cylinder and dosed into water by a chlorinator, which both controls and measures the
gas flow rate. Sodium hypochlorite solution is dosed using a positive-displacement
electric dosing pump or gravity feed system. Calcium hypochlorite has to be dissolved
in water, then mixed with the main supply. Chlorine, whether in the form of chlorine
gas from a cylinder, sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite, dissolves in water
to form hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite ion (OCl−).
     Different techniques of chlorination can be used, including breakpoint chlorina-
tion, marginal chlorination and superchlorination/dechlorination. Breakpoint chlo-
rination is a method in which the chlorine dose is sufficient to rapidly oxidize all the
ammonia nitrogen in the water and to leave a suitable free residual chlorine available to
protect the water against reinfection from the point of chlorination to the point of use.
Superchlorination/dechlorination is the addition of a large dose of chlorine to effect
rapid disinfection and chemical reaction, followed by reduction of excess free chlorine
residual. Removing excess chlorine is important to prevent taste problems. It is used
mainly when the bacterial load is variable or the detention time in a tank is not enough.
Marginal chlorination is used where water supplies are of high quality and is the simple
dosing of chlorine to produce a desired level of free residual chlorine. The chlorine
demand in these supplies is very low, and a breakpoint might not even occur.
     Chlorination is employed primarily for microbial disinfection. However, chlorine
also acts as an oxidant and can remove or assist in the removal or chemical conversion
of some chemicals—for example, decomposition of easily oxidized pesticides, such as
aldicarb; oxidation of dissolved species (e.g. manganese(II)) to form insoluble prod-
ucts that can be removed by subsequent filtration; and oxidation of dissolved species
to more easily removable forms (e.g. arsenite to arsenate).



                                          485
                           GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


    A disadvantage of chlorine is its ability to react with natural organic matter to
produce trihalomethanes and other halogenated disinfection by-products. However,
by-product formation may be controlled by optimization of the treatment system.

A5.1.2 Ozonation
Ozone is a powerful oxidant and has many uses in water treatment, including oxidation
of organic chemicals. Ozone can be used as a primary disinfectant. Ozone gas (O3) is
formed by passing dry air or oxygen through a high-voltage electric field. The result-
ant ozone-enriched air is dosed directly into the water by means of porous diffusers
at the base of baffled contactor tanks. The contactor tanks, typically about 5 m deep,
provide 10–20 minutes of contact time. Dissolution of at least 80% of the applied
ozone should be possible, with the remainder contained in the off-gas, which is passed
through an ozone destructor and vented to the atmosphere.
     The performance of ozonation relies on achieving the desired concentration after
a given contact period. For oxidation of organic chemicals, such as some oxidizable
pesticides, a residual of about 0.5 mg/l after a contact time of up to 20 minutes is
typically used. The doses required to achieve this vary with the type of water but are
typically in the range 2–5 mg/l. Higher doses are needed for untreated waters, because
of the ozone demand of the natural background organics.
     Ozone reacts with natural organics to increase their biodegradability, measured
as assimilable organic carbon. To avoid undesirable bacterial growth in distribution,
ozonation is normally used with subsequent treatment, such as biological filtration
or granular activated carbon (GAC), to remove biodegradable organics, followed by a
chlorine residual, as ozone does not provide a disinfectant residual. Ozone is effective
for the degradation of a wide range of pesticides and other organic chemicals.

A5.1.3 Other disinfection processes
Other disinfection methods include chloramination, the use of chlorine dioxide and
UV radiation, as well as alternative disinfection techniques that may be used in small-
er-scale applications, such as for household water.
     Chloramines (monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine, or nitrogen
trichloride) are produced by the reaction of aqueous chlorine with ammonia. Mono-
chloramine is the only useful chloramine disinfectant, and conditions employed for
chloramination are designed to produce only monochloramine. Monochloramine is
a less effective disinfectant than free chlorine, but it is persistent, and it is therefore an
attractive secondary disinfectant for the maintenance of a stable distribution system
residual.
     Chlorine dioxide has been used in recent years because of concerns about disinfec-
tion by-product production associated with chlorine disinfection. Typically, chlorine
dioxide is generated immediately prior to application by the addition of chlorine gas
or an aqueous chlorine solution to aqueous sodium chlorite. Chlorine dioxide decom-
poses in water to form chlorite and chlorate.
     UV radiation, emitted by a low-pressure or medium-pressure mercury arc lamp,
is biocidal between wavelengths of 180 and 320 nm. It can be used to inactivate proto-
zoa, bacteria, bacteriophage, yeast, viruses, fungi and algae. Turbidity can inhibit UV

                                             486
                      ANNEX 5. TREATMENT METHODS AND PERFORMANCE


disinfection. UV radiation can act as a catalyst in oxidation reactions when used in
conjunction with ozone or hydrogen peroxide.
     Numerous possible disinfection techniques are being developed and are typically
used in smaller-scale applications, such as household point-of-use and point-of-entry
water treatment systems. Some of these, including bromine and iodine, show prom-
ise for expanded use. Bromine and iodine are halogens, like chlorine, and they are
well-known biocides. Iodine is commonly used for short-term applications, such as by
travellers in areas where water quality is questionable. Some forms of silver may have
applications as bacteriostats or possibly as slow-acting disinfectants for some micro-
organisms; however, there are not good peer-reviewed published data to quantify the
latter. It will be necessary to develop a more thorough analysis of the biocidal efficacy,
potential disinfection by-products and risks from long-term exposures and applica-
tion conditions for these lesser-used treatment chemicals to provide appropriate guid-
ance as to their potential for wider applications.

A5.1.4 Filtration
Particulate matter can be removed from raw waters by rapid gravity, horizontal, pres-
sure or slow sand filters. Slow sand filtration is essentially a biological process, whereas
the others are physical treatment processes.
      Rapid gravity, horizontal and pressure filters can be used for filtration of raw
water, without pretreatment. Rapid gravity and pressure filters are commonly used
to filter water that has been pretreated by coagulation and sedimentation. An alterna-
tive process is direct filtration, in which coagulation is added to the water, which then
passes directly onto the filter where the precipitated floc (with contaminants) is re-
moved; the application of direct filtration is limited by the available storage within the
filter to accommodate solids.

Rapid gravity filters
Rapid gravity sand filters usually consist of open rectangular tanks (usually < 100 m2)
containing silica sand (size range 0.5–1.0 mm) to a depth of between 0.6 and 2.0 m.
The water flows downwards, and solids become concentrated in the upper layers of
the bed. The flow rate is generally in the range 4–20 m3/m2·h. Treated water is collected
via nozzles in the floor of the filter. The accumulated solids are removed periodically
by backwashing with treated water, sometimes preceded by scouring of the sand with
air. A dilute sludge that requires disposal is produced.
      In addition to single-medium sand filters, dual-media or multimedia filters are
used. Such filters incorporate different materials, such that the structure is from coarse
to fine as the water passes through the filter. Materials of suitable density are used in
order to maintain the segregation of the different layers following backwashing. A
common example of a dual-media filter is the anthracite–sand filter, which typically
consists of a 0.2 m deep layer of 1.5 mm anthracite over a 0.6 m deep layer of silica
sand. Anthracite, sand and garnet can be used in multimedia filters. The advantage
of dual-media and multimedia filters is that there is more efficient use of the whole
bed depth for particle retention—the rate of headloss development can be half that of



                                            487
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


single-medium filters, which can allow higher flow rates without increasing headloss
development.
     Rapid gravity filters are most commonly used to remove floc from coagulated
waters (see section A5.1.6). They may also be used to reduce turbidity (including
adsorbed chemicals) and oxidized iron and manganese from raw waters.
Roughing filters
Roughing filters can be applied as pre-filters prior to other processes such as slow sand
filters. Roughing filters with coarse gravel or crushed stones as the filter medium can
successfully treat water of high turbidity (> 50 nephelometric turbidity units). The
main advantage of roughing filtration is that as the water passes through the filter,
particles are removed by both filtration and gravity settling. Horizontal filters can be
up to 10 m long and are operated at filtration rates of 0.3–1.0 m3/m2·h.

Pressure filters
Pressure filters are sometimes used where it is necessary to maintain head in order to
eliminate the need for pumping into supply. The filter bed is enclosed in a cylindrical
shell. Small pressure filters, capable of treating up to about 15 m3/h, can be manufac-
tured in glass-reinforced plastics. Larger pressure filters, up to 4 m in diameter, are
manufactured in specially coated steel. Operation and performance are generally as
described for the rapid gravity filter, and similar facilities are required for backwashing
and disposal of the dilute sludge.

Slow sand filters
Slow sand filters usually consist of tanks containing sand (effective size range 0.15–0.3
mm) to a depth of between 0.5 and 1.5 m. The raw water flows downwards, and tur-
bidity and microorganisms are removed primarily in the top few centimetres of the
sand. A biological layer, known as the “schmutzdecke”, develops on the surface of the
filter and can be effective in removing microorganisms. Treated water is collected in
underdrains or pipework at the bottom of the filter. The top few centimetres of sand
containing the accumulated solids are removed and replaced periodically. Slow sand
filters are operated at a water flow rate of between 0.1 and 0.3 m3/m2·h.
      Slow sand filters are more suitable for low-turbidity water or water that has been
pre-filtered. They are used to remove algae and microorganisms, including protozoa,
and, if preceded by microstraining or coarse filtration, to reduce turbidity (including
adsorbed chemicals). Slow sand filtration is effective for the removal of some organics,
including certain pesticides and also ammonia.

Bank filtration
Bank filtration is a process that produces an influx of surface water through the ground-
water, via the bed and banks of the surface water body. This is commonly achieved
through abstraction from boreholes adjacent to the surface water source. It is a rela-
tively simple and low-cost means for removing particulates and microorganisms from
surface water by placing pumping wells in alluvial sediments of the river or stream
banks. The sediments act as both a filter and biofilter, trapping and reducing the con-
centrations of microorganisms and many organic pollutants. Bank filtration wells can


                                           488
                      ANNEX 5. TREATMENT METHODS AND PERFORMANCE


be either horizontal or vertical, depending upon the hydrogeological circumstances
and required production rate. Horizontal wells are often used where alluvial deposits
are shallow or where high pumping rates are required.
     Bank filtration can remove particles, bacteria, viruses, parasites, heavy metals and
easily biodegradable compounds. Bank filtration attenuates concentration peaks, pro-
viding uniform quality of raw water feed to downstream treatment. The performance
of bank filtration can be highly dependent upon several factors, including soil and
geological conditions as well as the quality of the source water. Bank filters can be-
come clogged, resulting in pressure drops. Site-specific testing is needed to determine
whether the appropriate geology is present as well as the effectiveness and operational
parameters.

A5.1.5 Aeration
Aeration processes are designed to achieve removal of gases and volatile compounds
by air stripping. Transfer can usually be achieved using a simple cascade or diffusion
of air into water, without the need for elaborate equipment. Stripping of gases or vola-
tile compounds, however, may require a specialized plant that provides a high degree
of mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase.
      Cascade or step aerators are designed so that water flows in a thin film to achieve
efficient mass transfer. Cascade aeration may introduce a significant headloss; de-
sign requirements are between 1 and 3 m to provide a loading of 10–30 m3/m2·h.
Alternatively, compressed air can be diffused through a system of submerged perfor­
ated pipes. These types of aerator are used for oxidation and precipitation of iron and
manganese.
      Air stripping can be used for removal of volatile organics (e.g. solvents), some
taste- and odour-causing compounds and radon. Aeration processes to achieve air
stripping need to be much more elaborate to provide the necessary contact between
the air and water. The most common technique is cascade aeration, usually in packed
towers in which water is allowed to flow in thin films over plastic media with air blown
counter-current. The required tower height and diameter are functions of the volatil-
ity and concentration of the compounds to be removed and the flow rate. Increas-
ing the dissolved oxygen content of a water can increase its corrosivity towards some
metallic materials used in distribution pipes and plumbing, and this should be taken
into account when considering aeration as a treatment process.

A5.1.6 Chemical coagulation
Chemical coagulation-based treatment is the most common approach for treatment
of surface waters and is almost always based on the following unit processes.
     Chemical coagulants, usually salts of aluminium or iron, are dosed to the raw
water under controlled conditions to form a solid flocculent metal hydroxide. Typical
coagulant doses are 2–5 mg/l as aluminium or 4–10 mg/l as iron. The precipitated floc
removes suspended and dissolved contaminants by mechanisms of charge neutraliza-
tion, adsorption and entrapment. The efficiency of the coagulation process depends
on raw water quality, the coagulant or coagulant aids used and operational factors,
including mixing conditions, coagulation dose and pH. The floc is removed from the

                                          489
                          GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


treated water by subsequent solid–liquid separation processes such as sedimentation
or flotation and/or rapid or pressure gravity filtration.
      Effective operation of the coagulation process depends on selection of the opti-
mum coagulant dose and also the pH value. The required dose and pH can be deter-
mined by using small-scale batch coagulation tests, often termed “jar tests”. Increasing
doses of coagulant are applied to raw water samples that are stirred and allowed to
settle. The optimum dose is selected as that which achieves adequate removal of col­
our and turbidity; the optimum pH can be selected in a similar manner. These tests
have to be conducted at a sufficient frequency to keep pace with changes in raw water
quality and hence coagulant demand.
      Powdered activated carbon (PAC) may be dosed during coagulation to adsorb
organic chemicals, such as some hydrophobic pesticides. The PAC will be removed as
an integral fraction of the floc and disposed of with the waterworks sludge.
      The floc may be removed by sedimentation to reduce the solids loading to the
subsequent rapid gravity filters. Sedimentation is most commonly achieved in hori-
zontal flow or floc blanket clarifiers. Alternatively, floc may be removed by dissolved
air flotation, in which solids are contacted with fine bubbles of air that attach to the
floc, causing them to float to the surface of the tank, where they are removed periodic­
ally as a layer of sludge. The treated water from either process is passed to rapid gravity
filters (see section A5.1.4), where remaining solids are removed. Filtered water may be
passed to a further stage of treatment, such as additional oxidation and filtration (for
removal of manganese), ozonation and/or GAC adsorption (for removal of pesticides
and other trace organics), prior to final disinfection before the treated water enters
the supply.
      Coagulation is suitable for removal of particulates and bound microorganisms,
certain heavy metals and low-solubility organic chemicals, such as certain organo-
chlorine pesticides. For other organic chemicals, coagulation is generally ineffective,
except where the chemical is bound to humic material or adsorbed onto particulates.

A5.1.7 Activated carbon adsorption
Activated carbon is produced by the controlled thermalization of carbonaceous ma-
terial, normally wood, coal, coconut shells or peat. This activation produces a porous
material with a large surface area (500–1500 m2/g) and a high affinity for organic com-
pounds. It is normally used in either powdered (PAC) or granular (GAC) form. When
the adsorption capacity of the carbon is exhausted, it can be reactivated by burning off
the organics in a controlled manner. However, PAC (and some GAC) is normally used
only once before disposal. Different types of activated carbon have different affinities
for types of contaminants.
     The choice between PAC and GAC will depend upon the relative cost-effective-
ness, frequency and dose required. PAC would generally be preferred in the case of
seasonal or intermittent contamination or where low dosage rates are required.
     PAC is dosed as a slurry into the water and removed by subsequent treatment
processes, together with the waterworks sludge. Its use is therefore restricted to surface
water treatment works with existing filters. GAC in fixed-bed adsorbers is used much
more efficiently than PAC dosed into the water, and the effective carbon use per water

                                           490
                      ANNEX 5. TREATMENT METHODS AND PERFORMANCE


volume treated would be much lower than the dose of PAC required to achieve the
same removal.
      GAC is used for taste and odour control. It is normally used in fixed beds, either
in purpose-built adsorbers for chemicals or in existing filter shells by replacement of
sand with GAC of a similar particle size. Although at most treatment works it would be
cheaper to convert existing filters rather than build separate adsorbers, use of existing
filters usually allows only short contact times, and they are not capable of facile reacti-
vation. It is therefore common practice to install additional GAC adsorbers (in some
cases preceded by ozonation) between the rapid gravity filters and final disinfection.
Most groundwater sources do not have existing filters, and separate adsorbers would
need to be installed.
      The service life of a GAC bed is dependent on the capacity of the carbon used
and the contact time between the water and the carbon, the empty bed contact time,
controlled by the flow rate of the water. Empty bed contact times are usually in the
range 5–30 minutes. GACs vary considerably in their capacity for specific organic
compounds, which can have a significant effect upon their service life. A guide to
capacity can be obtained from published isotherm data. Carbon capacity is strongly
dependent on the water source and is greatly reduced by the presence of background
organic compounds. The properties of a chemical that influence its adsorption onto
activated carbon include the water solubility and octanol–water partition coefficient.
As a general rule, chemicals with low solubilities and high log octanol–water partition
coefficients are well adsorbed.
      Activated carbon is used for the removal of pesticides and other organic chem­
icals, taste and odour compounds, cyanobacterial toxins and total organic carbon.

A5.1.8 Ion exchange
Ion exchange is a process in which ions of like charge are exchanged between the water
phase and the solid resin phase. Water softening is achieved by cation exchange. Water
is passed through a bed of cationic resin, and the calcium ions and magnesium ions in
the water are replaced by sodium ions. When the ion exchange resin is exhausted (i.e.
the sodium ions are depleted), it is regenerated using a solution of sodium chloride.
The process of “dealkalization” can also soften water. Water is passed through a bed
of weakly acidic resin, and the calcium and magnesium ions are replaced by hydrogen
ions. The hydrogen ions react with the carbonate and bicarbonate ions to produce car-
bon dioxide. The hardness of the water is thus reduced without any increase in sodium
levels. Anion exchange can be used to remove contaminants such as nitrate, fluoride,
arsenate and uranium (as the uranyl anion), which are exchanged for chloride. Several
appropriate resins are available for this purpose.
     An ion exchange plant normally consists of two or more resin beds contained in
pressure shells with appropriate pumps, pipework and ancillary equipment for re-
generation. The pressure shells are typically up to 4 m in diameter, containing 0.6–1.5
m depth of resin.
     Cation exchange can be used for removal of certain heavy metals. Potential ap-
plications of anionic resins, in addition to nitrate removal, are for removal of arsenic
and selenium species.

                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


A5.1.9 Membrane processes
The membrane processes of most significance in water treatment are reverse osmosis,
ultrafiltration, microfiltration and nanofiltration. These processes have traditionally
been applied to the production of water for industrial or pharmaceutical applications,
but are now being applied to the treatment of drinking-water.

High-pressure processes
If two solutions are separated by a semipermeable membrane (i.e. a membrane that
allows the passage of the solvent but not of the solute), the solvent will naturally pass
from the lower-concentration solution to the higher-concentration solution. This
process is known as osmosis. It is possible, however, to force the flow of solvent in the
opposite direction, from the higher to the lower concentration, by increasing the pres-
sure on the higher-concentration solution. The required pressure differential is known
as the osmotic pressure, and the process is known as reverse osmosis.
      Reverse osmosis results in the production of a treated water stream and a rela-
tively concentrated waste stream. Typical operating pressures are in the range 15–50
bar, depending on the application. Reverse osmosis rejects monovalent ions and or-
ganics of molecular weight greater than about 50 daltons (membrane pore sizes are
less than 0.002 µm). The most common application of reverse osmosis is desalination
of brackish water and seawater.
      Nanofiltration uses a membrane with properties between those of reverse osmosis
and ultrafiltration membranes; pore sizes are typically 0.001–0.01 µm. Nanofiltration
membranes allow monovalent ions such as sodium or potassium to pass but reject a
high proportion of divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium and some higher
molecular weight organics. Operating pressures are typically about 5 bar. Nanofiltra-
tion may be effective for the removal of colour-forming organic compounds.

Lower-pressure processes
Ultrafiltration is similar in principle to reverse osmosis, but the membranes have much
larger pore sizes (typically 0.002–0.03 µm) and operate at lower pressures. Ultrafiltra-
tion membranes reject organic molecules of molecular weight above about 800 dal-
tons and usually operate at pressures less than 5 bar.
     Microfiltration is a direct extension of conventional filtration into the sub-
micrometre range. Microfiltration membranes have pore sizes typically in the range
0.01–12 µm and do not separate molecules but reject colloidal and suspended material
at operating pressures of 1–2 bar. Microfiltration is capable of sieving out particles
greater than 0.05 µm. It has been used for water treatment in combination with co-
agulation or PAC to remove particulates and some dissolved organic carbon prior to
reverse osmosis membranes and to improve permeate flux.

A5.1.10 Other treatment processes
Processes aimed at generating hydroxyl radicals are known collectively as advanced
oxidation processes and can be effective for the destruction of chemicals that are dif-
ficult to treat using other methods, such as ozone alone. Hydrogen peroxide with UV
is also a source of hydroxyl radicals. Chemicals can react either directly with molecular

ozone or with the hydroxyl radical (HO·), which is a product of the decomposition
of ozone in water and is an exceedingly powerful indiscriminate oxidant that reacts
readily with a wide range of organic chemicals. The formation of hydroxyl radicals
can be encouraged by using ozone at high pH. One advanced oxidation process using
ozone or UV plus hydrogen peroxide involves dosing hydrogen peroxide simultan­
eously with ozone at a rate of approximately 0.4 mg of hydrogen peroxide per litre per
milligram of ozone dosed per litre (the theoretical optimum ratio for hydroxyl radical
production) and bicarbonate.
     Other treatment processes that can be used in certain applications include:
•   precipitation softening (addition of lime, lime plus sodium carbonate or sodium
    hydroxide to precipitate hardness at high pH);
•   ion exchange softening;
•   biological denitrification for removal of nitrate from surface waters;
•   biological nitrification for removal of ammonia from surface waters;
•   activated alumina (or other adsorbents) for specialized applications, such as
    removal of fluoride and arsenic.

A5.2 Treatment performance for chemicals for which guideline
     values have been established
Treatment performance for chemicals for which guideline values have been estab-
lished is given in Tables A5.1–A5.5.

A5.3 Corrosion of metals used in water treatment and distribution
A5.3.1 Brass
The main corrosion problem with brasses is dezincification, which is the selective dis-
solution of zinc from duplex brass, leaving behind copper as a porous mass of low
mechanical strength. Meringue dezincification, in which a voluminous corrosion
product of basic zinc carbonate forms on the brass surface, largely depends on the
ratio of chloride to alkalinity. Meringue dezincification can be controlled by main­
taining a low zinc to copper ratio (1:3 or lower) and by keeping pH below 8.3.
     General dissolution of brass can also occur, releasing metals, including lead, into
the water. Impingement attack can occur under conditions of high water velocity with
waters that form poorly protective corrosion product layers and that contain large
amounts of dissolved or entrained air.

A5.3.2 Concrete and cement
Concrete is a composite material consisting of a cement binder in which an inert ag-
gregate is embedded. Cement is primarily a mixture of calcium silicates and alumin­
ates together with some free lime. Cement mortar, in which the aggregate is fine sand,
is used as a protective lining in iron and steel water pipes. In asbestos–cement pipe, the
aggregate is asbestos fibres, which are not of concern in drinking-water (see also asbes-
tos fact sheet in chapter 12). Cement is subject to deterioration on prolonged exposure
to aggressive water, due either to the dissolution of lime and other soluble compounds

      b
        The table includes only those chemicals for which some treatment data are available. A blank entry in the table indicates either that the process is completely ineffective or that there
        are no data on the effectiveness of the process. For the most effective processes, where data are available, the table indicates the concentration of the chemical (in mg/l) that should be
        achievable.
      c
        Biological treatment includes slow sand filtration and bank filtration.
      d
        Yes means known or likely to be effective, but performance was not quantified.
      e
        Might be effective, but other techniques would be more likely to be applied due to cost.

or to chemical attack by aggressive ions such as chloride or sulfate, and this may result
in structural failure. Newly installed cement materials will leach lime, with consequent
increases in pH, alkalinity and hardness. Cement contains a variety of metals that
can be leached into the water. Aggressiveness to cement is related to the “aggressivity
index”, which has been used specifically to assess the potential for the dissolution of
concrete. A pH of 8.5 or higher may be necessary to control cement corrosion.

A5.3.3 Copper
The corrosion of copper pipework and hot water cylinders can cause blue water, blue
or green staining of bathroom fittings and, occasionally, taste problems. Copper tub-
ing may be subject to general corrosion, impingement attack and pitting corrosion.
     General corrosion is most often associated with soft, acidic waters; waters with
pH below 6.5 and hardness of less than 60 mg of calcium carbonate per litre are very
aggressive to copper. Copper, like lead, can enter water by dissolution of the corrosion
product, basic copper carbonate. The solubility is mainly a function of pH and total
inorganic carbon. Solubility decreases with increase in pH, but increases with increase
in concentrations of carbonate species. Raising the pH to between 8 and 8.5 is the
usual procedure to overcome these difficulties.
     Impingement attack is the result of excessive flow velocities and is aggravated in
soft water at high temperature and low pH.
     The pitting of copper is commonly associated with hard groundwaters having a
carbon dioxide concentration above 5 mg/l and high dissolved oxygen. Phosphates
have been used to suppress copper corrosion in those cases. Surface waters with
organic colour may also be associated with pitting corrosion. Copper pipes can fail by
pitting corrosion, which involves highly localized attacks leading to perforations with
negligible loss of metal. Two main types of attack are recognized. Type I pitting affects
cold water systems (below 40 °C) and is associated, particularly, with hard borehole
waters and the presence of a carbon film in the bore of the pipe, derived from the
manufacturing process. Tubes that have had the carbon removed by cleaning are im-
mune from Type I pitting. Type II pitting occurs in hot water systems (above 60 °C)
and is associated with soft waters. A high proportion of general and pitting corrosion
problems are associated with new pipe in which a protective oxide layer has not yet
formed. Calcium carbonate precipitation indices such as Langelier and Ryznar are not
good predictors of corrosion for copper systems.

A5.3.4 Iron
Iron (either cast or ductile) is frequently used in water distribution systems, and its
corrosion is of concern. While structural failure as a result of iron corrosion is rare,
water quality problems (e.g. “red water”) can arise as a result of excessive corrosion of
iron pipes. The corrosion of iron is a complex process that involves the oxidation of
the metal, normally by dissolved oxygen, ultimately to form a precipitate of iron(III).
This leads to the formation of tubercules on the pipe surface. The major water qual-
ity factors that determine whether the precipitate forms a protective scale are pH and
alkalinity. The concentrations of calcium, chloride and sulfate also influence iron cor-
rosion. Successful control of iron corrosion has been achieved by adjusting the pH to

                                          501
                         GUIDELINES FOR DRINKING-WATER QUALITY


the range 6.8–7.3, hardness and alkalinity to at least 40 mg/l (as calcium carbonate),
oversaturation with calcium carbonate of 4–10 mg/l and a ratio of alkalinity to chlor­
ide plus sulfate of at least 5 (when both are expressed as calcium carbonate).
     Silicates and polyphosphates are often described as “corrosion inhibitors”, but
there is no guarantee that they will inhibit corrosion in water distribution systems.
However, they can complex dissolved iron (in the iron(II) state) and prevent its pre-
cipitation as visibly obvious red “rust”. These compounds may act by masking the ef-
fects of corrosion rather than by preventing it. Orthophosphate is a possible corrosion
inhibitor and, like polyphosphates, is used to prevent “red water”.

A5.3.5 Lead
Lead corrosion (plumbosolvency) is of particular concern. Lead piping is still com-
mon in old houses in some countries, lead solders have been used widely for jointing
copper tubing and brass fittings can contain substantial amounts of lead. Galvanized
iron pipe plumbing can accumulate incoming lead and release it at a later time as
particulates. The solubility of lead is governed by the formation of lead carbonates as
pipe deposits. Wherever practicable, lead pipework should be replaced. Lead can also
leach from lead-based solders and brass and bronze fittings.
     The solubility of corrosion-related lead salts increases markedly as the pH in-
creases above or decreases below 8.3 because of the substantial decrease in the equi-
librium carbonate concentration. Thus, plumbosolvency tends to be at a maximum
in waters with a low pH and low alkalinity, and a useful interim control procedure,
pending pipe replacement, is to increase the pH to 8.0–8.5 after chlorination prior to
distribution. Orthophosphate and other phosphates are effective in suppressing dis-
solution of lead.
     Lead concentrations increase with increasing standing time of water in lead pipe.
Flushing the pipework before drawing water for consumption can be used as an in-
terim measure to reduce exposure to lead. Showering, bathing and flushing the toilet
can be used to flush out the system.
     Lead can corrode more rapidly when it is coupled to copper. The rate of such gal-
vanic corrosion is faster than that of simple oxidative corrosion, and lead concentra-
tions are not limited by the solubility of the corrosion products. The rate of galvanic
corrosion is affected principally by chloride concentration. Galvanic corrosion is less
easily controlled but can be reduced by dosing zinc in conjunction with orthophos-
phate and by adjustment of pH.
     Treatment to reduce plumbosolvency usually involves pH adjustment. When
the water is very soft (calcium carbonate concentration less than 50 mg/l), the opti-
mum pH is about 8.0–8.5. Alternatively, dosing with orthophosphoric acid or sodium
orthophosphate might be more effective, particularly when plumbosolvency occurs
in non-acidic waters. Calcium carbonate precipitation indices such as Langelier and
Ryznar are not considered to be necessarily good predictors of corrosion for lead.

A5.3.6 Nickel
Nickel in water may arise due to the leaching of nickel from new nickel/chromium-
plated taps. Low concentrations may also arise from stainless steel pipes and fittings.

                                         502
                      ANNEX 5. TREATMENT METHODS AND PERFORMANCE


Nickel leaching falls off over time. An increase of pH to control corrosion of other
materials should also reduce leaching of nickel.

A5.3.7 Zinc
Galvanized pipes will release zinc (from the galvanizing layer) and can also leach cad-
mium and lead. Corrosion can be a particular problem where galvanized steel or iron
piping is connected to dissimilar materials, such as brass, in taps and fittings.
     The solubility of zinc in water is a function of pH and total inorganic carbon
concentrations; the solubility of basic zinc carbonate decreases with increase in pH
and concentrations of carbonate species. For low-alkalinity waters, an increase of pH
to 8.5 should be sufficient to control the dissolution of zinc.
     With galvanized iron, the zinc layer initially protects the steel by corroding prefer-
entially. In the long term, a protective deposit of basic zinc carbonate forms; however,
galvanized pipe is also prone to uncontrolled deposition and clogging. Recent findings
have shown that lead can accumulate on galvanized pipe particulates and become
resuspended by physical disruption, such as water hammer. Protective deposits do
not form in soft waters where the alkalinity is less than 50 mg/l as calcium carbonate
or waters containing high carbon dioxide concentrations (> 25 mg/l), and galvanized
steel is unsuitable for these waters. Electrolytic corrosion can occur where galvanized
steel or iron pipes or fittings are connected with copper tube or brass fittings.

  Guidance levels were rounded to the nearest order of magnitude by averaging the log scale values (to 10n if the
  calculated value was below 3 × 10n and to 10n+1 if the value was 3 × 10 or above). For example, if the calculated value
  was 2 Bq/L (i.e. 2 × 100), the guidance level was rounded to 100 (i.e. = 1) whereas, if the calculated value was 3 Bq /L
  (i.e. 3 × 100 or above), the guidance level was rounded to 101 (i.e. = 10).
b
  Natural radionuclides.
c
  The provisional guideline value for uranium in drinking-water is 30 µg/l based on its chemical toxicity for the kidney
  (see section 8.5).
