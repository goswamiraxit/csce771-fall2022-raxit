             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Chapter 850: IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES

SUMMARY: This rule identifies hazardous wastes. These hazardous wastes
are subject to regulation according to the provisions of 38 M.R.S., §1301, et
seq. and to this and other rules adopted thereunder.

NOTE: As used in this rule, "department" has the same meaning as in the
Rule Concerning the Processing of Applications and Other Administrative
Matters, 06-096 C.M.R. ch. 2, and may refer to either the "board" or the
"commissioner". Under certain circumstances, Maine statutes require that
the board, rather than the commissioner, perform duties that may be
described or referenced in this rule (e.g. licensing of commercial hazardous
waste facilities pursuant to 38 M.R.S. §1319-R; licensing of projects of
"statewide significance" pursuant to 38 M.R.S. §341-D).

l. Legal Authority. This rule is authorized and adopted under 38 M.R.S.
§1319-O (1) and is intended to be consistent with applicable requirements of
The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. 6901, et seq.
and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) thereunder.

2. Preamble. It is the purpose of the Department of Environmental
Protection, consistent with legislative policy, to provide effective controls for
the management of hazardous wastes. This rule is promulgated to identify
hazardous wastes so that effective management measures can be
implemented.

3. Identification of Hazardous Wastes

A. General

(1) This rule identifies those wastes which are subject to regulation as
hazardous wastes under 38 M.R.S. §1301, et seq.

(2) Portions of this rule refer to federal regulations of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Unless otherwise specified, the
federal regulations referenced are those interim final or final regulations
revised as of July 1, 1994, as they appeared in volume 40 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). References to test methods shall include
regulations published on July 1, 2005, including 40 C.F.R. 260.11 which is
hereby adopted by reference. Where specifically indicated, the terms of a
referenced federal regulation are hereby adopted as terms of this rule,
except that in regulations incorporated thereby, "EPA", "Administrator",
"Regional Administrator" and "Director" shall mean "the Maine Department
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


of Environmental Protection or its designated representative"; and the
phrase "treat, store, and/or dispose" shall mean "handle". In addition, where
the terms of federal regulations hereby incorporated by reference differ from
or are inconsistent with other terms of this Chapter or Chapters 850-860,
the more stringent of the requirements shall apply. Other changes to
regulations incorporated hereby are as expressly made in this rule.

Waste. "Waste" means any useless, unwanted or discarded substance or
material, whether or not such substance or material has any other or future
use and includes any substance or material that is spilled, leaked, pumped,
poured, emitted, disposed, emptied, or dumped onto the land or into the
water or ambient air. This definition includes, without being limited to,
materials which are used in a manner constituting disposal, burned for
energy recovery, reclaimed or accumulated speculatively.

NOTE: It is intended that the terms "materials which are used in a manner
constituting disposal, burned for energy recovery, reclaimed or accumulated
speculatively" should include all materials covered by 40 C.F.R. Section
261.2(c)(1)-(4) and any amendments thereto.

(3) Definition of hazardous waste

(a) A waste is a hazardous waste if:

(i) It is not excluded from regulation as a hazardous waste under Section
3(A)(4) of this rule; and

(ii) It meets any of the following criteria:

a. It is listed in Section 3(C) and has not been excluded by EPA under 40
C.F.R. 260.20 and 260.22 and excluded subsequently by the Department;

b. It is a mixture of a non-hazardous waste and one or more hazardous
wastes listed in Section 3(C) and has not been excluded by EPA under 40
C.F.R. 260.20 and 260.22 and excluded subsequently by the Department; or

c. It exhibits any of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in
Section 3(B) of this rule.

(b) A waste which is not excluded from regulation under paragraph
3(A)(3)(a)(i) of this section becomes a hazardous waste when any of the
following events occur:

(i) In the case of a waste listed in Section 3(C), when the waste first meets
the listing description set forth in Section 3(C).
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(ii) In the case of a mixture of a non-hazardous waste and one or more listed
hazardous wastes, when a hazardous waste listed in Section 3(C) is first
added to the non-hazardous waste.

(iii) In the case of any other waste (including a waste mixture), when the
waste exhibits any of the characteristics identified in Section 3(B) of this
rule.

(c) Unless and until it meets the criteria of paragraph (d) below:

(i) A hazardous waste will remain a hazardous waste.

(ii) Any waste generated from the handling of a hazardous waste, including
any sludge, spill residue, ash, emission control dust or leachate (but not
including precipitation run-off), is a hazardous waste.

(d) Any waste described in paragraph (c) above is not a hazardous waste if it
meets the following criteria:

(i) In the case of any waste, it does not exhibit any of the characteristics of
hazardous waste identified in Section 3(B); however, such waste which
exhibits a characteristic at the point of generation is still subject to the
requirements of Chapter 852 even if the waste no longer exhibits a
characteristic at the point of disposal.

(ii) In the case of a waste which is a listed waste under Section 3(C), contains
a waste listed under Section 3(C) or is derived from a waste listed in Section
3(C), it also has been excluded from paragraph (c) by EPA under 40 C.F.R.
260.20 and 260.22 and excluded subsequently by the Department.

(4) Exclusions

(a) Substances which are not hazardous wastes. The following
materials are not hazardous wastes for the purpose of this rule:

(i) Domestic sewage; and

(ii) Any mixture of domestic sewage and other wastes that passes through a
sewer system to a publicly-owned treatment works (POTW) for treatment,
provided the mixture is a discharge of a non segregable waste at the site of
generation, the mixture is a discharge from a source whose hazardous
constituents are subject to categorical, local limits, and prohibitions
established in accordance with Section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act, and
the source is in compliance with those limits by means other than dilution
and the hazardous constituents are sampled and analyzed no less frequently
than annually. "Domestic sewage" means untreated sanitary wastes that
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


pass through a sewer system. The unknowing receipt of hazardous waste by
a POTW does not cause the POTW to become a hazardous waste facility.

NOTE: Unless the discharge is non segregable and is subject to categorical
and local limits, persons discharging hazardous waste to POTWs via a sewer
system containing domestic sewage or other means are subject to the
applicable abbreviated license provisions of Chapter 856, Section 11.
Dischargers to POTWs and POTWs are responsible for complying with the
applicable provisions of Chapter 856, Section 11. See also Section 12(D) of
Chapter 851. A waste is considered non-segregable when it is inherently
mixed with wastewater and is not segregated in containers, tanks, pipes and
sumps. A segregable waste cannot be introduced to wastewaters unless an
abbreviated license is held for the activity.

(iii) Industrial wastewater discharges that are point source discharges
subject to regulation under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, as amended,
in so far as any hazardous waste present in the discharge is in fact regulated.

NOTE: This exclusion applies only to the actual point source discharge. It
does not exclude industrial wastewaters while they are being handled before
discharge, or sludges that are generated by industrial wastewater treatment.
The exclusion is further limited by the provisions under Chapter 856 for the
abbreviated licensing of a POTW for treatment of a hazardous waste.

(iv) Irrigation return flows.

(v) Source, special nuclear or by-product material as defined by the Atomic
Energy Act of l954, , 42 U.S.C.. 20ll et seq., as amended up to August 8,
2005.

(vi) Materials subjected to in-situ mining techniques which are not removed
from the ground as part of the extraction process.

(vii) Household waste, including household waste that has been collected,
transported, stored, treated, disposed, recovered (e.g., refuse-derived fuel)
or reused. "Household waste" means any waste material (including garbage,
trash and sanitary wastes in septic tanks) derived from households
(including single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses,
picnic grounds, and day-use recreation areas.)

(viii) Wastes resulting from agricultural activities which are returned to the
soils as fertilizers. "Agricultural activities" means the growing of vegetables,
fruit, seeds, nursery crops, poultry, livestock, field crops, cultivated or
pasture hay and farm woodlot products, including Christmas trees.

(ix) Mining overburden returned to the mine site.
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Note: Wastes from the extraction and beneficiation of metallic ores and
minerals are regulated under Chapter 200 of the Department's rules, not
Chapters 850-857.

(x) Fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, and flue emission control
waste generated solely from the combustion of coal, other fossil fuels, or
wood or generated primarily from the combustion of coal and/or other fossil
fuels and/or wood, providing that the waste does not exhibit any of the
characteristics of hazardous waste as defined in Section 3(B)(2), (3), (4), or
(5) of this rule.

(xi) Drilling fluids, produced waters. and other wastes associated with the
exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas or
geothermal energy.

(xii) A sample of waste or sample of water, soil, or air which is collected for
the sole purpose of testing to determine its characteristics or composition
provided it meets the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 261.4(d)(1)(i)-(vi) which are
hereby adopted and incorporated by reference, and the sample collector
shipping samples to a laboratory and a laboratory returning samples to a
sample collector comply with 40 C.F.R. 261.4(d)(2) which is hereby adopted
and incorporated by reference. This exemption does not apply if the
laboratory determines the waste is hazardous but the laboratory is no longer
meeting the requirements of this provision.

(xiii) Commercial chemical product that is unused and which is reinserted
into the onsite manufacturing process without any alteration and is used as
a substitute for feedstock materials without placement on the land, or that is
unused and unexpired and is shipped to the original manufacturer or
distributor with their approval for use.

(xiv) Waste from the leather tanning and finishing industry including
chrome (blue) trimmings, chrome (blue) shavings, and buffing dust; and
scrap tanned leather from the leather tanning industry, the shoe
manufacturing industry, and other leather product manufacturing
industries, provided the generator can demonstrate the waste meets the
exemption criteria of 40 C.F.R. 261.4(b)(6)(i) which is hereby adopted and
incorporated by reference, the waste is managed in a non oxidizing
environment, and if disposed in Maine, is managed in a secure landfill.

NOTE: Due to the potential conversion of trivalent chromium to hexavalent
chromium in certain situations, the increased leachability of certain types of
chrome waste, and the current management of the waste in oxidizing
environments, the Department continues to have concerns with the
disposition of this waste stream. These wastes will be managed in secure
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


landfills as special wastes under the Solid Waste Management Regulations,
06-096 C.M.R. 400-405, 409, and 418.

(xv) Pulping liquors (i.e: black liquor) that are reclaimed in a pulping liquor
recovery furnace and then reused in the pulping process, provided the
storage of such liquor, if any, prior to reuse occurs in a fully enclosed tank
and the liquors are not accumulated speculatively as defined in 40 C.F.R.
261.1(c)

NOTE: For the purpose of this paragraph, pulping liquor that is spilled or
otherwise released into the environment may qualify for this exemption only
to the extent the liquor is recovered for subsequent reuse.

(xvi) Scrap metal which is recycled or intended to be recycled, provided it is
not accumulated speculatively as defined in 40 C.F.R. 261.1(c). "Scrap
metal" means bits and pieces of metal parts (e.g., bars, turnings, rods,
sheets, wire) or metal pieces that may be combined together with bolts or
soldering (e.g. radiators, scrap automobiles, railroad box cars), which when
worn or superfluous can be recycled and which are not otherwise mixed with
or contaminated with non metal hazardous wastes.

NOTE: It is the generator's responsibility to demonstrate to the Department
that the scrap metal is being recycled.

(xvii) Materials in unopened containers which are unused, unexpired and
which meet the product specifications, provided the materials are not used
in a manner constituting disposal (unless the product is normally applied to
the land) or burned for energy recovery (unless the product is a fuel).

(xviii) Unused, unexpired materials in an original container which meet the
product specifications, provided the Chief Executive Officers or plant
managers of the shipping and receiving facilities exchange letters
acknowledging the exchange of material, the Department receives copies of
these letters prior to shipment, and the materials are not used in a manner
constituting disposal (unless the product is originally applied to the land) or
burned for energy recovery (unless the product is a fuel.) The letter must
contain the following information: (1) the type and quantity of material
transferred; (2) the name, address and telephone number of the transferer
and transferee; (3) the date of transfer; and (4) the proposed use of the
materials by the transferee.

(xix) Isopropyl alcohol is excluded when shown to be recycled by being used
or reused as an effective substitute for commercial products provided the
isopropyl alcohol is not being reclaimed and the generator and recycling
facility is in compliance with the following:
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


The generator and if located in Maine, the recycler, must maintain the
following documentation at the facility of the generator and, if located in
Maine, at the recycling facility, and be available for the Department's
inspection:

(1) A description of the isopropyl alcohol to be used or reused;

(2) Consistent with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 261.2(f) a demonstration
that a known market or disposition exists for the isopropyl alcohol. This
demonstration must include documentation such as a contract that a
material is used to substitute for another product; a description of the
process by which the isopropyl alcohol is beneficially used or reused; a
representative analysis of the isopropyl alcohol including the hazardous
constituents found in 40 C.F.R. 261 Appendix VIII; and documentation that
the use of the material does not introduce toxic constituents into the
product, for which the material is used as a substitute, in concentrations that
are higher than those found in analogous products consistent with 40 C.F.R.
261.2(d)(3)(i)(B); and

(3) Consistent with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 261.2(f), a demonstration
by the owners or operators of the receiving facilities that they are actually
recycling the materials and documenting that they have the necessary
equipment to do so.

Isopropyl alcohol is not exempt under this provision and is a hazardous
waste, even if the recycling involves use or reuse, consistent with 40 C.F.R.
261.2(c) and (e) if the isopropyl alcohol or associated materials are
reclaimed, used in a manner constituting disposal, or used to produce
products that are applied to land, or burned for energy recovery, used to
produce a fuel, or contained in fuels, or if materials are accumulated
speculatively as defined in 40 C.F.R. 261.1(c)(8), or fed to a halogen acid
furnace. A respondent in an action to enforce hazardous waste regulations
who raises a claim that isopropyl alcohol is used or reused under this
provision must demonstrate consistent with 40 C.F.R. 261.2(f), that there is
a known market or disposition for the material, and that they meet the terms
of the exclusion.

(xx) Petroleum-contaminated media and debris that fail the test for the
toxicity characteristic of Section 3(B)(5) of this Chapter (Waste Codes D018
through D043) and are subject to the corrective action requirements of
Chapter 691.

(xxi) Debris (as defined in Section 3(A) of Chapter 852) that does not exhibit
a hazardous waste characteristic, and which has been treated in accordance
with Section 14(C) of Chapter 852 or the Department determines is no
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


longer contaminated with hazardous waste. Persons claiming this exclusion
based on treatment will have the burden of proving by clear and convincing
evidence in an enforcement action that the material meets all of the
exclusion requirements.

(xxii) Scrap metal including processed scrap metal, unprocessed home scrap
metal, and unprocessed prompt scrap metal. As used in this Chapter:

"Processed scrap metal" is scrap metal which has been manually or
physically altered to either separate it into distinct materials to enhance
economic value or to improve the handling of materials. Processed scrap
metal includes, but is not limited to scrap metal which has been baled,
shredded, sheared, chopped, crushed, flattened, cut, melted, or separated by
metal type (i.e. sorted), and fines, drosses and related materials which have
been agglomerated.

"Home scrap metal" is scrap metal as generated by steel mills, foundries,
and refineries such as turnings, cuttings, punchings, and borings.

(xxiii) "Prompt scrap metal" is scrap metal as generated by the metal
working/fabrication industries and includes such scrap metal as turnings,
cuttings, punchings, and borings. Prompt scrap is also known as industrial
or new scrap metal.Solid waste which consists of discarded arsenical-treated
wood or wood products which fails the test for the Toxicity Characteristic for
Hazardous Waste Code D004 through D017 and which is not a hazardous
waste for any other reason if the waste is generated by persons who utilize
the arsenical-treated wood and wood product for these materials' intended
end use.

(xxiv) EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. K060, K087, K141, K142, K143, K144,
K145, K147, and K148, and any wastes from the coke by-products processes
that are hazardous only because they exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic (TC)
specified in Section 3(B)(5) of this Chapter when, subsequent to generation,
these materials are recycled to coke ovens, to the tar recovery process as a
feedstock to produce coal tar, or mixed with coal tar prior to the tar's sale or
refining. This exclusion is conditioned on there being no land disposal of the
wastes from the point they are generated to the point they are recycled to
coke ovens or tar recovery or refining processes, or mixed with coal tar.

(xxv) Used cutting oil from metal working operations that is otherwise
identified in the Waste Oil Management Rules 06-096 C.M.R. ch. 860, §4 as
a "waste oil which must be managed as a hazardous waste", provided that it:

(1) Exceeds the allowable level for total halogens established in 06-096
C.M.R. ch. 860(4)(C) (4000 ppm) due solely to the presence of chlorinated
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


paraffins as a constituent of the cutting oil itself, and not due to the mixing
of a halogenated hazardous waste with the oil;

(2) Is not mixed or contaminated with any other hazardous waste, and does
not exhibit hazardous waste characteristics except as provided in 06-096
C.M.R ch. 860(4)(C), as demonstrated through sampling and analysis,
and/or knowledge of process;

(3) Does not exceed the allowable levels established in 06-096 C.M.R. ch.
860(4)(C) for arsenic, cadium, chromium, lead, PCBs, and flash point;

(4) Is, or will be, processed through a tolling arrangement to reclaim the oil
as described in 40 C.F.R. 279.24(c), or recycled through an arrangement at a
facility authorized and equipped to recycle the waste, which is documented
by a written contract, agreement, bill of sale or receipt from the recycling
facility;

(5) Is stored, prior to shipment to the recycling or processing facility, at the
site of generation, on a firm, impervious surface constructed to prevent
spillage from leaving the area, and in closed, non-leaking containers or tanks
labeled with the words "Used Oil Containing Chlorinated Paraffins"; and,

(6) Is transported from the site of generation to a facility authorized to
handle the waste by a Maine-licensed waste oil transporter, and each
shipment is documented by a bill of lading, a copy of which is retained by
the generator for at least three years from the date of shipment.

(5) Special requirements for hazardous waste generated by small
quantity generators

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a person determines
whether the waste he generates is hazardous under Chapter 851, Section 5
and generates, in a calendar month, a total of less than 100 kilograms
(220.46 lbs.) of hazardous wastes, those wastes are not subject to regulation
under 38 M.R.S., §1301, et seq. and related rules, provided the generator
complies with paragraph (d) below.

NOTE: A small quantity generator is required to properly package for
shipment, manifest, use a licensed hazardous waste transporter, and ship its
hazardous waste to an authorized facility identified in Section 3(A)(5)(d)(v)
of this chapter.

(b) If a person whose waste has been excluded from regulation under
paragraph (a) above accumulates hazardous wastes in quantities greater
than 600 kilograms or acutely hazardous wastes in quantities greater than
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, all of those accumulated wastes are
subject to regulation under 38 M.R.S. §1301 et seq. and related rules
(Chapters 850-860 of the Department's rules).

(c) If a person generates in a calendar month or accumulates at any time any
of the following acutely hazardous wastes in quantities greater than set forth
below, those wastes are subject to regulation under 38 M.R.S., §1301 et seq.
and related rules. (Chapters 850-857 of the Department's Rules).

(i) A total of one kilogram of commercial chemical products and
manufacturing chemical intermediates having the generic names listed in
Section 3(C)(4)(e) of this Chapter and off-specification commercial chemical
products and manufacturing chemical intermediates which, if they met
specifications, would have the generic names listed in Section 3(C)(4)(e) of
this Chapter.

(ii) A total of one kilogram of the following hazardous wastes listed in
Section 3(C)(2)(a) of this rule: Industry and EPA hazardous waste Nos.
F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, F027, and F028.

larger than 20 liters in capacity;
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(iv) Ten (10) kilograms of inner liners from containers identified in Section
3(C)(4)(c) of this Chapter;

(v) A total of 100 kilograms of any residue or contaminated soil, water, or
other debris resulting from the cleanup of a spill, into or on any land or
water, of any commercial chemical products or manufacturing chemical
intermediates having the generic names listed in Section 3(C)(4)(e) of this
Chapter or any residue or contaminated soil, water, or other debris resulting
from the cleanup of a spill, into or on any land or water, of any
off-specification commercial chemical products or manufacturing chemical
intermediates which, if they met specifications, would have the generic
names listed in Section 3(C)(4)(e) of this Chapter;

NOTE: Any person who exceeds the quantity requirements outlined in
Sections 3(A)(5)(b) and 3(A)(5)(c) of this rule is subject to full regulation
(i.e., regulation applicable to generators of greater than 100 kilograms per
month of hazardous waste), including the requirements of Chapter 851,
Section 8(B) that relate to accumulation times for hazardous waste. The
time period in Section 8(B) of Chapter 851 begins when the accumulated
wastes exceed the applicable exclusion limit.

(d) In order for hazardous waste to be excluded from regulation under this
section, the generator must:

(i) Determine whether the waste generated is hazardous in accordance with
Section 5 of Chapter 851;

(ii) Store the waste in a container no greater than 55 gallons in size, label
and package the hazardous waste in accordance with Section 8(A) and
8(B)(3) of Chapter 851, and label the container with the date the container
becomes full;

(iii) Properly manifest the hazardous waste in accordance with Chapter 857;

(iv) Utilize a licensed transporter in accordance with Section 7 of Chapter
851;

(v) Transport, or offer for transport, such waste only to a waste facility for
hazardous waste which is authorized to handle the waste under a state
program, and if applicable, under the federal hazardous waste regulatory
program; and

(vi) Ship off site such waste within 180 days of the date the drum becomes
full; and
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(vii) If more than 55 gallons (approximately 200 kg) of a non-acutely
hazardous waste is stored onsite, the generator must in addition:

a. Manage the waste in accordance with Sections 8(B)(2), 11, 13(B)(1),(2),
13(C)(1), (3), (4) and 13(D)(1), and (2) of Chapter 851; and

b. In accordance with Chapter 851 Section 6, have a generator identification
number assigned to the generator by the Maine Department of
Environmental Protection if the generator will be operating under the
provisions of 3(A)(5)(d)(vii) of this Chapter.

NOTE: To be eligible for the reduced requirements of this section, a small
quantity generator must store its waste in containers.

(e) Hazardous waste subject to the reduced requirements of paragraph (d)
that is mixed with non-hazardous waste remains subject to these reduced
requirements as long as the resultant mixture does not exceed the quantity
limitations identified in this section. If any person mixes a solid waste with a
hazardous waste that exceeds a quantity exclusion level of this section, the
mixture is subject to full regulation. Mixture of a characteristic hazardous
waste with a non hazardous waste such that the mixture no longer exhibits a
characteristic constitutes treatment which requires a license pursuant to
Chapters 854 and 856.

(6) Special requirements for hazardous waste which is
beneficially used or reused

(a) Activities that may be eligible for reduced licensing requirements
because those activities involve hazardous waste which is beneficially used
or reused are specified under Section 11 of Chapter 856, "Requirements for
Facilities Licensed under the Abbreviated License Process."

(b) Activities that involve recycling and reclamation of hazardous waste are
considered forms of treatment and, as such, are subject to the requirements
of Chapter 854 and 856 with respect to treatment of hazardous waste.

(7) Residues of hazardous waste in empty containers. Any residue
remaining in a container or an inner liner removed from a container that has
held any hazardous waste other than hazardous waste identified as acute
hazardous waste in Section 3(C)(2), 3(C)(3) or 3(C)(4)(e) is a hazardous
waste unless the container is empty as defined below:

(a) All wastes have been removed that can be removed using the practices
commonly employed to remove materials from that type container and
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(b) No more than one inch of residue containing no free liquids remains on
the bottom of the container or inner liner or

NOTE: Removing free liquids from a container may include: draining the
emptied container for at least thirty (30) seconds after the steady flow of
hazardous waste has ceased and individual droplets are clearly evident and
then performing that procedure two more times.

(c) The container or inner liner has been triple rinsed using a solvent
capable of removing the waste, or

(d) If the container has held a hazardous waste that is a compressed gas, the
pressure in the container is at atmospheric.

Any residue remaining in a container or an inner liner removed from a
container that has held an acute hazardous waste is empty if the container or
inner liner has been triple rinsed using a solvent capable of removing the
waste or, in the case of a container, the inner liner that prevented contact of
the commercial chemical product or manufacturing chemical intermediate
with the container, has been removed.

(e) no more than 3% by weight of the total capacity remains in the container
or inner liner if the container is less than or equal to 119 gallons; or

no more than 0.3% by weight of the total capacity remains in the container
or inner liner if the container is greater than 119 gallons.

(8) The use of material which is contaminated or mixed with dioxin or any
other hazardous waste identified in Chapter 850, for dust suppression or
road treatment is prohibited.

(9) No other fuel which contains any hazardous waste may be burned in any
cement kiln or other boiler or industrial furnace unless licensed under
Chapter 856.

(10) Persons who generate, transport, or collect non-leaking spent lead acid
batteries, or who store non-leaking spent batteries but do not reclaim or
intend to reclaim them are not required to obtain a license for such a facility.

(11) Owners or operators of facilities that store spent lead acid batteries
before reclaiming them are required to obtain a license for such storage
under Chapter 856.

waste transporter requirements, as provided in Section 11 of Chapter 853.
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


NOTE: Chapters 854 and 856 apply to a universal waste recycling facility.

(d) Household hazardous waste, which meets the description of universal
waste in Section 3(A)(13)(b) but which is exempt under Section
3(A)(4)(a)(vii), when combined or mixed with universal wastes is no longer
exempt and must be managed in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 850, 851, 853, 856, 857, and 858.

(e) All generators of universal wastes must:

(i) Determine whether the waste generated is hazardous in accordance with

all mercury containing lamps are a universal waste; and

(ii) Determine whether the waste is a universal waste under section 13(b)
above;

NOTE: If a hazardous waste is not eligible for regulation under the
universal waste rules, then the full hazardous waste management rules
apply.

(iii) Immediately contain and transfer all releases of waste and residues
resulting from spills or leaks from broken or ruptured universal waste to a
container that meets the requirements of the Maine Hazardous Waste
Management Rules (Chapter 850 through 857), except that waste and
residues from incidental breakage may still be managed as a universal
waste;

(iv) Determine by testing, or handle as hazardous, clean up residues
resulting from spills or leaks from events other than incidental breakage of
lamps or CRTs in accordance with Maine Hazardous Waste Management
Rules (Chapter 850 through 857) including generator accumulation time
limit, storage and disposal standards, and count this waste toward the
determination of hazardous waste generator status;

(14) Special requirements for certain batteries

Batteries that are described in 40 C.F.R. 273.2 revised as of July 1, 2001
must be managed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 273 revised as of July 1,
2001, except that references to 40 C.F.R. Parts 260 through 272 shall mean
850 through 857 of the Maine Hazardous Waste Management Rules and
except that 40 C.F.R. 273.8(a)(2) is not adopted, and instead, batteries
handled by federally conditionally exempt small quantity generators are
regulated as small quantity handlers pursuant to 40 C.F.R. 273 Subpart B. In
addition, instead of 40 C.F.R. 273.2(c), a battery becomes a waste on the
date that it becomes useless, unwanted, or intended for disposal, and spent
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


lead acid batteries described in 40 C.F.R. 273.2(a)(2) and 273.2(b)(1) are
regulated under 850 through 858 instead of 40 C.F.R. part 266, subpart G.

B. Identification of hazardous wastes by characteristics

(1) General

(a) A waste which is not excluded from regulation as a hazardous waste
under Section 3(A)(4) of this rule is a hazardous waste if it exhibits any of
the characteristics identified in this rule.

(b) A hazardous waste which is identified by a characteristic in this section is
assigned every EPA Hazardous Waste Number that is applicable in Section
3(B) of this Chapter. This number, alone or in combination with another
number assigned by the Department as provided by rule, must be used in
complying with regulatory requirements of Chapters 850 - 857 and Section
3010 of RCRA.

(c) For purposes of this Section 3(B) of this rule, the Department will
consider a sample obtained using any of the applicable sampling methods
specified in Appendix I of this rule to be a representative sample within the
meaning of 40 C.F.R. 260.10 of EPA regulations. A person who desires to
employ an alternative sampling method must demonstrate the equivalency
of that method under the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. 260.20 and
260.2l.

(2) Characteristic of ignitability

(a) A waste exhibits the characteristic of ignitability if a representative
sample of the waste has any of the following properties:

(i) It is a liquid, other than an aqueous solution containing less than 24
percent alcohol by volume, and has a flash point less than 60º C (l40º F) as
determined by a Pensky-Martens Closed Cup Tester, using the test method
specified in ASTM Standard D-93-79 or D-93-80, or a Setaflash Closed Cup
Tester, using the test method specified in ASTM standard D-3278-78, or as
determined by an equivalent test method approved by the EPA under the
procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R. 260.20 and 260.21.[1]

(ii) It is not a liquid and is capable, under standard temperature and
pressure, of causing fire through friction, absorption of moisture or
spontaneous chemical changes and, when ignited, burns so vigorously and
persistently that it creates a hazard.

(iii) It is an ignitable compressed gas.
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes

having in the container an absolute pressure exceeding 40 p.s.i. at 70° F or,
regardless of the pressure at 70° F, having an absolute pressure exceeding
104 p.s.i. at 130° F; or any liquid flammable material having a vapor
pressure exceeding 40 p.s.i. absolute at 100° F as determined by ASTM Test
D-323.

(2) A compressed gas shall be characterized as ignitable if any one of the
following occurs:

(a) Either a mixture of 13 percent or less (by volume) with air forms a
flammable mixture or the flammable range with air is wider than 12 percent
regardless of the lower limit. These limits shall be determined at
atmospheric temperature and pressure. The method of sampling and test
procedure shall be acceptable to the Bureau of Explosives and approved by
the director, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Technology, U.S.
Department of Transportation (US DOT).

(b) Using the Bureau of Explosives' Flame Projection Apparatus, the flame
projects more than 18 inches beyond the ignition source with valve opened
fully, or, the flame flashes back and burns at the valve with any degree of
valve opening.

(c) Using the Bureau of Explosives' Open Drum Apparatus, there is any
significant propagation of flame away from the ignition source.

(d) Using the Bureau of Explosives' Closed Drum Apparatus, there is any
explosion of the vapor-air mixture in the drum.

[Note: A description of the Bureau of Explosives' Flame Project Apparatus,
Open Drum Apparatus, Closed Drum Apparatus, and methods of tests may
be procured from the Bureau of Explosives.]

(iv) It is an oxidizer. An oxidizer for the purpose of this rule is a substance
such as a chlorate, permanganate, inorganic peroxide, or a nitrate, that
yields oxygen readily to stimulate the combustion of organic matter.

(1) An organic compound containing the bivalent -O-O- structure and which
may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or more of
the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals must be classed
as an organic peroxide unless:

(a) The material meets the definition of a forbidden explosive or a Division
1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 explosive, as defined in Section 3(B)(4)(viii) of Chapter 850, in
which case it must be classed as an explosive,

             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(ii) It reacts violently with water.

(iii) It forms potentially explosive mixtures with water.

(iv) When mixed with water, it generates toxic gases, vapors or fumes in a
quantity sufficient to present a danger to human health or the environment.

(v) It is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which, when exposed to pH
conditions between 2 and l2.5, can generate toxic gases, vapors or fumes in a
quantity sufficient to present a danger to human health or the environment.

(vi) It is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a
strong initiating source or if heated under confinement.

(vii) It is readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or
reaction at standard temperature and pressure.

(viii) It is a forbidden explosive as defined in 49 C.F.R. l73.54, or a Division
1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 explosive as defined in 49 C.F.R. l73.50 and 49 C.F.R. l73.53.

(b) A waste that exhibits the characteristic of reactivity has the EPA
Hazardous Waste Number of D003.

(5) Characteristic of toxicity

(a) A waste exhibits the characteristic of toxicity if, using the Toxicity
Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) Test Method 1311 in "Test
Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physcial/Chemical Methods", EPA
Publication SW-846 (see Appendix III for information on obtaining SW-
846), the extract from a representative sample of the waste contains any of
the contaminants listed in Table 1 at the concentration equal to or greater
than the respective value given in that table. Where the waste contains less
than 0.5 percent filterable solids, the waste itself, after filtering using the
methodology outlined in Method 1311, is considered to be the extract for the
purpose of this section.

(b) A waste that exhibits the characteristic of toxicity has the EPA Hazardous
Waste Number specified in Table I which corresponds to the toxic
contaminant causing it to be hazardous.

cresol (D026) concentration is used. The regulatory level of total cresol is
200 mg/l.

C. Identification of hazardous wastes by particular substance, by
chemical class or as waste products of specific industrial
activities

(1) General

(a) A waste is a hazardous waste if it is listed in Section 3(C) of this rule
unless it has been excluded by EPA under 260.20 and 260.22 of EPA
regulations and excluded subsequently by the Maine Board of
Environmental Protection.

(b) Each hazardous waste listed in this section is assigned an EPA
Hazardous Waste Number and/or a number assigned by the Department as
provided by rule. These numbers, alone or in combination, must be used in
complying with regulatory requirements as provided by rule in Chapter 850
- 857 and 3010 of RCRA.

(c) Certain of the hazardous waste listed in Section 3(C)(2) or 3(C)(3) have
exclusion limits that refer to Section 3(A)(5)(c).

(2) Hazardous wastes from non-specific sources. A waste is a
hazardous waste if it is listed below:

For the purposes of
administering and enforcing
this Rule, the Department
presumes that a discharge to
any land or surface or ground
waters is the result of a
discharge of hazardous waste
if such discharge contains the
presence of any waste
identified in F001-F005. In
order to overcome this
presumption, a person must
demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the
Commissioner through clear
and convincing evidence that
the waste was discharged
prior to 1980 or that the
waste, at the time of
discharge, was not a
hazardous waste as identified
in F001-F005 above.

(b) The provisions of 40 C.F.R. 261.31(b) further defining the F037 and
F038 listings are hereby adopted and incorporated by reference.

(c) Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
where PCB and PCBs means any chemical substance that is limited to the
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


biphenyl molecule that has been chlorinated to varying degrees or any
combination of substances which contains such substance.

(i) Except as provided in (AA) below, any chemical substances or
combination of substances that contain 50 parts per million (on a dry weight
basis) or greater of PCBs are subject to these regulations. "PCB Item" as
defined in 40 C.F.R. Part 761.3 as it appeared on July 1, 1982 is also subject
to these regulations.

Substances that are regulated by this rule include, but are not limited to,
dielectric fluids, contaminated solvents, oils, waste oils, heat transfer fluids,
hydraulic fluids, paints, sludges, slurries, dredge spoils, soils, materials
contaminated as a result of spills, and other chemical substances or
combination of substances, including impurities and byproducts.

(AA) The use of waste oil that contains any detectable concentration of PCB
as a sealant, coating, or dust control agent is prohibited. Prohibited uses
include, but are not limited to, road oiling, general dust control, use as a
pesticide or herbicide carrier, and use as a rust preventative on pipes.

NOTE: Road oiling with waste oil is a prohibited act under Chapter 860 of
the Department's Rules.

(ii) Any chemical substance or combinations of chemical substances that
contain less than 50 parts per million (ppm) PCBs as the result of dilution
shall be subject to these regulations unless otherwise specifically provided
by 40 C.F.R. 761, except that PCB contaminated media at an uncontrolled
hazardous substance site managed, treated or disposed of in accordance
with a Department approved removal or remedial action plan may be
managed according to the concentrations detected in the media.

(iii) For the purposes of this rule, the following are considered hazardous
waste and are subject to regulation under 38 M.R.S., §1301, et seq.:

(AA) PCB or PCBs that are useless, unwanted,discarded or intended to be
discarded;

(BB) PCB or PCBs that are "discharged" as defined by 38 M.R.S., §1317;

NOTE: Any person to whom AA or BB. applies is considered a generator of
hazardous waste.

(CC) PCB or PCBs generated from off site, where the generator and the
satellite facility are owned and operated by the same entity, other than those
contained in a totally enclosed manner in equipment such as electrical
transformers, capacitors, and hydraulic systems that are not intended to be
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


discarded, that are stored at a site which is used or capable of being used to
store as follows:

(1) greater than 165 gallons of PCBs for more than 10 working days is
considered a storage facility for hazardous waste; or

(2) less than 165 gallons of PCBs, for more than 10 working days, or greater
than 165 gallons for less than 10 working days, is not considered to be a
storage facility for hazardous waste, provided that the facility obtains an
abbreviated license under Chapter 856, Section 11A(8); or

(3) less than 165 gallons of PCBs for less than 10 working days are exempt
from the hazardous waste storage facility licensing requirements.

(DD) PCB or PCBs that are subjected to or intended to be subjected to
treatment so as to reduce or otherwise alter the concentration of PCB or
PCBs.

NOTE: Any person to whom Section DD applies is considered a treatment
facility for hazardous waste.

(iv) Disposal of PCB and PCBs is excluded from regulation under Chapters
854, 855 and 856 of the Department's rules in so far as that disposal is in
fact regulated under 40 C.F.R. 761.

NOTE: Federal law currently prohibits a State from regulating the disposal
of PCB and PCBs. This exclusion does not apply to PCB and PCBs while they
are being handled before disposal.

(v) PCB and PCBs are identified as toxic wastes (T) and are assigned the
Hazardous Waste Number M002.

(vi) "Alteration" or "treatment" as used in the Department's rules shall not
include the routine servicing of equipment where PCB or PCBs are
contained in a totally enclosed manner.

(3) Hazardous Wastes from specific sources. A waste is a hazardous
waste if it is listed in the table below:

(4) Discarded commercial chemical products, off-specification species,
container residues, and spill residues thereof. The following materials or
items are hazardous wastes if and when they are discarded or intended to be
discarded, when they are mixed with other material and applied to the land
for dust supression or road treatment, when they are otherwise applied to
the land in lieu of their original intended use or when they are contained in
products that are applied to the land in lieu of their original intended use or
when, in lieu of their original intended use, they are produced for use as (or
as a component of) a fuel, distributed for use as a fuel, or burned as a fuel:

(a) Any commercial chemical product, or manufacturing chemical
intermediate having the generic name listed in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this
section.

             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(b) Any off-specification commercial chemical product or manufacturing
chemical intermediate which, if it met specifications, would have the generic
name listed in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section.

(c) Any residue remaining in a container or an inner liner removed from a
container that has held any commercial chemical product or manufacturing
chemical intermediate having the generic name listed in paragraph (e) or (f)
of this section, unless the container is empty as defined in Section 3(A)(7) of
this Chapter. Containers which have contained medicinal nitroglycerin are
considered empty if they meet the provisions of Section 3(A)(7)(a) and (b).

(d) Any residue or contaminated soil, water or other debris resulting from
the cleanup of a spill into or on any land or water of any commmercial
chemical product or manufacturing chemical intermediate having the
generic name listed in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, or any residue or
contaminated soil, water or other debris resulting from the cleanup of a
spill, into or on any land or water, of any off-specification chemical product
and manufacturing chemical intermediate which, if it met specifications,
would have the generic name listed in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section.

NOTE: The phrase "commercial chemical product or manufacturing
chemical intermediate having the generic name listed in . . ." refers to a
chemical substance manufactured or formulated for commercial or
manufacturing use which consists of: (1) the commercially pure grade of the
chemical, (2) any technical grades of the chemical that are produced or
marketed, (3) any formulations in which the P or U listed chemical is the
sole active ingredient regardless of the percent composition, or (4) effective
Janaury 1, 1995, any formulations in which the P listed chemical is an active
ingredient of 10% or more. It does not refer to a material, such as a
manufacturing process waste, that contains any of the substances listed in
paragraphs (e) or (f). Where a manufacturing process waste is deemed to be
a hazardous waste because it contains a substance listed in paragraphs (e) or
(f), such waste will be listed in either Section 3(C)(2) or Section 3(C)(3) or
will be identified as a hazardous waste by the characteristics set forth in
Section 3(B) of this rule.

(e) The commercial chemical products, manufacturing chemical
intermediates or off-specification commercial chemical products or
manufacturing chemical intermediates referred to in paragraphs (a) through
(d) of this section, are identified as acute hazardous wastes (H) and are
subject to the small quantity exclusion defined in Section 3(A)(5)(c).

NOTE: For the convenience of the regulated community the primary
hazardous properties of these materials have been indicated by the letters T*

Rule.

D. Criteria for designation of hazardous waste as universal waste.

In determining whether a waste may be designated a universal waste, the
Maine Board of Environmental Protection must determine that:

(1) the waste or category of the waste meets the definition of a hazardous
waste;

(2) the waste or category of the waste is a manufactured product that is not
easily contaminated with other substances:

(3) the waste or a category of the waste is not exclusive to a specific industry
or group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of
establishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial
businesses, office complexes, small businesses, government organizations,
as well as large industrial facilities);

(4) the waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of
generators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in
relatively small quantities by each generator;

(5) systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste including
packaging, marking, labeling, storage, and tracking would ensure close
stewardship of the waste;

(6) the risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and
transport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific
management standards developed for the waste type would be protective of
human health and the environment during accumulation and transport;

(7) regulation of the waste or category of waste under the designation of
universal waste will increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted
from non hazardous waste management systems to recycling, or where
appropriate treatment or disposal, in compliance with the full hazardous
waste regulations;
 06 096 Me. Code R. Ch. 850 Identification of Hazardous Wastes
             (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


(8) regulation of the waste or category of waste under the designation of
universal waste will improve implementation of and compliance with the
hazardous waste regulatory program; and

(9) such other factors as may be appropriate.

APPENDIX I:

REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING METHODS

(Appendix I of this rule corresponds to Appendix I of 40 C.F.R. 261)

The methods and equipment used for sampling waste materials will vary
with the form and consistency of the waste materials to be sampled. Samples
collected using the sampling protocols listed below, for sampling waste with
properties similar to the indicated materials, will be considered by the
Agency [EPA] to be representative of the waste.

Extremely viscous liquid--ASTM Standard D140-70 Crushed or powdered
material--ASTM Standard D346-75 Soil or rock-like material--ASTM
Standard D420-69 Soil-like material--ASTM Standard D1452-65

Fly Ash-like material--ASTM Standard D2234-76 [ASTM Standards are
available from ASTM, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103]
