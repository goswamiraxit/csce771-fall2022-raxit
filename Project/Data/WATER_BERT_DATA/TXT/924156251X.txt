Foreword




Pressurized pipe networks provide a means for supplying drinking-water to
individual dwellings, buildings and communal taps. Their widespread adoption
has contributed significantly to both the reduction and control of water-related
diseases. They also reduce the burden of water collection, which is borne
especially by women and children, and is itself associated with much disease
and injury. Further development of piped water distribution will be critical to
improving health and progressing development in countries worldwide. It is no
coincidence that most of our villages and towns were originally concentrated
near readily available sources of fresh water such as springs, rivers and lakes.
   The microbial quality of water normally changes in a piped network.
Although the changes often do not have health implications, there are many
documented examples of serious contamination with pathogens occurring within
the piped network. When contamination occurs, it may be difficult to trace and
remedy because the pipework is normally below ground and difficult to inspect.
   This review looks at the factors affecting the presence and growth of
microorganisms in piped networks, and the practices of water supply
organizations that can directly or indirectly influence their presence and growth.
The information provided is based on experience with conventional
                                        (xi)

underground systems. The special requirements for systems in conveyances
(ships, aircraft and trains) or within buildings are not discussed, although many
of the general considerations presented here will be relevant.
   The information and conclusions presented here are intended for policy-
makers and those responsible for formulating water safety plans for the supply
of drinking-water, as described in the third edition of the WHO Guidelines for
Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004). They are also relevant to engineers and
scientists responsible for water supply planning, operations and monitoring.
   Many of the practices described in this review relate to the wider aspects of
maintaining the fabric and integrity of the network, not just the prevention of
health risks. For example, the removal of internal pipe deposits is often
undertaken to increase hydraulic capacity or reduce water discolouration.
Similarly, the prevention of pressure surges is normally undertaken to reduce
bursts that are expensive and inconvenient to repair. However, this review
shows that there are often public health reasons for adopting a more proactive
approach to many of the traditional practices used in designing, operating and
maintaining distribution networks.
   The first six chapters address:
    • the microbiology of piped distribution systems and public health;
    • composition of treated waters to minimize potential for microbiological
         changes;
    • design and operation of distribution networks;
    • planned maintenance and survey of distribution systems;
    • precautions during construction and repairs;
    • small animals in drinking-water distribution systems.

   Chapter 7 draws together this information in the context of a framework of
risk assessment and risk management, adapted for application to drinking-water
supply. This approach is consistent with the water safety plans described in the
third edition of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004).
   This review is confined to distribution networks based on pressurized pipes
fed by either gravity or pumps. Open-channel networks are not considered here
because they provide little or no protection from contamination.
   The microbial quality of water may also deteriorate in the plumbing systems
of domestic and public buildings. These plumbing systems, and the service
pipes connected to the supplier’s distribution pipes, have the potential to greatly
affect microbial and chemical quality. Plumbing systems and service pipes may
not be the direct responsibility of the water supplier, and both cross-connections
and backflow situations are a threat. These issues are addressed in Chapter 3. In
a typical distribution system, plumbing and services account for 82% of the total
pipe length and 24% of the total surface area in the system, yet contain only
1.6% of the total storage volume (Brazos, O’Connor & Abcouwer, 1986).
                                   Foreword                                  xiii

Therefore, the selection of service pipe and plumbing materials, and their
correct installation, is important in controlling the microbial, chemical and
aesthetic quality of water at the point of supply to the consumer. These issues
are not covered in this review but are the subject of another text on safe
plumbing practice, presently in development (see below).
   This publication forms part of a series of expert reviews developed by WHO.

The microbiology of piped
distribution systems and public
health
Pierre Payment and Will Robertson




1.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the microbiology of piped water distribution systems and
its relationship to public health. Piped systems are generally buried complex
reticulations; consequently, they are relatively difficult to operate and maintain.
However, they are as important as water resource and treatment facilities in
ensuring the supply of safe drinking-water.
    A drinking-water distribution system provides a habitat for microorganisms,
which are sustained by organic and inorganic nutrients present on the pipe and
in the conveyed water. A primary concern is therefore to prevent contamination
from faecal material that might build up near pipes or contaminate surface or

soil water. Generally, bacteria present in the water and on surfaces are harmless,
but they are at the base of a food-chain for other free-living organisms such as
fungi, protozoa, worms and crustaceans. These organisms may be present in a
distribution system, even in the presence of residual disinfectant, and the water
can still be free of health risks. However, excessive microbial activity can lead
to deterioration in aesthetic quality (e.g. tastes, odours and discolouration) and
can interfere with the methods used to monitor parameters of health
significance. Therefore, additional treatment may be needed to control the
quality of the treated water in a distribution system, to prevent excessive
microbial growth and any associated occurrence of larger life forms (AWWA,
1999). This subject is discussed in Chapter 2, which provides guidance on
operating treatment processes to minimize problems in water distribution.
    Maintaining good water quality in distribution will also depend on the
operation and design of the distribution system (Chapter 3), and will require
maintenance and survey procedures to prevent contamination, and to remove
and prevent the accumulation of internal deposits (Chapter 4). Performing any
work on the system that entails contact with conveyed water or internal surfaces
increases the risk of contamination. Such situations require well-documented
hygienic working practices, as discussed in Chapter 5. Chapters 3–5 summarize
practices to maintain microbial quality. The practices are also relevant to the
prevention of problems of discoloured water, odours and tastes. The provision
of tap water that is both aesthetically pleasing and safe is important, because it
will discourage the consumption of alternative supplies that may not be safe,
even if they appear to be so.
    The traditional approach to verifying the microbial safety of piped public
water supplies has relied on sampling strategies based on the end-product —
that is, tap water. Guidelines or regulations describing limits for microbial
content have been set by government-enacted laws in many countries and the
normal rationale for these is that historical data have shown compliant water to
be safe. However, the effectiveness of some of these guidelines and regulations
has been challenged by epidemiological studies. Analysis of data accumulated
over the 20th century has suggested that some of the microbial standards (e.g.
heterotrophic plate count, total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms) have
little predictive value for public health purposes in certain situations (WHO,
2003). Outbreaks have sometimes occurred when drinking-water met such
standards (Sobsey, 1989; Craun, Berger & Calderon, 1997). This is either
because some pathogens are more difficult to remove or have a higher level of
resistance to disinfection processes than the indicator microorganisms stipulated
in the standards, or because the sampling frequency is too low to reveal
contamination, particularly when it is transient.
    The identification and enumeration of microorganisms is slow, and hence is
not suitable for early warning or control purposes. Sampling and monitoring the
                   Microbiology of piped distribution systems                  3

microbial quality of the water supplied to the consumer can only verify that the
water was safe after it was supplied and perhaps ingested. In such situations a
holistic approach to quality assurance is important and should include:
    • assessment and control of source waters to prevent or reduce pathogen
         contamination;
    • selection and operation of treatment processes to reduce pathogens to
         target levels;
    • prevention of contamination by pathogens in the supply and distribution
         system.

   These stages in the water supply process can be considered in the framework
of a water safety plan and, where possible, the adoption of real-time controls to
reduce pathogens to safe levels, from source to supply. This approach builds on
the “hazard analysis and critical control point” (HACCP) system, which has
gained the approval of the food industry for controlling food quality. Its
application to controlling water quality in the context of a water safety plan is
described in the third edition of the World Health Organization (WHO)
Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004). Much of the information
provided in this and subsequent chapters is appropriate for the development of
the distribution section of such plans, and Chapter 7 provides guidance on the
development of water safety plans for distribution systems.
   The present chapter reviews the importance of distribution systems in
supplying safe water, the fate of pathogens in such systems, and the relevance of
monitoring microbiological parameters in distribution and at the point of supply
for assuring water quality.


1.2 WATERBORNE DISEASE DUE TO CONTAMINATION
    OF THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Data from countries that have a surveillance system for waterborne diseases
have provided numerous examples of the importance of a secure and well-
operated distribution system in supplying safe drinking-water.
   In the United States of America (USA), from 1920 to 1990, 11–18% of
reported outbreaks of waterborne disease were attributable to contamination of
the distribution system. From 1991 to 1996, contamination of water in the
distribution system was responsible for 22% of the reported outbreaks, caused
by corrosion, cross-connections, backflow, improperly protected storage or
repairs to water mains and plumbing (Craun and Calderon, 1999; Craun, 1986).
   In the United Kingdom, from 1911 to 1995, problems related to the
distribution system accounted for 15 (36%) of 42 reported waterborne disease
outbreaks in public water supplies (Hunter, 1997). Similarly, in Scandinavia,
between 1975 and 1991, cross-connections or backflow were responsible for
4                               Safe Piped Water

20% of the reported waterborne disease outbreaks in community supplies and
37% of the outbreaks in private systems (Stenström, 1994).
   Deteriorating water treatment facilities and distribution systems can pose a
significant public health threat, as illustrated by a study in Uzbekistan (Semenza
et al., 1998). More than 30% of the households with piped water lacked
detectable levels of chlorine residuals in their drinking-water, despite two-stage
chlorination of the source water, and were at increased risk of diarrhoea. Forty-
two percent of these municipal users reported that water pressure had been
intermittent within the previous two days. There was a dramatic reduction in
diarrhoeal rates when home chlorination was implemented, indicating that a
large proportion of diarrhoeal disease was waterborne. The authors concluded
that the epidemiological data supported the hypothesis that diarrhoeal disease
could be attributed to cross-contamination between the municipal water supply
and sewer, due to leaky pipes and lack of water pressure.
   An epidemic of cholera that began in Peru in January 1991 marked the first
such epidemic in South America since the 19th century. Subsequently, over
533 000 cases and 4700 deaths have been reported from 19 countries in that
continent. In Trujillo, the second largest city in Peru, the water supply was
unchlorinated and water contamination was common (Swerdlow et al., 1992a;
Besser et al., 1995). A water-quality study showed progressive contamination
during distribution and storage in the home. Illegal cross-connections, low and
intermittent water pressure and the lack of chlorination all contributed to the
widespread contamination. These authors found a wide variability in chlorine
concentrations in the municipal water that was distributed to dwellings. Vibrio
cholerae was isolated from water samples. Trujillo’s water and sanitation
problems, which are found on all continents, reinforce the need for measures to
prevent the spread of epidemic waterborne diseases at the treatment plant, in the
distribution system and at the household level.
   It is not only developing countries that are at risk, as illustrated by a large
Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak in a small rural township in Missouri, in the
USA, that had an unchlorinated water supply (Swerdlow et al., 1992b). There
were 243 case patients, of whom 86 had bloody stools, 32 were hospitalised, 4
died and 2 had haemolytic uremic syndrome. In a case–control study, no food
was associated with illness, but ill persons had drunk more municipal water than
had the controls (Swerdlow et al., 1992b). The study showed that, during the
peak of the outbreak, bloody diarrhoea was 18.2 times more likely to occur in
persons living inside the city and using municipal water than in persons living
outside the city and using private well water. Shortly before the peak of the
outbreak, 45 water meters were replaced and two water mains ruptured. The
number of new cases declined rapidly after residents were ordered to boil water
and the water supply was chlorinated. This was one of the largest outbreaks of
E. coli O157:H7 infection and the first that was shown to be transmitted by
                   Microbiology of piped distribution systems                   5

water. System-wide chlorination, as well as hyperchlorination during repairs,
might have prevented the outbreak.


1.3 MICROORGANISMS IN THE DISTRIBUTION
    SYSTEM
1.3.1 Microorganisms entering distribution systems by
      surviving the treatment processes
The first barrier required to prevent microorganisms from entering drinking-
water is protection of the water source. Effective water source protection,
including the construction of headworks and the control of land use within the
catchment or recharge area, will greatly reduce the numbers of pathogenic
microorganisms in source water. This in turn reduces reliance on treatment
processes to ensure water of acceptable quality. In many situations where
groundwater is used, source protection measures can be designed to largely
prevent contamination by pathogens.
   Source protection is particularly important when dealing with small,
community-managed water supplies. In many cases, community-managed
distribution systems do not apply any form of treatment. Prevention of microbial
entry at the start of the distribution system therefore relies on well-maintained
source protection measures. Failures in source protection are likely to result in
contamination of the water supply
   Catchment protection has also been shown to be important in the control of
pathogens in drinking-water supplies using treated surface waters (Hellard et al.,
2001). Further guidance is provided in the two accompanying texts dealing with
protection of groundwaters and surface waters as drinking-water sources (see
Foreword).
   Water leaving water treatment plants should meet stringent criteria to provide
assurance that pathogens are reduced to acceptable levels. The objective is not
to provide sterile water to the consumer (which is neither practicable nor
beneficial). However, the bacteriological content of drinking-water leaving
treatment plants should contain only very low levels of heterotrophic and
aerobic spore-forming microorganisms. Low levels of these organisms indicate
that the treatment and disinfection processes have been effective in removing or
inactivating most pathogens. It is possible to produce drinking-water leaving the
treatment plant with less than 10 colony forming units (cfu)/ml of heterotrophic
microorganisms. At this level of treatment, total coliforms, thermotolerant
coliforms and E. coli should be absent. They are much less resistant to
disinfection than other heterotrophic and aerobic spore-forming
microorganisms, and their presence would be an immediate indication of an
unacceptable quality.
6                               Safe Piped Water

   There are, however, numerous reports in the literature concerning the
presence of low levels of pathogens in treated drinking-water. These
occurrences usually correspond to the use of contaminated surface water sources
(rivers and lakes) or to groundwater affected by contaminated surface waters.
Infectious viruses have been found in treated drinking-water that meets
regulations (Payment & Armon, 1989; Gerba & Rose, 1990). Oocysts of
Giardia and Cryptosporidium have been found repeatedly in treated waters, but
their infectivity was often undetermined and their health significance unknown.
   The reasons for these findings, other than elevated source water
contamination, include inefficient coagulation, inefficient filtration (e.g. failure
in filtration, backwash recycling and poor maturation of filters) and poor
disinfection (e.g. no free-residual disinfectant and short contact times).
Pathogenic microorganisms that evade treatment and enter the distribution
system may survive and be the source of an important level of endemic disease
in the population (Payment et al., 1991; 1997). Therefore, the selection of
appropriate processes for the removal of pathogens and the adoption of Water
Safety Plan principles in operating these treatment barriers is important for safe
water supply.

1.3.2 Growth of microorganisms in the distribution system
Water treatment processes are capable of reducing heterotrophic
microorganisms to less than 10 cfu/ml, although waters from most treatment
works typically contain higher numbers. Some viable organisms remaining in
the water will multiply if nutrients are available, especially in waters that are
above 15°C, and may lead to the formation of biofilms on internal surfaces.
Biofilms typically contain numerous free-living heterotrophic bacteria, fungi,
protozoa, nematodes and crustaceans. Older systems may contain deposits and
sediments formed by the internal corrosion of metal pipes and insufficient water
treatment; they may also contain many microorganisms. The multiplication of
bacteria in a piped distribution system is driven by the availability of organic
and inorganic nutrients in the conveyed water and in surface deposits. This
subject is discussed in Chapter 2, where practical guidance is provided for the
operation of treatment processes to minimize microbial growth in distribution
systems.
   Most microorganisms developing within the distribution network are
harmless. Exceptions include Legionella and Mycobacterium avium complex,
which are discussed below. There are no reports of public health problems
arising from ingestion of opportunistic pathogens (e.g. Aeromonas and
Pseudomonas) found in drinking-water biofilms. Pseudomonas and Aeromonas
strains present in water usually do not have the same genetic pattern as those
found in clinical cases during gastrointestinal infections (Havelaar et al., 1992).
                   Microbiology of piped distribution systems                    7

Although these organisms have not been implicated in waterborne outbreaks,
Pseudomonas has been identified as the cause of several skin infections
associated with swimming pools, hot tubs and other spa facilities (WHO, 2000).
   Legionella and the M. avium complex merit special attention. Legionella in a
piped distribution system can grow to significant numbers in warm waters and
can colonise water heaters, hot tubs, hot-water lines and shower heads. The
organism is also associated with cooling towers or evaporative condensers.
Special precautions need to be taken to prevent or control Legionella in
environments such as hospitals and health care facilities, because aerosols
generated by showers or spas can be a route of infection, and contamination
with Legionella can be a significant source of nosocomial (hospital-acquired)
infections. This subject is beyond the scope of this document, but a summary of
knowledge and precautions is available in a companion text (Legionella and the
Prevention of Legionellosis, see Foreword).
   The M. avium complex is a group of bacteria that are opportunistic pathogens
in man, producing symptoms similar to M. tuberculosis (French, Benator &
Gordin, 1997; Horsburgh et al., 1994). They are ubiquitous in soil, food and
water, have been found in biofilms and are quite resistant to disinfection. Strains
of these microorganisms that are found in the environment have been shown to
cause disease in immunocompromised patients.
   Acanthamoeba and Naegleria are free-living amoebae (single-celled
microscopic animals) found commonly in soil and water habitats. Both have
been associated with water-borne infections but not through drinking. Species of
Acanthamoeba can cause contact lens related keratitis, with the source of
contamination being linked to poorly maintained lens storage cases (Stehr-
Green et al., 1987). Naegleria fowleri is the causative agent of primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis. Infection occurs after swimming or activities that cause
nasal inhalation of contaminated water. Naegleria fowleri is typically
thermophilic, growing in water up to 45o C. Although drinking-water has not
been demonstrated as a source of infection, Naegleria fowleri has been found in
distribution systems, with detection correlated with heterotrophic plate counts
and the absence of free chlorine residuals (Esterman et al., 1984).
   Free living amoebae such as Acanthamoeba and Naegleria can also harbour
bacterial pathogens such as Legionella and mycobacteria, and may play a role in
the survival of these organisms in drinking-water environments and in their
pathogenesis (Lee & West, 1991; Steinert et al., 1998).
   Bacteria present in the water and on surfaces are at the base of a food-chain
for other organisms such as fungi, protozoa, worms and crustaceans. Chapter 6
discusses the occurrence and significance of metazoan (many-celled) animals in
treated drinking-water distribution systems. In temperate countries, no
population of pathogenic animals has been found in a distribution system. In
tropical climates, the only potential health hazard that has been postulated
8                               Safe Piped Water

(WHO, 1996) arises in countries where water fleas (Cyclops) are the
intermediate host of the guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis). However, this
is a theoretical risk as there is no evidence that guinea worm transmission occurs
from piped drinking-water supplies. Generally, the presence of animals has
largely been regarded by water suppliers as an “aesthetic” problem, either
directly or through their association with discoloured water (see Chapter 6 for
further discussion).

1.3.3 The fate of pathogens gaining access to distribution
      systems
Biofilms, sediments and corrosion products may harbour pathogenic
microorganisms introduced through inefficient treatment or breaches of the
integrity of the distribution system. Buried in the sediments or embedded in the
biofilm, pathogens could be released during repairs and cleaning operations, or
by erosion caused by sudden changes in flow patterns. Survival depends on their
nature and the microbial activity in the biofilm. Only a few pathogenic bacterial
species may multiply if favourable conditions, such as warm water and
appropriate nutrients, are present (LeChevallier et al., 1999a; 1999b).
   Viruses and protozoan parasites are obligate parasites and they need a human
or animal host to multiply. If they enter the pipe network, they can only survive
for a limited period; the infective dose for human hosts is likely to be reached
only if large accumulations occur within system deposits. Such accumulations
may occur as a result of cross-connections, backflow or contamination (see
Box 1.1).
   Although there are currently no reports of health effects directly attributed to
the long-term survival of pathogens within a distribution system, such
organisms have been shown to persist within biofilms, thereby presenting a
potential underlying health concern to consumers (Szewzyk et al., 2000).
Biofilms contain many sorption sites that can bind and accumulate organic and
inorganic contaminants, as well as particulate and colloidal matter (Flemming,
1995). Within biofilms, microbial pathogens can be protected from biological,
physical, chemical and environmental stresses, including predation, desiccation
and changes or fluxes in the environment (Buswell et al., 1998; Walker et al.,
1995).
   Bacterial pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori (Mackay et al., 1998),
enterotoxigenic E. coli (Szewzyk et al., 1994), Salmonella typhimurium (Armon
et al. 1997) and Campylobacter species (Buswell et al., 1998) can persist within
biofilms formed in experimental laboratory systems. The potential therefore
exists for such pathogens to accumulate and persist within a municipal
distribution system, although so far they have not been isolated directly from
such systems. Model enteric viruses (B40-8 and MS2 bacteriophages) have also
                   Microbiology of piped distribution systems                   9

been shown to accumulate and persist within biofilms formed in the laboratory
(Storey & Ashbolt, 2001), although again these organisms have not been
isolated directly from a municipal water distribution system. The interaction of
viruses with pipe biofilms has been neglected or ignored in the past (Ford,
1999); however, recent research has demonstrated its potential significance
(Storey and Ashbolt, 2003b)
   Problems may therefore arise in distribution pipe systems when clusters of
biofilm-associated pathogens become detached from either substrata or biofilm
matrices by physical, chemical or biological processes. Detached biomass could
compromise the microbiological quality of distribution waters by providing a
continual contamination of the bulk water through the release of sorbed
pathogens and indicators. These mobilized pathogens, which may exist at
concentrations greater than an infective dose, have the potential to reach
consumers through the ingestion of contaminated water or food contaminated
with such water, inhalation of aerosols or breaks in the skin (Ashbolt, 1995). For
example, in a risk model that has been developed for the distribution of recycled
water there is evidence to suggest that, even during normal operating conditions
(1 virus per 100 l of recycled water), enteric viruses may accumulate within
distribution pipe biofilms in sufficient numbers to present a risk to consumers
should a biofilm slough off from the pipe (Storey & Ashbolt, 2003a). These
studies support the view that preventing the accumulation of deposits and
biofilms in a distribution system should be an important component of a water
safety plan (see Chapter 7).

1.3.4 Households and large building systems
Water usage, pipe materials and water-purification devices (point-of-use or
point-of-entry) can positively or negatively affect water quality in buildings.
   Water in household or building pipes can stagnate for long periods, leading to
deterioration in the microbial and chemical quality of the water. Buildings at
risk include schools during a vacation period, hotels with intermittent room
occupancy, large buildings relatively unoccupied during weekends and sections
of hospitals closed for long periods. These situations require planning from
responsible authorities to ensure public health protection.

Box 1.1. Persistence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in distribution after an outbreak of
cryptosporidiosis.
During March 2000, the town of Clitheroe in Lancashire, England was affected
by an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis that affected at least 58 people. Most of the
cases resided in an area supplied by a single spring source. The supply provided
water to 17 252 people and was chlorinated but not filtered. It rapidly became
clear that the source of contamination was cattle grazing near the spring. As
soon as the water source was implicated in the outbreak, the supply was
switched to a much larger and better-treated supply.
   Of interest was the persistence of oocysts in distribution long after the source
had been switched. The source was changed on the evening after the first
outbreak meeting on 16 March and the system was flushed by opening fire
hydrants in the town. For the following days, multiple (up to 23 per day) 10-litre
samples were collected from consumers’ taps. Despite the flushing, oocysts
were detected in tap samples for 10 consecutive days, although in decreasing
numbers. However, on 20 March there was a peak (mean 0.2 oocysts/l)
following a burst main. Because of this, the public were advised on 21 March to
boil all drinking-water.
   On 26 and 27 March, all samples were negative and it was decided to reduce
the number of daily samples. However, on the following day, two of three
samples were positive (mean 0.23 oocysts/l) and further samples were positive
over the following few days. This increase coincided with a decision to sample
from fire hydrants rather than consumers’ taps.
   This outbreak demonstrated the importance of the distribution system, even
in outbreaks due to source water contamination. The pathogen was retained in
the system even after vigorous flushing. Although the epidemiological evidence
suggested that nobody became infected after the change in supply, persistence of
oocysts led to the boil water advice. Partly based on the increased counts in
water from fire hydrant samples, the investigators suggested that oocysts were
being trapped in biofilm in the distribution network and then being released
back into the supply.

   The presence of properly designed and maintained water purification devices
offers some level of protection to the consumer. Filters capable of removing
micron-size particles or smaller can provide an effective barrier against
incoming contaminated water and bacterial and parasitic pathogens. They can be
used to reduce risks for vulnerable individuals (e.g. people with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other immunocompromised
individuals). They may also be useful in areas where water treatment and
distribution are not reliable (e.g. loss of pressure, inadequate or intermittent
                   Microbiology of piped distribution systems                   11

treatment). In these cases, filtration should be followed by disinfection (e.g.
chlorine or ultraviolet radiation).
   Point-of-use and point-of-entry filtering devices can retain large numbers of
microorganisms as well as particulate matter. Multiplication of heterotrophic
bacteria is frequent in such units, but health effects have not been reported. The
issue of pathogens captured in these units has been studied extensively
(Geldreich & Reasoner, 1989). Although some pathogens can survive in the
matrix of filters, they are usually overcome by the growth of heterotrophic
bacteria that have a much higher capacity to multiply in this environment.

1.3.5 Controlling microorganisms in distribution systems
Current practice in many countries is to use disinfectant residuals to control the
growth of microorganisms in distribution systems and to act as a final barrier, to
help maintain the microbial safety of the water. The various options for
disinfection are discussed in Chapter 2. Realistic residual concentrations only
inactivate the least resistant microorganisms such as E. coli and the
thermotolerant coliforms that are used as the main indicators of water safety
(Payment, 1999). Absence of coliforms may create a false sense of security
because many viral and parasitic pathogens are resistant to a low level of
disinfectant. Therefore, the maintenance of a disinfectant residual or an increase
in disinfectant dose should never be regarded as a substitute for the rigorous
application of the operational and maintenance practices described in this
review. However, the loss of chlorine residual can be used as an indicator of
intrusion if an appropriate monitoring frequency is established, especially if
continuous monitoring facilities are in place in the distribution system.
   In some countries and in many small community-managed piped water
supplies, no disinfectant residual is applied to maintain quality during
distribution. In these cases, prevention of the ingress of pathogenic
microorganisms must be assured, to protect water quality. This relies on regular
sanitary inspection of distribution systems to identify potential leaks or parts of
the system where ingress could occur. In addition, attention should be paid to
areas where faecal material builds up close to the pipe and where surface or soil
water would be likely to become contaminated. The results of the sanitary
inspection should be used to define preventive maintenance and remedial
actions (where necessary). Maintenance of water quality in nondisinfected
piped-water supplies requires proper training of system operators and managers
and, in the case of community-managed supplies, on-going support through
surveillance.
   In large systems, particularly where disinfectant residual is not maintained,
nutrient levels should be controlled to reduce the potential for biofilm growth

1.4 TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO MICROBIAL
    MONITORING IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
1.4.1 Regulations and guidelines for microbiological
       parameters
Total coliforms
Coliforms have been used extensively as a basis for regulating the microbial quality of
drinking-water. Initially total coliforms were used as indicators of faecal contamination
and hence of the possible presence of enteric pathogens. However, many species of
bacteria in the total coliform group survive and grow in the environment, and their
value as an indicator of faecal contamination has been questioned by many regulatory
agencies. Strains of total coliform bacteria may colonise surfaces within systems and
become part of a biofilm (Power & Nagy, 1989; LeChevallier, 1990). The
environmental conditions that favour this process are water temperatures greater than
15°C, neutral pH and adequate concentrations of assimilable organic carbon (AOC). In
temperate climates, growth events typically occur during the summer months, but in
tropical or subtropical climates they may occur year-round.
   Their ability to thrive in the environment or in a drinking-water distribution system
makes total coliforms an unreliable index of faecal contamination. However, total
coliforms can be used in operational monitoring as a measure of deterioration of water
quality through distribution systems. Detection of these organisms can reveal
microbial growth and possible biofilm formation, as well as ingress of foreign material
including soil. However, heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) detect a wider range of
organisms and are generally considered better indicators for these conditions than total
coliforms.

Escherichia coli and thermotolerant coliforms
Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the faecal indicator of choice used in WHO Guidelines for
Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004) and several countries are including this
organism in their regulations as the primary indicator of faecal pollution. Current data
suggest that E. coli is almost exclusively derived from the faeces of warm-blooded
animals. Its presence in drinking-water is interpreted as an indication of recent or
substantial post-treatment faecal contamination or inadequate treatment.
Thermotolerant coliforms include E. coli and also some types of Citrobacter,
Klebsiella and Enterobacter. Although thermotolerant species other than E. coli can
include environmental organisms, populations of thermotolerant coliforms detected in
most waters are predominantly composed of E. coli. As a result, thermotolerant
coliforms are regarded as a less reliable but acceptable indicator of faecal pollution.
   In using E. coli or thermotolerant coliforms as an indicator of faecal pollution, a
number of issues need to be considered. First, although E. coli does not readily grow
                     Microbiology of piped distribution systems                         13

outside the gut of warm-blooded animals in temperate regions, there is some evidence
to suggest that it may grow in the natural environment in tropical regions
(Byanppanahalli & Fujioka, 1998). However, in most cases, E. coli would be out-
competed by other environmental bacteria; therefore, whether growth occurs in nature
is questionable. If such growth were to be found in certain tropical regions, then
regulations would have to be based upon alternative indicators of post-treatment faecal
contamination in storage and distribution systems, such as intestinal enterococci and
Clostridium perfringens spores (Ashbolt, Grabow & Snozzi, 2001).
    Second, E. coli is extremely sensitive to disinfection (LeChevallier et al., 2003). Its
presence in a water sample is a sure sign of a major deficiency in the treatment or
integrity of the distribution system. However, its absence does not by itself provide
sufficient assurance that the water is free of risks from microbes. Many viral and
protozoan pathogens are significantly more resistant to disinfection and may survive
exposure to disinfectant that inactivates E. coli. Ingress of sewage into a distribution
system conveying water with a disinfectant residual might not be detected using E. coli
alone: these bacteria might be inactivated while other pathogens remained viable.

Heterotrophic plate count
The HPC was among the first parameters used to monitor the microbial quality of
drinking-water. Following the work of Koch in the late 1800s, HPC was used to
monitor the safety of finished drinking-water. However, in recent times, HPC has
become an indicator of general water quality within distribution systems (WHO,
2003).
   Heterotrophic microorganisms are indigenous to water (and biofilms) and are
always present in greater concentrations than coliform bacteria in distribution and
storage systems. An increase in HPC indicates treatment breakthrough, post-treatment
contamination, growth within the water conveyed by the distribution system or the
presence of deposits and biofilms in the system. A sudden increase in HPCs above
historic baseline values should trigger actions to investigate and, if necessary,
remediate the situation. There is no evidence that heterotrophic microrganisms in
distribution systems are responsible for public health effects in the general population
through ingestion of drinking-water (WHO, 2003).
   Some countries use a nonmandatory maximum HPC of 500 cfu/ml at 35°C,
because concentrations greater than this interfere with the recovery of coliform
bacteria by membrane filtration techniques based on lactose fermentation. However,
newer coliform detection methods based on the metabolism of chromogenic substrates
are not prone to this interference.

1.4.2 Principles of microbial monitoring in distribution systems
The purpose of microbial monitoring programmes in distribution systems is to ensure
that water supplies comply with applicable guidelines, standards or regulations.
14                                 Safe Piped Water

Guidance on methods for sampling and monitoring is part of internationally accepted
documents (ISO, 1980–98). Promulgated requirements or recommendations usually
appear simplistic. They are often based on population-served criteria such as “4
samples per month, if population is less than 5000”. Programmes based on such
criteria are ineffective for monitoring the quality of the water delivered to all
consumers.
    In theory, microbial monitoring could be achieved by a programme of frequent
monitoring at every storage reservoir and service connection throughout the system.
However, such a strategy would be prohibitively expensive and could only verify that
the water was safe after it was supplied, because the identification and enumeration of
microorganisms is too slow to be suitable for early warning or control purposes.
    One way to monitor effectively is to perform both routine sampling for microbial
quality and real-time (and possibly online) monitoring of parameters linked to
microbial quality at selected locations throughout the storage and distribution system.
With a good knowledge of the system’s hydraulics this approach can be cost-effective
and can quickly provide warnings of system failures related to health risks. Potential
surrogate parameters are free chlorine, water pressure, dissolved oxygen and turbidity.
Sudden anomalous changes in any of these parameters may indicate a problem with
the system. A monitoring programme should include directions on data interpretation
and corrective actions to be taken when limits are exceeded.
    The function of microbial monitoring in distribution is recognized in the water
supply plans described in Chapter 7. A water safety plan for the management of
distribution systems involves three types of monitoring (see Section 7.3.3):
     • operational monitoring to support on-going management of the safety of the
          system;
     • process validation for the design of treatment processes and other control
          measures;
     • verification to check that the entire water supply system is functioning
          correctly.
    Routine microbial monitoring normally fulfils the verification role by acting as a
final check of water safety. It verifies that the system is functioning properly; it should
not be relied upon for operational control.
    Periodic sanitary surveys of the storage and distribution system are an important
part of any water safety plan. Such surveys are inexpensive to carry out and can
complement water quality measurements. They are essential for small community-
managed supplies where verification of water quality may be infrequent. Chapters 4
and 7 provide guidance on sanitary surveys and routine inspections.

1.5 SUMMARY
Good quality drinking-water can suffer serious contamination in distribution systems
because of breaches in the integrity of the pipework and storage reservoirs. Many
outbreaks of waterborne disease have been attributed to such events.
    All distribution systems harbour active populations of microorganisms that do not
threaten public health. Nevertheless, in many countries it is usual to maintain a
disinfectant residual to control bacterial proliferation in the body of water supplied.
This will limit the development of tastes and odours produced by biofilms, and may
also inactivate low levels of some pathogens that gain entry to the network. Although
there are currently no reports of health effects directly attributed to the long-term
survival of pathogens within a distribution system, there is a potential for such
organisms to accumulate and persist within biofilms. Experimental studies confirm
this potential and support the view that preventing the accumulation of deposits and
biofilms in a distribution system should be an important component of a water safety
plan.
    The routine monitoring of microbial indicators, such as E. coli (or alternatively
thermotolerant coliforms), can be used as part of a final check on water quality
(verification). Such monitoring should not be the only method for managing risk or
supporting decisions about the operation of the distribution system. Safe drinking-
water is best achieved by adopting a holistic approach based on design, operational
practices and maintenance procedures that takes account of biological hazards. This
approach is the basis of the water safety plans described in Chapter 7. Monitoring has
an important role as part of water safety plans and should include parameters that are
capable of revealing both potential contamination (due to lack of system integrity) and
actual contamination.

Minimizing potential for changes in
microbial quality of treated water
Yves Levi




2.1 INTRODUCTION
The microbial quality of drinking-water can change as it travels from the treatment plant
to the extremities of the distribution network. Microbial proliferation will depend on the:
     • transit times
     • system condition
     • construction materials
     • water temperature
     • disinfectant residual
     • hydraulic conditions
     • initial physical, chemical and microbial characteristics of the treated water.

20                             Safe Piped Water

   It is not meaningful or practicable to strive for a sterile drinking-water
network devoid of all microorganisms. The principal objective is to remove
pathogenic organisms from the water supply and prevent contamination during
distribution. This requires effective management of the operation, maintenance
and cleanliness of the distribution network. The management process should
include optimization of treatment to minimize the entry of microbial nutrients
and deposit-forming components into the network. This will help to prevent
water discolouration, tastes, odours and the proliferation of microorganisms
(which may create a food-chain leading to the appearance of animals such as
crustaceans). The potential health significance of microorganisms growing in
piped supply systems is discussed in Chapter 1. The presence of large numbers
of bacteria in the conveyed water may make it difficult to identify serious
contamination from outside the pipework and reservoir structures. Finally, the
proliferation of nonpathogenic organisms may make water unpalatable and
encourage recipients to consume an alternative, and possibly less safe, source of
water.
   This chapter looks at how treatment can be optimized to control microbial
growth, corrosion of pipe materials and the formation of deposits such as
biofilms and sediments. It is not a general guide to water treatment.


2.2 MICROBIAL GROWTH FACTORS
Biological activity in a distribution system is normally most intense at the
interface between the water and structural materials (in formations generally
described as biofilms), and within deposits formed by particulate matter and
corrosion.
    The growth of biofilms depends on the nature of the material, the hydraulic
conditions and the physical and chemical characteristics of the water (Camper et
al., 2000). Colonisation occurs from the first contact between certain
microorganisms (mainly bacteria) and a new material. It then evolves through
the integration of various levels and species that can cohabit and exchange
nutrients by reacting to external conditions.
    When a microbial biofilm has formed, or a deposit containing organic matter
has precipitated, it can serve as a food source for predators such as protozoa,
which may themselves be consumed by higher animals such as Asellus
aquaticus (see Chapter 6).
    The factors controlling microbial growth and development in distribution
systems are shown in Figure 2.1. Some of these are discussed below.
    • Temperature — If nutrients are available, the microbial activity (as
        measured by HPC) increases significantly at water temperatures above
        15ºC, in the absence of a disinfectant residual.
                                   Design and operation                               21

    •    pH — Most microorganisms survive at the pH values normally found in
         drinking-water.
    •    Oxygen — Water supplies are normally well aerated, which reduces the
         risk of microbially-induced corrosion, denitrification, sulfide production and
         other consequences of anaerobic stagnation. However, oxygen may not
         penetrate to the bottom layers of biofilms, corrosion tubercles, and other
         pipe deposits and reservoir sediments where anaerobes such as sulfate-
         reducing bacteria may proliferate.
    •    Nutrients — Although some microorganisms can survive on mineral
         elements, they are of little significance in distribution networks. However,
         many microorganisms can proliferate if there is sufficient dissolved or
         particulate organic matter containing carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus.

2.3 TREATED WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES
To prevent or minimize bacterial proliferation in distribution systems, the following
general guidance should be followed:
   • minimize particles leaving the treatment works;
   • minimize the amount of particulate, colloidal and dissolved iron, manganese
        and aluminium compounds leaving the treatment works;
   • restrict the biodegradable organic content leaving the works;
   • control the corrosion potential of the water with respect to distribution
        system materials;
   • minimize the factors causing the consumption of a residual disinfectant;
   • adapt the disinfectant residual to the local conditions and climatic
        conditions;
   • introduce a monitoring policy that can identify failures in achieving the
        above.
22                             Safe Piped Water

2.3.1 Disinfection strategy and the distribution system
The disinfectant concentration and contact time applied must be appropriate for
the prevailing water temperature and pH, and for the target microorganisms.
This is best achieved within a contact tank at the treatment plant where the
hydraulics are designed to ensure effective contact between microorganisms and
disinfectant. Details may be found in the companion volume addressing
drinking-water treatment (LeChevallier et al., 2003). In some countries,
transmission mains may be used for ensuring such contact. If so, it is important
to ensure that there are no side connections or branches before full disinfection
has been achieved under well-controlled contact conditions. In reality, this may
be difficult to achieve.
   Residual disinfectant will be consumed by corrosion products on the internal
surface of metal piping, by iron and manganese deposits from corrosion and
carry-over from the plant, by organic biomasses and by part of the organic
matter circulating in the water. Therefore, maintenance of a residual is assisted
by control of corrosion, treatment that minimizes carry-over of particulates and
coagulant, low levels of dissolved organic matter, a system that is free of all
types of deposit and short water-transmission times between the treatment plant
and the consumer.
   Chlorine, chloramines and chlorine dioxide are the three disinfectants that
have been used to maintain a residual in distribution. Ozone decays too rapidly
for this application. The selection of the most appropriate chemical and its dose
depends on the microbial water quality targets or performance targets (see
WHO, 2004). Selection also depends on the risks of developing tastes, odours
and disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes (THMs) at the point of
disinfection and within the network. This decision can be complex. In many
situations, the choice is also dependent on the performance of available dosing
and monitoring equipment.

Chlorine
Chlorine is commonly used to maintain a residual. Its disinfecting power is a
function of pH, because when chlorine is added to water it reacts to produce
hypochlorous acid (HOCl):
                          Cl2 + H2O → HOCl + H+ + Cl-
   The hypochlorous acid will dissociate to the hypochlorite ion (OCl-) as the
water increases in pH:
                                HOCl → H+ + OCl-
   The hypochlorite ion is a less powerful disinfectant than hypochlorous acid.
Table 2.1 shows how the proportion of the hypochlorite ion increases with pH.

           Source: Snoeyink & Jenkins (1980)

   The correct selection and control of pH is therefore crucial for effective
disinfection at the treatment works when using chlorine. This is less important
when seeking to maintain a residual because the hypochlorite ion, although less
effective, will decay more slowly and will thus persist further into the network
for a particular dose. In Europe, common target concentrations for free chlorine
residual at the tap are 0.1–0.3 mg/l. At the higher value, consumers commonly
detect the taste and odour of chlorine. However, detection levels vary widely
between people and some can detect chlorine at much lower levels. (Complaints
generally occur in response to changes in concentration rather than to consistent
values, whether high or low.) In some countries, much higher concentrations
have been employed to maintain a residual (UKWIR, 1998a).
   The formation of THMs must be considered when maintaining chlorine
residual. Applying adequate treatment before distribution minimizes organic
precursor compounds (Carlson, 1991) and is thus important in controlling
THMs. If organic precursors to THMs remain, further chlorination may create
THMs. The factors affecting the formation of THMs (UKWIR, 2000c) are:
    • pH — about 10–20% more THMs will form at pH 9 than at pH 7;
    • time — the rate of formation of THMs is greatest during the first 2–20
        hours;
    • temperature — at < 10OC, THM concentrations do not increase
        significantly;
    • total organic carbon (TOC) — at values of TOC above 4 mg/l it will be
        difficult to prevent THMs exceeding 100 µg/l if free chlorine is
        maintained to the tap for travel times of 2–3 days.

Monochloramine
A monochloramine residual may have advantages over a free chlorine residual
(for a health-related benefit, see Box 2.1). In water, ammonia and chlorine react
to form monochloramine (NH2Cl), dichloramine (NHCl2) and nitrogen
trichloride (NCl3). The chloramines are less powerful disinfectants than free
chlorine, and are therefore often used as a secondary rather than a primary
disinfectant within the treatment plant. However, they do persist in distribution
24                               Safe Piped Water

(decay rates can be up to 20 times slower than free chlorine). Nitrogen
trichloride produces a strong taste and odour at concentrations above 0.02 mg/l,
whereas taste and odour thresholds for monochloramine are between 0.48 and
0.65 mg/l. High concentrations of dichloramine (> 0.15 mg/l) may produce
tastes and odours. It is, therefore, important to control the disinfection process to
produce a stable residual that is predominantly monochloramine. This requires
evaluation of the water in question as a function of temperature, but normally a
molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia of one and a pH value above seven is
required (Snoeyink & Jenkins, 1980; Palin, 1975).
    Monochloramine residuals in distribution will not increase THMs, although
the process of chloramination can give rise to these chemicals, because free
chlorine will be present at some point in the process. However, if this step is
well managed it will be short lived, and any THMs formed will be at low
concentrations. Monochloramine is more effective than free chlorine at
penetrating and inactivating organisms within biofilms, especially where
corrosion products are present (LeChevallier et al., 1993; Norton, 1995).
Chloramination has also been found to be effective in controlling Naegleria
fowleri in Australian water supplies (Christy & Robinson, 1984; UWRAA,
1990).
    Treatment to produce a monochloramine residual does pose the risk of nitrite
formation in the distribution system, especially in low-flow stagnant areas.
Bacteria on surfaces and in deposits may nitrify any slight excess of ammonia.
However, careful control of the chloramination process will prevent most nitrite
problems (Williams, Andrews & Wakeford, 2001). If nitrite does occur at
certain locations, despite good control of the chloramination process, then the
presence of internal pipe deposits at these locations should be investigated.

Chlorine dioxide
Chlorine dioxide is a powerful biocide and is used in treatment works,
especially where there is a problem with THM production. However, chlorine
dioxide in water produces inorganic breakdown products, chlorite and chlorate.
The health significance of chlorite and chlorate in drinking-water is discussed in
the third edition of WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004).
The persistence of chlorine dioxide in distribution is unclear. Microbial
aftergrowth in the presence of chlorine dioxide has occurred in some systems.
This has been explained by rapid conversion of chlorine dioxide to chlorite in
distribution systems and the subsequent measurement of chlorite rather than the
dioxide (Brett & Ridgway, 1981). Therefore, any attempt to maintain a chlorine
dioxide residual would require careful investigation.

Box 2.1. Disinfection and the risk of legionnaires’ disease.
The authors conducted a retrospective case-control study to identify risk factors
for hospital outbreaks of legionnaires’ disease. They identified 32 hospitals
where one or more outbreaks had been identified between 1979 and 1997. In
addition, 48 control hospitals, matched for size and whether they had transplant
programmes, were identified.
    Case-hospitals were far more likely to be supplied with water that contained
free chlorine (rather than monochloramine) as a residual disinfectant than were
control hospitals (adjusted odds ratio 10.2, 95% confidence intervals 1.4 to 460).
The authors estimated that about 90% of all hospital outbreaks of legionnaires’
disease could be prevented if all water utilities in the USA switched to
chloramination.
    The suggestion is that monochloramine residual disinfection is more effective
at inhibiting the growth of biofilm in water distribution systems, and that this in
turn affects the risk of legionnaires’ disease. This is an example of how
disinfection practice can affect the quality and safety of water in distribution.

Management of disinfectant residuals
Not all countries have the same attitude to the maintenance of disinfectant
residuals in distribution systems. Water suppliers in many European countries,
for example, are seeking to reduce the use of chlorine and its derivatives
wherever it is feasible to do so, by optimising treatment to remove organic
material.
   Hydraulics simulation models and results of microbiological analysis can be
used to optimize the management of disinfectant residuals (Heraud et al., 1997;
Dukan et al., 1996; Piriou et al., 1997). Controlling disinfectant residuals by
booster dosing (re-dosing with a disinfectant at strategic points in the network)
is described in Chapter 3. Modelling the concentration of a disinfectant in
distribution requires knowledge of its reactivity with:
    • the treated water (e.g. chlorine is consumed rapidly at first, followed by
         an on-going but slow process);
    • the pipe deposits and biofilms present in the system;
    • the pipeline and network construction materials (information on the
         chlorine and monochloramine demand of common distribution materials
         is available (UKWIR, 1998b; AWWARF, 1998)).

   Such modelling requires specialist knowledge, but can assist in optimising
the treatment process or identifying the network locations where booster
disinfection will be most effective.

2.3.2 Particulate content, turbidity and coagulant residual
Particles capable of surviving the various phases of drinking-water treatment
can transport microorganisms adsorbed on their surface, fixed as biofilm or
integrated into the porous mass. They may be protected from an oxidizing
disinfectant if the particles contain reducing compounds, such as iron oxides or
organic matter. If ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation is used, the shadow cones
projected by the particle mass can limit the effectiveness of this disinfecting
procedure. Thus, achieving turbidities of less than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity
unit (NTU) in waters entering distribution will significantly reduce the risk of
breakthrough of pathogenic microorganisms, many of which may be resistant to
disinfection.
    The particles that settle in the network may eventually form adhesive
deposits and sediments in reservoirs and pipes where microorganisms will be
protected. This causes a secondary problem if changes in flow direction and
velocity resuspend these deposits and associated microorganisms, contaminating
the water supply.
    Another common cause of particulate formation in distribution arises from
the by-products of water treatment processes (e.g. where iron and aluminium
compounds are used as flocculants). Water that complies with recommended
metal concentrations on health and aesthetic grounds may contain sufficient
material to precipitate as deposits in the distribution system (UKWIR, 2000a).
Post-treatment deposition of iron and aluminium coagulant, manganese and
silica has been observed (WRc, 1981). There is no generally applicable
guidance for the residual concentrations of these components of treated water to
avoid such deposition problems. It is therefore prudent to routinely monitor not
only the composition of water leaving a treatment works but also the
composition during passage to the extremities of the network to reveal
deposition processes. In the United Kingdom, the recommendations shown in
Table 2.2 have been made for water leaving treatment works.
    Information is available on procedures for identifying and rectifying process
conditions that lead to such problems, and for identifying where such post-
treatment works precipitation is occurring (WRc, 1990).

2.3.3 Organic matter
In recent years, attention has focused on the carbonaceous organic matter that
can be used by microorganisms as a source of nutrients. Among the various
parameters published by research teams, two have been made into international
standards: biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and assimilable
organic carbon (AOC). The purpose of these parameters is to measure the
nutritional potential of water directly or indirectly in terms of carbonaceous
organic compounds (Kaplan, Reasoner & Rice, 1994); they are not intended for
routine monitoring. In the terminology of water safety plans, these parameters
are used for “process validation” (see Section 7.3.3). They must be studied in
depth during an investigational stage in order to understand fully how they
develop in the source water and evolve throughout the treatment process. Thus,
they serve to optimize the process and provide information during pilot testing,
with a view to modifying or designing the treatment plant. The parameters will
then be checked only periodically to verify the performance of the treatment
works.

Assimilable organic carbon
This parameter was developed by Van der Kooij (1992). It is based on culturing
two bacterial strains in the water under investigation and matching the
maximum number of cells obtained with a calibration curve produced by using
an easily assimilated nutrient such as sodium acetate (APHA-AWWA-WEF,
1995). After many years of experience, Van der Kooij has been able to establish
an AOC scale that allows waters to be classified in terms of bacterial regrowth
potential. A value of no more than 10 µg/l of AOC from the Pseudomonas p17
strain is recommended for biologically stable water. The AOC level is
considered to indicate the quantity of carbon in a test water that can easily be
assimilated by bacteria.

Biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
The sample to be analysed is placed in contact with a native mixed biomass.
Monitoring of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) enables the degradation of
the organic matter to be observed, with the corresponding increase in carbon
dioxide and bacterial cells (Figure 2.2). When the degradation has reached a
plateau, the value obtained is described as refractory dissolved organic carbon
(RDOC). The difference between the initial DOC and the RDOC enables the
BDOC to be calculated in milligrams per litre (Block et al., 1992). A 30-day
incubation method has been published (Servais, Anzil & Ventresque, 1989). For
a faster result, Joret & Levi (1986) incubated the sample on a mass of colonised
sand, generally taken from the sand filters of treatment plants. This sand
contains a native biomass that is well adapted to the water under investigation
28                               Safe Piped Water

and can completely degrade the BDOC in 5–7 days. These two methods have
been compared by Volk et al. (1994).




Figure 2.2. An example of a typical biodegradation curve for dissolved organic carbon
            (DOC).

    The method allows quantification not only of the easily assimilable carbon but
also of the carbon that will be degraded by bacteria more slowly during distribution.
It has been found that waters that are biologically stable in distribution have BDOC
values of 0.2 mg/l or less. Comparisons of the methods have shown that AOC is the
most easily assimilated fraction of the BDOC. Whichever method is used, ozonation
has been found to lead to conversion of refractory TOC into biodegradable TOC.
Consequently, the use of ozone is not recommended during the final treatment
stages before distribution (Joret, Levi & Volk, 1991; Volk & LeChevallier, 1999).

Biofilm formation potential
Methods for assessing biofilm formation potential combine information about the
dissolved organic content with an evaluation of its potential to promote the
proliferation of fixed biomasses.
    One of these methods determines the biofilm formation potential (BFP)
parameter (Van der Kooij & Veenendal, 1992). The water under investigation is
percolated continuously through a device containing glass cylinders. At regular
intervals, a cylinder is sampled and the fixed biomass estimated by calculating the
metabolic activity. This is achieved by measuring the level of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP, a component of all living microbial cells) using luminescence.
Plotting the kinetics allows different waters to be compared, and investigators in the
Netherlands have used this technique to identify water resources that are more likely
to support biofilm formation in distribution systems (Van den Hoven et al., 1996).
    A European task force has worked on the development of a similar method that is
simple, easy and cheap, and does not require complex equipment (AGHTM, 1999).
The water is percolated through a bed of glass beads and the biomass is assessed by
                                 Design and operation                               29

bacterial counts on R2A agar or by measuring ATP, total protein or TOC. The
protocol has been validated but results vary between laboratories.
   Although these methods are not the subject of international standardization, they
can be used to select water resources and treatment options for minimizing
biodegradable organic matter entering distribution systems. However, due to
difficulties with interlaboratory comparability, the analysis must be done
systematically by the same individuals using the same methods, to limit the
variability of results.

2.3.4 Limiting the potential for corrosion and scale
Internal corrosion of iron pipes reduces their structural strength and may create leaks
and bursts, as does external corrosion. Internal corrosion also increases the
consumption of disinfectant residual, decreases the water-carrying capacity of the
pipe and creates deposits that are undesirable in terms of maintaining high microbial
quality (LeChevallier et al., 1993). The internal corrosion of the traditional cast and
ductile iron pipes, protected by a paint layer of coal-tar (no longer recommended due
to leaching of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), often produces hard adhesive
tubercles, as shown in Plate 2.1.
   In unprotected steel pipes, the corrosion products tend to be more uniform and
less adhesive. Other scales based on adhesive and layered calcium carbonate
deposits can form in mains when the conveyed water is excessively supersaturated
with calcium carbonate. These may also be found in association with corrosion
products and biofilms (Lu, Kiene & Levi, 1998). Calcium carbonate deposits and
ferrous corrosion products usually require mechanical action or an acid chemical
process for their removal.




Plate 2.1. Corrosion tubercles in 40 year old cast iron main (100 mm diameter).
30                              Safe Piped Water

   To prevent corrosion and scale, the water should be saturated or slightly
over-saturated with calcium carbonate (Legrand & Leroy, 1995).
   Several options are available for controlling the corrosivity of treated water
towards the range of materials used in the distribution network. These should be
considered on a case-by-case basis. It is also important to consider how changes
in water composition may affect the corrosion of all distribution and plumbing
materials. Guidance is available for minimizing corrosion in networks
containing pipes made from iron, lead, copper, galvanised steel and cement-
based materials (UKWIR, 2000b).


2.4 OPTIMIZATION OF TREATMENT
2.4.1 Water sources
Where there is a choice of water source, content of biodegradable organic matter
should be considered. Protected underground resources or sites, where there can
be groundwater replenishment or bank infiltration, are preferred. In most
circumstances, the quality of groundwater improves during its passage through
subterranean rocks and subsoils, resulting in more biologically stable water
entering the distribution system. In contrast, surface waters containing a lot of
humus-based material, urban or industrial effluents, or a proliferation of algae
are more difficult to treat and are more likely to contain a high proportion of
undesirable nutrients.
   For small, community-managed systems, the selection of source waters with
lower potential for promoting regrowth is preferred, given the usually limited
availability of water-quality testing equipment and lack of skills in interpreting
the results of microbiological analysis. However, the overriding requirement
should still be the selection of sources with the lowest risk of contamination
with pathogens.

2.4.2 Drinking-water treatment plant
The water treatment plant should be designed and operated to minimize dissolved
and particulate nutrient entering the network. The processes include biodegradation,
retention and adsorption (Jacangelo et al., 1995), summarized below.
   A preliminary stage of biological nitrification will remove ammonia without
using chlorine, thus limiting the formation of unwanted by-products. However, the
biodegradation will not be effective below 5°C, and if nitrification stops during
prolonged periods of low temperatures, it will be necessary to use a stand-by
chemical method.
   Flocculation must be optimized by selecting the best flocculant and the best pH,
not just to reduce turbidity but also to reduce both colloidal and dissolved organic
matter. If this stage is well managed, it can also reduce some undesirable organic
                                Design and operation                                31

micropollutants and disinfection by-product precursors (Crozes, White & Marshall,
1995). The chemistry of the coagulation process must also be controlled to minimize
carry-over of dissolved and colloidal coagulant. This is especially important in
waters of low calcium hardness (WRc, 1992).
    Some clarifiers, like the floc blanket reactors that promote prolonged contact
between the water and the microorganisms held in the sludge, allow a
biodegradation stage to be introduced at the beginning of the treatment cycle
(Campos et al., 1999a). The addition of powdered activated carbon may be used to
reduce the DOC content.
    Biological sand filters have a biodegrading effect because of the biomass that
develops in the first few tens of centimetres. The particle size and contact time must
promote good contact between the organic carbon and the biomass. Generally, the
bacteria must not come into contact with disinfectants used during water
pretreatment or in the filter cleaning water, because this would slow down the
biological activity in the filters (Laurent et al., 1999a). Monitoring is essential to
identify any risk of excessive growth, which could cause blockages in the filter mass
and thereby limit the effectiveness of filter backwashing (Croue et al., 1997). Rapid
filtration usually results in a BDOC reduction of 20–30%, as long as the water does
not contain disinfectant residual.
    Dune, riverbank and soil filtration are very effective methods if the residence
times are long enough. In addition to the removal of particulate matter and
microorganisms, BDOC may be considerably reduced, ensuring stability in the
distribution system.
    The biocidal and oxidizing effects of ozonation can be highly beneficial.
However, ozonation converts refractory organic matter into biodegradable organic
matter (Ribas et al., 1997). This effect can neutralize the BDOC improvement
produced by a preliminary sand filtration stage, creating a need for further biological
filtration downstream (Van der Kooij, Hijnen & Kruithof, 1989; Volk et al., 1993).
    Filtration through granular activated carbon (GAC) in the adsorption mode can
reduce organic carbon in a controlled way. However, the GAC will become
saturated with organic compounds quite quickly, which means that frequent
regeneration will be required, according to the type of water. The presence of an
active microbial biomass can slow the saturation of the GAC due to breakdown of
the adsorbed organic materials. The choice of the type and brand of carbon must be
based on a preliminary pilot study over several months on-site, to observe the
adsorption decline pattern and the progressive emergence of the degrading biomass.
The process cannot be simulated in the laboratory or by short-term experiments
(Bablon, Ventresque & Benaïm, 1988). Low temperatures do not favour the
generation of active biomass.
    Recent studies have shown that the combined use of powdered carbon and
ultrafiltration can eliminate not only the finest particles, bacteria and protozoa, but
32                                 Safe Piped Water

also a large proportion of the TOC (Clark, Baudin & Anselme, 1996; Campos et al.,
1999b).
   Membrane retention of TOC will also remove a large proportion of mineral salts,
without the use of activated carbon. Some form of remineralisation or treatment with
corrosion inhibitor may then be required to prevent corrosion in the distribution
system (Agbekodo, Legube & Cote, 1996; Laurent et al., 1999b).


Box 2.2. Water quality deterioration associated with a change in disinfection practice.
In the late summer of 2000, the water supply in the City of Coquitlam, Canada,
had high total coliform counts, though indicators of faecal contamination had
been negative.
   The supply came from surface water in mountainous areas and was treated by
newly introduced coarse screening and chlorination. In May 2000, an ozone
treatment facility had been commissioned to treat water before chlorination and
distribution. With the onset of ozonation there was an increase in assimilable
organic carbon (AOC) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in
water entering the distribution system.
   The supply area varied in elevation from 64 to 390 m. Water for consumers
at the highest point travelled through a series of service reservoirs until it
reached the highest storage tank (summit), some 420 m above sea level.
Chlorine levels declined through each reservoir, from 0.7 to 0.8 mg/l at the
treatment works to about 0.4 mg/l in the lowest reservoir, and less than
0.05 mg/l at the summit. In the autumn of 2000, there had been several high
total coliform counts in the area of distribution served by the two highest
reservoirs. High heterotrophic plate counts were common in these parts of the
system as well. The positive total coliform counts led to the issue of advice to
boil drinking-water.
   The cause of this coliform bloom was a combination of the increase in AOC
and BDOC (produced by ozonation), combined with low chlorine levels in the
distal part of the system. The two highest reservoirs had particularly large
storage in relation to demand, with the summit reservoir holding almost seven
days supply and the next highest four days. The problem was resolved by
regular cleaning of reservoirs and flushing of mains, reducing residence times in
the service reservoirs and installing additional chlorination equipment.
   Although coliform blooms as reported here do not represent a risk to human
health, advice to boil water was issued. Boil water advice may carry its own
risks to public health from scalds, anxiety and increased costs.

2.4.3 Decentralized treatment
The development of larger urban areas and the difficulties of building large
treatment works in cities leads to more extensive distribution systems. In these
situations, it may be necessary to adjust water quality in the distribution
network. For example, recent investigations have demonstrated the feasibility of
using membrane technology for treating water in an urban distribution network
(Levi et al., 1997).
    Chlorination booster stations (also known as relay stations) are commonly
used in networks to manage chlorine residuals. They avoid the need for
excessively high doses of disinfectant at treatment works to ensure that residuals
reach the extremities of a network. The locations of rechlorination stations can
be optimized using hydraulic models to simulate the residence times and the
disinfectant residual (see Chapter 3). The effects of water temperature should be
included, to avoid overdosing and prevent excessive formation of by-products in
certain seasons of the year. However, booster chlorination should not be
regarded as a means of preventing contamination of the distribution system
(Snead et al., 1980) or as an alternative to monitoring system performance.


2.5 SUMMARY
It is not meaningful or practicable to strive for a sterile drinking-water network
devoid of all microorganisms. Although the presence of nonpathogenic
organisms does not directly threaten public health, their proliferation may make
water unpalatable and encourage recipients to consume an alternative, and
possibly less safe, source of water. In addition, the presence of large numbers of
bacteria in the conveyed water, or in biofilms and deposits, may compromise the
identification of serious contamination from outside the pipework and reservoir
structures.
    The optimization of treatment to minimize the amount of microbial nutrients
and deposit-forming components entering the network will help to prevent water
discolouration, tastes, odours and the proliferation of microorganisms.
Optimization of treatment should be the first stage in any plan to ensure the
microbial quality of water during distribution. Once deposits and biofilms have
formed in a system, they are difficult to remove.
    Water treatment can be optimized to prevent microbial growth, corrosion of
pipe materials and the formation of deposits by adopting the following practices:
     • continuous and reliable elimination of particles and the production of
         water of low turbidity;
     • precipitation and removal of dissolved (and particulate) iron and
         manganese;
34                                    Safe Piped Water

     •   minimization of the carry-over of residual coagulant (either dissolved,
         colloidal or particulate) that may precipitate in reservoirs and pipework;
     •   reduction (as far as possible) of dissolved organic matter, especially
         AOC and BDOC, that provides carbon-based nutrients for
         microorganisms;
     •   maintenance of the corrosion potential within limits that avoid damage
         to the structural materials and consumption of disinfectant;
     •   production of water with a low disinfectant demand, enabling
         disinfectant residuals to be maintained throughout the network without
         giving rise to unwanted by-products;
     •   adaptation of the disinfectant residual and its control to local conditions
         and climatic variation.

   Predicting the effects of treatment options to minimize biological degradation
in the network is not readily achieved using laboratory simulations. However,
measurements of operationally-defined parameters such as AOC or BDOC can
be used to evaluate the relative effects of different treatment processes designed
to remove organic nutrients.

Design and operation of distribution
networks

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Water distribution networks serve many purposes in addition to the provision of
water for human consumption, which often accounts for less than 2% of the total
volume supplied. Piped water is used for washing, sanitation, irrigation and fire
fighting. Networks are designed to meet peak demands; in parts of the network
this creates low-flow conditions that can contribute to the deterioration of
microbial and chemical water quality. To maintain microbial quality, the
network should be designed and operated to prevent ingress of contaminants, to
maintain disinfectant residual concentrations within a locally predetermined
range and to minimize the transit time (or age of the water after leaving the
treatment works).

   The issues for designing and operating a distribution network discussed in
this chapter are:
    • design and operation of piped networks;
    • design and operation of service reservoirs;
    • controlling disinfectant residuals by booster (relay) dosing;
    • avoiding potential problems when mixing water sources in distribution;
    • potential effects of zoning networks;
    • pipe materials;
    • pipe location;
    • protection from cross-connections and backflow at point of delivery.


3.2 DESIGN AND OPERATION OF PIPED NETWORKS
3.2.1 Hydraulics
The purpose of a system of pipes is to supply water at adequate pressure and
flow. However, pressure is lost by the action of friction at the pipe wall. The
pressure loss is also dependent on the water demand, pipe length, gradient and
diameter. Several established empirical equations describe the pressure–flow
relationship (Webber, 1971), and these have been incorporated into network
modelling software packages to facilitate their solution and use.
   When designing a piped system, the aim is to ensure that there is sufficient
pressure at the point of supply to provide an adequate flow to the consumer. For
example, in England and Wales, water companies are required to supply water
to a single property at a minimum of 10 m head of pressure at the boundary
stoptap with a flow rate of 9 l/min (OFWAT, 1999). This minimum pressure
increases as the number of properties supplied through a single service pipe
increases.
   For the purposes of maintaining microbial quality, it is important to minimize
transit times and avoid low flows and pressures. These requirements have to be
balanced against the practicalities of supplying water according to the location
of consumers and where pipes can be laid.

Excessive capacity
The system should not have excessive capacity (which will result in long transit
times) unless this excess capacity is required to meet a known increase in future
demand.

Low-flow dead-ends and loops
Ideally, low-flow dead-ends and loops should be avoided, but in practice this is
not always possible. Low-flow sections of dead-ends should be as short as
possible. Both dead-ends and loops in the system may cause problems by
40                             Safe Piped Water

creating long residence times and sections where sediments can collect. Changes
in flow direction (“tidal flows”) in loops may disturb any deposits in the pipes.
Operators should be aware of these possible problematic locations and closely
monitor and maintain these pipes (see Chapter 4).

Negative pressures
Situations that may give rise to negative pressures should always be avoided.
Faecal organisms and culturable human viruses may be present in groundwater
adjacent to a pipeline and drawn into a pipe during transient low or negative
pressures (LeChevallier et al., 2003). Hydraulic models can be used to identify
where, when and how negative pressures may occur. Preventative measures
such as system reinforcement may then be identified and implemented. Until
such measures are effective, staff responsible for the daily operation of the
network should be informed of these situations and hence where, when and how
contamination of the network may occur. Such situations may occur where there
are:
    • properties on high ground;
    • remote properties at the end of long lengths of pipe;
    • demands that are greater than the design demand;
    • pipes of inadequate capacity (too small diameter);
    • rough pipes (e.g. corroding iron pipes or pipes with a build-up of
        sediment);
    • equipment failures (e.g. pumps and valves, see Section 3.2.2).

Appropriate pressures
Pressure at any point in the system should be maintained within a range
whereby the maximum pressure avoids pipe bursts and the minimum ensures
that water is supplied at adequate flow rates for all expected demands. This may
require pressure boosting at strategic locations in the network (see
Section 3.2.2).

Hydraulic models
If available, network models of the system should be used to check that the
system will be or is operating to the required standard. Models are valuable
during design and operation of a system. A model can be used to identify
problems in an existing system (e.g. closed valves that should be open) by
comparing modelled pressures with actual pressures in the system.

Box 3.1. A hepatitis outbreak affecting a football team.
During September and October 1969, hepatitis affected members of a football
team at a college in Massachusetts, USA. Of 97 potentially exposed individuals,
there was biochemical evidence that 90 were infected, of whom 32 were
jaundiced, 22 were ill though not jaundiced and 36 had no symptoms. The
clustering of cases suggested a common source. No cases were seen in other
students on campus and the only common factor in affected individuals was
attendance at the training ground. In the absence of alternative explanations,
attention turned towards a possible water source at the training grounds.
    The water supply to the training ground was from a municipal supply and
was used for both irrigation and drinking. The training ground was at the highest
point on campus, about 80 m above the lowest point. The municipal system
terminated at a meter pit and from there a pipe passed along the side of two
fields, terminating at a hut where the drinking-water tap was situated.
Subsurface taps used to irrigate the field were located at several points along the
pipe.
    The water pressure in the municipal supply averaged 140 pounds per square
inch (psi), though at peak demand the pressure was only 40 psi. It was noted that
the pressure in the water pipe at the field was very variable and became negative
when a couple of fire hydrants in the municipal supply were opened.
    Further investigations found that children who lived next to the practice field
had suffered infectious hepatitis four weeks earlier and that these children
played in the water that collected around one of the subsurface irrigation taps.
Furthermore, at about the time that the cases would have been infected there had
been a fire two miles away from the training grounds, along the line of the
municipal supply. The conclusion was that the water around the irrigation tap
had become contaminated from the children, that water demand from the fire
had led to negative pressure in the field supply and that this had drawn
contaminated water into the pipework.

Intermittent supply
In some situations, water supplies are only available for a restricted number of
hours per day or days per week. Although such systems are not desirable, they
are the reality for a large proportion of the world's population. The control of
water quality in intermittent supplies represents a significant challenge to water
suppliers, because the risk of backflow increases significantly due to reduced
pressure. The risk may be elevated in seasons with greater rainfall, where soil
moisture conditions will increase the likelihood of a pressure gradient
developing from the soil to the pipe. Within the supply, the most significant
points of risk will be areas where pipes pass through drains or other places
42                                Safe Piped Water

where stagnant water pools may form. Water quality may also deteriorate on
recharging where surges may dislodge biofilm, leading to aesthetic problems.
   Intermittent systems are very common in many countries; therefore, it is
important to minimize the associated health risks. As discussed in Chapter 7,
understanding the system — its vulnerability and hazards that affect it — is
crucial to the control of water quality. It is unlikely to be feasible to run the first
charge of water to waste throughout the system, but this may be possible in
selected areas of elevated risk (determined by the potential for contamination of
the supply and the level of service). Control of hazards in the immediate vicinity
of pipes is more important because intermittent systems are inherently
vulnerable. In the longer term, the reduction of intermittence is important; in
some areas this may actually be relatively easy to achieve by using or
rehabilitating service reservoirs.

3.2.2 Pumps and control valves
If gravity is insufficient to supply water at an adequate pressure, then pumps
need to be installed to boost the pressure. Pumps can be either permanently
operational or intermittent. They can be controlled by a time-switch, pressure or
a water level in a tank or reservoir. A back-up system (e.g. a standby pump) may
be needed.
   Control valves (e.g. pressure reducing valves, nonreturn valves and throttled
valves) are designed to optimize the operation of a network with respect to
pressure, water supply and energy costs. Some control valves can be controlled
from a remote site. For example, a pressure-reducing valve can be controlled by
the pressure at a site further downstream that is known to be the critical low-
pressure point in the network. All of these control valves need to be designed
correctly for their application. Regular maintenance (see Chapter 4) is a key to
ensuring that water quality is not compromised. If pumps or valves fail, low or
negative pressures can arise, and this can lead to ingress of contaminants into
the system. The correct location and size of a pump or valve can be identified
using a network-modelling software package (see Section 3.2.1). Pumps and
valves should be operated to minimize surge effects (see Section 3.2.4). Other
issues to be aware of are as follows.
    • Double acting air valves and ball-type hydrants, which allow the ingress
         of air at low pressures, provide an opportunity for ingress of
         contaminants if the valve is submerged in its chamber. It is important to
         keep the chamber dry and free of debris.
    • It is worthwhile installing washout valves in dead-ends to make water
         disposal more convenient (see Section 3.2.1).
    • Nonreturn valves may be a sensible precaution on the supply inlet to
         premises where high back-pressures could be accidentally generated
                              Design and operation                              43

        (see Section 3.9). Potential hazards include industrial, commercial and
        agricultural premises, and major “domestic” institutions such as
        hospitals and university halls of residence that may have significant
        storage and internal distribution.

3.2.3 Access for maintenance
When designing a network, it is important to incorporate fixtures that can be
maintained with minimal disruption to normal flow regimes, using hygienic
operating and maintenance practices (see Chapter 4 for details of maintenance
procedures). The following are examples of appropriate fixtures.
   • Hydrants either side of a closed valve. Stagnant, dirty water can collect
        at dead-ends formed by closed valves. When the valve is operated, this
        water and any deposits can be conveyed into the network and to
        consumers. By flushing the hydrants, some or all of this water can be
        removed before operating the valve.
   • By-passes for devices such as flow meters and pressure-reducing valves
        that allow the devices to be taken out of service for maintenance. It may
        also be appropriate to install a second device, so that there is always one
        in use while the other is maintained.
   • Valve chambers that are large enough to allow maintenance and
        replacement and are well drained, to reduce the possibility of
        contaminant ingress.
   • Sufficient valves to allow containment of a problem to small areas of
        the system. This means that pipework does not have to be completely
        drained in the event of a pipe break and that small parts of the network
        can be isolated when undertaking system modifications.
   • Entry and exit points for mains cleaning.
   • Disinfection injection points at critical points, for emergency
        disinfectant injection to maintain a disinfectant residual.

   The location and depth of installation of pipelines are important, especially
when sewerage systems are adjacent (see Section 3.8). In the event of a burst
water pipe, the soil structure will be undermined. If a sewer is nearby there is a
risk of raw sewage entering the pipe, especially if the pipe is at the same depth
or lower than the sewer.
   It is worth noting that trunk mains (usually  200 mm in diameter) are
generally less easy to maintain than other pipes. This is because they usually
have few, if any, access points and, if they are taken out of service for
maintenance, then large numbers of consumers are affected. Operators need to
be aware of the risks and issues associated with trunk mains in order to plan
work.

3.2.4 Surge events
A surge in pressure and flow can occur when pumps are switched or when
valves and hydrants are operated. Any change in flow can result in surge (e.g.
pressure reducing valve hunting can cause a surge); however, the common
causes are the operation of pumps, valves and hydrants. This can result in a
deterioration of water quality because the surge can disturb deposits in the pipe
or on the pipe wall. These operations may also cause low pressures that could
allow ingress of contaminants. The risk of significant surge, and hence water
quality problems, is greater in long unbranched pipes than in branched pipes,
because branched pipes reduce surge.

Recommended techniques for avoiding surge effects
There are several techniques to avoid surge effects, three of which are described
here.
   • Place air vessels close to pumps and major valves. Air vessels are
        devices that have air trapped above the water. The water level changes
        as the pressure varies, dampening the surge event. The advantage of this
        system is that no power supply is needed, but the volume of air must be
        maintained (Wylie & Streeter, 1978).
   • Control the rate of switching pumps to make the change in flow gradual,
        so that the network can absorb the effect of the change in flow (Wylie &
        Streeter, 1978).
   • Operate valves and hydrants slowly. The reasoning behind this
        technique is the same as for control of pump switching.

   As for all devices in a network, the devices associated with the above
techniques need to be sized and maintained correctly. A pump at the exit of a
treatment works or service reservoir (a source pump) requires an air vessel (if
this is the chosen solution) to be located immediately downstream of the pump’s
nonreturn valve. For a pump within the network, the upstream and downstream
sides may need to be protected; thus, the correctly sized air vessel would need to
be placed upstream of the pump’s nonreturn valve. For a valve where
suppression is needed, two air vessels may be required, one either side of the
valve, to protect the network.
   Other events such as fire fighting, bursts and sudden increases in demand can
cause surges. Air vessels can be used to counter these surge events by placing
them at a range of sites, but costs and practicalities may limit their use.
   Specialized software packages are available to determine the correct position
and size of an air vessel, the rate of switching of a pump and rate of operations
of a valve or hydrant. This is the only way to accurately plan antisurge
techniques. Basic charts have been produced but these are inadequate for
                              Design and operation                              45

networks. Wylie & Streeter (1978) give a full description of the mechanisms
and analysis of surge events.
   It is possible to determine an approximate minimum safe value for the time to
take to switch a pump or operate a valve (WRc, 2000). The time ‘t’ (in seconds)
should be greater than 2L/a, where ‘L’ (in metres) is the “characteristic” length
of the network and ‘a’ is the wavespeed for the pipes (in metres per second).
The characteristic length of the network in its simplest form is the length of pipe
downstream of the source of the surge. In a complex network, it may be the sum
of the pipe lengths. The constant ‘a’ depends on the pipe material and other
factors. As a guide, ‘a’ equals 300–500 m/s for a plastic pipe, 1000–1300 m/s
for an iron pipe and 900–1200 m/s for asbestos cement. The critical stage of
moving a valve is when it is nearly closed. This is when the movement must be
carried out slowly and the time ‘t’ applies to this part of the movement.

Inadvisable techniques for avoiding surge effects
The following three methods have also been employed to relieve surge but are
not recommended because the risk of ingress and contamination is too great
and/or they are impractical:
   • Pressure relief valves. These release water to the atmosphere to reduce
        pressure but cannot solve a low-pressure surge problem.
   • Double acting air valves. These are the opposite of pressure relief
        valves, letting air into the network when the pressure drops. These
        valves limit low pressures but cannot alleviate high pressures.
   • Surge shafts. These are towers open to the atmosphere, which are
        usually very tall in order to hold water to a height equivalent to the
        maximum pressure head. They act like air vessels.

3.2.5 Integrated operations
The operation of a network should not just be a collection of uncoordinated
activities such as valve and pump operation (and maintenance activities — see
Chapter 4) but should take account of the interactions between these activities.
This requires an overall strategy adapted to local circumstances and applicable
to all water quality issues, not just microbial quality. The activities that can be
included in a strategy are numerous and may include those listed below
(UKWIR, 2000a).
    • Risk assessment of each activity (e.g. valve operation) before it is
         undertaken and identification of actions to minimize risk (see chapters
         4, 5 and 7 for tools that could be used for assessments).
    • Procedures for mains cleaning, mains laying, repairs and renovations
         (see chapters 4 and 5 for microbiological aspects of these).
46                               Safe Piped Water

     •   Coordination with fire fighting services on hydrant use and awareness
         of which areas may be at risk of loss of pressure.
     •   Procedures for operating valves, hydrant and other fixtures (see sections
         3.2.3 and 3.2.4 on access for maintenance and prevention of surge
         events). Consider labelling fixtures as to their type, status and allowed
         operations.
     •   Service reservoir design, operation and maintenance requirements (see
         Section 3.3 and Chapter 4).
     •   Procedures for changing or mixing supplies in distribution (see
         Section 3.5).
     •   Optimization of water treatment (including a full cost–benefit analysis)
         so that water entering the network is of good quality and the potential
         for regrowth in the network is minimized (see Chapter 2).
     •   Awareness of, and collaboration with, leakage reduction teams to
         identify where pressure reduction may result in low pressures.
     •   Good record keeping so that problems can be traced and lessons learnt.
         An electronic record is preferable for ease of storage and access.
     •   Collaboration with consumer services to keep consumers fully informed
         of activities on the network and any emergency advice in the case of a
         water quality problem (e.g. issuing boil water notices).


3.3 DESIGN AND OPERATION OF SERVICE
    RESERVOIRS
Service reservoirs (i.e. reservoirs that store treated water) allow fluctuations in
demand to be accommodated without a loss of hydraulic integrity. They can also
guarantee a supply, at least for part of the day, while the inflow into the network
is stopped (e.g. for maintenance of the treatment works or upstream pipe, or a
contamination incident).
   Service reservoirs should be covered to avoid contamination of the water
from animal faeces and other pollutants. Only covered reservoirs are considered
here.
   Using service reservoirs can allow the water to age by several hours (or days)
and the disinfectant residual to decline, particularly in areas with high ambient
temperatures. Regions of stagnant water are possible if the reservoir is not
designed or operated correctly, and this creates a risk of poor-quality water
entering the supply if the reservoir is operated outside its usual limits. Ingress of
contaminants such as animal faeces is also a possibility (e.g. through poorly
closing hatches, cracks in the walls and damaged vermin proofing).
   There are two extremes of mixing in reservoirs: fully mixed and plug flow. In
practice, the mixing will usually be between the two extremes (WRc, 1996).
Fully mixed conditions are the preferred option for service reservoirs because
                              Design and operation                              47

the outlet disinfectant concentration with fully mixed conditions is better than
that with plug flow. An exception is when disinfection is applied at the inlet for
primary disinfection purposes, in which case plug flow is preferred, to allow
sufficient contact time (as in the disinfection contact tank of a water treatment
works).
   Near fully mixed conditions are easier to achieve than near plug flow and
there are fewer stagnant regions with fully mixed conditions than with an
approximation to plug flow.

3.3.1 Shape and configuration
Service reservoirs can be in various forms; for example, towers and tanks (at
ground level or underground). Towers provide the extra benefit of increasing
pressure head to the downstream network, which is useful in flat regions. In
situations where it is not critical to provide extra pressure above that provided
by the geography of the land, then ground-level or underground tanks are
sufficient. These can be placed on top of hills to use the natural pressure head.
   The internal shape and configuration of a reservoir are major factors in
maintaining water quality while the water is stored. The five subsections below
describing important features of reservoirs summarize information from a report
(WRc, 1996), which identifies the limitations and scope of application of these
features.

Shape and dimension
As the ratio of length to breadth of a reservoir is increased, it becomes more
difficult to achieve the (desirable) fully mixed condition. In the extreme case of
a long, narrow reservoir, it would be necessary to place the inlet and outlet at
opposite ends; the flow would then approximate to plug flow. Therefore, the
reservoir should be circular or rectangular, with a low ratio of length to breadth.
For new reservoirs without baffles, a length to breadth ratio of less than 2:1 is
considered optimal for water quality. For existing reservoirs with a ratio greater
than 2:1, it should still be possible to optimize water quality by minimizing the
residence time (see Section 3.3.2) and noting the rules on inlet and depth.

Depth of water
Generally, in reservoirs without baffles, water quality is better where the
average depth is greater than 3 m, because this facilitates mixing. However, in
situations where a deep reservoir creates long residence times, a depth of less
than 3 m may be a compromise design. A reservoir with an exceptionally large
or small volume would have a different critical level, which would need to be
determined for each case, using a technique such as computational fluid
dynamics.
48                                Safe Piped Water

Inlet
As a guideline, in reservoirs without baffles, inlet velocities in excess of 0.1 m/s
will promote the conditions desirable for optimal water quality. A turbulent jet
is needed to ensure mixing. In reservoirs without baffles that meet the
dimensions and depth considerations given above, there is no strong evidence
for any one preferred inlet position. Inlet position is likely to be more important
for cases outside the design and depth considerations given above.
Computational fluid dynamic software can be used to determine the best inlet
configuration (and service reservoir design generally). Positioning of inlets and
outlets at opposite corners of the same wall (even if this is the shortest wall) is
not detrimental to water quality in a well-mixed reservoir. Positioning of inlets
and outlets closer than this should be avoided to minimize the risk of short-
circuiting. In circular reservoirs, one particular inlet position (i.e. where the inlet
has a horizontal flow parallel to the wall) is detrimental to water quality and
should be avoided. Inlet velocity and position is less important for reservoirs
with baffles, provided that the inlet is logically positioned at the beginning of
the first baffle section.

Baffles
Generally, baffles should be avoided. When designing new reservoirs (that also
meet the dimensional and depth ratios and inlet considerations above) the
inclusion of baffles will give a worse water quality than if baffles are not used,
especially where inlet flows are virtually continuous. For reservoirs with baffles,
the inlet velocity and depth considerations given above would not improve
water quality. However, the inclusion of compartments is worth considering
(where each compartment is designed and operated as a separate service
reservoir) for the operational advantage of being able to take individual
compartments out of service for maintenance without affecting water supply.

Outlet
The outlet position is not critical in a well-mixed reservoir. Outlets need to be
positioned on or near floor level in order to allow the full reservoir capacity to
be used. Their position relative to the inlet is not as important as the above
factors.

3.3.2 Flow pattern
The following aspects of flow pattern within a service reservoir may have a
substantial effect on water quality (WRc, 1996).
                              Design and operation                              49

Residence time
The factor that has the greatest overall effect on water quality is residence time,
and this should be minimized to reduce both loss of disinfectant residual and the
age of the water at the outlet. Minimizing residence time, within supplier or
local requirements for security of supply, will improve water quality. As
mentioned in Section 3.2.1, systems should not have excessive capacity unless
an increase in future demand is probable.

Pumping and loss of supply
Long periods without pumping should be avoided. Short periods such as loss of
inlet flow for several hours or where pumping is only at night may not cause
poor water quality. What may be of concern is that such situations will cause
variable disinfectant concentrations entering supply. Where intermittent
pumping is unavoidable, baffles can be an advantage. In reservoirs with baffles,
the variation in disinfectant during intermittent pumping is less marked.
However, the need to control the disinfectant concentration should be balanced
against the disadvantages of baffles (see Section 3.3.1).

Stratification
Where incoming water temperatures differ from those in the body of the
reservoir, stratification can occur. This is only an issue in reservoirs with poor
mixing because good mixing does not allow thermal strata to form.
Stratification is undesirable because it promotes slower moving water in some
parts of the reservoir, which could provide more opportunities for microbial
growth.

3.3.3 General issues
Addressing the following general issues will also help maintain water quality in
service reservoirs (also see Section 4.2).

Security of site
The potential for, and consequences of, contamination of the treated water in the
reservoir are substantial. Service reservoirs should always be covered to prevent
wildlife and people contaminating the water. Even if the reservoir is covered, all
access points should be closed securely and checked regularly.

Risk assessment before operations
A risk assessment to identify potential problems and their consequences should
be undertaken before any operations such as cleaning or seasonal use. Large
50                               Safe Piped Water

numbers of people may be affected downstream of the reservoir if
contamination occurs.

Sampling facilities
Sampling taps should be located to provide representative samples of water
entering and leaving the reservoir. Sampling pipework should be constructed of
material that does not support microbial growth (see Section 3.7) and kept to a
minimum practical length. It is prudent to ensure that guidance on the minimum
duration time for flushing the sampling pipework is provided at the sampling
location.

Records
It is important that records are kept of the water quality, inlet and outlet flow
rates, operations and any other activities that affect the reservoir. This provides
an auditable trail in case of an incident, as well as valuable information for
improving operations.


3.4 CONTROLLING DISINFECTANT RESIDUALS BY
    BOOSTER (RELAY) DOSING
3.4.1 Reasons for booster dosing
A disinfectant is typically added at the end of water treatment to give a
disinfectant residual to provide some protection against microbial growth and
limit the effects of contamination while the water is being conveyed through the
distribution system. Chapter 2 (Section 2.3.1) for a discusses options for
disinfectant residuals.
   A disinfectant residual is normally consumed by exposed surfaces of
materials in the network, deposits in the pipes, microorganisms and chemical
species in the water (UKWIR, 2000c). It may also be consumed by
contaminants entering the network; for example, as a result of cross-connections
or backflow. Consequently, at the ends of long networks or networks with long
transit times, the disinfectant residual concentration can be zero. This by itself is
not a problem if there is no contamination or growth in microorganisms that
would compromise either water quality or the monitoring of microbial quality.
However, many water suppliers consider it prudent to maintain a residual to the
extremities of the system, which may require disinfection stations within the
network, a system known as “booster” or “relay” disinfection. (Note:
maintaining the network (see Chapter 4) will help to maintain a disinfectant
residual throughout the network, which may obviate the need for booster
dosing.)
                             Design and operation                            51

   One method for maintaining a disinfectant residual throughout the network is
to ensure a high residual concentration as water leaves the treatment works.
However, this may mean that consumers immediately downstream of the
treatment works receive concentrations of disinfectant that are undesirable
because of tastes and odours. Booster disinfection provides an alternative
solution.

3.4.2 Locating booster sites
Sampling water quality within a distribution system (at consumers’ taps) will
identify where the disinfectant residual is inadequate. It should be borne in
mind that disinfectant residual will vary during the day as the demand, and
hence transit times, change.
   It would be a very expensive exercise to sample in sufficient density to
assess the whole of a network. This is where water quality modelling software
packages are valuable. Disinfectant residuals across the whole of the network
can be modelled and areas where the disinfectant is likely to be inadequate
identified. These software packages are extensions of hydraulic network
models (see Section 3.2.1) where processes such as disinfectant residual decay
in distribution can be modelled.
   The models can also be used to test the suitability of sites for disinfection
stations. By running the model, it is possible to gauge what disinfectant
residual is needed at the potential sites to provide sufficient residual
downstream as protection against microbial regrowth, taking into account the
threshold for tastes and odours. The modelling may show that a particular site
cannot be used because the disinfectant dose required to give sufficient
residual concentration at downstream sites will cause taste and odour
problems immediately downstream of the station.
   The inlets and outlets of service reservoirs are common sites for booster
disinfection. There are practical advantages: reservoirs usually provide a
secure site and hence the dosing equipment can be installed in a safe
environment where the public cannot easily gain access. Where a station is not
on the supplier’s property, then security and safety are key issues. It may be
that the concern over security overrides all other considerations. Sites within
the distribution system where equipment can be installed (see Section 3.4.3)
may also be limited in number.

3.4.3 Equipment
Several types of equipment can be used for booster disinfection (WRc, 1995).
Most are designed for use at remote sites. The following points should be
considered when designing a relay station.
52                              Safe Piped Water

     •   Pressure. The pressure against which the dosing equipment needs to
         pump will influence the type of equipment that can be used.
     •   Pump capacity. The pump needs to operate in its mid-range when
         delivering the required dose. The dose needs to be appropriate for the
         water quality at the dosing station, the flow rate and the target
         disinfectant residual. Laboratory tests can be used to determine the
         disinfectant demand of the water and thus the required dose.
     •   Volumetric versus flow-proportional dosing. Flow-proportional dosing
         is the preferred option because it gives better control. A flow meter
         will be needed if flow-proportional dosing is adopted.
     •   Feedback. Control of dosing can be improved by using feedback from
         a disinfectant monitor. Such a system requires an online disinfectant
         monitor to provide a signal to the dosing pump. If the disinfectant
         concentration in the water before booster dosing is variable, feedback
         is important to ensure that the target disinfectant concentration is
         reached.
     •   Maintenance. Cost and frequency of equipment maintenance will
         affect staffing and budget requirements.
     •   Power supply. The power supply available (e.g. battery, mains,
         gravity, compressed air or solar) will influence the choice of both the
         equipment and the siting of the station.
     •   Physical size of the equipment. The location of the dosing equipment
         will impact on which equipment can be used and vice versa.
     •   Reliability of the equipment. The operating environment should be
         specified when selecting equipment.
     •   Dosing. Duplicate dosing arrangements are needed to provide security
         in case of a failure.
     •   Liquid versus gaseous dosing chemicals. Safety, cost and any by-
         products must be taken into account when deciding whether to use
         liquid or gaseous dosing chemicals.
     •   Telemetry for online monitoring. Access to a telemetry system will be
         required.

   The equipment needs to be installed and maintained correctly to ensure that
the disinfectant residual is kept at the required level. The equipment used
should be fitted so that the disinfectant-solution feed pipe is fixed directly into
the main or enters through a dedicated inlet on the service reservoir.
                               Design and operation                               53

3.5 AVOIDING POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WHEN MIXING
    WATER SOURCES IN DISTRIBUTION
There are many distribution systems where waters from two or more sources
mix within the network. In most cases this has no detrimental effect on water
quality; however, if waters of significantly different composition mix in the
system, quality problems may occur. It is therefore prudent to investigate
potential problems before introducing a new source, and take corrective action
where necessary. Those issues specific to microbial quality are dealt with in
Section 3.5.3.
   When an additional source is introduced, problems may occur in one or more
of the following three general categories:
    • Long-term change in the composition of water received by an area or by
         consumers — Some areas will receive water that differs from the
         previous supply. This may cause problems with certain industrial
         processes, destabilise pipe deposits and biofilms, and lead to complaints
         about aesthetic quality from consumers.
    • Daily changes in the composition of the water received by an area or by
         consumers — Some parts of the network may receive water from
         different sources at different times of the day (tidal flow). Similar issues
         arise as with long-term change in composition, but in this case they are
         due to the short-term variability of the quality. These tidal flows are
         very difficult to manage.
    • Blending of two different waters — Consumers may receive a blend of
         the two waters throughout the day. The ratio between the two waters
         may be constant or variable. Certain ratios may have greater detrimental
         effects than other ratios of the same waters, and some blends may even
         have effects that would not arise with either of the source waters alone.

3.5.1 Modelling and planning
Network models are a valuable way of investigating the effects of mixing. In
particular, they can be used to predict where mixing will take place and how
these locations vary with time of day, season and system operation. These
questions can be answered with a hydraulic model, but water-quality modelling
software has advantages in that it allows the source of water delivered to each
point in the network to be determined; also, it can predict the proportion of
water from each source delivered to each point at each time. These features
enable the user to consider many of the issues raised in the previous section.
   Expertise in the use of water-quality models is not as widespread as expertise
with hydraulic models. Interpretation is more difficult, particularly in the area
where mixing takes place. The mixing boundary itself is very sensitive to
54                             Safe Piped Water

inaccuracies in the input data. The ratio of the mix at any point can also be
sensitive to input values. Decisions should not be made on the assumption that
results are accurate. It is prudent to carry out a sensitivity analysis and take
action on the basis that a range of mixing boundaries and mixing ratios could
occur in practice.
    The available water-quality modelling software packages contain only
limited process models. All the models handle the transport and blending of
inert substances and the decay of disinfectant residual. Treatment of other
parameters depends on the particular software package; however, microbiology
is a particularly weak aspect of these programmes.
    Laboratory testing provides an alternative to detailed modelling. Samples of
the two waters can be mixed in the predicted proportions and determinations
made of the relevant parameter values. Different consumers will receive
different mixes and, as described above, there will usually be some error in the
predicted blend. Therefore, a range of blends should be tested to determine the
chemical and microbial changes that may occur and to identify the risks of
introducing the new source.
    It is important to realize that both the modelling and mixing tests will only
predict the effects of the mixing process, not the effects related to the
interactions with biofilms and other deposits in the network.

3.5.2 Introducing a new supply
Modelling and laboratory testing are described above in Section 3.5.1, which
empasises the difficulty in producing accurate values for mixed parameters.
Increased vigilance during the commissioning of a new supply is therefore
recommended. Increased sampling may be necessary before, during and
immediately after implementation. Sample points should be concentrated at the
following locations:
    • near to the predicted boundary between the areas supplied by the
        different waters;
    • in areas supplied with a blend of different waters;
    • in tidal flow areas where the source of the water changes during the day.

   Samples should be analysed for parameters that the predictions have shown
may be problematical. Sampling frequency and duration will depend on the
nature of potential problems; if destabilisation of deposits is of concern, the
effects could occur after a period of several weeks if not months.
   Many complaints may be about the aesthetic quality of the water. While the
water is safe, the different taste or appearance may be a cause of concern to
consumers. Warning the affected consumers of the intended change and
reassuring them of the water quality is an effective way to reduce complaints.
                              Design and operation                            55

Some industrial users have very specific quality requirements. Consultation with
users before implementation of change may demonstrate that there is no
problem, or that the user can make simple process modifications to deal with the
change.

3.5.3 Potential effects of mixing waters on disinfectant
      residual and microbial quality
Microbial growth in a water depends on temperature, nutrient content and
disinfectant concentration. In a network, it will also depend on the composition
of the internal pipe surfaces, but this effect cannot be predicted and is not
discussed here. The temperature and nutrient content are relatively easy to
predict in the mixed water because they will be the flow-weighted average of
the values in the constituent waters. Disinfectant concentration will depend on
the degree of decay in the constituent waters up to the point of mixing, the type
of disinfectant in the constituent waters, the blending proportions and the
chemical reactions between the disinfectant species. These are affected in turn
by other compositional parameters such as pH of the mixed water.
   If one source has not had its disinfectant demand satisfied and another source
has a disinfectant residual, the combination of the two sources may result in the
disinfectant demand of the mixed water being satisfied and the disinfectant
residual concentration reducing to zero. This change will most readily be
observed when surface waters and groundwaters are blended (WRc, 1990).
   When the constituent waters contain different types of disinfectant, various
scenarios can occur on mixing. Where the two disinfectants are free chorine and
monochloramine, the reactions are complex and depend on the water
composition (White, 1992).
   Two of the possible effects that can occur when waters mix are described
below (WRc, 1990).
    • If a groundwater of good quality with a free chlorine residual of, for
        example, 0.2 mg/l, is mixed in equal volumes with another water with
        no chlorine residual but containing a relatively low concentration of
        ammonia (e.g. 0.02–0.04 mg/l ammonia-N), the ratio of chlorine to
        ammonia-N will favour the formation of dichloramine and nitrogen
        trichloride, both of which are ineffective disinfectants and cause taste
        and odour complaints.
    • If the mixing of two waters produces a change in pH and the
        disinfectant is monochloramine, then monochloramine may convert to
        dichloramine. For example, at pH 8 only 5% dichloramine will be
        present, but at pH 7.5 the proportion would rise to 25%.
56                              Safe Piped Water

   These examples emphasize the importance of undertaking laboratory mixing
experiments before blending waters in distribution.
   Low temperature and high disinfectant levels inhibit microbial growth, which
otherwise depends on nutrient level. However, the relationships between growth
and these controlling factors are not linear and it cannot be assumed that growth
in a mixed water of equal proportions, for example, is midway between the
growth in each of the constituent waters. Thus, a particular water may exhibit
low microbial growth at low temperature and low disinfectant residual, as may
another water at a higher temperature with a higher residual, but a mix of the
two may support high microbial growth.

3.5.4 Changing flow conditions and existing deposits
Stable biofilms and other deposits may be disturbed by a change in flow
conditions or by changes in water composition.A new source may radically
change the flow pattern in parts of the network if the new point of entry is in a
different location to the existing point of entry. Network modelling (see
Section 3.5.1) is well suited to predicting these changes. Some pipes may have a
large increase in flow rate or a change in flow direction, which may disturb
deposits or strip biofilm from the pipe wall. This may have an adverse effect on
the aesthetic and microbial quality of water at the consumer’s tap.
   Other pipes may contain water that has taken longer to reach this point than it
did before the change (i.e. it is “older”). The water quality may thus be
significantly different and the water may contain a higher concentration of
disinfectant, leading to stripping of biofilm — a situation that can arise even if
the new water entering the system is of the same quality as the existing supply.
   The following changes in water composition often lead to destabilisation of
deposits (WRc, 1990):
    • changing from a hard (> 200 mg/l as calcium carbonate) to a very soft
         water (< 50 mg/l as calcium carbonate);
    • a reduction in dissolved oxygen content of the conveyed water (a well-
         aerated supply has > 4 mg/l of oxygen);
    • a substantial increase in dissolved organic content (low content is
         < 2 mg/l of carbon and high content is > 3 mg/l).

   Although the effects of destabilised deposits are often temporary, it is
recommended that networks are cleaned before a permanent change in water
type or a substantial change in flow pattern (see Chapter 4).
                              Design and operation                              57

3.6 POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF ZONING NETWORKS
3.6.1 Potential benefits
There are a number of reasons for dividing networks into zones but, essentially,
the aim is to achieve greater control over the distribution of water. An example
is the practice of dividing the network into “district meter areas” for leakage
control purposes, where valves are closed so that a group of 1000–2000
properties is supplied through a single flow meter. Whatever the prime reason
for zoning, there are potential benefits from a water quality standpoint.
    • Containment of water quality incidents (e.g. contamination) is much
        easier if an area can be rapidly isolated. If the zone is small, then it
        should be possible to contain the problem in a small area.
    • Zoning can reduce the extent and complexity of mixing in distribution
        so that more consumers are regularly supplied with the same water
        quality; the problems described in Section 3.5 are therefore minimized.
    • Interpretation of sample analysis data is easier.

3.6.2 Potential disadvantages
Zoning can improve water quality in some parts of the network and reduce
quality in others (UKWIR, 2000b). Creating a zone changes the flow pattern in
the network. Some pipes will have increased flow velocity, possibly
resuspending deposits, and others will have decreased flow velocity, possibly
allowing deposition. The age of the water when it reaches some properties will
be less and, at other points, more. At properties where the age of the water has
increased substantially, water quality may deteriorate.
   Although some consumers will benefit and others suffer from the change, it
is possible to limit the extent of the deleterious effects by careful siting of the
closed valves. Of particular concern is the creation of new dead-ends with zero
flow or long lengths with very low flow. Water quality close to the closed valve
can become particularly poor and there will be increased deposition from the
slow moving water.
   Dead-ends are particularly important when the boundary valves are opened.
On these occasions, poor-quality water will be carried into the zone or into the
neighbouring zone. It is good practice to clean the dead-end lengths on each side
of the boundary valve before the valve is opened. Washouts installed close to
the valve on each side will facilitate this process.

3.6.3 Implementing changes
Before implementation, it is important to identify risks so that, if necessary,
designs can be modified, consumers informed and remedial action planned.
58                              Safe Piped Water

   Network modelling is a useful tool for predicting the effect of zoning on
velocities, disinfectant concentration and age of water. Where low disinfectant
concentration, long times of travel or long lengths of near-stagnant water are
predicted, it may be possible to improve the situation by changing the valve
positions. Models can also be used to identify the effect of the design changes or
remedial measures. For example, booster disinfection may be needed because
zoning will lead to low concentrations in part of the network. The best site and
required set point for a disinfection station can be determined using a network
model (see Section 3.4 for more details on booster dosing).
   It is prudent to increase sampling in the period before, during and
immediately after rezoning, as for the introduction of a new supply (see
Section 3.5.2).


3.7 PIPE MATERIALS
Treated water conveyed through a piped network is exposed to numerous
surfaces. It is important that no materials placed in contact with the drinking-
water in the network promote microbial growth or leach any contaminants into
the water that can support microbial growth (see the WHO companion text
Managing the Safety of Materials and Chemicals Used in the Production and
Distribution of Drinking-water, in preparation).
   A materials approval system, where materials are tested to see if they meet
defined standards before they can be added to a list of approved materials, is a
recommended approach. There is no universally accepted system for such
approvals. Some countries have their own national approval scheme (NAS),
others leave the selection of safe materials to the individual water supply
organizations.
   Most approval schemes are based on tests where the product is kept in
contact with test water under specified test conditions. Various tests are
undertaken to assess whether the material, or contaminants arising from the
material, can:
    • adversely affect general water quality;
    • exceed permissible levels set in national standards and positive lists, etc;
    • pose a health risk to consumers.

   These schemes may or may not address the ability of the materials to support
or promote microbial growth. Details are beyond the scope of this review but a
summary of the European approval systems and the development of a
harmonized European acceptance scheme is available (WRc-NSF, 2001). The
USA approval systems are based on plumbing codes and standards set by the
American National Standards Institution and NSF (www.nsf.org).
                              Design and operation                            59

    The condition of existing materials in the network is also important and this
is addressed in Chapter 4.


3.8 PIPE LOCATION
Water mains should be installed using adequate separation from potential
sources of contamination such as sewers, storm water pipes, pipes carrying
reclaimed wastewater and drainage fields for septic tanks. The appropriate
separation will depend on pipe material and joint type, soil conditions and space
for repair (AWWARF, 2001). Local recommendations should be followed. For
example, the following separation distances are recommended in certain USA
standards (Great Lakes, 1997):
    • a 3 m horizontal separation between water mains and sanitary sewer
        force mains or sewers installed in parallel;
    • a 45.7 cm vertical separation for a water main crossing above or below a
        sewer or force main.


3.9 PROTECTION FROM CROSS-CONNECTION AND
    BACKFLOW AT POINT OF DELIVERY
3.9.1 Sanitary significance
Piped water supplies are vulnerable to contamination at the point of delivery to
consumers, which may be domestic households, institutions or premises for
commerce, agriculture and industry. At these locations, water is transferred
within the property and used not only for consumption via a tap but stored in
tanks or supplied to various equipment. The water supply organization has less
effective control of pipework in these situations than in the main supply
network. There is a potential for backflow of water from these premises into the
mains network. This may be driven by high pressures generated in equipment
connected to mains water supplies, or by low pressures in the mains as
described previously in this chapter. A backflow event will be a sanitary
problem if there is cross-connection between the potable supply and a source of
contamination. A cross-connection can be defined as: “any actual or potential
connection or structural arrangement between a public or private potable water
system and any other source or system though which it is possible to introduce
into any part of the potable system any used water, industrial fluids, gas or
substance other than the intended potable water with which the potable system is
supplied” (USC FCCCHR, 1993). Examples of potential sources of cross-
connections include beverage dispensers, garden hose sprayers, water jetting
equipment and fire sprinkling systems. Reviews of waterborne disease
outbreaks in municipal systems often identify backflow events as a causative
60                              Safe Piped Water

factor. In the USA, drinking-water contamination from backflow events has
caused more waterborne disease outbreaks than any other factor (Dyksen, 1997;
Craun, 1981).

3.9.2 Cross-connection control
Controlling cross-connections and preventing backflow depends on factors that
are largely governed by the legal aspects of water supply in a particular country.
Normally, at some point on the system the responsibility for the pipework will
transfer from supplier to property owner. This is where protection for the
potable water supply distribution system (e.g. a backflow prevention device
installed in conjunction with a stop valve and meter) may be installed if
considered necessary. The location is usually in a protected but accessible place
near the boundary of the consumer’s property. The consumer’s system
downstream of this point may contain potentially hazardous cross-connections.
It may be the property owner’s responsibility to identify hazards and provide
those individual connections with backflow prevention devices to protect the
potable water system within the property. Ideally, the backflow protection
devices should be registered with the water supplier and should comply with a
standard procedure for assessing the hazard.
   Requirements for protection from contamination of pressurized potable water
systems at cross-connection points are normally set out in appropriate
regulations and adopted by the local or national legislature. The water supply
agency or the appropriate governing body then implements these regulations.
Cross-connection regulations will typically include the following measures
(AWWA, 1990; AS/NZS, 1998):
    • definition of responsibilities for cross-connection control;
    • identification of personnel to perform inspections;
    • categorization of cross-connection hazards and appropriate devices for
         each level of hazard;
    • inspection schedules;
    • records of control devices maintained in the system;
    • procedures for installing devices on new constructions;
    • details of requirements for devices to prevent backflow, in terms of
         materials, design, performance (including air gaps and break tanks),
         field testing and maintenance;
    • education and certification programmes for employees;
    • education programmes for the public on the hazards of cross-
         connections and devices that can be used in the home.

Box 3.2. An outbreak of Giardiasis at a campsite.
During the summer of 1979, an estimated 1850 people became ill with diarrhoea
after camping at a private campsite in Arizona. Of seven stool samples
examined, six were positive for Giardia duodenalis. Drinking-water from a tap
on the site was implicated as the cause of the outbreak following a postal
questionnaire. Of 53 people who said they had drunk the water, 51 (96%)
reported illness, compared to only 3 of 12 who had not drunk it (25%). There
was also a significant dose response relationship between the amount of water
drunk and the risk of illness.
   The water system on the site had been developed over a period of six years
under the management of four separate owners. Records covering the design and
maintenance of the water supply system were not available. Drinking-water
came from a shallow well and was pumped to a storage tank above the campsite.
The campground had its own sewage system. On investigation, it was found that
both the drinking-water and sewage system used pipes of the same type and
colour. Both systems operated under pressure, with the pressure in the sewage
system being greater than in the drinking-water system.
   Although water samples had been collected for bacteriological analysis on
neighbouring sites, none had been taken from the implicated site until the
outbreak. Of 11 samples taken after the outbreak was detected, three had very
high coliform counts. These three samples were taken from taps that had been
associated with increased risk of illness in the epidemiological study.
   When fluorescein dye was introduced into the sewage treatment plant, the tap
water became intensely coloured. Excavation of the distribution system revealed
a direct connection between the sewage and drinking-water systems. This
outbreak illustrates the importance of:
•    maintaining adequate records of the design and maintenance of water and
     sewage systems;
•    using clearly different markings to indicate drinking-water and sewerage
     systems;
•    routine microbiological monitoring of all water supply systems.

   Typical definitions for degrees of cross-connection hazard ratings are as
follows:
    • High hazard — Any condition, device or practice that, in connection
        with the potable water supply system, has the potential to cause death.
    • Medium hazard — Any condition, device or practice that, in connection
        with the potable water supply system, could endanger health.
    • Low hazard — Any condition, device or practice that, in connection
        with the potable water supply system, would constitute a nuisance but
        would not endanger health or cause injury.

   The type of backflow prevention device installed has to be consistent with
the hazard rating.

3.9.3 Backflow prevention devices
There are various types of backflow prevention devices; those listed below are
the more common.

Air gap
An air gap is the most basic protection measure where potable water can flow
without any possibility of a backflow, siphon or pressurized return of used water
or contaminated substance. An air gap is suitable for use in high, medium or
low-hazard conditions. A simple example is the sink inlet valve or tap, with its
discharge point well above the overflow level of water in the sink.

Break tank
The air gap principle is extended to create a new supply head (pressure) and, if
the tank is allowed to overflow, an air gap is maintained to the water inlet. The
break tank provides a separated supply system that effectively isolates the
potable water supply system from a new gravity head or a source for a pumped
supply. A break tank is suitable for use in high, medium or low-hazard
conditions. A simple example is the float-valve controlled toilet flushing cistern.

Mechanical control valves
Mechanical control valves are subject to wear and eventual failure. An
inspection and maintenance programme is usually required, with the results of
the programme to be reported to the water supplier. The following are types of
mechanical backflow prevention devices that are typically installed downstream
of the meter or stop valve at the property boundary. (There are other types
designed for special operational conditions.)
                              Design and operation                             63

   •    The dual check valve (dual CV). This valve is designed for use in low-
        hazard conditions. The device is nontestable and is typically installed in
        domestic or residential water services. The dual CV consists of two
        independently acting nonreturn valves in series, arranged to be force
        loaded in the closed position. Domestic or residential basic size water
        meters are available with a dual CV included. The combination (water
        meter plus dual CV) is cheaper to purchase than the two components
        individually.
   •    The double check valve (double CV). This valve is designed for use in
        medium-hazard conditions. This is a testable device and is typically
        used in smaller industrial or commercial water services. The double CV
        consists of two independently acting nonreturn valves in series,
        arranged to be force loaded in the closed position. Three test taps are
        included on the double CV, (upstream, intermediate and downstream) to
        enable regular checking of the valve performance. These devices are
        usually designed to allow the valves to be replaced without removing
        the device from the pipeline assembly.
   •    The double check detector assembly (DCDA). This assembly is also
        designed for use in medium-hazard conditions. This is a testable device
        intended for use with fire services; it allows monitoring or metering of
        small draw-off of water for general use within the property. The DCDA
        consists of a double CV or a pair of nonreturn valves, a by-pass line
        with isolating ball valves and test taps, water meter and secondary
        double CV.
   •    The reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZA). This assembly is designed
        for use in high-hazard conditions. This is a testable device and is
        typically used in industrial water services. The RPZA consists of two
        independently acting nonreturn valves in series, arranged to be force
        loaded in the closed position; and a relief valve positioned between the
        nonreturn valves, force loaded to be open to the atmosphere whenever
        the pressure differential across the upstream nonreturn valve reduces to
        a specified amount. Test taps are also provided for performance
        checking.

3.9.4 Typical property hazard ratings
Hazard ratings for different property types are useful for designating the type of
cross-connection protection required. A qualified person nominated or approved
by the regulating body should assess each connection. Table 3.1 provides some
typical hazard ratings by type of connection.

3.9.5 Field testing and maintenance of backflow protection
      devices
Registered air gaps and break tanks should comply with the dimensions
specified in regulations. Mechanical backflow prevention devices used for high
and medium hazards should comply with the manufacturing and performance
requirements nominated in regulations. For high and medium-rated hazards, the
dimensions and function of each installation should be independently inspected
and tested for operation by a qualified person after installation. Typical
regulations specify testing after maintenance or repair and regularly at intervals
not exceeding 12 months.
   Service connections for residential properties and smaller commercial
premises usually attract a low-hazard rating, and water suppliers may not have
considered backflow prevention devices an important issue for these
connections. However, some service connections use a stop tap incorporating a
nonreturn valve that acts as a backflow prevention device. In some cases, the
connections are fitted with two stop taps, one at the water main tapping
(connection) and another at the meter. These stop taps effectively represent the
performance equivalent of a dual CV. The backflow protection function of these
valves cannot be tested for operation without shut down and removal, which is
an unlikely event. It is not unusual for many of these connections to be in
service for decades without any inspection or maintenance, and it could be
expected that backflow prevention would not be effective in time. Instead of
stop taps, some supply systems are connected using ball valves that have no
                             Design and operation                             65

backflow prevention capacity. The water company may rely on the meter for
backflow prevention because the basic meter is designed to include at least one
nonreturn valve.
   Where water by measure (metered service) is used as the predominant
method of payment to the water company and the meter is used to provide
backflow protection, renewal of the meter will also ensure renewal of the
backflow prevention device. Many governments and regulators are legislating
for accuracy in measurement for public metered systems, which results in more
regular meter replacement by water companies. The performance of different
types of water meters can be modelled by the water company under the varied
operational conditions encountered. The model includes operational costs and
income received, and an economic meter renewal period can be established.
Water meters containing a dual CV provide water agencies with the opportunity
to replace both at a prescheduled time.


3.10 HEALTH RELATED DESIGN AND OPERATIONS
    CHECKLIST

Pipe network
   •   Set minimum pressures to prevent intrusion and provide adequate flows
       at all delivery points in the distribution network.
   •   Maintain pressure in the network within a maximum that avoids pipe
       breaks and a minimum that supplies adequate flow rates to meet
       expected demands.
   •   Minimize low-flow dead-ends and loops to prevent water “stagnation”.
   •   Do not design with excessive capacity unless required to meet a known
       increase in future demand.
   •   Avoid situations that may give rise to negative pressures. Hydraulic
       models can be used to identify where these may occur and to identify
       solutions.
   •   Install nonreturn valves on the supply inlet to premises where high back
       pressures could be accidentally generated.
   •   Incorporate fixtures and designs that facilitate maintenance with
       minimum disruption to normal flow regimes and that prevent the ingress
       of contaminants at low pressures.
   •   Prevent pressure surges by controlling the switching of pumps and the
       operation of the valves. Use surge analysis to plan antisurge techniques.
   •   Where possible, avoid the use of pressure relief valves, double acting air
       valves and surge shafts to relieve surge because they may allow ingress
       of contaminants.
66                               Safe Piped Water

     •   In intermittent supplies, identify particularly high-risk areas and reduce
         hazards. Give high priority to preventing intermittence.
     •   Perform risk assessments of all operational activities that may affect
         water quality and ensure that documented procedures are used by all
         those that are involved.

Service reservoirs
     •   Cover service reservoirs to prevent contamination.
     •   Ensure that all hatches and structures are secure and vermin proof.
     •   Ensure that sampling facilities will provide representative samples.
     •   Use fully-mixed flow if possible; consider the effect of shape,
         dimensions and inlet conditions on the residence time and flow pattern
         in the reservoir.
     •   Perform risk assessments of all operational activities that may affect
         water quality and ensure that documented procedures are used by all
         those involved.
     •   Keep records of all activities on, and information about, the reservoirs.

Controlling disinfectant residuals
     •   Use booster dosing within distribution to avoid excessive doses at the
         start of the network to achieve a residual at the extremities.
     •   Use hydraulic models to help in identifying suitable locations.
     •   Ensure secure location of booster equipment.
     •   Consider the effects of mixing different water sources in distribution, or
         changing the water supply, on the resulting disinfectant residuals.

Zoning networks
     •   Select boundaries to minimize dead-ends and water transit times, and to
         maintain pressures.
     •   Select boundaries to aid the containment of water contamination
         incidents and the monitoring of parameters of hygienic significance.
     •   Install washouts either side of boundary valves to clean out dead-end
         lengths before opening boundary valves.
     •   Consider whether deposits may be disturbed by changes in flow velocity
         and direction.

Materials of construction and pipe location
     •   Adopt a materials approval scheme that prevents the use of materials
         that may promote microbial growth (or may pose any other health risk
         to consumers).
                              Design and operation                            67

   •    When installing water mains, ensure adequate separation from potential
        sources of contamination such as sewers, storm water pipes, pipes
        carrying reclaimed wastewater and drainage fields for septic tanks.

Cross-connections and backflow
   •    Inform the public (and plumbers) about the hazards of cross-
        connections, their responsibilities and the control devices that can be
        used in the home.
   •    Specify a hazard rating system and backflow prevention devices for
        each level of hazard.
   •    Adopt a policy for testing and maintenance of backflow protection
        devices according to hazard rating and risk.


3.11 SUMMARY
Water supply organizations should adopt network design and operating
strategies that prioritize issues closely linked to water supply hygiene. In
particular, such strategies should specify how the organization would:
    • identify and prevent low pressures, especially negative pressures, in the
         system;
    • prevent pressure surges in the network;
    • design the network to minimize the risks of contamination during
         operational activities and to avoid water stagnation;
    • design and operate service reservoirs to avoid contamination by ingress
         and to avoid stagnation;
    • control disinfectant residuals in distribution systems;
    • assess the effect of different supplies entering the network;
    • determine the benefits and problems of zoning the network;
    • select construction materials that do not promote microbial growth;
    • prevent cross-connections and backflow.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Previous chapters have discussed:
   • design of pipework and associated facilities to prevent contamination
   • system operation to maintain pressure and structural integrity
   • design and operation to avoid stagnation and preserve water quality
   • prevention of deposits and biofilm by good water treatment.

   Succeeding chapters provide guidance on sanitary practices for repairs and
construction, and advice on the effects of small animals proliferating in the
network. Achieving the objectives given in each of these chapters depends on
the distribution system being well maintained and in good structural condition.

    This chapter discusses maintenance and survey procedures that should form
part of a water safety plan (see Chapter 7). It looks first at procedures that are
applied to readily accessible features such as service reservoirs or valves, and
then at procedures applied to the inside of pipework, where condition is
inferred from water quality measurements or by inspection, which may be
difficult.
    In many older systems the condition of the pipework may have deteriorated
to such an extent that targeted renovation and replacement is necessary to
maintain operability. This can occur where iron pipes have corroded internally
to produce hard encrustations that prevent the maintenance of water pressure
and disinfectant residuals, or where external corrosion and ground movement
have created excessive leakage. Such situations obviously require careful
investigation to identify the appropriate engineering solution. This process is
usually called rehabilitation planning (Evins et al., 1989; AWWA, 2001) and
it incorporates more complex and costly methods than those used for planned
maintenance and survey. Rehabilitation planning is not covered in this review,
except in this chapter, where there are references to common approaches (e.g.
selection of pipe-cleaning methods).


4.2 MAINTENANCE AND SURVEY OF RESERVOIRS,
    TANKS AND FITTINGS
4.2.1 Sanitary significance
Structural deficiencies in tanks and reservoirs may lead to the direct
contamination of water supplies with pathogens. Also, sediments may form in
tanks and reservoirs due to the relatively low flow velocities that are a feature
of these structures. Although such sediments are unlikely to be of direct health
significance, they make it difficult to maintain a disinfectant residual. If the
water level of the reservoir drops rapidly, accumulated sediments can be
drawn into the pipework, where they are difficult to remove and have an even
greater effect on disinfectant residual and general microbial activity than in
the reservoir.
   Faulty seals, joints or connections on valves, hydrants and washouts may
also allow contamination of the system. This is unlikely if the system is
operating at design pressures because the leakage flow will be from the pipe
outwards. However, low or negative pressures may draw in contamination.
The occurrence of low and negative pressures can be extensive during
emergencies. For example, surge modelling on three well-operated systems in
the USA demonstrated that conditions such as the loss of pumping power, fire
flow and pipe breaks created low or negative pressures at up to nearly 30% of
                             Maintenance and survey                              71

the pipe intersection points (nodes) incorporated in the models (AWWARF,
2001).
   Where supplies are intermittent, contamination is likely to occur, and it
may be difficult to operate the system to reduce the risks of backflow. In
managing risks from intermittent supplies, it is important to reduce the
hazards that may cause contamination and the risks of ingress of water
contaminated with faecal material. Reducing intermittence will require careful
analysis of both the causes and the solutions. The management of water
demand and the implementation of water conservation measures such as
hosepipe bans can provide rapid, long-lasting solutions. However, these
measures may be insufficient where the infrastructure needs to be reinforced
(e.g. by providing storage tanks and service reservoirs), or repaired, to prevent
leakage and wastage in the distribution system.

4.2.2 Service reservoirs and tanks
Table 4.1 provides a typical checklist for external examination of reservoirs to
identify potential sanitary deficiencies.
   The frequency of internal inspection and cleaning of a reservoir will
depend on the rate of deposition of solids, the effect of the solids on water
quality and the construction, age and ground characteristics. In many systems,
inspection and cleaning will require detailed planning to minimize disruption
to supplies and to avoid contamination. Detailed advice is available (Tarbet,
Thomas & Brown, 1993). It is vital to observe safety and hygiene
requirements during inspection and during any cleaning that is performed. The
appropriate safety measures for working in confined spaces should be
followed. Minimum hygienic conditions for reservoir entry should include
facilities for disinfecting boots, gloves and equipment. These may include foot
baths with disinfectant solution and the provision of clean disinfected mats
around the hatch. It is also advisable to provide toilet facilities on site. General
guidelines about the use of personnel in situations where they could
contaminate water supplies are given in Section 5.3. Table 4.2 provides a
typical checklist for the internal examination of reservoir structures to identify
deficiencies of potential sanitary significance.

Cleaning of internal surfaces
Certain aspects of the internal inspection normally require the internal surfaces
to be cleaned and freed of deposits. Pressure jetting and chemical cleaning are
the two methods commonly used for this.
    Pressure-jet washing employs specialized equipment; it may damage weak
surfaces and coatings, and expose aggregate on concrete surfaces. Therefore, the
jetting pressure should be selected and tested with care, and provisions made for
localized repairs. Following jetting, surfaces should be sprayed with a
disinfecting solution. A typical solution contains 10–20 mg/l of free chlorine.
    Any chemical cleaning system that is used should be suitable for a potable
water system. Those that have been employed consist of a dilute solution of
hypochlorous acid, or a dilute solution of organic or inorganic acids plus
vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Provided the manufacturer’s instructions are
followed, these chemical cleaning methods should not damage the structure.
Whichever method is employed, there will be a requirement to dispose of the
deposits, disinfecting solutions and cleaning solutions in an environmentally
acceptable manner.
    Alternative inspection and cleaning methods may be available, based on
diving equipment or robot-based technology. When using these techniques for
inspection there are potential advantages of reduced disruption to reservoir
operation and safer working conditions. However, if they are being considered
for cleaning, then the difficulties of removing packed sediments and effectively
disinfecting walls could be a disadvantage.

Frequency of inspection and cleaning
Many water supply organizations undertake the inspection and cleaning of
service reservoirs at 1–5 year intervals, depending on factors such as water-
quality measurements, the efficiency of water treatment in removing deposit-
forming substances, the presence of animals and information from previous
inspections.
   External sanitary surveys may be undertaken more frequently, using
standardized forms designed for the specific reservoir. These surveys should
focus particularly on sanitary and structural integrity, and any obvious
deviations from good operational practice such as inundated valves, inspection
covers left open and damaged vent-pipe mesh. Routine visitors to the reservoir
should be encouraged to report any visible defects promptly and operational
staff should respond rapidly to identified problems. Where operators visit
service reservoirs daily, they should be given the task of regular inspection of
the reservoir.

4.2.3 Valves and other fittings
Valves are used to isolate and control flow, regulate pressure or prevent
backflow. A range of valve types exists, with various design features to achieve
different operating requirements.
    The most common valve function in a distribution system is to isolate flow,
by being either open or shut. Valves at the boundaries of supply zones are shut
to maintain a specific pressure within a supply zone, whereas those within a
supply zone are generally open. Thus, valves could be in the same operational
position for long periods. Distribution valves assist the operation of a water-
supply system at times of pipe failures, supply deficiencies, seasonal supply
changes and mains cleaning. Their predominant function is to isolate sections or
to configure the systems differently to maintain supply. Thus, having all valves
locatable and operable is important in minimizing the number of consumers
affected during both emergencies and planned maintenance.
    Hydrants provide fire authorities with access to sufficient water in case of a
fire, and can be used for air release at high points. In practice, hydrants are used
for a number of other reasons, such as flushing mains to improve water quality,
and filling water trucks and street sweepers. Above-ground hydrants are easier
to see, which is useful to fire authorities at critical times. However, placing
hydrants below ground avoids the potential for vehicular accidents and reduces
the chance of vandalism. Washouts are fittings designed to drain and aid the
flushing of mains; they are usually located at the ends of mains or low points
along a pipeline.
    These valves and other fittings are important for the efficient operation of the
system to maintain water quality. They are also potential points of ingress for
contaminants, including pathogens. If a burst occurs or there are unusual
demands, low or negative pressures may allow ingress through sealing
mechanisms. Valves and other fittings should therefore be regularly inspected
and maintained to meet the following requirements (Walski, 1994):
    • the type and location of all fittings are accurately recorded;
    • valves and fittings are accessible and boxes are not buried under asphalt
         or paved over;
    • valve and fittings boxes are clear of debris, well drained and show no
         signs of leakage;
    • valves and fittings are in operable condition, and sealing mechanisms
         are in good order;
    • valves are in the intended position (either open or shut);
    • the turning direction and required number of turns for all valves is
         known.

   Exercising or operating valves requires skill and care. It is possible to open or
shut valves too quickly, causing surge, which can lead to main breaks or low
                               Maintenance and survey                                75

pressures. Valves that have not been operated for a long time can break if too
much pressure is applied. Operation of such valves can also dislodge rust and
sediments, adversely affecting water quality. Closing such valves may also be
complicated if sediments lodge in the valve seat, requiring operation of a nearby
hydrant to dislodge these sediments. It is important that only suitably trained
personnel operate valves.

Box 4.1. An outbreak of Norwalk viral gastroenteritis due to backflow between a septic
tank and the water supply.
During May 1978, an outbreak of gastroenteritis affected staff and students at a
school in Pierce County, Washington State, USA. The main clinical features
were nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Two of three people from whom
paired sera were collected showed a fourfold rise in titre to Norwalk virus. The
attack rate in the school was 71.5%, compared to only 6.5% in a control school.
There was a very strong correlation between illness and reporting consumption
of tap water in the school. Furthermore, two soccer teams from other schools
met at the school and players from these teams who drank water were 14 times
more likely to be ill than those who did not drink the water.
   The water supply to the school came from a 51 m deep well yielding 257 l/m.
The water was not chlorinated. The school was not connected to the public
sewer and used a septic tank. Well water was pumped to a pressure tank through
a ball-check release valve, with the pressure being maintained by on–off cycling
of the pump. When the pump switched off, a port in the valve opened to allow
air into the system. This air was expelled when the pump switched on again. At
this point, it was common for water to spill out of the valve and maintenance
staff had therefore attached a pipe from the valve to a floor drain. On 2 May, a
baffle to the septic tank blocked and foul water filled the boiler room floor to a
depth of 20 cm, completely covering the end of the pipe from the ball-check
release valve.
   As soon as the outbreak was identified, maintenance staff took samples from
five taps in the school and all five showed thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms. It
was concluded that the drinking-water had become contaminated with foul
water through the pipe from the release valve that had aspirated water up the
pipe.

4.3 MAINTENANCE AND SURVEY OF PIPES
4.3.1 Sanitary significance
Externally-derived pathogens can potentially persist within deposits in a
pipeline (see Section 1.3.3), and can present an underlying health concern if
76                              Safe Piped Water

resuspended with the deposits and then consumed. Although there are no reports
of health effects directly attributed to this mechanism, maintaining the internal
cleanliness of the network is a prudent objective. Deposits provide an
environment for the proliferation of microorganisms and animals, which may
make the water unpalatable. This may result in consumers turning to alternative
potentially unsafe sources, and may also make it difficult to identify
contamination of hygienic significance by routine monitoring. The deposits also
hinder the maintenance of a disinfectant residual, especially in the smaller
diameter pipes, which are at greatest risk of low pressures and hence
contamination.

4.3.2 Strategies for pipe networks
The most important problems associated with networks are:
   • hygienic water-quality problems
   • aesthetic water-quality problems
   • hydraulic deficiencies
   • structural performance problems
   • leakage.

    Hygienic water-quality problems are clearly the most important of these;
however, identifying the best solution requires information about the other
problems. This can be a complex process because of the variety of pipe
materials and pipe ages usually found in a network, and the fact that a relatively
small part of a pipeline may be responsible for a problem.
    Many utilities have found that a programme of regular mains cleaning to
remove loose deposits and animal infestations has been of great assistance in
maintaining water quality in distribution. A range of activities and solutions
may be available, such as simple flushing of selected pipe lengths, swabbing,
relining pipes with either structural or nonstructural linings and mains renewal.
The costs and complexity of these are obviously different and dictate that
problems are investigated in a systematic way based on performance data. These
strategic investigation and planning procedures, which should also consider the
future demands on the system, are beyond the scope of this review.
Representative methodologies for systematic rehabilitation planning have been
published (Evins, Liebeschuetz & Williams, 1989; AWWA, 2001; Lei &
Sægrov, 1998; Herz, 1998).
    Three methods are generally used to clean pipes; flushing, air scouring and
swabbing with compressible foam swabs. These methods are often referred to as
nonaggressive techniques. An important attribute is that they can be used
without having to cut into the mains and are therefore suitable for regular
maintenance. Some cleaning methods (e.g. pressure jetting, mechanical scraping
                             Maintenance and survey                             77

and abrasive swabs) do require cutting into mains and, if the pipe material is
ferrous, also require subsequent relining of the pipe. Complexities like this
require systematic rehabilitation planning.
   Programmes of regular mains cleaning should not become a substitute for
efficient treatment (see Chapter 2). However, even in well-treated supplies,
some deposits may form in small diameter pipes and at dead-ends, and animals
may be present (see Chapter 6). Deposits may also originate from historically
poor water treatment. Some investigational work will be required to ensure that
extensive internal encrustations of iron mains are not present. Where these exist,
there is the risk that the adoption of an aggressive cleaning method will
aggravate the problem by dislodging the encrustations and allowing the iron
surfaces to “bleed” corrosion products. In badly encrusted pipes, the use of
nonaggressive foam swabs is likely to be ineffective and the swabs could
become stuck or disintegrate to create blockage problems.
   A general approach to targeting pipes to be cleaned requires analysis of
available water-quality information and maintenance records, and integration
with other maintenance activities within the distribution system. Monitoring of
swater-quality changes in the network can be used to identify baseline
conditions and infer where deposits are located. The following parameters have
been employed for this purpose (Cossins et al., 2000; Rodgers, Pizzi &
Friedman, 1998; Friedman et al., 1998):
    • heterotrophic bacteria counts and total coliforms
    • residual disinfectant concentrations
    • consumer complaints
    • turbidity
    • dissolved oxygen
    • iron, aluminium and manganese concentrations.

   The colour of filter-papers used to filter set volumes of water can indicate the
internal condition of pipework. The method has been used to distinguish
problems caused by corrosion, deposition of treatment chemicals and deposition
of manganese (Evins, Leibeschuetz & Williams, 1990a).
   Water-quality measurements may indicate the presence of deposits. The
selection of a cleaning method (or indeed whether cleaning alone is appropriate)
depends on the pipe material (easily identified if not known) and the nature of
the deposits. The three nonaggressive methods described in this chapter are not
suitable for the removal of:
    • hard deposits such as calcium carbonate (downstream of water softening
        plants or in pipes conveying very “hard” waters);
    • corrosion tubercles in iron pipes;
    • adhesive deposits, such as those that are rich in manganese oxides.
78                             Safe Piped Water

   Identifying the nature of the deposits in mains is difficult because they are
relatively inaccessible. A number of water suppliers have used fibrescopes (fibre
optic instruments), which allow visual inspection via mains tappings or hydrants
under mains pressure (Carruthers & Evins, 1985). A more direct approach is the
examination of pipe samples, exhumed deliberately for this purpose, or obtained
opportunistically during repairs and system modifications. Other techniques
involve controlled flushing via hydrants and washouts to estimate the quantities
and measure the composition of loose deposits and the populations of animals
(Evins, Liebeschuetz & Williams, 1990b).

4.3.3 Planning mains-cleaning programmes
Pipe-cleaning programmes require careful planning to be effective and to
prevent flow conditions that may allow system contamination. For all three
techniques, a basic principle is that water must enter the length of main being
cleaned from a length of main that has been previously cleaned or is known to
be clean. It is important to assess normal flow velocities and pressures, and the
effects on these of the work being planned. An important hygiene requirement is
to avoid low or negative pressures in adjacent parts of the network. A network
model will help in this assessment and can be used to identify whether the
planned operations will create flushing conditions in adjacent pipework.
Planning will normally follow the eight steps listed below (Stephenson, 1989).
(1) Determine where cleaning is required (as described in Section 4.3.2) and
     which method to use (see Section 4.4 below).
(2) Prepare plans of the area(s) to be cleaned.
(3) Assess potential contamination hazards (low pressures, pipe environment,
     air valves, etc) and which preventative measures to adopt.
(4) Determine the timing of works and labour; determine plant and material
     requirements including those for good hygienic practice (see Chapter 5).
(5) Assess on-site traffic problems, access and condition of mains and valves.
(6) Review and, if necessary, modify, step 4.
(7) Brief operators, notify consumers, and arrange system modifications (e.g.
     tappings) if required.
(8) Monitor progress and effectiveness of the work.

   The environmental impacts of an extensive pipe-cleaning programme should
always be assessed beforehand. For example, the large volumes of water and
deposits that are discharged will require careful disposal and dechlorination to
avoid contamination of watercourses and land. It is prudent to inspect the site
environment and address issues such options for discharge of dirty water,
dechlorination, erosion, and potential scenarios for ingress and contamination.
                              Maintenance and survey                               79

Further to this, mitigation and protection measures should be considered, such
as stormwater drain protection, temporary detention or off-site disposal.
   Good consumer relations and information are critical to the success of a pipe-
cleaning programme. Consumers, especially critical ones such as hospitals and
other utilities, need to be informed of maintenance activities via a suitable
communication strategy, which could include the following features:
    • advance notification letters informing the community of forthcoming
        work; reasons and benefits to the water supply;
    • shutdown notification (if required);
    • handling of complaints and enquiries specific to the cleaning
        programme.

4.3.4 Monitoring effectiveness of mains cleaning
The parameters used to identify the parts of the network requiring cleaning
should be measured after cleaning. Indicator organisms should be included, to
verify that the working practices were hygienic (Ashbolt, Grabow & Snozzi,
2001). Existing operational and verification monitoring can be used to assess
how the pipes have responded to cleaning in the long term (> 1 month). Data
collection before and after cleaning is essential for understanding the benefits,
costs and secondary impacts of the cleaning programme (Friedman et al., 1998).


4.4 NONAGGRESSIVE PIPE CLEANING METHODS
4.4.1 Introduction
The most commonly used cleaning methods for routine maintenance are flushing,
air scouring and swabbing. Other, more abrasive, methods are available for cleaning
pipes before the renovation of water mains by coating with spray-on protective
linings such as cement mortar or epoxy resin, or before the insertion of pipe liners
such as polyethylene. Examples are high pressure water jetting, power boring with
metal flails, and abrasive pigging devices (AWWA, 2001). However when these
abrasive methods are used to clean iron pipe surfaces they should always be
followed by a lining method, otherwise corrosion will continue apace, causing
extensive water discolouration and deterioration. The characteristics of each of these
nonaggressive cleaning methods are described in the following sections and are
summarized in Table 4.3.

4.4.2 Flushing
Flushing involves the discharge of water from pipes, generally through hydrants and
washouts, to generate velocities in the pipe capable of removing accumulated material
and biofilms inside the pipe and attached to its walls. This is the simplest of the pipe-
cleaning techniques. The velocity required to suspend and flush out the deposits depends
on particle size and specific gravity. Although most small animals are of low specific
gravity (about 1), inorganic deposits may have a specific gravity of up to 3. Table 4.4
provides the volumetric flow rates required to transport loose particles of 0.2 mm
diameter. Below this diameter, the minimum flow rate required falls quickly with particle
size. Above this diameter, the effect of flushing diminishes rapidly.

water mains.

   Many water suppliers have a long history of implementing flushing
programmes in one form or another, and to varying extents within the
distribution system. Flushing may be used routinely to expel contaminants or in
response to consumer complaints. These latter unplanned operations often
involve opening hydrants in an area and leaving them open until certain water
quality objectives are met (e.g. reduction or elimination of discolouration of
water, or decreased turbidity of water). Flushing velocities are not necessarily
maximized and the water used to flush a particular pipe may not have originated
from clean or preflushed pipework.
   For planned maintenance it is important to adopt a systematic approach based
on unidirectional flushing. This means working to ensure that water enters from
a previously cleaned main and water approaches the discharge point from one
direction only. A particular section of pipe is isolated, typically by closing
valves. The hydrants are then opened in a sequential manner, with the aim of
increasing the velocity of water flowing through the pipe, thereby suspending
sediments and flushing them out. In calculating flushing times it is important to
remove at least twice the nominal volume of each main, because the suspended
particulate matter moves more slowly than the water.
   Advantages of flushing:
    • simple to perform because it requires only 1 or 2 persons;
    • relatively inexpensive to carry out in comparison with other cleaning
         techniques.

  Disadvantages of flushing:
  • uses a lot of water;
  • limited effectiveness unless high flow velocities are achieved;
  • unlikely to remove all the biofilm from the pipe;
  • not suitable for larger diameter mains because it is usually not
      practicable to achieve the desired flushing velocity.

4.4.3 Swabbing
The swabbing process involves driving a cylindrical foam sponge (known as a
swab) through pipes using water pressure. The swab has a diameter
approximately 25% greater than the pipe it is being forced through. Various
grades of swab are available, depending on the particular manufacturer's
specifications. Typically, they come in three grades: soft, hard and scouring
(WRc, 1994).
   In practice, swabbing will be effective when the velocity of the water in the
pipe is between 0.8 and 1.5 m/s. If the swab travels too fast it will remove less
material and will suffer from wear and tear. To prevent the swab from tumbling,
82                              Safe Piped Water

the ratio of length to diameter should be 2 for small diameters (< 100 mm) and
1.5 for larger diameters.
   Swabbing will remove soft deposits but not the hard scales or corrosion
products that may be present. It is usual to send between three and six swabs
through a pipe to achieve adequate cleaning.
   Swabs are normally inserted into pipes using existing fixtures such as
hydrants, or insertion points such as swept-tees (T-branched connections, with
the middle branch sweeping in at a shallow angle) specifically installed for this
purpose. The insertion method will depend on the local engineering practices.
However, all methods involve gaining access to the pipe interior and inserting a
swab that will be in contact with both drinking-water and surfaces that are
exposed to drinking-water. It is therefore essential that staff apply the same
working practices and disinfection procedures as described in Chapter 5 for all
equipment and materials (e.g. swabs) used in swabbing operations.
   Advantages of swabbing:
    • superior to flushing and air scouring in terms of removing sediments
         and biofilm from the pipe wall;
    • has the potential to remove almost all biomass and sediment;
    • uses less water than flushing;
    • no diameter limitations because foam swabs can be manufactured for
         practically all pipe sizes;
    • swabs can be manufactured with abrasive surfaces to assist in removing
         harder deposits from the pipe wall (but see comments above concerning
         corroded and tuberculated iron mains).

     Disadvantages of swabbing:
     • consumers may have to be isolated from supply during the cleaning
         operation;
     • swabs may break up in the pipe, particularly in pipes with a high degree
         of internal corrosion or encrustations;
     • more expensive than flushing;
     • problems with collecting and disposing of contaminants — swabbing
         can produce a large amount of discoloured water that requires careful
         environmental planning for its disposal;
     • swabs may become stuck in any unforeseen bore restriction, such as
         inserted length of smaller diameter pipe or tuberculated section;
     • requires suitable points for insertion of swabs;
     • swabs and any other materials or equipment used in the insertion
         process must be disinfected.

4.4.4 Air scouring
   Air scouring involves the controlled injection of filtered, compressed air into
pipes, usually via a hydrant (Stephenson, 1989). Given a continuous supply of
water and air in the right proportions, discrete “slugs” of water are formed in the
main and driven along by the compressed air at high velocity. There is no need
to turn the water or air on and off to achieve this effect. This is illustrated in
Figure 4.1. The high velocity slugs tend to lift up silt and sediment from the
base of the pipe. Air-scouring companies do not claim that the process removes
much, if any, biofilm from the walls of the pipe. Achieving the right conditions
whereby high velocity ‘slugs’ are propelled through the pipework is a skilled
task, and normally undertaken by a specialist team. Alternate slugs of air and
water, along with loose sediments, are ejected from the hydrant (or other fixture)
at the end of the pipe being cleaned. It is very important to get all the
compressed air out of the pipe before it is returned to service, to avoid unstable
flows and cloudy water.
   The fact that pipeline fixtures will be used as air injection points dictates that
the same hygienic working practices will be required as described above for
swabbing. The additional complication is that ambient air is normally injected
after being pressurized in an air compressor, which will almost certainly release
oil into the air stream. Therefore, the compressed air should be passed through
an air cooler and suitable filters to ensure removal of both oil droplets and oil
vapours. The nature of the ambient air and its potential to contaminate the
pipework should also be considered: for example, the proximity of a cooling
tower generating aerosols could be considered potentially hazardous if the
aerosols contain chemicals or microorganisms.

   Advantages of air scouring:
   • about 40% less water is used during air-scouring than during swabbing
       or flushing;
   • removes more deposits from pipes than flushing;
   • the likelihood of a pipe break is very low as air pressure is kept below
       the static operating pressure of the pipe.

     Disadvantages of air scouring:
     • only effective in pipes with a diameter of less than 200 mm (also
         reported to lose its effectiveness in very small diameter pipes);
     • not as effective as swabbing for removing biofilms;
     • operators must be skilled, to ensure that the correct proportions of air
         and water are used;
     • as with swabbing, consumers need to be isolated from the water supply
         during air scouring to ensure that discoloured water does not enter the
         house service pipes;
     • precautions must be taken to prevent air contaminated with pathogens
         and chemicals (such as compressor oil) entering the pipework.


4.5 SUMMARY
Structural deficiencies in tanks, reservoirs, valves, fittings and pipework may
offer direct routes for the contamination of water supplies with pathogens. This
will depend on the environment surrounding the different components of the
distribution system and the water pressure. Emergencies will generate low
pressures in most conventional distribution systems.
   Most tanks, reservoirs and fittings are accessible for inspection and planned
maintenance. They should be prioritized according to sanitary risks, and
surveyed and maintained in accordance with those risks. The survey and
maintenance of service reservoirs is especially important because of the large
populations served by these structures and the absence of internal water pressure
at potential contamination points.
   There are sound hygienic reasons for maintaining the internal cleanliness of
pipework. Although there are no reports of health effects directly attributed to
deposits in pipes, they do provide conditions for proliferation of microorganisms
and animals. This may make the water unpalatable and make it difficult to
identify contamination of hygienic significance by routine monitoring. The
deposits also hinder the maintenance of a disinfectant residual, especially in the
smaller diameter pipes which are at greatest risk of low pressures and hence
contamination.
   Pipe cleaning programmes can be used to maintain the internal cleanliness of
a network. They require careful planning to be effective and to prevent flow
conditions that may allow system contamination. It is important to assess
normal flow velocities and pressures, and the effects on these of the work being
planned. A network hydraulic model will help in this assessment. An important
hygienic requirement is to avoid low or negative pressures in, and adjacent to,
those parts of the network being cleaned. When using swabs or injected air to
clean pipework, the materials and fixtures are potential sources of contamination
and therefore the hygienic practices described in Chapter 5 should be followed.

Precautions during construction and
repairs
Richard Ainsworth and David Holt




5.1 INTRODUCTION
Engineering work on distribution systems presents risks of widespread
contamination of water supplies. The risks depend on factors such as the degree
of pollution at the construction or repair site, the method of construction or
repair, the ability to contain potential contamination by valving and, most
importantly, the cleanliness of personnel, their working practices and the
materials employed. The following activities may present risks of contamination
with pathogenic microorganisms:
   • construction of new pipework or the abandonment of existing pipework;
   • renovation work using either structural or nonstructural linings, such as
        polyethylene slipliners or spray-on coatings;

     •   repairs, either emergency or planned, that involve pressure loss or
         breaking into the inside of a pipe;
     •   reconnecting a water main after it has been taken out of service for an
         extended period.

   Emergency repairs present the greatest risks — locating valves, dealing with
consumers and traffic, the presence of adjacent services and the need to restore
an essential supply all create difficulties when the location and timing are
unplanned. Minimizing the risks arising from both emergency and planned
engineering work depends on:
   • having documented protocols;
   • adopting general precautionary working practices;
   • using health criteria to select personnel;
   • implementing effective procedures for cleaning and disinfection;
   • assessing the risks and monitoring the effects of both planned and
       emergency engineering work.

   This chapter addresses each of these topics, with an emphasis on recent
assessments of the efficacy of traditional approaches to cleaning and
disinfecting water mains after construction, planned maintenance and
emergency repairs. Box 5.1 provides an example of a disease outbreak
associated with a broken water main.

Box 5.1. An outbreak of jaundice associated with a broken water main.
In January 1990, the staff at Rairangpur Hospital in Orisa, India noticed a sharp
increase in the number of patients admitted because of jaundice. A community
survey was conducted to identify further cases. About a fifth of the population
were contacted and 127 cases of jaundice were identified as occurring in
December or January, giving an estimated size of the outbreak of 635 cases,
with one death. Serological tests were negative for both hepatitis A and B,
making this non-A, non-B hepatitis (presumably the outbreak was hepatitis E).
   The city of Rairangpur has 15 wards, of which 9 had an intermittent piped
water supply and 6 had to rely on hand pumps and dug wells. The town had no
sewerage system and open-air defecation was the general practice. The
distribution of cases of jaundice was strongly correlated with water source.
People who used the piped supply were nine times more likely to have
developed jaundice than people who used the dug wells.
   On investigation, it was found that a main pipe had burst on December 1st,
though this was promptly repaired. This pipe supplied water to the five wards
with the highest attack rates. This example illustrates the importance of sanitary
conditions in the vicinity of water mains undergoing repair and maintenance.

   As for other aspects of water supply hygiene, it is important that procedures
are developed for local circumstances and are incorporated in national codes of
practice, and in training and instructions for waterworks staff. The national
codes of practice should also be reviewed regularly in the light of local
performance and international technical developments.


5.2 PRECAUTIONARY WORKING PRACTICES
Typical guidance concerning hygienic working practices usually includes
general advice on prevention measures. The following advice has been
abstracted from two sets of guidelines (Water UK, 1998; AWWA, 1999).
   • When working with pipes and fittings on site, ensure that they are
        protected from contamination by storing off the ground, capping the
        ends of pipes and liners, and keeping fittings in wrappings until the time
        of use (see Box 5.2).
   • Ensure that the open ends of pipes in trenches are plugged and
        watertight when not being worked on or when there is a risk of the
        trench flooding.
   • Excavate trenches to below the pipe level to provide a sump, and keep
        as dry as possible to prevent water entering a pipe or fitting.
   • Ensure that sealing materials and lubricants are clean and certified as
        suitable for contact with potable water supplies.
   • Protect unattended trenches and engineering sites from vandals and
        animals.
   • If a part of the distribution system has been taken out of service for an
        extended period, treat it as a potentially contaminated new installation.
        Apply the flushing, disinfection and microbiological sampling
        procedures that are normally applied to new installations (see below).
   • If a part of the distribution system is to be abandoned, ensure that all
        boundaries with the live system are effectively closed with especially
        secure and marked valves, or are capped. Create boundaries to minimize
        dead legs on the live system and ensure that the location of the
        abandoned system is recorded for future reference.
   • When planning new installations and renovation works, make sure that
        the plans include valves, injection and washout points to facilitate
        effective cleaning and disinfection of the pipework.
   • As far as is practicable, if general purpose or specialized vehicles are
        used for water supply construction and repair duties, do not use those
        vehicles for other duties where contamination may be prevalent (e.g.
        sewerage work).
90                              Safe Piped Water

     •   Clearly mark equipment and materials used in contact with water
         supplies as intended for this purpose and protect them from direct
         contamination with sewage or sewage sludge.


Box 5.2. A foxy tale.
A few months after moving into their homes, residents of a new housing estate
started to complain of pieces of fur and other particles appearing in their tap
water. The estate was supplied with water through a 15 cm diameter main that
fed into a circular main round the estate. The diameter of the pipe tapered down
to 10 cm.
   The cause of the particulate material was traced to a dead fox. The fox had
apparently climbed into the system during construction and, when the pipe had
been charged, had become stuck at the taper. Because the estate was supplied by
a loop system, the flow of water to consumers’ taps was not interrupted. As the
fox decayed it started to break up and at this point small pieces of rotting flesh
appeared in consumers’ tap water.
   Microbiological analysis showed heavy contamination of the system with
coliforms and Escherichia coli. Residents of the estate had to be evacuated
while the supply and the domestic plumbing systems were thoroughly cleaned.
   This example illustrates the importance of ensuring that mains pipes are kept
capped at all times when they are not being directly supervised.

5.3 PERSONNEL
Known carriers of potentially waterborne communicable diseases should not
come into contact with the distribution system of potable water supplies. The
local circumstances and environment will dictate which diseases pose the
greatest threats and how best to employ and monitor personnel to minimize such
risks. However, certain guidance concerning good practice is universally
applicable, as described below.
    • Water supply activities that pose a potential contamination risk should
        be defined and given a clear descriptive name. For example, in the
        United Kingdom, such activities are referred to as “restricted
        operations” and this terminology is used below.
    • Employees and contractors involved in restricted operations should be
        trained in the hygienic implications of their work and basic hygienic
        practices. This training should include details of the personal symptoms
        that indicate a potential waterborne disease. All staff (employees and
        contractors) should be encouraged to report such symptoms without
        prejudice to their employment prospects.
                                   Precautions                                 91

   •    Employers should provide adequate toilet and washing facilities to
        maintain personal hygiene. Wastes from portable or temporary
        arrangements should be disposed of without risk to water supplies or the
        environment.
   •    A medical officer should review the suitability of individuals for
        restricted operations at regular intervals. This may involve the use of
        questionnaires.


5.4 CLEANING AND DISINFECTION PROCEDURES
Before putting into service a new, repaired, rehabilitated or modified water main
carrying potable water, the main must first be cleaned, disinfected, flushed and
sampled to ensure that it is free from contamination. Each stage is important, but
the emergence of knowledge concerning the resistance of Cryptosporidium
oocysts to high concentrations of disinfectants such as aqueous chlorine (WRc,
1988) has placed extra emphasis on the removal of all solid matter from the
interior of pipes and fittings before reconnection. Furthermore, deposits left in
mains may shield pathogens from the disinfectant and allow them to remain
undetected during subsequent microbiological sampling. A main may appear
satisfactory, but deposits may then be disturbed and contaminate the conveyed
water. Chemical disinfection, even in relatively high doses, should never be
considered a catch-all stage for ensuring hygienic conditions in a new or
repaired distribution system; physical removal of all introduced deposits is a
critical control stage. Some water suppliers recognize this by requiring that all
new mains incorporate swab (usually polyurethane foam) insertion and removal
points, to allow future maintenance and to swab the newly laid main before
flushing and disinfection.
   The presence of deposits previously formed in a main that is being repaired
obviously creates problems when assessing whether contamination has occurred
or whether cleaning has been effective. However, introduced material is likely
to be less adhesive than indigenous deposits, and vigorous flushing and
swabbing should be effective if well controlled.

5.4.1 Typical cleaning and disinfection procedures
Guidance concerning cleaning and disinfection procedures is an important
component of water safety plans, as described in Chapter 7. The guidance
typically differentiates between practices for new constructions and repairs.
Tables 5.1 and 5.2 list advice contained in two readily available sets of
guidelines (Water UK, 1998 and WAA, 1988; AWWA, 1999); they are given
here for illustration.

   In the case of mains undergoing renovation with spray-on linings (or similar)
guidance is usually similar to that for a repair with potential internal
contamination. However, additional flushing and testing is likely to be required
to avoid unacceptable levels of chemical contaminants leaching from such
linings.

5.4.2 Methods for dosing chlorine into the mains
Gaseous chlorine is not a practical option for field disinfection applications
because it poses a safety risk for utility staff, contractors and the public.
Calcium hypochlorite (as granules or tablets) and sodium hypochlorite solution
are the normal chemicals of choice for this situation.
   Quantities of calcium hypochlorite may be deposited in the main at regular
intervals during construction or during a repair. The recommended quantities,
spatial distribution and maximum filling velocity for the inlet water are a
function of pipe internal diameter. Detailed guidelines are available (AWWA,
1999). The objective is to achieve an initial dose of 25 mg/l of free chlorine and
to have a detectable chlorine residual after 24 hours. Some codes restrict the use
of calcium hypochlorite to, for example, short lengths or emergency repairs to
burst mains. Important limitations are:
    • the need to keep the main clean and dry in a new construction to prevent
         premature dissolution;
    • the presence of the solid hypochlorite, which precludes any preliminary
         flushing;
    • the tendency of the dissolution process to concentrate the dense
         hypochlorite solution at the bottom of the pipe.

   Sodium hypochlorite solution can be prepared in concentrated form and then
dosed proportionally to flow into the main, or dosed in batch form if a tank is
available. These solutions are corrosive and should be treated with caution. The
flow can then be stopped when the main is full, or it can be continuously fed
through the main to waste. The American Water Works Association standard
(AWWA, 1999), which provides detailed guidance, refers to the former as the
“slug method” and to the latter as the “continuous method”. The slug method
creates less volume of chlorinated water to be disposed of and uses less
chemical; the continuous method can provide a uniform concentration of
chlorine along the length of main. Recommended concentrations and contact
times are summarized in Table 5.1.
   Detailed practical information on the manufacture of chlorine solutions,
chlorine measurement, destruction of chlorine residues in wastewater and
flushing volumes is available (e.g. AWWA, 1999).

5.4.3 Practical problems
New construction work and renovation should present few problems because
there is time available to plan carefully and to forewarn consumers. Also, the
interior of the pipework is new or resurfaced and has a smooth bore, free of
encrustation and corrosion. This assists in cleaning the pipe and should reduce
chlorine consumption during the disinfection stage. However, some linings may
themselves exert a chlorine demand and make it difficult to achieve target
chlorine residuals. This has been observed during investigations of cement
mortar linings applied in-situ (Rayner, Olliffe & Kings, 1993).
   The majority of problems occur when making emergency repairs. The ability
to quickly locate valves, stopcocks and washout points relies on good local
knowledge or accessible records. Consumers may need to be warned and may
have to move out of the buildings involved. Finding a convenient injection and
washout point may require the isolation of a long length of main, especially in a
rural area. Furthermore, the existing pipework may contain deposits and
encrustation that consume the disinfectant.
   These practical concerns have lead to a reappraisal of the effectiveness of the
traditional cleaning and disinfection practices in recent years, as outlined in the
next section.

5.4.4 Effectiveness of guidance for field disinfection
An underground pipe rig and field trials have been used to identify the
performance of various disinfection practices and cleaning practices used in the
UK (WRc, 1994). In a series of experiments, the dispersion of chlorine in small
diameter mains (< 150 mm) was first investigated. The results demonstrated the
poor and nonuniform dispersion of disinfectant that occurs when either solid or
dissolved hypochlorite is introduced at one end of a pipe and then distributed by
the incoming water used to charge the main. Dosing calcium hypochlorite
tablets at the spacing recommended by the manufacturers reduced the
nonuniformity of the distribution, but target doses were not achieved at some
locations. As would be expected, dosing sodium hypochlorite solution into
water being used to charge the main was most effective.
   In the same investigation, the effects of various combinations of chlorine
concentrations and contact times (with and without prior swabbing) were
measured. The method of measurement was unusual in that the biofilm on a
standardized area of the pipe interior was sampled and the bacteria enumerated
using a heterotrophic plate count technique. Other investigations have relied on
sampling the conveyed water. The experiments used either exhumed or in situ
cast-iron pipes, which were tuberculated with corrosion products and contained
established biofilms. The results were variable because of variation in the size of
the bacterial colonies on the pipe surfaces. However, chlorine consumption was
96                              Safe Piped Water

found to be more a function of the indigenous deposits than of the introduced
deposits in pipes of this condition. Conventional doses and contact times
reduced general bacterial numbers on the surfaces by 65–98%, although
preswabbing appeared to have no beneficial effect in such circumstances. These
results indicate that normal doses of chlorine are able to affect the bacterial
populations on surfaces and hence provide some safeguard in case of certain
pathogens entering pipes during construction and repair (although the
disinfectant is ineffective against pathogens such as viruses and the oocysts of
protozoa). The results also indicate the benefits of routine maintenance activities
intended to keep the system free of deposits and biofilms.
   Similar investigations have been undertaken to identify the performance of
various disinfection and cleaning practices used in the USA (AWWARF, 1998).
These investigations measured bacterial numbers in water that had been flushed
through pipe rigs containing new pipes and old used pipes. In some cases, water
flushed from the vicinity of mains breaks was used. The purpose was to identify
bacterial numbers that occur on pipe surfaces and to study the disinfection
kinetics within the water itself. The results were as follows.
    • None of the water mains tested was found to have detectable total
         coliforms or acid-fast bacteria but all mains (including new ones) had
         high heterotrophic bacteria counts.
    • Heterotrophic bacteria counts in used mains were variable, but were
         comparable to levels in new mains. Tuberculated used mains had higher
         counts than smooth bore used mains.
    • All mains (including new ones) exhibited a significant chlorine demand.
    • In all cases, regardless of material, diameter or age of pipe, using an
         initial chlorine residual of 25 mg/l and a contact time of 24 hours
         resulted in a four-log inactivation of heterotrophic bacteria. This, of
         course, applied to the flushed organisms, not those remaining on the
         pipe surfaces.

   The results of the American Water Works Association Research Foundation
(AWWARF) study confirmed that the recommended procedures are a
conservative approach to disinfecting conventional indicator and heterotrophic
microorganisms. The authors did, however, point out that disinfectant-resistant
pathogens such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium had not been investigated in
the same way and that this is an outstanding research requirement.


5.5 RISK ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING
The decision on when to commission a newly constructed or repaired water
main depends on the risk of contamination, the risk that cleaning and
disinfection will be ineffective, and the added security that can be provided by
                                   Precautions                                 97

satisfactory results arising from bacteriological sampling. With repairs, these
risks need to be balanced against the practicalities associated with interruptions
to supply.
    When undertaking new constructions, renovation work and planned repairs it
is normal to have sufficient time available to follow all the recommended
procedures for dealing with materials, excavations, physical cleaning and long-
duration disinfection. In such cases, risks are already low and added security is
provided by sampling the main at regular intervals along its length and by
testing for coliform organisms (at the very least). The AWWA standard
recommends that two consecutive sets of acceptable samples, taken at least 24
hours apart, should be obtained before recommissioning (AWWA, 1999). The
Water UK guidelines recommend that new mains be charged with mains water
for 24 hours, sampled at appropriate points and analysed for residual chlorine,
coliforms, turbidity, taste, odour and appearance (Water UK, 1998). Mains that
fail such tests will obviously require investigation and should be reflushed (or
recleaned by some other means such as swabbing), rechlorinated and sampled
until acceptable results are obtained, before commissioning the main.
    Emergency repairs create obvious difficulties in comparison with planned
work. Water suppliers are confronted with balancing the risks of contamination
with the risks of poor sanitary conditions occurring in the absence of a mains
supply. Table 5.2 summarizes the advice provided by two national codes. The
important requirement is good site practice and information. If a break causes
pressure loss and is near a leaking sewer or contaminated ground, then extreme
caution should be exercised before recommissioning; a larger area may need to
be cleaned. In such cases, the decision should be made by a suitably qualified
employee of the water supplier.
    Bacteriological sampling after emergency repairs may not inform the
decision to return the affected pipe to service because of the delay in obtaining
microbiological results. However, these samples are still important. They
provide baseline data in the event of a problem developing subsequently; they
also provide a record of the effectiveness of an organisation’s working practices;
indeed they may reveal differences in the performance of different repair crews.
These data should be regularly reviewed to identify areas for improvement.
    Box 5.3 (below) describes an outbreak of giardiasis associated with work on
a water main.


5.6 SMALL COMMUNITY-MANAGED SYSTEMS
It is important to follow hygienic working practices during construction of
community-managed piped supplies; also, the supply should be properly
disinfected before commissioning. Training in good hygiene practices for repair
work is essential for operators and managers of such supplies.

Box 5.3. An outbreak of giardiasis associated with work on a water main.
An outbreak of giardiasis affected residents of Bristol, England during the
summer of 1985. There were 108 laboratory confirmed cases. Most of the cases
were resident in an area supplied by a single reservoir and became ill during the
middle two weeks of July. Epidemiological investigations showed a very strong
association between illness and consumption of unboiled tap water in the
affected area during the first week of July. Data from water samples taken from
the reservoir and the distribution of cases suggested that contamination occurred
after water had left the reservoir.
   Although the exact cause of failure was not identified, the outbreak coincided
with work on the implicated mains. The main had been opened on two separate
occasions for a few hours. It was suggested that either this had allowed access to
infected water or had allowed backflow into the mains during the pressure drop.
   This outbreak demonstrates the dangers associated with work on the
distribution system. The potential risks to public health should be considered
before any work on the distribution system.
Source: Jephcott, Begg & Baker (1986).

   Community operators and managers need to have a good understanding of
where the distribution system is laid, and a diagram of the system that shows
pipe location in relation to easily recognized landmarks. This is particularly
important in older systems where changes in community operator or
management committee may have occurred. It may be necessary for an external
agency (such as a surveillance body) to ensure that this knowledge is
maintained, through periodic visits.
   Training of community operators should include hygienic working practices,
and guidance material should be provided to the operator as a reference. This
material should be simple and attractive, and should maximize the use of
pictures (even in literate communities).
   Simple guidance should be provided to communities regarding good hygiene
during work carried out on pipes, based on the practices outlined above. These
may need modification to remove those that are obviously not applicable (e.g.
the use of specialized vehicles) and to include additional guidance that is
appropriate.
   Within small, community-managed systems, medical checks on personnel
working on pipelines are often not feasible. It must therefore be emphasized to
community operators and managers that people who are currently suffering from
diarrhoea or who have recently had diarrhoea should not undertake work on
distribution systems.

5.7 SUMMARY
The hygienic safety of repaired or constructed pipework is dependent on good
working practice and the removal of all debris and water that may have entered
a pipe. Disinfection, although important, is not a panacea for contaminated
pipework, especially as some pathogens may be resistant.
   Recent investigations of published guidelines for the cleaning and
disinfection of new and repaired water mains show these to be effective when
followed carefully. However, existing deposits and encrustations in water mains
may consume much of the disinfectant.
   Chlorination using an externally prepared solution of hypochlorite to charge
the whole main gives the best dispersion of disinfectant. Introducing
hypochlorite tablets or a volume of hypochlorite solution followed by charging
the main is a much less effective means of uniform dispersion.
   The construction and renovation of mains provides an opportunity to
incorporate valves, and injection and washout points for swabs or for flushing.
These will facilitate immediate cleaning and disinfection of the pipework, and
will be useful in the long-term maintenance of the system.
   Good hygiene is equally vital during work on the distribution system in
small, community-managed water supplies. Providing proper training and
simple guidance material to support safe, hygienic working practices in such
supplies is essential.

Small animals in drinking-water
distribution systems
Colin Evins




6.1 INTRODUCTION
Invertebrate animals are naturally present in many water resources used as
sources for the supply of drinking-water. Small numbers of adults or their larvae
may pass through water-treatment works if the barriers to particulate matter are
not completely effective. Their motility may also enable them to penetrate filters
at the treatment works and vents on storage reservoirs.
    Many of these animals can survive (and some may even reproduce) within
the supply network by deriving their food from the microorganisms and organic
matter in the water or (more commonly) present in deposits on pipe and tank
surfaces. Populations of small animals are surprisingly widespread in treated-
water distribution systems. Reports from most continents suggest that few, if
any, water distribution systems are completely free of animals. However, the
density and composition of animal populations vary widely, from heavy

infestations of readily visible species that are objectionable to consumers, to
sparse occurrences of microscopic species. In spite of their ubiquity, these
animal populations have not been widely studied and their biology is not well
understood.
   In temperate countries, no population of pathogenic animals has been found,
or would be expected to be found, in a distribution system. The presence of
animals has largely been regarded by water suppliers as an ‘aesthetic’ problem,
either directly or through their association with discoloured water. However,
there have been suggestions that their presence may affect the microbiological
quality of water.
   In tropical and subtropical countries, certain species of aquatic animal can act
as secondary hosts for parasites. For example, the small crustacean Cyclops is
the intermediate host of Dracunculus medinensis, the guinea worm — the only
parasite that is known to be transmitted solely by water consumption (WHO,
1996). However there is no evidence that guinea worm transmission occurs from
treated-water piped supplies.
   In all countries, the presence of living animals or animal debris will reduce
the acceptability of a water supply. People may then change to alternative
supplies that may be less safe. Thus, for reasons of public health, it is important
to prevent the entry and proliferation of animals in water distribution networks.
   This chapter discusses:
    • the occurrence and significance of metazoan (many-celled) animals in
         treated drinking-water distribution systems;
    • the limited information available on their relationship with the
         microbiological quality of water and health concerns;
    • methods of controlling populations of animals in the supply network.

   This chapter does not deal with animals infesting raw water pipelines.


6.2 OCCURRENCE OF ANIMALS IN DISTRIBUTION
    SYSTEMS
6.2.1 Extent
There are reports in the literature of animals in water distribution systems
from North America, Europe, Africa, South Asia and East Asia, from the late
19th century (before the widespread introduction of filtration and disinfection)
into the 21st century. For example, the animal populations of water
distribution systems were studied in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and
1970s; about 50 systems were sampled, and animals were found in all of them,
although the water suppliers and their consumers were often unaware of their
presence. About 150 species of animal were identified (Smalls & Greaves,
                                 Small animals                              103

1968), including a species that had not been recorded from natural waters
since the 1920s, but had been found in several water distribution systems. A
systematic survey in the 1990s of water distribution systems supplied by 36
treatment works in the Netherlands also found animals in all of them, although
fewer taxa were identified (van Lieverloo, 1997). Water pipes evidently
provide a favourable environment for a variety of small aquatic animals.
   No systematic studies have followed the numbers of animals present in
distribution systems over a long period. Ad hoc observations from water
suppliers suggest that, where the efficacy of water treatment has improved,
animal numbers have probably declined.

6.2.2 Sampling
The usual method of sampling animals in water pipes is to flush a standard
volume of water from a hydrant at a controlled flow rate, and to capture
particulate matter, including animals, in a fine-meshed sampling net. The
catch is sorted in a trough with a through flow of water, the species identified
and their number estimated. Results are often only semiquantitative, the
number of individuals of a particular species in a sample being expressed as
an order of magnitude (1–9, 10–99, 100–999 etc.) (Smalls & Greaves, 1968).
   More elaborate methods have been proposed. Van Lieverloo (1997) used a
device that split the flow from the hydrant, part being filtered through a
500 µm mesh, and part being passed through an additional 100 µm mesh.
Smart (1989) used repeated flushing of the same hydrant, and extrapolated
from the declining numbers found in successive samples from the same point
to estimate the total population in the length of main being sampled. Because
different species show a different propensity to be flushed from the pipe, it
was necessary to make a separate extrapolation for each. However, such
methods have not found widespread favour, partly because it is uncertain how
representative samples are, and partly because the considerable effort involved
in making the sampling and counting more quantitative is usually not thought
to be worthwhile for making short-term operational decisions. Consequently,
few data exist on the biomass of the various species or on the dynamics of the
ecosystems in water mains.

6.2.3 Ingress
Animals may be present in water distribution systems because:
   • they enter the distribution system with the incoming water, having
       passed through treatment processes or having colonised parts of the
       treatment plant;
   • they enter through defects in the integrity of the distribution system,
       such as badly screened service reservoirs;
   • they form breeding populations within the distribution systems.

    Animals that are aquatic for the whole or part of their life-cycle may gain
initial entry to the system by penetration through treatment works. The animals
that successfully penetrate treatment processes are largely benthic species
(Evins & Greaves, 1979) — that is, species that live on the bottoms or margins
of water bodies. Where water from upland reservoirs of good microbiological
quality with a low content of suspended solids receives only limited treatment,
planktonic species may enter the distribution system in appreciable numbers.
However, they do not usually thrive there. Some benthic species have also been
found to colonise filter beds and other parts of treatment works, and this has
been shown to influence the numbers and species in the treated water leaving
                                   Small animals                                  105

the works. The relative importance of this mechanism is unclear, but the species
found in each situation suggest that it in most cases it is probably less important
than the direct passage of animals with the water being treated.
    Service reservoirs may be a point of entry for species that are aerial for part
of their life-cycle. For example, flying insects may enter through badly
protected vents and overflows, and lay eggs at the water surface, which develop
into aquatic larvae. Significant ingress of chironomid (gnat) larvae may take
place in this way. Terrestrial species may enter as a result of inadequate care in
laying mains or through cracks and poorly fitting access covers at service
reservoirs; the resulting problems are transient and cease when the access point
is blocked.
    The ingress of small numbers of aquatic animals through treatment works
and the establishment of breeding populations in the distribution system is
responsible for by far the greatest number of individuals. The initial entry of a
species may have been some time ago, when water treatment was less effective
than it is now, or it may be the result of periodic treatment failures.
    Although a large proportion of the species that penetrate treatment works are
benthic, and all those that thrive in the mains are benthic, it is not necessarily the
species that pass treatment in the greatest numbers that are most common in the
mains. A survey (Evins & Greaves, 1979) of treatment works and their
associated distribution systems showed that, for most species, it is success of
reproduction within the main that determines the size of the population. Thus,
the species that are common in the distribution system are not necessarily those
that appear most frequently at consumers’ taps (van Lieverloo, 1997). This is
because the species that thrive in the pipework may resist dislodgement and
suspension in the conveyed water, whereas those that are present in the
incoming supply may pass directly to consumers’ taps.
    Only animals that are aquatic for the whole of their life-cycle can colonise
the distribution system and form breeding populations there. This excludes most
insect larvae. Nevertheless, larvae of many species of chironomid may be
present in the distribution system in appreciable numbers. Larvae are often
present in large numbers in rivers and reservoirs, and may penetrate treatment
works. These insects may colonise filter beds, they may also lay eggs in open
tanks in treatment works or in badly protected service reservoirs.
    However, several species of chironomid are parthenogenetic (females are
able to reproduce without males), and have eggs that begin to develop within the
pupa. In at least one species, Paratanytarsus grimmii, and possibly others, if
emergence of the (normally aerial) imago is prevented (e.g. by lack of access to
air) viable eggs are released from the pupa. Thus, successful reproduction is
possible within the confines of water mains, and these insects have been
particularly troublesome in water distribution systems in Europe and North
America. (Krüger, 1941; Williams, 1974; Berg, 1995).
106                             Safe Piped Water

6.2.4 Population size
For some species, numbers depend on ingress from outside the distribution
system; however, for most species, there are breeding populations within the
distribution system that interact to form an ecosystem. The size of these
populations depends on intrinsic characteristics, such as their adaptability to
conditions in a water pipe, their reproductive potential and external factors, such
as temperature and (most importantly) food supply. The majority of the species
that thrive in water mains feed in their natural habitats on particulate organic
matter or plant material. For example, the chydorids, which are often the most
numerous group, feed by filtering small particles from water close to solid
surfaces. One of the most successful of the larger colonizers of water mains,
Asellus aquaticus, is a detritivore (an organism that feeds on nonliving organic
matter) and is a fairly indiscriminate feeder. The faeces of Asellus taken from
iron water mains contain about 70% by weight of iron oxides (Water Research
Association, United Kingdom, unpublished data). Other species may graze more
directly on surface biofilms.
    Populations of these detritivores and grazers can flourish in the relative
absence of pressure from carnivores. A number of small carnivorous species
have been found, such as Cyclops albidus, which would feed on the smaller
chydorids. However, larger carnivores are rare or absent. Fish are usually the
‘top carnivores’ in freshwater ecosystems, consuming invertebrates such as
insect larvae, and are effectively absent from treated water distribution systems.
    Thus, one may imagine that the food-chain in the water mains ecosystem is a
relatively short one: most of the animal species present are at the same trophic
level. They would be either competing directly for the same food supply of
organic detritus and microorganisms, or using separate parts of it, divided for
example by size and by whether or not they are attached to the substrate. Smart
(1989) has studied the diversity of animals recolonising pipework following
flushing. He found little pattern to the recolonisation in apparently similar
situations, and concluded that there was a ‘competitive lottery’: the species
which by chance arrived first being able to establish substantial populations.
    Various observations and studies have shown a link between the type of
water source, particularly its organic content, and the extent of animal
populations in the water mains. Water from deep underground sources generally
supports lower numbers of animals than water from surface sources, probably
because water from underground has a low organic content. Increases in animals
in the mains have been attributed to penetration of algae and to the introduction
of treatment processes that are less effective at reducing the organic content of
the water. Variations in the organic content of the water at one works have been
linked to changes in the numbers of some groups of animals (Evins & Greaves,
1979), although these were unsophisticated studies. No known studies have
quantified the interactions between the major elements of the system, namely
                                     Small animals                            107

the organic material entering the distribution system, the heterotrophic
microorganisms in the pipework and the animals in the pipework.
   It would be reasonable to suppose that the type of organic material is
significant. Some particulate organic matter, such as algal cells and other plant
material, may directly contribute to the food supply for filter feeders and
detritivores. Increases in populations of Asellus aquaticus have been noted after
high algal numbers in raw water, the introduction of water from surface sources
and a change to treatment processes that were less effective at removing algae.
Biodegradable dissolved organic material contributes to microbial growth (see
Chapter 2) and thus to the food supply for animals, although the more refractory
dissolved or colloidal organic material, such as the humic material prevalent in
some upland waters, is likely to be less suitable.
   As a generalization, the trophic interactions may be summarized as in
Figure 6.1. The relationships involved have not been satisfactorily quantified. In
particular, there is lack of information on the quantity of biofilm material
necessary to support populations of grazing animals, and a corresponding lack
of information on the effect of the grazing on the quantity and species
composition of biofilms.

108                            Safe Piped Water

   Recommendations have been made to limit the potential for the growth of
animal populations in water mains by limiting the amount of organic matter
entering the distribution system (Evins, Liebeschuetz & Williams, 1990; van
Lieverloo, 1997). The severity of infestations has declined in some countries in
recent years; this may be related to improvements in the efficacy of water
treatment not primarily introduced for this reason.


6.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF METAZOAN ANIMALS IN
    DRINKING-WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
6.3.1 Aesthetic problems
The presence of animals has largely been regarded by water suppliers in
temperate countries as an “aesthetic” problem. The few studies in distribution
systems and the animal control activity by water suppliers have been concerned
with the aesthetic aspects. The larger animals may be visible to the consumer
and may be objectionable if they appear at the tap. Also, animals are associated
with discoloured water problems as both cause and effect; the animals thrive at
points of low flow, such as dead end mains and badly encrusted pipes, where
sediments accumulate. Examination of samples of discoloured water has
sometimes revealed that the particulate matter consists largely of fragments of
animals, such as the cast carapaces of chydorids, which are stained with iron.
   The decay of animals and their faeces may create the potential for taste and
odour problems. Alternatively, the animals may have a beneficial effect — by
feeding on particulate organic matter they limit the potential growth of
microorganisms such as actinomycetes, which can cause taste and odour
problems. Both these hypotheses are conjectural. In view of the much greater
biomass of microorganisms than that of animals, and the known association
between some of these microorganisms and odour problems, the beneficial
effect seems more likely.

6.3.2 Metazoan parasites
In temperate countries, there is no evidence that any of the metazoan animals
found in water distribution systems are directly harmful to human beings.
   In tropical and subtropical countries, certain species of aquatic invertebrate
animal act as intermediate hosts for parasites. The parasitic nematode
Dracunculus medinensis, the guinea worm, presently occurs in sub-Saharan
Africa only, but regions where it has been historically endemic also include
North Africa, Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It is transmitted solely
by water consumption (WHO, 1996). Cyclops is its intermediate host: one larval
stage develops within the crustacean, and human infection (dracunculiasis)
                                 Small animals                               109

results from ingesting water containing infected Cyclops. Further larval
development and growth of the adult worm (up to 1 m in length) takes place in
subcutaneous tissue. Juvenile worms are released: these cause a severe allergic
reaction and ulceration, which often becomes infected by bacteria. The sufferer
often uses water to cool the inflamed and infected areas, allowing the juvenile
worms to return to water and infect new Cyclops. Thus, in areas where
dracunculiasis is prevalent, raw water should be treated sufficiently well to
remove Cyclops. However, there is no evidence that guinea worm transmission
occurs from piped drinking-water supplies.
   The five species of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma that cause
schistosomiasis (bilharziasis) have occurred in many countries in Central and
South America, Africa, Asia Minor, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific
(WHO, 1996). They have a complex aquatic life-cycle with aquatic snails as
their intermediate hosts. Eggs released by human beings develop into miracidia,
which are infective to snails, where they develop and release sporocysts. These
in turn develop into cercariae, which are infective to human beings. Thus, in the
tropical and subtropical regions where schistosomiasis is prevalent, the presence
of snails in the distribution system could pose a hazard. If the snails are not
already infected, it is possible they will become so if eggs or miracidia pass
through treatment. Again, this is a theoretical risk and there is no evidence of
piped distribution systems acting as a transmission route for this disease.

6.3.3 Effect of animals on occurrence of microorganisms in
      water mains
There have been suggestions that the presence of animals may have an effect on
the microbial quality of water. Animals play a role in the biological equilibrium
in the distribution system. The animals present in water mains occur
predominantly in sediments or close to the pipe walls, and this is where
microorganisms are concentrated. Most of the animals present in water mains
are filter feeders or detritivores, and it could be expected that the
microorganisms form a substantial proportion of the material ingested by the
animals. Although a microbial flora may be present in the gut of the animals, it
is likely that the predominant effect of the animals will be to exert a “grazing
pressure” by ingesting and inactivating microorganisms. This may reduce the
biomass of microbial material present, and may have a selective effect on the
relative abundance of microbial species present. However, no studies have
quantified either of these effects.
    It has been noted that when control measures are applied against some
species of animal in water distribution systems, the composition of the pipe
fauna changes and other species increase. It is not known what effect such
changes have on the composition of the biofilms.
110                             Safe Piped Water

6.3.4 Association between animals and pathogens
In natural waters, bacteria are present in the gut of various invertebrates and on
their surfaces. This has led to speculation that, if the same were true of
invertebrates in water supplies, this may be of sanitary significance. The
microorganisms present in the guts of the invertebrates are likely to reflect those
in the sediments and biofilms where they are feeding. In distribution systems
carrying treated water, these would not normally be expected to include
significant numbers of pathogens, and there is no reason to suppose that
pathogens would be selectively favoured.
   Viruses and parasites require specific hosts, and pathogenic bacteria
generally require higher temperatures for multiplication than those found in
water mains, at least in temperate countries. In the tropics, the situation may be
different. Temperatures may be high enough to allow the proliferation of
organisms such as Legionella, which multiplies above about 20°C. Legionella,
which is infective through inhalation, has been isolated from protozoa (Lee &
West, 1991); the possibility that it may also survive in macroinvertebrates
cannot be discounted.
   Among the few studies of the microflora associated with animals from water
supplies, Levy, Hart and Cheetham (1986) took amphipods, insect larvae and
copepods from samples from a distribution system in the USA. These animals
were homogenised and the microflora studied. No enteric pathogens or
coliforms were isolated in spite of the presence of coliforms in a service
reservoir in the system. Some species which may be regarded as “opportunist”
pathogens were identified: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Serratia and
Staphylococcus. However, there is no evidence of any association of these
organisms with waterborne gastrointestinal infection for the population at large
(WHO 2003). Lupi, Ricci and Burrini (1995) examined the microflora of the
guts of nematodes taken from a treated water supply and from the raw water
from which it was derived. They found Enterobacteriaceae in the nematodes
from both situations, although these bacteria were of nonpathogenic genera. Far
fewer bacteria were found in the nematodes from the treated water.

6.3.5 Protection from disinfection
A few studies have suggested that invertebrates could harbour microorganisms
in their gut and protect them from disinfection. Chang et al. (1960) conducted
laboratory experiments using two species of nematode isolated from potable
water in the USA and exposed to suspensions of microorganisms. They
demonstrated that the nematodes would ingest Salmonella and Shigella bacteria,
and coxsackie and echo viruses. A small proportion (around 1%) of these
microorganisms survived in the gut of the nematodes for 48 hours. The
nematodes were shown to be highly resistant to chlorination, and viable
                                  Small animals                               111

microorganisms were isolated from the gut after the nematodes were subject to
chlorination. Chang et al. (1960) did not demonstrate the excretion of viable
pathogens, but Smerda, Jensen and Anderson (1971) showed that viable
Salmonella might be excreted by a nematode.
   Levy et al. (1984) exposed amphipods to suspensions of Escherichia coli and
Enterobacter cloacae, subjected them to chlorination (1 mg/l for 60 minutes),
homogenized the animals and determined the count of viable bacteria. Viability
of the bacteria in or on the amphipods was reduced to about 2% (E. coli) and
15% (Enterobacter cloacae). In contrast, bacteria that had not been in the
presence of the amphipods were reduced to about 1% in 1 minute at this
concentration of chlorine.
   These studies demonstrated the possibility that invertebrates may protect
microorganisms from disinfection, although they did not quantify the risks
involved. It has not been demonstrated that pathogens have actually been
present in a distribution system as a result of such a mechanism.
   Theoretically, this mechanism could occur in the distribution system,
although it would present a significant risk only if pathogens were already
present in the distribution system and were protected from the levels of
disinfectant carried through distribution. The microorganisms most likely to be
protected in this way are those present in biofilms and sediments, which
themselves offer protection from disinfection. It could be argued that grazing
animals allow more effective penetration of disinfectant, by reducing the
amount of organic matter present in biofilms and sediments. However, this
theoretical possibility should not detract from the general objective of
minimizing the formation of deposits and biofilms in the distribution system by
appropriate treatment (Chapter 2) and routine maintenance (Chapter 4).
   Another possibility raised by these studies is that some invertebrates could
harbour microorganisms in water-treatment works, protect them from
disinfection and carry them through treatment into the distribution system. This
hazard only applies to the small numbers of animals passing treatment and not
to the populations breeding in the distribution system. It represents a possible
mechanism by which pathogens may be transported from a situation in which
they may be relatively abundant (i.e. polluted raw water) to one in which
otherwise they would be absent or rare (i.e. the treated water). Thus, the animals
that warrant closer attention are likely to be those that appear to pass treatment
more readily, such as chironomid larvae and nematodes. Again this risk is
purely hypothetical and has not been observed in a piped-water supply system.

6.4 REMEDIAL MEASURES
6.4.1 Range of methods
The methods available for controlling existing infestations of animals in water
mains include physical methods (essentially the mains cleaning techniques
referred to in Chapter 4) and some chemical methods. The physical methods
have the advantage of removing the sediments that provide habitat and food
supply for animals, as well as the animals themselves. Effective application of
the chemical methods also involves flushing. The most important of the
chemical agents are pyrethroids, which are effective against a range of
arthropods, including chironomid larvae and Asellus. Any chemical agent
should be specifically approved for use in drinking-water (see WHO, 2004)
Long-term control measures are recommended to restrict the potential for the
growth of animal populations.
   Regular monitoring of populations of animals in the distribution system,
using the methods outlined in Section 6.2.2, will provide information on their
relative abundance in different parts of the system and on changes in their
numbers. This allows control measures to be taken pre-emptively in a planned
manner at a time chosen by the water supplier, before numbers become high
enough to cause major problems.
   The choice of method adopted to control a particular infestation will depend
on the species of animal present, whether consumers will tolerate them, their
ease of removal and the numbers present. In general, species that move freely in
the water or on the surface of the pipe or deposits (e.g. Cyclops) are relatively
easily removed by flushing; whereas, those that burrow in deposits (e.g.
nematodes, chironomid larvae) require action that is more stringent. Species that
cling to the pipe surface (e.g. Asellus, aquatic gastropod snails) require
dislodging before they can be flushed from the main.
   Most of the methods involve the use of flowing water; they should be applied
working systematically ‘downstream’, starting at the treatment works if
practicable. No main that has been treated or is being treated should receive
water from an untreated main. This is important to reduce recolonisation of
cleaned mains; it requires accurate mains records and invariably involves
several valving operations. For the methods to be effective, and to avoid
unwanted side-effects, it is important that work is planned carefully and carried
out thoroughly (see Section 4.4).

6.4.2 Physical methods
Systematic unidirectional flushing
Systematic flushing (see Section 4.4.2) removes most freely swimming animals,
provided that adequate flows are available. In smooth pipes, it will also remove
                                  Small animals                                 113

loose deposits and animals burrowing within them, but higher flows are required
to achieve good results. Although most animals are of relatively low density, the
pipe deposits often have a specific gravity of up to three; flows suitable for their
removal should be used wherever possible. The solid particles transported by the
water move more slowly than the water itself, so at least twice the nominal
volume of water in the section of main should be flushed.

Swabbing
Swabbing (see Section 4.4.3) may be used where only moderate flows are
available; it is generally effective at removing loose deposits and burrowing
animals, and can also remove lightly attached organisms such as aquatic
gastropod snails. However, swabbing is not very effective in badly encrusted
mains.

Air scouring
Air scouring (see Section 4.4.4) may be used where only moderate pressures are
available; it will effectively remove virtually all loose deposits and attached
animals. It is less affected by encrustation on the pipe walls than foam
swabbing. However, air scouring is normally restricted to mains up to 200 mm
in diameter, and it may exacerbate corrosion in corroding iron mains.

6.4.3 Chemical methods
Chlorine
The concentrations of chlorine or chloramines normally found in water leaving
treatment works, and that would be acceptable to consumers, are not very
effective against most of the animals found in distribution systems. There is
evidence that the higher concentrations that may be applied during water
treatment have some effect in reducing animal penetration through treatment
(Evins & Greaves, 1979). The oligochaete worms (e.g. Nais) are susceptible to
moderate concentrations of chlorine; free chlorine concentrations raised to 0.5–
1 mg/l, carried through the distribution system, have been used for control
(Sands, 1969). Occasionally, very high concentrations of chlorine or
chloramines have been used to counter particular problems after disconnecting
consumers. For example, 12 mg/l chlorine has been used to kill leeches in a
small isolated section of distribution system (Smalls & Greaves, 1968) and
about 70 mg/l of chloramines has been used to kill chironomid larvae in
temporarily isolated tanks (Broza et al., 1998).
114                             Safe Piped Water

Pyrethroids
Natural pyrethrins and a synthetic analogue, permethrin, have been used very
successfully to control Asellus, other crustaceans such as Gammarus, and
chironomid larvae (Burfield & Williams, 1975; Abram, Evans & Hobson, 1980;
Mitcham & Shelley, 1980; Crowther and Smith, 1982). Although permethrin is
chemically distinct from pyrethrins, it shares a number of properties that are
important in its use for controlling animals in water mains. Among these are a
very wide margin between the concentration that is effective in killing a range
of aquatic animals, and the concentration that is toxic when drunk by mammals.
For both substances the dose commonly used is 10 µg/l, which has not been
considered a risk to consumers (Abram, Evans & Hobson, 1980; Fawell, 1987).
The WHO guideline value for permethrin in drinking-water is 20 µg/l in the
third edition of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2004).
Because this value does not represent a significant risk to consumers over
protracted periods of exposure, there is a significant margin of safety in
comparison to the short periods for which permethrin may be present in
drinking-water due to its occasional addition for control of animals. However, it
is important that the dosing exercise is carefully controlled and monitored.
    As the concentration effective for controlling animals in water mains is
highly toxic to fish, it should not be discharged to watercourses, and warnings
should be issued to those who may be affected (e.g. aquaculture, fisheries,
aquaria). In some countries, the addition of pesticides to drinking-water is now
prohibited and this precludes the use of pyrethrins or permethrin. In countries
where the use of these chemicals is permitted, a decision to use them should
take into account the seriousness of the infestation to be controlled and the
available capacity to plan, control and monitor the operation. A carefully
controlled and monitored application of these pesticides makes intensive use of
technically qualified staff, and causes appreciable disruption to the system.
Thus, it is only likely to be worthwhile to combat serious infestations. Note that
these compounds are not included on the list of pesticides recommended by the
WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) for application to drinking-
water sources for control of mosquito larvae for public health purposes (i.e. to
control the disease vector).1
    The preferred method of application is to treat an area that is small enough to
allow systematic unidirectional flushing to be carried out in about 24 hours. The
area should be separated from adjacent areas by closed valves to prevent
reinfestation from untreated areas. Metered districts generally provide a
convenient area, with adjacent areas treated subsequently. Consumers are not

usually disconnected. The pesticide solution is injected into a main under
pressure at a rate proportional to the water flow. This ensures that, initially, all
water flowing into the area being treated is at the target concentration, typically
10 µg/l. The network served from the point of injection is subject to systematic
unidirectional flushing to draw the pesticide through the whole system. Twice
the calculated volume in each length of main should be flushed. The pesticide
tends to leave solution very readily (because of adsorption onto pipe surfaces
and deposits); thus, some loss is to be expected as the water flows through the
distribution system. It is advisable to monitor the concentrations reaching
various points in the network during the dosing exercise. After allowing 24
hours contact, the dosing is discontinued and the systematic unidirectional
flushing exercise is repeated to remove dead or moribund animals, and to draw
fresh water into the system.

Other substances
In the past, some workers have suggested the use of copper for the control of
animals in water mains, including Asellus and Nais, but its use has not found
favour because it may promote corrosion of iron mains.

6.4.4 Measures suitable for different groups of animals
Isopoda
Isopoda are commonly known as ‘slaters’. One example is Asellus aquaticus,
which may be up to 15 mm long, so is obvious to consumers. It adapts readily to
conditions in water mains and clings tenaciously to pipe walls. In a survey by
van Lieverloo (1997) in the Netherlands, it comprised about 80% of the biomass
of animals flushed from hydrants. Most complaints are received when the adult
organisms die following reproduction in spring; at other times, large numbers
may be present in the pipes without causing complaints. Collingwood (1964)
suggested that the best season for control is in spring, immediately before the
peak in reproduction. Asellus is controlled most effectively by dosing with
pyrethrins or permethrin, accompanied by unidirectional systematic flushing of
twice the pipe volume (see Section 6.4.3). Smaller crustaceans such as Cyclops
and chydorids often increase after removal of Asellus using pyrethroids (Smalls,
1965). Both foam swabbing and air scouring may achieve moderately good
removal of Asellus in favourable circumstances: they may also remove more
sediments and thus inhibit reinfestation by other species.

Amphipoda
Amphipoda are freshwater shrimps; for example, Gammarus. Gammarus are up
to about 15 mm long, so are obvious to consumers. Although they may be
116                             Safe Piped Water

widespread, they seem not to increase to the densities shown by Asellus. They
swim and are more easily removed by physical methods such as flushing and
swabbing than Asellus. They are also susceptible to pyrethroids.

Insecta
Insecta are wormlike organisms; for example, the larvae of chironomids. Some
species may be up to 25 mm long and bright red so are obvious to consumers,
but most are much less conspicuous. Most species are unable to complete their
life-cycle in the distribution system. They are controlled by systematic flushing
or swabbing, depending on the flows available. Attention should be given to
penetration of larvae through treatment works, access of adults to treatment
works and ingress of adults through openings in service reservoirs. For those
species that can complete their life-cycle in the distribution system, infestations
can be successfully controlled using pyrethrins (Burfield & Williams, 1975) and
permethrin (Mitcham and Shelley, 1980), where the use of these chemicals is
permitted.

Oligochaeta (true worms) e.g. Nais
Worm species common in water mains are small and slender (typically up to
7 mm long and 0.3 mm wide), but may be noticed when they swim. Other
aquatic species may be somewhat larger. They can be controlled by
unidirectional systematic flushing, swabbing or air scouring, with the free
chlorine concentration raised to 0.5 mg/l throughout the distribution system for
a few weeks. The maintenance of a residual of 0.2 mg/l or more is likely to
prevent reinfestation.

Nematoda
Nematoda, commonly known as roundworms, are plant parasites, animal
parasites or free-living organisms that feed on organic matter. Most, but not all,
are invisible to the naked eye. Those found in water mains are not easy to
identify but are thought to be mainly small free-living aquatic species, thriving
in locations that are rich in organic detritus. They can be controlled by flushing,
swabbing or air scouring.

Gastropoda (aquatic snails)
Many of the gastropoda (aquatic snails) that are prevalent in water pipes are
small (e.g. 5 mm long), although some are appreciably larger. They cling to pipe
walls, so are not effectively removed by flushing. Foam swabbing is effective in
pipes that are not badly encrusted. Although specific molluscicides are available
for agricultural use, none are known to be suitable for use in potable water
supplies.

Smaller crustacea
Smaller crustacea include species such as Cyclops and Chydorus. The Cyclops
that are common in water mains are mostly about 1.5–2 mm long, although
some are larger. They may be noticed by consumers because they dart jerkily
through the water. The chydorids are less than 1 mm long, and are not noticed
individually by consumers. However, they may occur in very large numbers,
and cast their carapaces frequently. These may become iron stained and be seen
by consumers as discoloured water. In general, these crustacea can be controlled
by systematic flushing if flows are adequate, or by swabbing or air scouring.

6.4.5 Long-term control measures
Long-term control measures are recommended to prevent animals reaching
nuisance levels or, following disinfestation, to prevent recurrence of problems.
The principal objective is to deny the animals a food supply and to restrict their
entry into the distribution system.

Removal of particulate organic matter at treatment works
Probably the single most important step in limiting animal populations in mains
is to minimize the quantity of particulate organic matter entering the distribution
system. Many algae are suitable as food for filter feeding animals, and they
comprise the bulk of particulate organic matter in water derived from
impounded surface sources. Different treatment processes are best suited to
removing different types of algae: the processes should be selected and
optimized to take account of the types of algae present.

Removal of assimilable organic matter at treatment works
Assimilable organic material may contribute to the growth of microorganisms,
and thus indirectly to the growth of animals. Processes should be selected and
operated to minimize the quantity of assimilable organic matter leaving the
works, as discussed in Section 2.3.3.

Removal of animals at treatment works
Virtually all works treating surface waters allow the passage of some animals,
although the numbers may be very small when compared with those in the raw
water, and do not account for the numbers found in distribution. In general,
coagulation and sedimentation are not effective at removing animals. Slow sand
filtration appears to give better removal than rapid gravity filtration. Planktonic
species, which predominate in stored waters, are relatively easily removed by
treatment and do not thrive in the distribution system. Benthic species, which
account for a greater proportion of the raw water community in river waters, are
118                             Safe Piped Water

more likely to pass treatment, and in turn are more likely to thrive in the
distribution system. Organisms that are able to burrow in particulate media, such
as chironomid larvae, nematodes and oligochaete worms, seem well adapted to
penetrate treatment, and significant numbers of chironomids have been found at
all stages of treatment.
    It is unusual for animal removal to be made a specific objective in the
management of treatment works. Nevertheless, attention to such things as the
effectiveness of backwashing is likely to be beneficial in this respect. In rapid
sand filters, particular care should be taken to eliminate “dead spots” where the
sand bed is not effectively fluidised. Prechlorination has been shown to help the
removal of animals: this benefit should be balanced against other considerations,
such as formation of disinfection by-products.

Measures taken in the distribution system
Certain “good housekeeping” practices carried out in the distribution system
will limit the potential for animal infestations. Service reservoirs should be
covered. Ventilators on these reservoirs should be covered with 0.5 mm mesh to
exclude flying insects, overflows should be fitted with nonreturn valves and
inspection covers should be tightly fitting. Unused dead end mains should be
eliminated where practicable, and the size of mains should be appropriate for the
flows to be carried because slow-flowing water is conducive to precipitation of
solids and to animal growth. Hygienic precautions should be taken when
repairing mains. Water pressure should be maintained to discourage ingress and
contamination. Mains and service reservoirs should be routinely cleaned to
remove particulate matter.


6.5 SUMMARY
Any supply of water containing visible living animals or animal debris will
discourage consumption and encourage the use of alternative supplies that may
have a better appearance but may be less safe. Thus, for reasons of public
health, it is important to prevent the entry and proliferation of animals in water
distribution networks.
   Regular monitoring of the populations of animals in distribution systems
allows control measures to be applied pre-emptively. A number of measures are
available for limiting the populations of animals in water distribution systems.
Short-term measures are mostly based on methods for cleaning solid material
from the pipes. Some chemical methods are also available; however, there are
restrictions on the use of these in some countries. Their use should be carefully
controlled and monitored, and this requires intensive use of technically qualified
staff. Long-term measures are mostly based on limiting the quantity of organic
matter entering the distribution system and prevention of entry.

   A small number of studies have demonstrated the possibility that
invertebrates may protect microorganisms from disinfection. Within a
distribution system carrying well-treated water, the risk of a significant number
of pathogens being protected in this way is thought to be extremely small. The
risk posed by invertebrates protecting microorganisms from disinfection during
their passage through water treatment works is also likely to be very small. This
mechanism is relatively unstudied and little understood.

Risk management for distribution
systems

7.1 INTRODUCTION
The safety of drinking-water depends on a number of factors, including quality
of source water, effectiveness of treatment and integrity of the distribution
system that transports the water to consumers. At every stage in the production
and delivery of drinking-water, hazards can potentially compromise the quality
of the water. Piped distribution systems may be less vulnerable to contamination
than open surface-water catchments; however, if piped systems become
contaminated, there may be no treatment processes to reduce risks from the
introduced hazards.
   The previous chapters have reviewed knowledge about the presence, growth
and significance of microorganisms in piped networks. They have also

Systems. Edited by Richard Ainsworth. ISBN: 1 84339 039 6. Published by IWA Publishing, London, UK.

described the operating practices of water supply organizations that can directly
or indirectly influence the presence of microorganisms, especially those of
significance to public health. However, this information is of little benefit unless
it is part of a package of working practices designed to manage hazards in the
whole supply system. Identifying, prioritizing and preventing risk arising from
such hazards is the basis of a water safety plan approach. Such an approach is
described in Chapter 4 of the latest edition of the World Health Organization’s
(WHO) Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (WHO, 2004). The remainder of
this chapter demonstrates how control measures for distribution system can fit
within a water safety plan.


7.2 WATER SAFETY PLANS
7.2.1 Elements of a water safety plan
Figure 7.1 describes development of a water safety plan. The objective of the
plan is to supply water of a quality that will allow health-based targets to be
met. The success of the plan is assessed through surveillance. The three central
components of a water safety plan are:
• system assessment, which involves assessing the capability of the drinking-
    water supply chain (up to the point of consumption) to deliver water of a
    quality that meets the identified targets, and assessing design criteria for
    new systems
• identification of control measures in a drinking-water system that will
    collectively control identified risks and ensure that health-based targets are
    met (for each control measure identified, an appropriate means of
    monitoring should be defined that will ensure that any deviation from
    required performance is rapidly detected in a timely manner)
• management plans that describe actions to be taken during normal operation
    or extreme and incident conditions, and that document system assessment
    (including upgrade and improvement), monitoring, communication plans
    and supporting programmes.

7.3 WATER SAFETY PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION
    SYSTEMS
In general, water entering a drinking-water distribution system should be safe to
drink, without additional treatment, once it has reached the first consumer
connection. Therefore, the management of distribution systems primarily
involves maintaining water quality, and minimizing the risk of contamination
and deterioration of quality during transport. However, many distribution
systems are a complex array of pipes, pumps, tanks and valves, which means
that risks are not always as easily identified as in other areas of drinking-water
supply.

7.3.1 Assemble team
The first step in developing a water safety plan is to assemble a
multidisciplinary team with an understanding of the specific distribution system,
to describe that system. The team would typically include managers, engineers
(operations, maintenance, design and capital investment), water quality control
staff (microbiologists and chemists) and technical staff involved in day-to-day
operations. All members of the team should have a good knowledge of the
system.

7.3.2 Document and describe the system
The next step is to document and describe the system. The description can
include a basic flow diagram of the drinking-water distribution system, and
reference to maps showing water quality networks and zones. It is important to
capture the elements of the water supply system in sufficient detail to allow
risks to be assessed and control measures to be identified. Therefore, pressure,
pumps, connections, valves (and their status) and tanks need to be considered.
Exmples of important features include:
    • service reservoirs, balancing tanks, booster stations and (when used)
         break-pressure tanks
    • zones of supply from each source
    • layout of primary, secondary and tertiary pipelines (coded by colour or
         numerically)
    • location of major valve boxes and junctions
    • flow within the system (clearly indicated, noting where there are areas
         of interconnection between different zones)
    • numbers of consumer connections
    • hydraulic system flow rates and paths (including two-way flow)
    • connections with high backflow hazard.
                                 Risk management                                 125

   The representation of the system must be conceptually accurate, because the
team will use the diagram as the basis for hazard analysis. If the flow diagram
and system maps are incorrect, the team may miss potentially significant
hazards, and may fail to identify existing or required control measures.
Therefore, the team should validate the completeness and accuracy of the flow
diagram and maps; for example, by visually checking against features observed
on the ground. Proof of validation is typically recorded, together with an
accountability (e.g. a member of the team may sign and date a flowchart and a
set of maps to validate that they are accurate and complete).
   The example given in Box 7.1 (below) illustrates the importance of being
aware of the major components of the distribution system.

7.3.3 Hazard assessment and risk characterization
Managing risks in distribution systems poses different challenges to managing
risks in, for example, a treatment plant. When considering engineered treatment
processes such as filtration and disinfection, the emphasis is on selecting and
controlling processes that will reduce risk to an acceptable level, assuming that
the source water has potentially unacceptable contamination. When considering
distribution systems, the focus is on preventing recontamination or degradation
of water quality caused by breaches in system integrity or difficult operational
circumstances. In both situations, it is useful to determine what contaminants are
of concern (hazard assessment), and how they may reach unacceptable levels
(risk characterization). This makes it easier to identify important potential
contaminants (hazards) and the risk of events occurring that could cause these
hazards to contaminate the system (hazardous events).
    Risk management in distribution systems is similar to that in catchments, in
that the aim is to prevent the introduction of hazards. However, a major
difference is that distribution systems represent the final barrier before
consumption in many supplies, whereas hazards arising in catchments may be
reduced during storage and treatment.
    In risk assessment, it is important to be explicit about the risks that are to be
assessed, in terms of who is at risk, and what they are at risk from. Therefore,
the following questions are helpful as a first step in risk assessment:
     • How is the water to be used and what exposure routes are relevant?
     • What consumer education is in place for water use?
     • How are consumers notified of potential contamination?
     • Who is the water intended for?
     • What special considerations are in place for vulnerable groups such as
          infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised?

Box 7.1. Outbreak of Norwalk virus caused by a cross connection between a municipal
supply and a private supply.
During one week in August 1980, approximately 1500 people from a small
community in the north of the State of Georgia, USA, developed gastroenteritis.
Stool culture was negative for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter. Only
four stool samples were examined by electron microscopy and these were
negative. However, 12 of 19 paired sera showed a fourfold rise in titre of
antibody to norovirus, confirming the diagnosis. A door-to-door survey of
households revealed marked variation in reported attack rates, with the highest
attack rate (68%) in people living close to a textile plant. Epidemiological
investigation also found an association between illness and consumption of tap
water.
   Within the affected area there were two water supplies — a nearby river and
a spring source. There was no relevant illness in people whose water was
supplied from the river source; those who were affected by the outbreak had
received water sourced from the spring
   The spring source, which was chlorinated, was found be satisfactory and the
chlorination plant to be working adequately. There were, however, two known
connections between this municipal water system and a private system
supplying water to a textile plant. The water for the textile plant came from five
wells and two springs in the area. Each source was chlorinated, though the
chlorination equipment was antiquated and inadequate. One of the springs was
contaminated with high counts of total and thermotolerant coliforms, and
storage reservoirs for the textile plant water were grossly contaminated with
algae and pinnate diatoms.
   The water pressure in the municipal system (110 psi) was normally higher
than in the textile plant system (100 psi). However, demands on the municipal
system sometimes reduced the pressure to only 80 psi, which would have
allowed substantial flow of water from the textile plant system to the municipal
system.
   The outbreak illustrates the importance of avoiding cross connections
between systems where the water utility does not have complete control of the
water quality of both systems.

Desktop risk assessment
The next step in risk assessment is to systematically evaluate the system’s
potential vulnerability to external hazards, using the flow diagrams and system
maps. The initial evaluation is desk-based and relies on data supplied by design
and operational staff.
                                Risk management                                 127

   Information that would normally be part of this assessment includes the
following:
    • areas where (possibly seasonal) soil moisture content or flooding makes
        it likely that faecal matter from sources on the surface or shallow
        subsurface will enter the system
    • any other sources of faecal matter found in the urban area (e.g. animal
        husbandry)
    • areas of high population density (used as a surrogate for faecal loading
        in the environment)
    • areas of low pressure within the system
    • areas of intermittent supply and their likely recharging pattern
    • pipe material, age and condition (a vulnerability score can be developed
        based on likely risk of breaks or joint failure)
    • cross-connections, proximity to sewers and high-hazard facilities, and
        the relative depth of water supply pipes and sewers
    • low-lying areas prone to flooding
    • depth to which pipes are buried (this differs from the point above
        concerning sewers, because it relates to the risk of accidental breakage
        by traffic, etc)
    • condition and age of service reservoirs
    • areas where there are significant numbers of illegal connections or
        where the tertiary infrastructure has been installed by nonutility staff
        and quality of construction is uncertain
    • areas where a significant proportion of houses use household storage,
        which may include the attachment of small pumps to the main, for
        pumping to roof tanks
    • areas of known high leakage
    • large buildings, such as hospitals.

   At each step, the objective is to identify how contamination could arise from
the identified hazards, by considering the events that could lead to the presence
of contamination. The output from this exercise is a list of hazardous events,
their associated hazards and a reference to where in the system or process the
risks are located.

Sanitary survey
The above steps provide an overall picture of the distribution system and a
framework for identifying hazardous environments and vulnerability. The next
step is to carry out a field assessment of the system, to identify potential hazards
and hazardous events, and the existence of possible control measures (described
in Section 7.3.4).
128                             Safe Piped Water

   The sanitary survey gathers field evidence to support the risk assessment. It
involves systematic investigation of the complete distribution system, to identify
all major hazards and vulnerable points. The survey deals mainly with the
physical state of infrastructure, focusing primarily on external threats.
   In undertaking a sanitary survey, standard forms can be used for major
structures of the same type, such as service reservoirs, major valve boxes, road
or culvert crossings and distribution infrastructure. Standardized forms for
sanitary surveys and inspections are available (WHO, 1997; Howard, 2002), and
can help to ensure that the importance of different major components of the
system is evaluated, and persistent failures identified.
   Urban piped water supplies can be difficult to survey, because most sanitary
inspections are based on observation. Leaks associated with deep-laid pipes are
often difficult to detect through observation, and contamination may occur a
significant distance from a sample site. However, simple visual and question-
based approaches can still provide useful information about whether risks are at
the level of the general supply or are localized. Thus, questions on the
inspection form should deal both with risks found in the immediate area and
those that relate to broader supply problems. Local risks will include aspects
such as the pooling of stagnant water around the joints between riser pipes and
delivery mains. Tap leakage, pipe exposure and waste allowed to collect around
the tap may be significant causes of contamination. Inspections are required at
service reservoirs because these have the potential to cause widespread
contamination.
   There are difficulties of scale in a comprehensive sanitary inspection of an
entire urban piped water system. The areas to be inspected by field staff should
be broken down into segments that can be easily covered within one day — this
may be a full water supply zone or an acceptable subdivision.
   The importance of having an understanding of the vulnerability of a
distribution system is illustrated by the example given in Box 7.2 (below).

Prioritizing risks
In large and complex systems, so many risks may be identified that it is difficult
to set priorities. Simple matrices for risk assessment typically combine technical
information from guidelines, scientific literature and industry practice with well-
informed “expert” judgement, supported by third-party peer review or
benchmarking. The risk ranking will be specific for any particular water supply
system because each system is unique.

Box 7.2 Cryptosporidiosis associated with contamination of a water conduit.
During August and September 2000, there were 168 laboratory confirmed case of
cryptosporidiosis in residents of Belfast. Of these cases, 117 lived within the area
supplied by a single water conduit. This drinking-water conduit had been built 110
years earlier. It was seven miles long and supplied drinking-water to some 216 000
people. The water passing through the conduit came from a water treatment works and
was not further treated before being supplied to a number of distribution reservoirs and
then consumers.
   Initial sampling of the water was negative for Cryptosporidium oocysts, although
several large-volume samples taken from the service reservoirs were positive, with
counts of up to 2.2 oocysts per 10 litres. To further investigate the integrity of the
conduit, chlorination was turned off at the water treatment works and samples for total
coliforms and E. coli taken at various points of the conduit through pre-existing
airwells. Counts of total coliforms and E. coli increased substantially between two
sampling points. Close-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were put into the conduit
between these points. CCTV demonstrated black staining of the roof of the conduit,
which was subsequently shown to coincide with the location of a private septic tank.
On further inspection it was found that the outer brick wall of the conduit had been
removed to enable the outflow of the septic tank to be constructed. Consequently, the
overflow from the septic tank could contaminate the drinking-water distribution
system after the treatment stage.

    By using a semiquantitative risk assessment, the water safety plan team can
calculate a priority score for each hazardous event identified. The objective is to focus
on the most significant hazards and hazardous events, to begin to identify what might
be the most important control measures (Section 7.3.4). Several approaches to ranking
risk are available, and the team needs to determine which approach it will use. An
example of an approach is given in Table 7.1, where the risk score for a particular
hazardous event is determined by combining the likelihood of its occurrence with the
severity of the consequences.
    Table 7.2 gives examples of descriptors that coulc be used to rate the
likelihood and severity for calculation of the risk score; other descriptors might
be more appropriate in some situations.
    In developing a water safety plan, it is possible to adopt an approach of
continuous improvement, taking more risks into consideration at each iteration
of the plan. To do this, the team needs to determine a cut-off point to distinguish
between hazards that require immediate attention and those that can be
considered in future iterations.

7.3.4 Control measures
In the context of a water safety plan, a control measure is any action or activity
that can be used to prevent or eliminate a hazard, or reduce it to an acceptable
level. Therefore, any risk management activity in a drinking-water supply is
considered to be a control measure. Examples of control measures in water
distribution are positive pressure, intact pipe networks, backflow preventers and
vermin proofing on tanks.
   Control measures are identified by considering the events that can cause
contamination of water, both directly and indirectly, and the activities that can
mitigate the risks from those events. Examples of control measures in the
distribution system include:
    • maintenance of the distribution system
                                 Risk management                                 131

   •    availability of backup systems (e.g. power supply)
   •    maintenance of an adequate disinfectant residual
   •    presence of devices to prevent cross-connection and backflow
   •    use of fully enclosed distribution system and storages
   •    maintenance of a disinfection residual
   •    appropriate repair procedures, including disinfection of water mains after
        repairs
   •    maintenance of adequate system pressure
   •    maintenance of security to prevent sabotage, illegal tapping and tampering.

   In identifying control measures, operational criteria to differentiate acceptable
from unacceptable performance are required. These criteria, referred to as
“operational limits”, are control measure variables that can be measured (either
directly or indirectly) or factors that can be observed. Examples of measurable
variables include minimum and maximum values for pH, chlorine residuals or
hydraulic system pressure at strategic locations in the distribution system; an
example of a factor that can be observed is the apparent integrity of vermin-proofing
screens on reservoirs. Current knowledge and expertise (including industry
standards and technical data), and locally derived historical data can be used as a
guide when determining the limits. Ideally, operational limits have the following
properties:
    • they can be defined and monitored (either directly, or indirectly through
         surrogates)
    • a predetermined response (i.e. a corrective action, described in
         Section 7.3.5) can be implemented when monitoring indicates that
         conditions have deviated from set limits
    • the corrective action will protect water safety by either bringing the control
         measure back within acceptable limits or causing additional control
         measures to be implemented
    • the process of detecting deviation from limits and of responding will be
         sufficiently rapid to maintain water safety.

   Control measures that cannot be defined, but meet the other requirements listed
above, can still be important and can form part of the water safety plan.

7.3.5 Monitoring to support risk management
There are three kinds of monitoring in the management of distribution systems —
operational, process validation and verification — each of which has a different
purpose, as shown in Table 7.3. This section considers operational monitoring;
Section 7.3.6 looks at monitoring for process validation and verification.
132                                  Safe Piped Water

Table 7.3. Types of monitoring in the management of distribution systems
  Monitoring type                                      Purpose

  Operational          Support management of the operation of the system, to ensure safety
                       and to ensure that control measures are working effectively

  Process validation   Demonstrate that control measures are capable of achieving the
                       required outcomes

  Verification         A final check that the entire water supply system is functioning
                       correctly


Operational monitoring and selection of operational control
parameters
Operational monitoring involves conducting a planned sequence of observations
or measurements, designed to assess whether the control measures applied at a
point in the system are achieving their objectives. Effective monitoring relies on
establishing what will be monitored, how, when and by whom. In most cases,
routine operational monitoring will be based on simple surrogate observations or
tests, such as turbidity or structural integrity, rather than complex microbial or
chemical tests (which are likely to form part of process validation and verification,
Section 7.3.6).
    An essential requirement of operational monitoring is the ability to assess
performance of the system in a timely manner, and judge whether a control
measure is functioning properly. Microbial parameters (e.g. indicator bacteria) are
of limited use for this purpose, because the time taken to process and analyse
water samples is too slow (although changes in heterotrophic plate counts can be
used to monitor the effectiveness of control measures for limiting biofilm activity
or maintaining system integrity). Generally, operational monitoring for control
measures such as pressure and levels can be online and in real time, although this
is not always essential.
    If monitoring shows that an operational or critical limit has been exceeded,
then there is the potential for water to be, or to become, unsafe. The objective is to
monitor control measures according to a statistically valid sampling plan and in a
timely manner, to prevent the supply of any potentially unsafe water. A permanent
record of monitoring should be maintained. For example, if chlorine disinfection
is being used as a control measure for a distribution system, the parameters
monitored could be chlorine residuals, established for the given system at
particular set points (generally in parts per million, ppm). A range of values would
be included, again calculated for the system, outside of which an alarm would be
set to sound via a telemetry system. Since pH and turbidity are integral to chlorine
efficacy, these parameters might also be monitored. Should the telemetry system
                                   Risk management                                   133

show that the disinfection control measure was not within acceptable bounds, a
pager system could be used to alert water quality personnel. These staff would
then take predetermined corrective actions to investigate the deviation and bring
the water back into specification, as discussed in the next section.

Establish corrective action for deviations that may occur
A corrective action is the action to be taken when the results of monitoring at a
control point indicate a loss of control. For example, the ability to change
temporarily to alternative water sources is one of the most useful corrective
actions, although this option is not always available. Corrective actions should be
specific and predetermined where possible, so that they can be employed rapidly.
To allow for unforeseen events for which there may be no predetermined
corrective action, a general incident and emergency response plan should be
developed, to at least set up a response framework. By ensuring that a contingency
is available in the event of an operational limit being exceeded, safety of supply
can be maintained.
   The following are examples of possible corrective actions that could be taken when
online monitoring of chlorine disinfection fails to comply with operational limits (all of
these corrective actions would include action from the on-call or designated water
quality personnel):
    • ensure that the telemetry system is working and that the alarm is not false
    • review or adjust the range of chlorine residuals, and increase the chlorine
         dosing level if necessary
    • flush any undisinfected water from the main
    • make any necessary repairs or operational control changes.

   Communication is a crucial component of corrective actions. Therefore, a
procedure for notifying sensitive customers (e.g. hospitals) and authorities (e.g. health
departments) should be included in corrective actions. For example, it may be
necessary to have an understanding with a local bottled water company, to ensure that
residential customers at least receive drinking water in the event of a distribution
system failure.

7.3.6 Verification
Verification is the final check of water safety. It provides an objective confirmation of
the overall safety of the system. For example, biophysical verification activities, such
as microbial and chemical monitoring, are likely to be undertaken in the distribution
system. Verification also encompasses audit and review of the water safety plan,
including checking compliance with operational procedures.
134                                   Safe Piped Water

   Verification monitoring involves using methods, procedures or tests, in addition to,
and independent of, those used in operational monitoring, to determine whether the
water safety plan:
   • complies with the stated objectives outlined in the water quality targets
   • needs modification and revalidation
   • is controlling the identified hazard.

    Verification monitoring may be less frequent than operational monitoring. For
example, operational monitoring might be online (and thus continuous) through a
telemetry system, whereas verification monitoring of distribution storage tanks and
reservoirs might be carried out fortnightly.
    Bacterial indicators, such as E. coli, are the indicator most frequently used for final
verification of microbiological quality. Although microbial monitoring can be used in
verification as a final check, end-point testing should not be relied on for operational
control because, by the time samples have been processed and analysed, water will
already have been treated and delivered to consumers.
    Auditing of compliance with the water safety plan is another form of verification.
The objective is to assess the extent to which the plan is being followed in practice.
Auditing may involve both internal and external auditors, and may include review of
important activities related to water safety, such as compliance with operational
procedures, adoption of training plans and timely calibration of equipment. An
example of a verification schedule is given in Table 7.4.

                 according to
                 maintenance
                 schedules



Process validation
Process validation involves obtaining evidence that the elements of the water safety
plan will be effective. An example of such validation is the provision of objective
evidence that a control measure, operating within its operational limits, will control the
relevant hazard. Validation can be based on a variety of sources, including the
scientific literature, trade associations, regulation and legislation, historical data,
professional bodies and suppliers.
                                   Risk management                                    135

   System-specific validation is essential, because variations in water or system design
may have a large impact on the efficacy of certain control measures. Thus, a control
measure that works in one distribution system may be less effective in another type of
distribution system. Examples of process validation are:
    • modelling of flow paths in storage tanks to validate the extent of mixing
    • measurement of conditions for effective disinfection in storage tanks
    • measurement of microbial parameters, such as heterotrophic bacteria and
          coliforms (in this situation, the lag time for return of results from culture-
          based methods can be tolerated, because this type of monitoring is not used to
          support the day-to-day management of water safety).

   The water safety plan should be reviewed at predetermined periods to incorporate
new information as it becomes available, and to ensure that the plan is still capable of
controlling the identified hazards.

7.3.7 Supporting programmes and management procedures
The delivery of safe water through a water safety plan involves managing people and
processes. Therefore, adequate supporting programmes, such as training, supplier
quality assurance and good hygiene practices, are an important part of the plan.
Supporting programmes are activities that are essential for effective operation of
control measures and that indirectly support water safety. Actions required to operate
the system according to the water safety plan need to be captured in the form of
management procedures, such as standard operating procedures. Management
procedures should be developed for both routine and incident and emergency
conditions.

7.3.8 Documentation
Records are essential for reviewing the adequacy and implementation of the water
safety plan. Four types of records can be kept:
    • support documentation for development of the water safety plan
    • records generated by the water safety plan system
    • documentation of methods and procedures used
    • records of employee training programmes.

   Records demonstrating adherence to the water safety plan are needed to support the
verification auditing activities. In the short term, tracking of records allows an operator
or manager to become aware that a process is approaching its operational limits, and
review of records can help to identify trends so that operational adjustments can be
made. In the long term, periodical review of records allows trends to be noted, so that
136                                   Safe Piped Water

appropriate actions can be determined and implemented, to ensure continual
improvement.
   Documentation is an essential part of following the water safety plan; it is also a
powerful way of demonstrating that all due diligence and reasonable precautions have
been taken by the utility, because the information is readily available, readily trackable
and transparent.


7.5 SUMMARY OF WATER SAFETY PLAN CONTENT
Table 7.5 summarises the suitable content of a water safety plan, with the elements
categorised as “must contain”, “should contain” or “may contain”.
