                           Edition))

§ R18-4-212. Groundwater under the Direct Influence of Surface
Water

A. The Department suspects the following sources to be groundwater under
the direct influence of surface water:

1. A spring;

2. An infiltration gallery;

3. A radial well collector, Ranney well, or horizontal well;

4. A well that is less than 500 feet from a surface water, and:

a. The Department conducts a vulnerability assessment and determines that
the source is vulnerable to direct surface water influence, or

b. The Department cannot assess the vulnerability of the groundwater
source to direct surface water influence because of a lack of information or
the uncertainty of available information on the local hydrogeology or well
construction characteristics;

5. A shallow well with perforations or well screens that are less than 50 feet
below the ground surface;

6. A hand-dug or auger-bored well without a casing;

7. A groundwater source for which turbidity data is available that shows that
the groundwater violates an interim MCL for turbidity;

8. A groundwater source for which data is available that shows that total
coliform, fecal coliform, or E. Coli are present in untreated groundwater
from the source that are not related to new well development, source
modification, repair, or maintenance; and

9. Any groundwater source if the temperature of the groundwater fluctuates
15% to 20% from the mean groundwater temperature over the course of a
year or if changes in the temperature of the groundwater correlate to similar
changes in the temperature of surface water.

B. The Department shall conduct a sanitary survey of each public water
system that the Department suspects is using a groundwater source under
the direct influence of surface water.

C. The Department shall provide written notice to a public water system that
the Department suspects a groundwater source is under the direct influence
of surface water. A public water system may submit information to the
   Ariz. Admin. Code R18-4-212 Groundwater under the Direct
 Influence of Surface Water (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                           Edition))

Department to show that a groundwater source is not under the direct
influence of surface water. Information that is submitted to show that a
suspect groundwater source is not under the direct influence of surface
water shall be in writing and shall be prepared by a qualified professional,
such as a professional engineer registered in Arizona, registered geologist,
water system operator, or hydrogeologist. The Department shall review any
information submitted by a qualified professional to show a suspect
groundwater source is not under the direct influence of surface water within
90 days after receipt of the information and determine if the source remains
suspect.

D. If a groundwater source continues to be suspect after the analyses
required in subsections (A) through (C), the Department may require a
public water system that is suspected of using a groundwater source that is
under the direct influence of surface water to conduct Microscopic Particle
Analysis (MPA) monitoring of the groundwater source. A public water
system may request that the Department allow the system to use an
alternative method to determine whether a groundwater source is under the
direct influence of surface water. An alternative method to determine
whether a groundwater source is under the direct influence of surface water
shall be approved by the Arizona Department of Health Services under 9
A.A.C. 14, Article 6.

E. A public water system shall conduct MPA monitoring as follows:

1. Each sample shall be representative of the groundwater source. A public
water system shall not take a sample of blended water or a sample of water
from the distribution system.

2. Each sample shall be collected and analyzed according to the procedures
prescribed in the "Consensus Method for Determining Groundwaters Under
the Direct Influence of Surface Water Using Microscopic Particulate
Analysis (MPA), " EPA 910/9-92-029, United States Environmental
Protection Agency, Environmental Services Division, Manchester
Environmental Laboratory, 7411 Beach Dr. E., Port Orchard, WA 98366,
October 1992 (and no future editions or amendments), which is
incorporated by reference and on file with the Department.

3. The Department shall schedule MPA monitoring at a time when the
groundwater source is most susceptible to direct surface water influence.

4. The Department shall use the MPA risk ratings in Table 1 to determine
whether groundwater is under the direct influence of surface water.
   Ariz. Admin. Code R18-4-212 Groundwater under the Direct
 Influence of Surface Water (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                           Edition))

a. If the MPA risk rating of the initial sample indicates a high or moderate
risk of direct surface water influence, the public water system shall collect a
second sample for MPA at the same location on a date scheduled by the
Department. If the MPA risk rating of the second sample indicates a high or
moderate risk of direct surface water influence, the Department shall
determine that the groundwater is under the direct influence of surface
water. If the risk rating of the second sample indicates a low risk of direct
surface water influence, the public water system shall collect a third sample
for MPA at the same location on a date scheduled by the Department. If a
third sample is taken, the Department shall determine whether the
groundwater is under the direct influence of surface water under subsection
(E)(4)(c).

b. If the MPA risk rating of the initial sample indicates a low risk of direct
surface water influence, the public water system shall collect a second
sample for MPA at the same location on a date scheduled by the
Department. If the MPA risk rating of the second sample indicates a low risk
of direct surface water influence, the Department shall determine that the
groundwater is not under the direct influence of surface water. If the MPA
risk rating of the second sample indicates a high or moderate risk of direct
surface water influence, the public water system shall collect a third sample
for MPA at the same location on a date scheduled by the Department. If a
third sample is taken, the Department shall determine whether the
groundwater is under the direct influence of surface water under subsection
(E)(4)(c).

c. If a third sample is required and the MPA risk rating of the third sample
indicates a high or moderate risk of direct surface water influence, the
Department shall determine that the groundwater is under the direct
influence of surface water. If the MPA risk rating of the third sample
indicates a low risk of direct surface water influence, the Department shall
determine that the groundwater is not under the direct influence of surface
water.

F. If the Department determines a source to be groundwater under the
direct influence of surface water under subsection (E) and a public water
system demonstrates to the Department that it is feasible to take corrective
action to prevent direct surface water influence, the Department shall
establish a schedule of compliance for the public water system to take
corrective action instead of requiring installation of filtration and
disinfection treatment. A schedule of compliance to take corrective action
shall require:

1. Completion of corrective action no later than 18 months after receipt of
the initial MPA monitoring results, and
   Ariz. Admin. Code R18-4-212 Groundwater under the Direct
 Influence of Surface Water (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                           Edition))

2. A second round of MPA monitoring to determine whether the source is
under the direct influence of surface water after completion of the corrective
action.

G. Except as provided in subsection (F), a public water system with a source
that the Department determines to be groundwater under the direct
influence of surface water shall provide filtration and disinfection required
under 40 CFR 141 Subparts H, P, and T, as incorporated by reference in this
Chapter, within 18 months after the date that the Department makes the
final determination that the groundwater is under the direct influence of
surface water.

H. The Department shall provide a written notice to a public water system of
a final determination that a groundwater source is under the direct influence
of surface water. The notice shall contain the information required by A.R.S.
§ 41-1092.03(A).

I. A public water system may appeal a final determination that a
groundwater source is under the direct influence of surface water by serving
notice of appeal with the Department under the Uniform Administrative
Hearing Procedures in A.R.S. Title 41, Chapter 6, Article 10. A public water

C. A public water system that uses bottled water as a condition for receiving
a variance or an exemption shall comply with the following:

1. The public water system shall develop and put in place a monitoring
program approved by the Department that provides reasonable assurances
that the bottled water meets applicable MCLs. The public water system shall
monitor a representative sample of the bottled water to determine
compliance with applicable MCLs during the first three-month period that it
supplies the bottled water to the public and annually thereafter. Results of
the bottled water monitoring program shall be provided to the Department
annually; or

2. The public water system shall receive a certification from the bottled
water company that the bottled water supplied has been taken from an

assistance program. Baseline monitoring does not include increased
monitoring required by this Chapter when the results of baseline monitoring
indicate the presence of a contaminant at a level that requires increased
monitoring by a participating public water system.

B. A contractor shall deliver copies of monitoring analysis results to the
public water system and to the Department.

§ R18-4-304. Fees for the Monitoring Assistance Program

A. The Department shall assess, and a public water system participating in
the monitoring assistance program shall pay, the following annual fees,
subject to adjustments referenced in subsection (B):

1. An annual fee of $250, and

2. A unit fee of $2.57 per meter or service connection.

B. If the monitoring assistance fund has a surplus after execution of the
previous year's contract, any surplus in excess of $200, 000 in any year shall
be used to reduce future fees for public water systems that paid annual fees
in the previous compliance period, in a manner consistent with the program
invoicing system. In the first compliance period that a public water system
participates in the monitoring assistance program, the public water system
shall pay the full amount of annual fees due under this Section, and is not
entitled to a fee reduction resulting from a surplus in the monitoring
assistance fund from a prior compliance period.

C. If a public water system serving 10, 000 or fewer persons at the beginning
of a compliance period increases service during the compliance period so
that the public water system serves more than 10, 000 persons annually, the
public water system may elect to cease participation in the monitoring
assistance program under the following conditions:

1. If the monitoring assistance program has already conducted monitoring
for the public water system during the compliance period, the public water
system shall remain in the monitoring assistance program, and pay annual
fees, for the remainder of the compliance period.

2. If the monitoring assistance program has not conducted monitoring for
the public water system during the compliance period, the public water
system may cease participating in the monitoring assistance program, and if
so, the Department shall refund any monitoring fees paid by the public
water system during the compliance period.

of a public water system participating in the monitoring assistance program.
The owner of the public water system shall pay the invoiced amount to the
Department, at the address listed on the invoice, by the due date indicated
on the invoice.

B. The Department shall make refunds or billing corrections if a public water
system demonstrates an error in the amount billed. The owner of a public
water system shall send a written request for a refund or correction to the
Department, at the address on the invoice, within 90 days of the invoice
date.

C. The Department may verify the number of meters and service
connections of a participating public water system.

D. The Department shall not waive fees prescribed by R18-4-304.

E. The owner of a public water system that fails to pay fees assessed by the
Department in a timely manner shall be subject to the penalties listed in
A.R.S. § 49-354. Failure to notify the Department of the owner's current
mailing address does not relieve the owner of a public water system from
liability for penalties.
