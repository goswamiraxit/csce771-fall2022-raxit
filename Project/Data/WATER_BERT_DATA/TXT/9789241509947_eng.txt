WHO does not furthermore warrant that: any products included in the figures and tables are of acceptable quality, have obtained regulatory approval
in any country, or that their use is otherwise in accordance with the national laws and regulations of any country, including but not limited to patent
laws. Inclusion of any products in this report, particularly in any of the figures and tables, does not furthermore imply any approval by WHO of these
products (which is the sole prerogative of national authorities).
The results in this report reflect whether the products which were evaluated in Round I of the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household
Water Treatment Technologies (“the Scheme”) were found to meet any of the WHO recommended performance levels for such products, and if so
what performance level they were found to meet at the time of testing. WHO cannot represent that the products which were found to meet a stated
performance level will continue to do so.
The figures and tables included in this report do not provide an exhaustive overview of available HWT products. They reflect those products which have
been submitted to WHO for evaluation in Round I of the Scheme, were found to meet the eligibility criteria for such evaluation, and were subsequently
evaluated. The fact that certain products are not mentioned in this report and are not included in the figures and tables does not mean that if eligible
for evaluation, and if evaluated, they would not be found to meet any of the WHO recommended performance levels.
WHO disclaims any and all liability and responsibility whatsoever for any injury, death, loss, damage, or other prejudice of any kind that may arise as
a result of or in connection with the procurement, distribution and use of any product included in this report.

    Executive summary

    G
         lobally, an estimated 1.9 billion people use either an unimproved water source or an improved source1 that
         is faecally-contaminated. Furthermore, 502,000 diarrhoeal deaths in low- and middle-income countries
         can be attributed to insufficient and unsafe drinking-water (WHO, 2014a). The vast majority of these
    deaths occur in Africa and South-East Asia, mainly among vulnerable populations, including young children, the
    malnourished and people living with the human immunodeficiency virus.

    The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda agreed by United Nations (UN) Member States in 2015 calls for
    universal access to safe drinking water, and the proposed indicator of ‘safely managed drinking-water services’
    will require direct measurement of drinking-water quality (WHO/UNICEF, 2015a). Improved protection
    and management of drinking-water supplies, including at the household level, will therefore gain increasing
    importance for achieving the new Sustainable Development Goal targets. Long-term, this can be achieved
    through increased use of risk management approaches like Water Safety Planning, but in the short and medium
    term household water treatment (HWT) and safe storage can play an important role.




    1 Unimproved sources of drinking-water include surface water, unprotected springs and unprotected dug wells. Full definitions of improved and unimproved sources can
      be found at: http://www.wssinfo.org/definitions-methods/watsan-categories/

                          HWT and safe storage is an important public health intervention to improve the quality of drinking-water and
                          prevent waterborne disease. However, achieving health gains associated with HWT relies on two important
                          factors. HWT technologies need to sufficiently reduce pathogens to protect health and also to be used correctly
                          and consistently by those who are exposed to contaminated water. The first of these conditions – microbiological
                          performance – is critical, and is the primary focus of this report.

                          The International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies (the Scheme) was established by
                          the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014 to evaluate the microbiological performance of HWT technologies
                          against WHO health-based criteria. The results of the Scheme evaluation are intended to guide HWT product
                          selection by Member States and procuring UN agencies. In this regard, the Scheme fills an important global
                          and national need for independent health-based evaluation of HWT, especially considering the large number of
                          product manufacturers and product claims, and the limited capacity of low-income countries to conduct testing
                          to verify these claims.

                          This Round I Report of the Scheme is the first ever global assessment of HWT performance, and details the
                          results from a range of HWT technologies including solar, chemical, filtration and ultraviolet (UV). In addition,
                          the report draws on the findings from a rapid assessment of the HWT product market and enabling environment
                          in Africa and South-East Asia. The report:

                          • highlights that performance is a fundamental criterion in HWT product selection, and a number of products
                            are available that were found to meet WHO recommended performance targets;

                          • draws attention to the fact that, despite the significant need for effective HWT solutions among vulnerable
                            populations, product evaluation and regulation is generally weak; and

                          • recommends specific actions at the national level needed to ensure that health gains from HWT are realized;
                            these include strengthening product regulation and enabling environments for HWT, understanding market
                            development and user needs and motivations for sustained use.

    The report is divided into two main sections. Section 1 summarizes the results of Round I of the Scheme
    evaluations, performed in 2014/2015, with data on the performance of ten HWT products. The performance
    of HWT products is classified as 3-star (); 2-star (); and 1-star (), denoting descending order of
    performance, based on log10 reductions of bacteria, viruses and protozoa from drinking-water. Performance that
    does not meet the minimum target is given no stars. The results of the performance testing and review of existing
    data and product information highlight that:

    • A variety of HWT products are available that were found to meet WHO recommended performance targets.
      Of the ten products evaluated, five were found to provide comprehensive protection against all three classes
      of pathogens (3-star or 2-star), while three were found to provide targeted protection against two of the three
      classes of pathogens (1-star). The eight products found to meet WHO recommended performance targets
      are listed in Table 1.

    • Some products fail to meet the Scheme’s minimum standard of health protection.
      Two of the products evaluated do not meet the Scheme’s minimum microbiological performance criteria.
      Identifying such products is crucial to inform appropriate HWT product selection and procurement and to
      promote use of better performing alternatives. Information on these products is provided in Section 1.3.1 of
      this report.

    • Awareness of the key considerations in HWT performance evaluation is limited.
      Three main findings arising from the review of existing testing data and discussions with HWT stakeholders
      are that:
      –– Performance is often overlooked in selecting products. Both products that did not meet the performance
         criteria were being distributed or sold on the market at the time of testing. While WHO recognizes that
         microbiological performance is only one of many factors to consider, this performance is a prerequisite
         for health gains.
      –– Testing conducted outside the Scheme is undertaken with varying methods and often under “ideal”
         conditions such as using non-turbid water, high doses and long contact times, and only against a limited
         set of parameters. This results in data which only reflect “part of” HWT performance, rather than
         comprehensive data under all conditions, thus rendering interpretation of tests difficult and comparability
         between tests even more so.
      –– Product information, including use instructions and labelling can be unclear, and deciphering information
         that is pertinent to product performance is difficult. Without sufficient product information, the ability of
         users to correctly and consistently use HWT and ultimately achieve health gains is compromised.

    Section 2 outlines the main findings from the rapid market assessment of HWT in Africa and Asia, and discusses
    key scaling up efforts required to better monitor, target and understand the use of quality HWT. While the limited
    scope of the assessment precludes making definitive statements about the HWT market in these regions, the
    available data from selected countries provide some useful insights on the HWT environment. The findings
    highlight that:

    • There is a strong growth in filter markets in parts of Asia.
      While boiling remains the most commonly reported method of HWT (Box 1), filtration is increasingly common
      in Asia. Findings from India, Viet Nam, China and South Korea highlight that the growth in the filter markets
      is likely attributed to growing consumer awareness of a number of factors, including the quality of supplied
      water, the potential health gains from using HWT, the wide availability of HWT products and also the ability
      of middle-income households to pay.




8   WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
   BOX 1
   Boiling remains the most commonly reported method of household water treatment

   Boiling is reported by approximately one fifth of households in low- and middle-income countries. It is very effective in inactivating
   waterborne pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. However, an important limitation is that the treated water may be
   susceptible to recontamination due to unsafe storage and handling after boiling (WHO, 2015a). In addition, use of certain fuels and
   stoves has adverse environmental consequences, including contributing to climate change. As with other household water treatment
   methods, actual use of boiling may be lower than self-reported use, and consequently its health impact may be limited in practice
   (Brown and Sobsey, 2012; Rosa et al., 2014).




• Behavioural interventions and understanding of consumer preferences are necessary to realize sustained
  use of HWT.
  The vast majority of those without improved water sources live in sub-Saharan Africa, and an estimated
  53% of the population in the region are exposed to water that is faecally-contaminated (WHO, 2014a). Yet,
  reported HWT use in the region remains relatively low (20 %, on average). Implementation of HWT is largely
  project-based and is often focused on emergency relief efforts or cholera outbreaks, highlighting the need for
  approaches that promote more sustained, ongoing use and develop the mechanisms and systems to ensure
  availability, user support and effective supply chains.

• Regulation of HWT is weak and fragmented.
  Findings from Ethiopia, Ghana and Viet Nam highlight that regulatory frameworks for HWT products are
  weak, and often fragmented. Overall, few countries regulate HWT products based on their microbiological
  performance, and among those that do, such regulation is often limited to chemical disinfectants and
  performance testing, at best, only includes faecal indicator bacteria, rather than all three classes of pathogens.

The section concludes with three main priorities to support scaling up of quality assured HWT products. These
priorities are:

• Strengthening the regulatory capacity of national governments, through increasing awareness of the WHO
  HWT performance criteria, and strengthening the capacity of national regulatory institutions to conduct
  complimentary evaluations of HWT and evaluate product efficacy data and certifications.

• Strengthening local manufacturing of quality HWT products, by supporting implementation of best
  manufacturing practices tools. This includes developing a better understanding of the key variants affecting
  performance of locally manufactured HWT products, and strengthening quality assurance and quality control
  at local manufacturing plants through implementation of best manufacturing practices tools.

• Strengthening implementation of HWT to ensure that effective HWT products reach, and are used correctly
  and consistently by, those most at risk of waterborne disease. This requires effective targeting of market
  development, understanding of consumer preferences, behavioural interventions and monitoring and evaluating
  ongoing use and smarter HWT implementation for better health impact.

     Background

     A
           n estimated 842,000 deaths each year are attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene;
           representing 58% of the total diarrhoeal deaths in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, unsafe
           and insufficient drinking-water account for an estimated 502,000 diarrhoea deaths in low and middle-
     income countries (WHO, 2014a). Many of these deaths could be prevented by improving the quality of drinking-
     water. In particular, the use of a comprehensive risk assessment and management approach, known as a water
     safety plan (WSP) will support consistent good quality water (WHO, 2009). Household water treatment (HWT)
     and safe storage is one particular control option within a broader WSP to make water safer to drink (WHO, 2011b).

     HWT and safe storage is not a substitute for sustainable access to safe drinking-water, but does serve as an
     important interim measure for removing pathogens from drinking-water and reducing disease risk, particularly for
     the 663 million individuals (WHO/UNICEF, 2015b) who do not have access to improved supplies. Furthermore,
     when safety (as defined by faecal contamination) is considered, the number of individuals in need of safer water
     increases to 1.9 billion (WHO, 2014a).

     Achieving health gains associated                                      FIGURE 1

     technologies must be microbiologically
     effective; i.e. they must sufficiently
     reduce pathogens to protect health.                                                      UNIMPROVED SOURCE OF DRINKING-WATER                                    HIGH

     Importance of safe storage

     Studies have shown that safe storage alone can significantly reduce diarrhoeal disease (Roberts et al., 2001) which highlights the
     importance and the cost-effectiveness of this measure. Increasingly a number of HWT products incorporate safe storage into their
     design (as is often the case for filters) or through the presence of a chlorine residual. With climate change and increasing fluctuations
     in water supply and the resulting need to store water in the household, safe storage is likely to become even more important in
     the future. Furthermore, safe storage is also associated with other health benefits beyond diarrhoeal disease reduction, such as
     decreasing the risk of dengue by reducing breeding grounds for the mosquito vector.



There are a number of different HWT methods. The main types include chemical disinfection, disinfection
with heat or ultraviolet (UV), filtration and flocculation-disinfection. In order to comprehensively assess
effectiveness, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended health-based performance targets
for HWT products based on the removal of enteric bacteria, viruses, and protozoa1 (WHO, 2011a). However,
many low- and middle-income countries have neither the capacity, nor the resources to evaluate technologies
based on WHO recommendations. Concurrently, these same governments – mainly located in Sub-Saharan
Africa, South-East Asia and parts of Central and South America – are increasingly being approached by
manufacturers to buy and allow the sale of their products within the respective countries. To this end, in
2014 WHO established the International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies (the
Scheme) to independently and consistently evaluate HWT products based on specific performance criteria
that address the removal of viruses, bacteria and protozoa (WHO, 2011a). The objectives of the Scheme are to:

• promote and coordinate independent and consistent evaluation of HWT based on WHO recommended
  criteria and, in so doing, guide WHO Member States and procuring United Nations agencies in the selection
  of HWT; and

• support governments in a number of evaluation-related functions, including building technical capacity of
  research institutions, conducting complimentary national assessments of HWT in the field, and strengthening
  national regulation of HWT.

Together, these two objectives and the associated activities serve the ultimate aim of the Scheme, which is to
reduce the burden of disease associated with unsafe drinking-water.




1 Performance testing of HWT technologies under the Scheme currently does not specifically address non-enteric pathogens that may grow in household water systems
  when warm water is stored (Ashbolt, 2015), nor non-microbial contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride.

1. Round I of the Scheme

1.1 An overview of the Scheme
The Scheme is coordinated by the Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Health Unit at the WHO. In this role, WHO
reviews and designates testing laboratories, develops testing protocols and report templates, coordinates the
testing of technologies, reviews testing results and communicates the test results to Member States (Figure 2).

WHO works with an independent advisory committee (IAC) of experts in drinking-water treatment, microbiology
and epidemiology1, and designated testing laboratories to independently evaluate the performance of submitted
HWT products. The highly specialized technical nature of evaluating HWT technologies necessitates testing in
laboratories with advanced capabilities. Thus, laboratories need to have systems in place to ensure the integrity
of testing and the results, including compliance with the quality management requirements of the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17025. There are currently two laboratories that have been designated to
conduct testing2. These are KWR Watercycle Research Institute (KWR) in the Netherlands and NSF International
(NSF) in the United States of America.

     1.1.1 HWT performance targets
     The evaluation of HWT technologies is based on the recommended performance criteria set out in Evaluating
     household water treatment options: health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications (WHO,
     2011a). These criteria were determined by applying the concept of tolerable burden of disease (acceptable risk)
     as outlined in the fourth edition of the GDWQ (WHO, 2011b). Using quantitative microbial risk assessment
     (QMRA) methods described in the GDWQ (Box 3), and assuming background levels of reference pathogens in
     untreated water, reductions of pathogens were calculated to meet risk-based targets.



          BOX 3
          Quantitative microbial risk assessment

          Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is the process of estimating the risk posed to human health from exposure to microbial
          pathogens. The process uses data on source water quality, effectiveness of treatment and characteristics of microbial pathogens,
          to estimate the disease burden associated with exposure to pathogens in drinking-water.



     From this, three categories of recommended performance: 3-star (           ); 2-star (   ); and 1-star ( ), were
     developed, denoting descending order of performance1. The performance targets pertain to three main classes of
     pathogens which cause enteric infections and disease, namely bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The log10 reductions
     required to achieve the performance targets for each pathogen class are presented in Table 2, and a description
     of a log reductions is provided in Box 4.

          BOX 4
          Log10 reduction

          The microbiological performance of HWT technologies is often presented as a comparison of the concentration of pathogens in water
          before, and after treatment, on a logarithmic basis. A 1-log reduction stands for a ten-fold or 90% reduction in the concentration
          of pathogens in water.
          • 1 log10 reduction = 90% reduction
          • 2 log10 reduction = 99% reduction
          • 3 log10 reduction = 99.9% reduction, etc.



     1 The performance targets were originally labelled as Highly protective, Protective and Interim (WHO, 2011a). While the log reduction requirements remain the same, the
       nomenclature has been subsequently revised to the star rating, based on feedback from a strategic meeting held in March 2015, to be more universally understood.




14   WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
These three pathogen classes occur widely in drinking-water supplies impacted by animal and/or human excreta.
For example, in a recent global study involving over 20,000 children in seven developing countries, rotavirus,
Cryptosporidium protozoa and some toxin-producing strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) were among
the top pathogens associated with moderate to severe diarrhoea (Kotloff et al., 2013). In addition, increased E.
coli contamination in household water has been associated with an increase in child diarrhoea (Luby et al., 2015).
Thus, in many faecally-contaminated drinking-water sources it is important that HWT technologies sufficiently
reduce all three classes of pathogens. Where such technologies are not available a multi-barrier approach is
advised (Box 5). Within each class of pathogen, there are many different organisms associated with waterborne
diseases and it is neither feasible nor practical to evaluate the performance of HWT technologies against each of
them. Instead, reference organisms have been selected to represent the three classes. These reference organisms
are: E. coli (bacteria), coliphages MS2 and phiX174 (viruses) and Cryptosporidium parvum (protozoa). An overview
of the key considerations in selecting these reference organisms is given in Annex 1.



   BOX 5
   Technologies providing ‘targeted protection’ and the multi-barrier approach

   The WHO recommends a multi-barrier approach to water safety, where combinations of technologies can be used to treat water.
   While technologies that provide targeted protection such as chlorine disinfectants are effective against only bacteria and viruses,
   they can be combined with a method that is effective against protozoa (such as filtration) to achieve comprehensive protection.




1.1.2 The Scheme evaluation procedure
Evaluation under the Scheme is based on the voluntary submission of an expression of interest (EOI) from
manufacturers. Priority products for evaluation are those that are:

• low cost;

• appropriate for low-income settings;

• generally ‘free-standing’ and do not need to be plumbed in; and

• which only treat sufficient water to serve a limited number of individuals a day, as would be typically used in
  households or small public facilities such as tertiary healthcare centres.

Each EOI that meets these initial screening criteria is selected for review by the Scheme Secretariat at WHO with
input and advice from the IAC. In its role as coordinator, WHO works with the IAC to review these submissions,
develop testing protocols and manage communications and reporting with the designated testing laboratories and
manufacturers (further details on the screening and evaluation criteria are outlined in Annex 1). The results of the
evaluation are published on the WHO website. An overview of the Scheme evaluation procedure is shown in Figure 3.
Evaluations are conducted according to standardized protocols in line with the above-mentioned performance
criteria. The evaluation may consider existing data and abbreviated testing, in lieu of full testing, provided that
such data have been generated by independent, highly qualified testing laboratories using quality assurance
protocols that are similar to those of the Scheme

                     recommended performance levels                                     design, etc.




     1.1.3 Quality assurance
     Quality assurance elements in place to provide appropriate and consistent evaluation of HWT technologies
     include harmonized testing protocols, ongoing learning exchange and site visits between highly qualified
     laboratories and regular review of evidence to ensure testing is in line with latest science.

     The testing procedures
     To ensure appropriate and consistent evaluation across products and technologies, product testing follows a
     harmonized testing protocol, based on internationally recognized performance approaches and recommendations
     by the IAC. The protocol is intentionally prescriptive to ensure consistency in evaluation and it outlines:

     • the specifications for each test water characteristic, the adjustment materials to be used and the published
       methods of analysis to be used to verify and report compliance with the specifications; and

     • the Scheme reference target organisms to be used, which are well documented as laboratory test
       microorganisms. Where appropriate, internationally recognized identifications are used such as the American
       Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and testing utilizes the production and assay procedures outlined in the
       harmonized testing protocol. Collection procedures, including neutralization details, storage conditions and
       hold times are all clearly defined.

     BOX 6
     Reliability of testing between the designated laboratories

     To assess the consistency between the designated laboratories, two products were tested at both KWR and NSF. Each laboratory
     independently developed product-specific testing protocols for the two products. At both laboratories three sampling units each
     of the two products were tested, with influent concentrations for all organisms sufficient to meet 3-star performance targets. The
     results from the laboratories were consistent for both products: one product met the 2-star target, limited by its virus performance,
     while the other product fully met the 3-star performance targets for all three pathogen classes. Given viruses are the most difficult
     class of pathogen to manipulate, the consistency between labs for this class of organism in particular, demonstrates quality measures
     are being met.




Designated testing laboratories
The WHO designated laboratories, KWR and NSF, were selected based on expertise, capabilities and
independence. These laboratories are accredited to ISO 17025, demonstrating their competence in testing and
calibration and providing quality assurance that includes both management and technical requirements:

• Management requirements relate to the operation and effectiveness of the quality management system within
  the laboratory, including defined responsibilities and tasks of staff, procedures for ensuring the quality of test
  results and clear document control/ reporting procedures.

• Technical requirements include factors which determine the correctness and reliability of the tests and
  calibrations performed in laboratory (Box 6). These include staff competence, environment control, testing
  methodology, equipment and measurement traceability, and reporting of test and calibration results.

In addition to demonstrated technical capability, KWR and NSF are independent of industry and the head of
each institution and the staff responsible for the testing activities are required to disclose potential conflicts of
interest. The institutions also have adequate mechanisms in place to address and manage potential conflicts
and safeguards to ensure the integrity of testing and the results.

Laboratory learning exchanges
Communication between designated testing facilities also helps to ensure consistent evaluation. KWR and
NSF, both WHO Collaborating Centres, have met and maintain regular communication to produce a common
understanding of all the evaluations and subsequent reporting and conduct testing on a not-for profit basis as
part of Collaborating Centre activities.


1.1.4 Overview of the product testing
For each of the products that undergo laboratory testing, manufacturers are required to provide three production
units for devices, and sufficient samples for triplicate replicates in three production lots for chemical disinfectants.1
Each of the products is tested against the protocols specific to the technology class that they represent. Further
information on these technology-specific protocols can be found in Annex 1. The actual setup employed during
testing follows the manufacturer’s instructions for use, including doses to be applied, contact times, requirements
for pre-conditioning, etc. Supporting information submitted by manufacturers describing their product and its
operation and maintenance is also reviewed.




1 Each unit from the three lots is required to meet or exceed the performance requirements set out in Table 2. However, a maximum deviation of 10% in the sample points
  is allowed, provided that the variance is not greater than 1 log10.




                                                                                                                                                                          17

1.2 HWT products evaluated in Round I
In 2014, WHO issued the first call to HWT manufacturers to submit EOIs. A total of 29 EOIs were received from
26 manufacturers. After the initial screening, 12 products did not meet the eligibility criteria and thus did not
proceed to the full evaluation. Details of the screening criteria and EOI reviews are provided in Annex 1. Some
manufacturers withdrew from the evaluation for various reasons, including uncertainty about the readiness of
their product for testing and concerns about the testing costs.1 In total, ten products from eight manufacturers
proceeded to evaluation under the Scheme (Table 3).

Of the ten products that were evaluated, six underwent full laboratory testing and four underwent abbreviated
evaluations. These products represent filtration, solar, UV, chemical and combination technologies. A brief
description of these products and the technology class they represent is provided in the following sections.

           MEMBRANE FILTRATION (ULTRAFILTRATION)
           In general, filters reduce microbial contaminants from drinking-water by a combination of physical and chemical
           processes, including size exclusion and adsorption. A key determinant of their performance is the pore size of the
           filter, and not all membrane types are effective against small microorganisms such as viruses. A brief overview
           of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of ultrafiltration membranes (and not membranes in
           general) is provided below.


           Microbial performance                     • Effective against viruses (depending on the integrity of the membrane), bacteria
                                                       and protozoa
           Advantages                                • Visual improvement in treated water
           Limitations                               • Regular cleaning of filters required
                                                     • Requires reliable supply chain for spare parts
                                                     • Does not provide residual protection against recontamination unless treated
                                                       water is safely stored
                                                     • Membrane fouling
           Application                               • Most appropriate in areas where:
                                                     • There is external funding or microfinance schemes to support the initial cost of
                                                       the filter
                                                     • There is a distribution network for replacement of broken parts
                                                     • User training on how to correctly maintain and use the filter is feasible

Countries of manufacture
The filter membranes and cartridge are manufactured in Korea. The plastic moulding for LifeStraw Family
2.0 and LifeStraw Community is manufactured in China.

Treatment technology
Membrane ultrafiltration

Product description
The LifeStraw filters are available in three versions, namely LifeStraw Family 1.0, 2.0 and Community. During
filtration, microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa are physically removed from water as it is
forced through hollow fibre membranes under gravitational pressure.

The LifeStraw Family 1.0 comprises a 2 L reservoir containing a pre-filter to remove coarse particles, which
is attached to a hose that connects to the ultrafiltration hollow fibre membrane1 cartridge and a tap. When
the tap is turned on, water in the reservoir travels down the hose and is forced through the filter cartridge
and released through the tap. The filter does not come with a safe storage container, and has to be hung or
suspended above the storage container to be filled. The estimated flow rate of the filter when new is 12 L/hour.

The LifeStraw Family 2.0 and LifeStraw Community are based on the same ultrafiltration membrane
technology as the LifeStraw Family 1.0. The 2.0 is a table top version of the LifeStraw range, and comprises
a 6.0 L raw water tank and a built-in 5.5 L safe storage water tank with a tap. The estimated flow rate of the
filter when new is at least 2.5 L/hour. The LifeStraw Community is a high-volume version designed for use
in community and institutional settings. It has a total fill capacity of 50 L, with raw water and safe storage
tanks of 25 L each. The estimated flow rate of the filter when new is at least 12 L/hour. The full product

Product evaluation
The evaluation of the LifeStraw filters consisted of a desk review of existing data of the Family 1.0 and
laboratory testing of the Family 2.0 and Community versions. Testing followed requirements of the
technology-specific protocol for gravity-fed membrane filters. Following the manufacturer’s use instructions,
three lots of the products, run in triplicate, were evaluated to determine their reduction performance against
bacteria and viruses. Testing against Cryptosporidium parvum was not required, as filtration devices with a
pore size of less than 1 micron would be capable of removing oocysts (size ranging between 2 to 50 microns),
and if the membrane was compromised, the presence of smaller viruses or bacteria in the treated water
would clearly demonstrate a fault in the filter.

1 The hollow fibre membrane can filter particles down to 0.02 microns.
                                                                                                                                                 21
            POROUS CERAMIC FILTRATION
            Ceramic filtration relies on the physical removal of contaminants from water by a combination of size exclusion
            and adsorption. The most common ceramic filter shapes are pots and candles, although discs are also available.
            The filters may also be enhanced by impregnating or coating with a bacteriostatic agent such as silver nitrate
            solution or colloidal suspensions of silver. A brief overview of the microbial performance, limitations and
            advantages of porous ceramic filters is provided below.


            Microbial performance                     • Effective against bacteria and protozoa
                                                      • Limited effectiveness against viruses
            Advantages                                •   Simple to use
                                                      •   Visual improvement in treated water
                                                      •   One-time capital cost
                                                      •   Possibility of local production benefits economy
            Limitations                               • Lack of residual protection presents potential for recontamination if no
                                                        attached safe storage container is provided
                                                      • Variability in quality of locally produced filters
                                                      • Filter breakage requires reliable supply chain
                                                      • Need to regularly clean filters and receptacles
                                                      • Low flow rate of 1–3 litres per hour (slower in turbid waters)

Product evaluation
The evaluation of the TEMBO Filter Pot consisted of laboratory testing to provide independent data on the
product’s microbiological performance. Testing followed requirements of the technology-specific protocol
for ceramic pot filters. Following the manufacturer’s use instructions, including conditioning, three units
(triplicate replicates) were tested for all three classes of pathogens in general and challenge test waters.
Testing was stopped prior to full test capacity due to very low flow of the test waters in the pots. According
to the information provided by the manufacturer, the average flow rate for the TEMBO Filter Pots is 1-5 L/
hour. However, during testing it took more than 24 hours to filter an 8 L of sample water, indicating a flow
rate of less than 0.5 L/hour.

                     Flocculant-disinfectants employ a multi-barrier approach to water treatment. The flocculant encourages
                     suspended and larger microorganisms such as protozoa to bind to each other and settle to the bottom of the water
                     container, while the disinfectant inactivates the smaller microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. A brief
                     overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of flocculant-disinfectants is provided below.

Product evaluation
The evaluation of the WADI consisted of laboratory testing of the product’s performance against all three
classes of pathogens. Testing followed requirements of the solar (UV and heat) technology-specific protocol.
Following the manufacturer’s use instructions, three units (triplicate replicates) were evaluated for all three
classes of pathogens in general and challenge test waters. A solar lamp was used to provide 550W/m2 of
simulated outdoor solar radiation in a laboratory setting. This irradiance corresponds to what would likely
be observed between latitude 15°N and 35°N as well as 15°S and 35°S, where the majority of developing
countries are located.

          CHEMICAL DISINFECTION (CHLORINATION)
          Chemical disinfectants primarily act against microorganisms by chemically altering (often oxidizing) their
          biochemical building blocks and disrupting surface attachment molecules and vital cell functions. The most
          common disinfectants are chlorine based, although iodine based or metallic disinfectants such as ionized
          copper and/or silver are available. A brief overview of the microbial performance, limitations and advantages of
          chlorination is provided below.


          Microbial performance                     • Effective against bacteria and some viruses
                                                    • Ineffective against protozoan cysts such as Cryptosporidium parvum1
          Advantages                                •   Residual protection against recontamination
                                                    •   Simple to use
                                                    •   Possibility of local production may benefit economy
                                                    •   Low cost
          Limitations                               •   Less effective in turbid or organic-rich waters2
                                                    •   Potential user taste and odour objections
                                                    •   Requires reliable supply chain
                                                    •   Necessity of ensuring quality control of product
          Application                               Chlorination products are widely used in emergencies, due to their ease of use
                                                    and transport, and affordability, among other factors. It should be noted that
                                                    chlorination products are most appropriate in areas where:
                                                    • The pathogen of concern is known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae), as chlorine does not
                                                      provide protection against some protozoa
                                                    • There is a consistent supply chain or there are quality management procedures
                                                      in place for onsite production
                                                    • Water is of relatively low turbidity and colour
                                                    • Educational messages can reach the target population to encourage correct
                                                      and consistent use

          Because   of this limitation, products based on simple chlorination alone are unlikely to achieve a performance target higher than 1-star ( ).
                              disinfection
        2 High levels of dissolved organic carbon in water can react with chlorine to form potentially hazardous by-products. However, the health risks from these by-products at
          the levels at which they occur in drinking-water are relatively small in comparison with the risks associated with inadequate disinfection. As such, disinfection should
          not be compromised in attempting to control such by-products (WHO, 2011b).

Product evaluation
The evaluation of H2gO Purifier consisted of a desk review of existing data on its performance against
bacteria and viruses only. The submitted data on performance against viruses and bacteria were reviewed
as an abbreviated procedure against the technology-specific protocol for chlorine disinfectants. In general,
the existing evidence suggests that disinfection by chlorine alone or mixed oxidants is ineffective against
Cryptosporidium oocysts at concentrations that would be within taste and odour thresholds and contact
times reasonably reflective of field use. Although some experimental data were submitted on the product’s
performance against protozoan cysts including Cryptosporidium oocysts, they were based on high doses
and long contact times (up to four hours). These data were therefore not considered in the review as in
practice the recommended contact time is 30 min and achieving longer times would require considerable
user education.

The results are summarized in two sub-sections, based on the performance evaluation and review of product
information.


1.3.1 Microbiological performance of HWT products
Products classified as providing comprehensive protection with very high removal (                 ) are those that
demonstrate at least 4 log10 reduction against bacteria and protozoa, and at least 5 log10 reduction against viruses.
Products classified as providing comprehensive protection with high removal ( ) are those that demonstrate
at least 2 log10 reduction against bacteria and protozoa, and at least 3 log10 reduction against viruses. As shown
in Figure 4, there is some variability in performance and some of the products evaluated do not meet any of the
performance targets.

                The results of the evaluation reveal the following key findings:

                Half of the ten products evaluated were found to provide comprehensive protection against all three pathogen
                classes. These are: the three membrane ultra-filters, the flocculant-disinfectant, and the UV disinfectant. These
                products were found to meet the performance targets for either 3-star (        ) or 2-star ( ), and are classified
                as providing Comprehensive protection, with very high or high removal of three classes of pathogens, respectively.

                Three of the products evaluated were found to provide targeted protection against two of three classes of
                pathogens. These are the chlorine tablets, the electrolytic chlorine generator and the solar disinfection indicator.
                The chlorination products were found to be effective against and bacteria and viruses only – achieving at least
                6- and 3-log10 respectively – but were found not to be effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts. Therefore,
                these chlorination products meet the performance targets for 1-star ( ), and are classified as providing Targeted

                1 This refers only to the treatment technologies represented by the products evaluated under the Scheme and found to meet the performance targets, and not all such
                  technologies.

protection against bacteria and viruses only. The solar disinfection device was found to be effective against
bacteria and protozoa, and also demonstrated reasonable performance against viruses. However, it did not
consistently meet the performance target for viruses across all samples and is therefore classified as providing
Targeted protection against bacteria and protozoa only.

Not all products were found to be effective in reducing pathogens from drinking-water. Two of the products
evaluated were found to not meet the minimum performance targets (1-star). This underscores the importance of
rigorous, consistent and independent evaluation of HWT products, as distribution of underperforming products
will not result in expected health gains, regardless of consistency and correctness of use.

Other selected findings include:

Product performance may vary significantly between production units. Two of the products evaluated (a
membrane ultrafiltration device and a solar disinfection indicator) did not consistently meet the required
performance targets across all samples. For these products, the mean log10 reduction for the viral surrogates MS2
and/ or phiX174 varied by more than 1 log10 across the samples. Therefore, although the mean log10 reductions
against the viral surrogates of these devices met or exceeded the performance targets, more than 10 % of the
samples did not meet the target log reductions and therefore the performance targets were not fully met. Such
variation in performance among product units highlights the importance of performing replicate analyses and
testing multiple lots to evaluate the consistency in manufacture. Variation in performance among units may
suggest variability in production highlighting a need to identify gaps in quality product manufacturing, especially
for filters where there are several parts which must be fit together. It is worth noting that although the membrane
ultrafiltration device did not consistently meet the 5 log10 reduction for viruses, the average removal was higher
than 5 log and the performance of membrane filters has been shown to progressively improve over time, with
increased clogging of the filter pores (Madsen et al., 2010).

Special consideration may need to be given to quality management of local products. It was not possible
to classify the performance of the ceramic pot filter, due to the very low flow rate that was observed during
testing. Thus, without being able to filter water, testing was concluded prematurely and the performance was
undetermined. This suggests poor quality control in manufacturing, as locally manufactured products have been
shown to be especially susceptible to inconsistencies in performance (the Ceramics Manufacturing Working
Group, 2011).


1.3.2 Findings from the reviews of product information and existing data
In addition to the laboratory testing, supporting information for each product was reviewed, including the product
labels, instructions for use and existing performance-related information. Selected findings from this review are:

Manufacturer testing, in some cases, is insufficient to support claims as testing does not cover all three
classes of pathogens, and is largely limited to faecal coliforms and physico-chemical parameters. Communication
and facilitating the understanding of the need to demonstrate comprehensive evaluation results to decision-
makers who are responsible for procuring HWT products (such as national governments, donors and non-
governmental organizations) is vital in order to identify limitations in various technologies and decipher claims
about product performance.

Existing testing is often conducted under ideal conditions that are not reasonably reflective of actual use in
the field. In particular, the existing evidence suggests that chemical disinfectants alone are ineffective against
protozoan oocysts such as Cryptosporidium at concentrations that would be within taste and odour thresholds, and
at contact times that would be reasonably reflective of field use. Among the existing performance data reviewed,
two disinfection products demonstrated at least 2 log10 reduction against Cryptosporidium oocysts, but used doses
2 to 4 times higher than that recommended on the product label and contact times ranging from 2 to 4 hours.




                                                                                                                      37
     Unclear product labelling and use instructions. Consistent with the findings of Murray et al. (2014), unclear use
     instructions and product labelling were observed in two products. This may lead to confusion, possible misuse
     and underperformance of products.
     1.3.3 Interpretation of evaluation results
     Products that meet 3-star (       ) or 2-star ( ) performance targets are classified as providing Comprehensive
     protection against the three main classes of pathogens which cause diarrhoeal disease in humans. The use of
     these products is encouraged where there is no information on the specific pathogens in drinking-water or where
     piped supplies exist but are not safely managed.

     Products that meet that meet the performance targets for at least 2-star ( ) for only two of the three classes
     of pathogen are given one star ( ) and are classified as providing Targeted protection. In general, the use of these
     products may be appropriate in targeted situations where the burden of diarrhoeal disease is high due to known
     classes of pathogens. For instance, although chlorination is ineffective against protozoa, it is known to be effective
     against bacteria and viruses. Thus, in a situation where the causative agent of disease is known, such as Vibrio
     cholerae, chlorination can play an important role in improving the quality of water, and is widely used in cholera
     outbreaks and other emergencies (Box 7). Given that cholera outbreaks are still frequent in many countries and
     that there were an estimated 190,500 cases and 2,200 deaths in 2014 (WHO, 2015b), chlorine will continue to
     serve an important role in such situations.



          BOX 7
          Household water treatment in emergencies

          Safe drinking-water is an immediate priority in most
          emergencies, and HWT can be an effective emergency
          response intervention. Common water treatment options in
          emergencies include chlorine tablets and solutions, boiling
          promotion and safe storage. However, a number of key
          elements should be considered when implementing HWT
          in emergencies. These include having a selection of HWT
          options available, user training and materials necessary
          to use the treatment options, obtaining local registration
          of HWT products and user knowledge and acceptability of
          chlorine dosage.
          Lantagne and Clasen (2009)




     1.3.4 Use of results in selecting HWT products
     The results of the evaluation are intended to assist procurers in making informed purchases of these products.
     It must be noted that the evaluation results presented in this report represent an initial step in decision-making.

     In addition to microbiological performance, supply chains, cost, user preferences as well as user compliance
     (correct and consistent use) are extremely important (Box 8). Regardless of the star rating, products need to
     be used correctly and consistently in order to achieve health gains. Evidence suggests that products need to be
     used at least 90 % of the time in order to achieve health gains from HWT (Brown and Clasen, 2012). A slightly
     lower performing (e.g. 2-star) product that is used at least 90 % of the time to treat faecally-contaminated
     water can provide several times more protection than a higher performing (e.g. 3-star) product that is used less
     consistently (Brown and Clasen, 2012). Thus, given a choice between a product whose performance is classified
     as 3-star versus one whose performance is classified as 2-star, the existing evidence points to the product with
     the higher user compliance as the better choice.

       BOX 8
       Selecting HWT products

       There is no single HWT product that is appropriate for all contexts. However, microbiological performance should be the first
       consideration in product selection, followed by local contextual factors that influence correct and consistent use. These factors
       include availability, cost, user preferences and behaviour. WHO is working with partners to develop specific resources and tools to
       further guide product selection in this regard.

2. Implications: supporting
availability and scaling up of
quality HWT and safe storage
Globally, an estimated 1.1 billion people (30 % of households) in low- and middle-income countries report using
household water treatment (HWT) and safe storage (WHO, 2014a). As Figure 7 shows, the practice is particularly
common in the regions of the Western Pacific and South-East Asia.

Boiling is the most commonly used method. Figure 7 also highlights that filtration is fairly common in the South-
East Asian and Western Pacific regions, while chlorination is more common in the regions of the Americas and
Africa (WHO, 2014a).

A number of complimentary areas of work are necessary to ensure that quality HWT products are available and
used by populations with unsafe drinking-water. The following section presents the findings of a rapid market
assessment to understand use of HWT in key countries, including growth of particular technologies and national
regulatory structures. This is followed by a discussion of key scaling up efforts to better monitor, target and
understand the use of quality HWT.

2.1 Rapid market assessment
In early 2015, WHO commissioned a rapid market assessment to identify HWT products that are currently
on the market and could potentially be evaluated in Round II of the Scheme, and investigate the regulatory
environment surrounding these products. Due to resource constraints, the market assessment was limited to
the WHO regions of Africa, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The market assessment was based on a
literature review and interviews with manufacturers of HWT products, implementing agencies (including non-
governmental organizations) and national regulatory officials. In addition, field visits took place in three countries
where there was an expressed need and capacity to strengthen HWT regulation and evaluation (Ethiopia, Ghana
and Viet Nam).


                                                                                                                                           41
     2.1.1 Sub-Saharan Africa: Estimated use and regulation of HWT
     The findings indicate that there is wide variation in HWT use among countries in the African region, ranging
     from 4 % in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 49 % of the population in Rwanda (Annex 2). Consistent with
     previous reports on HWT use (Rosa & Clasen 2010; WHO, 2014a), apart from boiling, chlorination remains the
     most common method of treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such chlorination is often associated with emergencies
     and disease outbreaks. In areas where HWT use (typically chlorination) has been sustained this has been
     largely as a result of focused social marketing efforts or driven by non-governmental organization intervention
     programs. While both imported and locally manufactured filters are available, their use is not widespread. The
     former are typically membrane, siphon1 or combination filters, while the local filters mainly comprise biosand2
     and ceramic pot filters.



          BOX 9
          Strengthening regulation in Ethiopia

          Under the umbrella of the ‘One WASH Programme’, which aims to achieve universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH),
          the Government of Ethiopia has set a target to increase access to HWT and safe storage to 77 %, by 2015. However, with only an
          estimated 9.1 % of the population reporting using HWT and safe storage, this target will not be achieved. Part of such efforts will
          necessitate strengthening regulation which does not include performance testing and is limited in scope to assessing the constituents
          of chlorine-based products. Other key areas that need addressing include product labelling, clear responsibilities among the different
          Government laboratories, ministries and regulatory bodies, lessening the time and burden of registering new products and support
          for use and evaluation of HWT in the field. WHO seeks to support Ethiopia in addressing a number of these issues and has started
          with technical training of laboratories to assess performance.




     The regulatory environment
     The data reviewed for some of the countries suggests that while HWT products are regulated in some form, such
     regulation is limited in scope. These findings confirm an earlier WHO survey of HWT policies and regulations
     which found that of the 22 African countries that responded, only 50 % regulated HWT in any way and only 40 %
     did any kind of microbiological testing (WHO, 2012). Among the countries that do regulate HWT technologies in
     some form, such regulation is largely limited to chemical disinfectants and focused on the chemical constituents
     rather than on performance and ability to remove pathogens of concern (Box 9 and 10).



          BOX 10
          Supporting implementation of a national HWT Strategy in Ghana

          The Ghana National Strategy for Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage was launched in 2014, and seeks to reduce waterborne
          disease and achieve health for all by 2025. To achieve this, the Strategy seeks to increase awareness and practice of HWT and safe
          storage and facilitate use of appropriate and effective technologies (Republic of Ghana, 2014). A national HWT and safe storage
          taskforce has been established to implement the strategy and facilitate the development of HWT performance standards, as well
          as to develop certification and product labelling system to aid users in making informed purchasing choices. Currently, there is no
          comprehensive microbiological performance testing and, like Ethiopia, chlorine regulation is done by the national food and drug
          authority, while filters are reviewed by the national standards authority. WHO is working on developing a plan of action to support
          Ghana on the identified priorities.



     1 Siphon filters rely on gravity to force water through a ceramic filter element. The ceramic filter element is typically attached to a plastic tube or hose, and the siphoning
       action pulls contaminated water through the filter and tube into a collection vessel.
     2 Biosand filters use a combination of physical and biological mechanisms to remove microorganisms from drinking-water. The filter media comprises layers of sand and
       gravel and a biological layer (schmutzdecke) through which contaminated water passes.

2.1.2 Asia: Estimated use and regulation of HWT
Of the eight countries reviewed within the South-East Asian and Western Pacific regions, HWT use ranges from
8 % in Bangladesh to 87 % in Viet Nam (Annex 2). Boiling is, by far, the most common method of HWT, followed
by filtration. The filter market has grown significantly in China, Vietnam (Box 11) and India (Box 12) in particular.



     BOX 11
     Rising filter markets and public-private partnerships in Viet Nam

     While boiling is reportedly practiced by over 80% of the population, the use of filters has tripled over the past four years and is now
     reportedly used in 17 % of households. The growth in the use of filters is attributed, in part, to an increased awareness and desire
     by consumers for safer water through use of HWT. Additionally, the waiving of import taxes for products from certain South Asian
     countries under the Regional Free Trade Agreement allows imported filters from countries like South Korea and China to be highly
     competitive. In turn, filters are widely available in supermarkets and trade shops in urban and peri-urban areas. Key challenges are
     the weak markets in remote areas, and achieving correct and consistent use of HWT. To address these challenges, the government
     is working with key partners and stakeholders including UNICEF to promote Public Private Partnerships for HWT and safe storage
     in remote rural Viet Nam.




The regulatory environment
As with the African countries reviewed, HWT regulation in Asian countries is generally weak. Among the
seven countries reviewed, only two have a vetted and funded regulatory mechanism that is in place or is being
established (Annex 3). There are some encouraging examples, however, where there is growing recognition of
the need for regulation of products.



     BOX 12
     Consumer demand for HWT regulation in India

     With the growth of the filter market in India, consumers are also demanding greater product safety and regulation. India recently
     developed harmonized national HWT evaluation protocols, although product testing under these protocols is currently voluntary.
     However, there is increasing pressure from consumer advocate groups that testing become mandatory to protect consumers from
     spurious product claims.




2.2 Scaling up use of quality assured HWT products
Beyond verifying the microbiological performance of HWT products, a number of parallel efforts at the national
level are necessary to ensure that potential health gains from HWT are realized. The three main priorities to
support scaling up of quality assured HWT products are:

• stronger and more comprehensive regulations;

• increasing availability of quality HWT products; and

• broader enabling environment support including use of targeted market approaches, smart subsidies, and
  consumer understanding and behaviour change1.

     2.2.1 Strengthening regulation
     WHO is encouraging all Member States to fast-track certification of products that have been tested under the
     Scheme. In addition, WHO is developing training packages and piloting their use with national laboratories in
     conducting complimentary testing of HWT products, especially local ones that would not be tested under the
     international Scheme (Box 14). Finally, WHO is working to develop best practice tools for assisting countries
     in strengthening their regulatory structures, including improving the labelling of products to enable more
     informed choice.

          capacity of laboratory staff in testing local HWT products, including testing against a
          wider range of pathogens and exploring a variety of candidate microbes under different
          environmental conditions and technologies to support simple protocol development.
          The first of these training workshops was conducted in August 2015, and the modules
          can be accessed at: http://www.who.int/household_water/scheme/en/




     2.2.2 Increasing availability of quality HWT products
     Increasing access to quality HWT products involves both reducing the costs and time of importing internationally
     recognized products and improving the quality of locally manufactured products. In some situations, such as
     conflict zones or after natural disasters, locally procured products may be the only option. Such products are
     largely filters (ceramic, mineral pot and biosand) but may also include others such as flocculant-disinfectants
     and sodium hypochlorite solutions. The performance of such local products can vary widely depending on the
     manufacturing process (Box 15). Thus, WHO is working to understand the key variants affecting performance
     and strengthening quality assurance and quality control at local manufacturing plants through implementation
     of best manufacturing practices checklists and frequent spot-check testing of products. This involves working
     with partners such as the Ceramics Manufacturing Working Group and the Centre for Affordable Water and
     Sanitation Technology and its partners.




44   WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
Increasing access also involves understanding where, and by whom, HWT is used and better targeting of
resources. To support field monitoring and use of monitoring data to improve programme implementation,
WHO and UNICEF developed a toolkit which provides an overall framework for planning, conducting, and
utilizing monitoring and evaluation to inform smarter HWT and safe storage implementation. The focus of the
toolkit (WHO/UNICEF, 2012a) is on easily assessed measures of use that can be done through observation and
chlorine residual assessments. WHO is working with partners in the aforementioned Network to implement
and share results from use of the toolkit. In addition, WHO is exploring how to establish national consumer
feedback mechanisms to facilitate collection and action on information regarding the ongoing performance of
HWT products.



   BOX 15
   Strengthening manufacture of quality local products

   Locally manufactured technologies are often difficult to evaluate in a global scheme
   because of variability in manufacturing processes, materials used, etc. Evaluating the
   performance of biosand filters (BSFs) presents a particular challenge due to the relatively
   long period required for pre-conditioning prior to testing. Therefore, while BSFs have not
   been evaluated in Round I of the Scheme, they are an important HWT option to consider.
   Health impact studies have found that BSFs generally reduce diarrhoea (Fabiszewski de
   Aceituno et al., 2012; Stauber et al., 2011; Tiwari et al., 2009; Sobsey et al., 2008). WHO is
   working with the Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology and its partners
   to develop a quality management process for the local production and installation of BSFs
   worldwide. Some of the activities include developing a process to validate the competency
   of filter technicians, standardizing sand selection through sand sieve analysis and flow
   rate control (Davis et al., 2013).




2.2.3 Supporting the broader enabling environment
WHO is engaging with partners who continue to innovate and learn about how to segment the market to reach
particular groups, when and where to provide subsidies (defined in Box 16), and how to better understand consumer
needs and reflect this understanding through improved design, user support and communication of HWT benefits.

Among the key partners in this area are Antenna Technologies and Aqua for All, who are working on mechanisms
to provide safe water to the poor in a sustainable and affordable manner through innovative HWT and safe
storage products, and building on user experiences and satisfying user aspirations for convenience, status and
aesthetics. Such market innovation starts with suitable products whose effectiveness has been verified and relies,
also, on market creation (from sales, retail and sustainable supply chain) that would serve poor populations and
promote consistent and correct use of the products. For example, in Conakry in the Republic of Guinea, Antenna
Technologies has been supporting widespread production of sodium hypochlorite flasks in both urban and rural
areas. Collaboration with last mile delivery companies has enabled access to fairly remote areas and, through
social marketing, approximately 3.5 million flasks are delivered to five provinces each year.



   BOX 16
   Smart subsidies in HWT

   Smart subsidies are all subsidies that enhance the markets and do not undercut the profitability of the supply chain – especially the
   last mile delivery. They include financing through public-private partnership, social marketing campaigns that create markets but
   do not hamper them, support for research and development, micro-credits, etc.




                                                                                                                                           45
     At a business level, support and innovative financing are important in increasing access to treatment products,
     e.g. through research and development support, field studies, and social marketing and smart subsidies. Strong
     enabling environments are critical in order for these approaches to successfully reach significant scale. This
     requires engagement and clear division of roles between governments and key partners (Heierli and Osborn,
     2014) to ensure that effective, affordable and appropriate HWT options become available and that solutions
     are delivered and used sustainably.

     Governments can play a key role in developing and implementing national HWT and safe storage policies and
     programmes, which are vital for raising awareness and providing the impetus to take action and induce behaviour
     change (Box 17). The private sector and implementing agencies are critical for delivering the solutions, be it
     through sale of water treatment products or the last mile delivery in the poorest most disadvantaged households.



          BOX 17
          Supporting countries in creating enabling environments for HWT and safe storage

          Supporting countries in developing and
          implementing national HWT and safe
          storage policies and programmes is critical
          for raising government awareness and
          providing the impetus to take action. The
          Network has been assisting in such efforts
          through regional integration and policy
          strengthening workshops. Since Phase II
          of the Network (2011 to date), five regional
          workshops have been held in East, West
          and Southern Africa, and South and South-
          East Asia, involving almost 20 countries.
          These workshops bring together officials
          from the ministries of health and water as
          well as implementers, manufacturers and researchers to exchange ideas and solutions for scaling-up and sustaining HWT and safe
          storage. One notable outcome from these workshops has been the establishment of national policies on HWT and safe storage by
          various countries, including Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania.

3. Conclusion and lessons
learned
T
      he findings of Round I highlight three important points. First, a number of products were found to meet WHO
      recommended performance criteria. Second, not all products perform equally and there are several instances
      of overstatement of claims and unclear use instructions which may mean such products have limited or
no public health benefit. Third, many low-income countries have limited capacity to verify performance claims
or effectively regulate the sale and distribution of products. However, as highlighted from findings of the market
assessment, there are countries such as Ghana, Ethiopia and Viet Nam showing strong interest in strengthening
regulation, In addition, many HWT partners are working to support enabling environment issues on market
development, smart subsidies, consumer understanding and behaviour change to ensure HWT products reach
and are used by those that need them the most. Only once all the elements of effective HWT are achieved will
the ultimate goal of significantly reducing the burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking–water be met.

Lessons learned from Round I of the Scheme include balancing the goals of technical rigour, programme efficiency
and financial viability. In response, WHO has worked to simplify the testing protocols, to reduce testing costs
and better support use of similar protocols in developing countries, all with the view to allow more products to
be tested. At the national level, WHO is focusing on sensitizing governments to the broader goals of reducing
health risks associated with drinking-water and translating the recommendations in the WHO GDWQ into
actionable strategies, targets and community efforts.

     Annexes

     Annex 1: The Scheme evaluation procedure
     Evaluation of HWT technologies under the Scheme is done according to harmonized protocols. The evaluation
     may consider existing data, providing that such data have been generated by independent testing laboratories
     using quality assurance protocols that are similar to those of the Scheme.


     Initial screening of dossiers
     Evaluation of HWT products under the Scheme is based on a voluntary submission of an EOI and product dossier
     by manufacturers to WHO. The dossier contains supporting documents and information describing the product
     and its specifications, its operation and maintenance, evidence of user uptake and strategies for reaching the
     underserved and those most in need. Invitations to interested manufacturers to submit EOIs are published on
     the WHO website and through various listservs. The criteria for manufacturers to be eligible to submit an EOI
     are as follows:

     • have an established manufacturing process for market-ready HWT products;

     • provide evidence of compliance with ISO 9001:28 Quality management systems;

     • use materials in their products for which the properties are well described in regards to their safety and
       composition; and

     • have developed robust and tested operation and use instructions, which are used as the basis for developing
       product specific test plans.

     Evaluation under the Scheme is fee-based, but with subsidies awarded by WHO subject to the availability of
     funds. The criteria for determining whether a manufacturer is eligible for a subsidy are outlined in the Procedure
     for Evaluation (WHO, 2014c). Priority products for evaluation under the Scheme are those that are low cost,
     appropriate for low-income settings, generally ‘free-standing’ and do not require installation and which only
     treat sufficient water to serve a limited number of individuals a day (as would be typically used in a household
     or small public facility such as a tertiary healthcare centre). EOIs that meet these initial screening criteria are
     selected for review by the Scheme Secretariat at WHO with input and advice from the IAC.


     Dossier review
     The dossier review seeks to determine whether HWT products meet the WHO performance recommendations,
     and considers product data and information on safety, performance and user testing, as well as production and
     quality control processes of their manufacture. Key criteria under consideration include the following:

     • Do the existing laboratory data demonstrate that the product meets WHO microbiological performance
       criteria for all three classes of pathogens?




50   WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
• Are the details of testing protocols used, and test methods comparable to those of the Scheme?

• Is there sufficient evidence to demonstrate the independence of the testing laboratory and quality management
  procedures employed?

• Is there demonstrated uptake of the product (e.g. through field studies of acceptability or reported sales
  volumes)?

Depending on the extent to which the above-mentioned criteria are met, three possible recommendations on
how a product will be evaluated may be made:

1. full laboratory testing: criteria are not met, and testing against all three pathogen classes at one of the designated
   testing laboratories of the Scheme is required; or

2. abbreviated laboratory testing and desk review of existing data: criteria are partially met, and a combination of
   testing against one or two of the pathogen classes at one of the designated testing laboratories of the Scheme
   and review of existing data is required; or

3. desk review of existing data only: the criteria are fully met, and no laboratory testing under the Scheme is
   required1.

WHO has developed technology-specific test protocols which are then adapted by the laboratories to create
specific product needs and use requirements. WHO reviews these product specific protocols and shares them
with the manufacturer for comment before testing commences.

Considering the advice of the IAC, WHO communicates the outcome of the evaluation to the manufacturer. A
list of all evaluated products and their performance level is published on the WHO website, including the relevant
test protocols for each of the technology classes.


The Scheme evaluation protocols
The Evaluating household water treatment options: health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications
(WHO, 2011a) provides guidance on the development of testing protocols for HWT. It is from this document
that the Scheme harmonized and technology-specific testing protocols were developed (Figure A.1).

The harmonized protocol outlines the general testing methods, including number of samples, characteristics
of test waters, microbiological organisms, sampling points and reporting formats. However, a wide range of
HWT technologies exist (e.g. chemical disinfectants; filtration devices, UV and solar disinfectants) and various
parameters such as turbidity, temperature and contact time may influence their microbiological performance
(WHO, 2011a). Therefore, based on this harmonized testing protocol, additional protocols that are specific to
the various HWT technologies have been developed that take such factors into account2. Finally, from these
technology-specific testing protocols, the testing protocol for products within the respective technology classes
are developed in accordance with the product use instructions.




1 Several products evaluated in Round I have been on the market for some time and had already undergone extensive testing. Thus, evaluation of these products consisted
  of reviews of existing data only. It is however anticipated that future evaluations of other products will require some testing.

     Test organisms
     The reference organisms of the Scheme were selected on the basis of a number of key technical and practical
     considerations (Table A.1), including evidence of their role and significance in disease prevalence, availability
     of QMRA data on dose-response relationships in humans and disease burden, sensitivity to HWT treatment
     processes, cost of purchasing the pathogens for laboratory testing and ease of handling of the pathogens by
     laboratory staff.

52   WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
In choosing the two virus surrogates, MS2 and phiX174, consideration was given to the wide variety of different
viruses’ resistance to potential treatment processes (given that viruses vary greatly in terms of size), isoelectric
points, type of nucleic acid, presence of lipids and the structure of the proteins in the capsid. Additionally, some
treatment systems have more than one mechanism that would remove/inactivate viruses. For example, a filtration
system (activated carbon) may be combined with a UV light system. Some viruses may be more easily removed
by adsorption to the activated carbon than others, and others may be more resistant to the UV light. For these
reasons and as non-pathogenic microorganisms are preferred, two bacteriophages with differing characteristics
and responses to treatment processes are used in the assessment of the performance of HWT products, and
the virus performance claim is based on the poorest log reduction of the two.

Ideally, surrogates would be chosen for all classes as they are easier and cheaper to use and can more easily be
applied to capacity building efforts; two important considerations for making the protocol accessible to range of
laboratories. However, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to support selecting surrogates for all classes
of pathogens. WHO will continue to review the evidence with the aim of simplifying the testing protocols.


Test waters
Testing under the Scheme is intended to model, as far as possible, the variety of conditions under which HWT
products are used, including the quality of source waters. Products are evaluated are against two types of test
waters: general test water representing high quality groundwater or rainwater and the non-aggressive phase of
testing; and challenge test water with more aggressive water specifications generally representative of surface
water (Table A.2).

The distinguishing characteristics for these two waters are the specifications for total residual chlorine, pH,
turbidity, temperature, total dissolved solids, total organic carbon and alkalinity1. The general test water is not
technology-specific, and is the same for all products. The challenge test water, however, is based on the product’s
technology.

54   WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies
Annex 3: Overview of the regulatory environment for HWT
This annex outlines provides an overview of HWT reported use and the policy and regulatory environment for
countries reviewed in Sub-Saharan Africa (Table A.5) and Asia (Table A.6). Countries were assessed along five
key policy and regulation elements that included:

• inclusion of HWT and safe storage in national policies;

• mandatory regulation of chlorine based HWT technologies;

• mandatory regulation of non-chlorine based HWT technologies (e.g. filters);

• availability of HWT standards and/or certification of HWT technologies; and

• committee/ structure in place at the national level to guide HWT coordination within the country.

These criteria were drawn from a global survey report (WHO, 2012) that assessed countries based on criteria
for policy readiness in scaling up HWT. Countries were categorized into three tiers: those with four to five of the
above-mentioned elements in place were considered in tier 1, those with three elements were categorized as
tier 2, and those with less than three elements were categorized as tier 3.

 Democratic Republic of   HWT and safe storage is included in national policies and products are regulated. There is a committee/ structure in place
 Congo                    for HWT coordination (WHO, 2012).
 Ethiopia                 Chemicals are regulated by the Ethiopian Food, Medicine, Health Care Administration, while filters are unregulated. HWT
                          and safe storage is included in national policies and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT coordination (WHO, 2012).
 Ghana                    A HWT strategy has been published with government and private partner roles defined. Ghanaian law does not include
                          regulation of HWT products, however, chemicals are regulated by the Food & Drug Administration. A working group is in
                          place to develop a comprehensive regulatory approach for HWT.
 Kenya                    HWT and safe storage is included in national policies and products are regulated (WHO, 2012) by Kenya Bureau of Standards
                          (KEBS). However, KEBS’s capacity to test and regulate products is limited, given the volume of products coming into the
                          country (Kariuki, personal interview, 2015a). Due to porous borders, there are unaccredited HWT products on the market. A
                          HWT and safe storage technical working group is in place to develop a regulatory approach for HWT and to draft monitoring
                          and evaluation guidelines.
 Tanzania                 HWT and safe storage is included in national policies, and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT coordination (WHO,
                          2012). Tanzania Standards Bureau certifies HWT and safe storage products and technologies (voluntary standards). Proctor
                          & Gamble and Population Services International note a requirement for registration of products before distribution.
 Uganda                   HWT and safe storage is included in national policies, and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT coordination
                          (WHO, 2012). Mandatory standards (US 201:2008) for water treated by conventional methods (filtration, chlorination,
                          sedimentation) are provided by the Uganda National Bureau of Standards.
                                                                                     Tier 2
 Mozambique               HWT and safe storage is included in national policies (WHO, 2012) and all products coming into the country are noted as
                          being evaluated by the Ministry of Health (WHO/UNICEF, 2012b).
 Nigeria                  HWT products are reported as being regulated by the Federal Ministry of Health (Olokun, 2013). Standards/ certification are
                          available and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT coordination (WHO, 2012).

         Malawi                             HWT is implied by national policies though not explicitly stated (Rowe, 2012). The Catalogue of Standards developed by the
                                            Malawi Bureau of Standards includes standards regarding control and surveillance of drinking-water networks and bottled
                                            water but does not include criteria for water treatment products (Rowe, 2012, Malawi Bureau of Standards, 2015).
         South Africa                       HWT and safe storage is not included in national policies and there is no standing committee in place for coordination
                                            of HWT (WHO, 2012). Requirements for drinking-water treatment units to meet microbiological and other standards are
                                            specified (South African Bureau of Standards, 2006).

         India                              HWT specific testing standards for chemicals and filters were issued February, 2015. Currently, standards are voluntary,
                                            though advocacy groups and WASH stakeholders are working towards making testing and certification mandatory
                                            (Labhastewara, personal interview, 2015). The Bureau of Indian Standards provides product certification.
         Viet Nam                           HWT and safe storage is included in national policies. Chemical disinfectants are regulated by Ministry of Health. Standards/
                                            certification are available for HWT and safe storage technologies, and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT
                                            coordination.

         Bangladesh                         HWT and safe storage is included in Bangladesh WSP. The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution provides voluntary
                                            certification and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT coordination (WHO, 2012).
         Cambodia                           Cambodia reports that HWT policies are included in national policies and a committee/ structure is in place for HWT
                                            coordination. There is no mandatory regulation of HWT products or certification standards (WHO, 2012) but standards are in
                                            the process of being finalized for HWT and safe storage technologies (Rosenboom, 2010).
         Indonesia                          HWT and safe storage is included in national policies with a committee/ structure in place for HWT coordination (WHO,
                                            2012). Flocculant-disinfectants such as P&G Purifier of Water are registered with the government.
