1. Summary
This technical brief provides information on the uses and significance of turbidity in drinking-water and is intended for regulators
and operators of drinking-water supplies.

Turbidity is an extremely useful indicator that can yield valuable information quickly, relatively cheaply and on an ongoing basis.
Measurement of turbidity is applicable in a variety of settings, from low-resource small systems all the way through to large and
sophisticated water treatment plants.

Turbidity, which is caused by suspended chemical and biological particles, can have both water safety and aesthetic implications
for drinking-water supplies. Turbidity itself does not always represent a direct risk to public health; however, it can indicate the
presence of pathogenic microorganisms and be an effective indicator of hazardous events throughout the water supply system,
from catchment to point of use. For example, high turbidity in source waters can harbour microbial pathogens, which can be
attached to particles and impair disinfection; high turbidity in filtered water can indicate poor removal of pathogens; and an
increase in turbidity in distribution systems can indicate sloughing of biofilms and oxide scales or ingress of contaminants through
faults such as mains breaks.

Turbidity can be easily, accurately and rapidly measured, and is commonly used for operational monitoring of control measures
included in water safety plans (WSPs), the recommended approach to managing drinking-water quality in the WHO Guidelines
for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2017). It can be used as a basis for choosing between alternative source waters and for assessing
the performance of a number of control measures, including coagulation and clarification, filtration, disinfection and management
of distribution systems.

Turbidity is also an important aesthetic parameter, with turbidities of 4 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and above being visible,
and affecting the appearance and acceptability of drinking-water to consumers.

Although turbidity can be used in multiple ways within WSPs, this versatility can cause confusion and misinterpretation. Each of
the relationships between turbidity and drinking-water quality is different and needs to be considered separately.

2. General description
Turbidity describes the cloudiness of water caused by suspended particles such as clay and silts, chemical precipitates such as
manganese and iron, and organic particles such as plant debris and organisms (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012; Health Canada, 2012).
As turbidity increases, it reduces the clarity of water to transmitted light by causing light to be scattered and adsorbed. Typically
expressed in NTU, turbidity is a practical parameter that can be measured using online devices, and benchtop and portable
meters or turbidity tubes (e.g. in small communities where resources are limited). Turbidities below 4 NTU can only be detected by
instruments; however, at 4 NTU and above, a milky-white,1 muddy, red-brown or black suspension can be visible and can reduce
the acceptability of drinking-water.

The sources of turbidity are diverse, and many of the constituent particles (e.g. clays, soils and natural organic matter) are harmless.
However, turbidity can also indicate the presence of hazardous chemical and microbial contaminants, and have significant
implications for water quality (Table 2). The implications will vary depending on the characteristics of the turbidity. In addition, as
indicated in Table 2, the point of detection is important in considering potential impacts. Elevated turbidity in source waters can
signal pollution events in the catchment (e.g. heavy rain, spills or contamination of groundwater), and can challenge the effectiveness
of coagulation and clarification, filtration and disinfection. Failure to meet turbidity targets for filtered water can indicate the possible
presence of pathogens in drinking-water, and increased turbidity in distribution systems can represent detachment of biofilms and
oxide scales or entry of external sources of contamination. Each source needs to be considered in context because the treatment
and management implications will vary (Table 2).

    Milky-white suspensions can also be caused by supersaturated air being released from water. Unlike turbidity, suspensions of air clear from the bottom of a glass upward. The air
    could have been introduced during pipe repair or could have been released following changes in water pressure.

3. Measurement of turbidity
One of the advantages of turbidity is that it can be measured easily using simple, low-cost manual comparators, and portable,
benchtop and online automated meters. These devices measure scattering or attenuation of light from a range of sources
(e.g. natural light, tungsten lamps or light-emitting diodes), with the results being expressed in units that reflect the method
of measurement (Table 3). The nephelometric method is the most common, with turbidity being expressed as NTU. Other
units include formazin nephelometric units,1 formazin attenuation units, Jackson turbidity units and turbidity units. The various
turbidity units are related, and often similar, but not always equivalent. This is particularly true for Jackson turbidity units and
turbidity units which are based on visual assessments while the other units are meter readings. Standardized methods –
including guidance on sample collection and calibration standards – have been established for various types of turbidity meters
(APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012; Health Canada, 2012; ISO, 2016). As turbidity measured in collected samples can change as a result of
temperature variations, particle flocculation and sedimentation, samples should be analysed as soon as possible using online
or onsite meters at treatment plants and portable meters in the field (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012; Health Canada, 2012; ISO, 2016).

Electronic meters are in common use; however, in smaller rural and remote communities, issues can include cost, sources of
electricity, and availability of technical and servicing support and replacement parts. The whole-of-life costs – including cost of
replacement parts as well as consumable items such as calibration standards and batteries – must be carefully considered when
selecting an appropriate technology for turbidity measurement in low-resource settings. Turbidity tubes represent simpler, lower
cost alternatives but sensitivity is a limitation, with a lower limit of 5 TU (WHO, 2008). This limits the effectiveness of turbidity tubes
for operational monitoring of processes such as filtration; nevertheless, turbidity tubes remain among the most appropriate means
of turbidity measurement in lower resource settings. Despite more recent developments in the application of smart-phone optical
sensors for turbidity measurement, a significant technology gap remains with respect to durable, low-cost, low-technology turbidity
meters that are sensitive below 1 NTU.

Accuracy and sensitivity are always important, but are usually more critical when measuring turbidities below 1 NTU; for example,
when used to measure the operation of filtration technologies, where acceptable performance is determined by meeting targets
of 0.3 NTU or below (USEPA, 2006; Health Canada, 2012). Online, benchtop or portable instruments are available that can reliably
measure turbidities below 0.1 NTU. Although different instruments can produce some degree of variability, turbidity meters can
deliver consistent and reliable results, provided that careful calibration and maintenance, standard operating procedures and analyst
training are implemented (Health Canada, 2012).

defects in membrane structure that may allow passage of pathogens. It has been suggested that laser turbidity meters, although
more costly, are more sensitive and could detect smaller membrane breaches than conventional turbidity meters (USEPA, 2005;
Health Canada, 2012). An alternative that can provide greater assurance about membrane integrity and performance is to augment
turbidity monitoring with less frequent (e.g. daily) but more sensitive direct integrity monitoring, such as pressure decay testing
(USEPA, 2005; 2006).

4.2.3 Disinfection
Turbidity can be used as an operational parameter to assess the likely effectiveness of disinfection, and as a basis for setting
disinfectant doses and modifying contact times (where such modification is possible).

Turbidity above 1–2 NTU reduces the efficacy of chlorination by increasing chlorine demand and potentially shielding
microorganisms from inactivation (LeChevallier et al., 1981; Keegan et al., 2012). While there is evidence that disinfection can be
achieved at higher turbidities, chlorine doses or contact times need to be increased to ensure that adequate Cts1 are achieved
(Keegan et al., 2012). Similarly, turbidity can reduce the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection by reducing UV light
transmission or by shielding microorganisms from inactivation (Christensen and Linden, 2003; Batch et al., 2004; Passantino et al.,
2004; Amoah et al., 2005; Templeton et al., 2007; Cantwell et al., 2008; Kollu and Ormeci, 2012).

Turbidity should ideally be kept below 1 NTU because of the recorded impacts on disinfection. This is achievable in large well-run
municipal supplies, which should be able to achieve less than 0.5 NTU before disinfection at all times and an average of 0.2 NTU or
less, irrespective of source water type and quality. However, keeping turbidity below 1 NTU is not always possible in low-resource
settings including small supplies; in such cases, the aim should be to keep turbidities below 5 NTU. At turbidities above 1 NTU,
higher disinfection doses or contact times will be required to ensure that adequate Ct or UV light intensity is achieved.


4.3 Distribution systems

Turbidity can be included in operational monitoring of water quality in distribution systems as an indicator of integrity, and of good
operation and maintenance of the network (Health Canada, 2012; WHO, 2014). The level of turbidity in distribution systems will vary
depending on the source of supply; the type of treatment; the operating conditions (e.g. pressure fluctuations, and continuous or
intermittent supply); and the characteristics, condition, complexity and integrity of the distribution network. Turbidity targets can
be identified by determining background levels throughout the system when water treatment is functioning effectively and there
are no known faults in the distribution system. Any substantial and unexpected increases above background values should be
immediately investigated to determine cause and significance. This should include investigating customer complaints of increased
turbidity, which may provide an early indication of more serious and widespread public health issues.

    The effectiveness of a disinfectant is based on the combination of dose and contact time with target micro-organisms. Ct is the product of the concentration of a disinfectant in
    water (C in mg/L) and contact time (t in minutes) with water and entrained microorganisms.

                                                                                                                   Such faults and events can include elevated turbidity in water entering the system, loss of integrity (e.g. due to mains breaks),
                                                                                                                   resuspension of sediments and scale, and detachment of biofilms or oxide scales. These events can lead to entry of external

                                                                                                                   Increases in turbidity of stored household water, such as harvested rainwater, can indicate deterioration in water quality.



                                                                                                                   5. Turbidity and aesthetic quality of drinking-water
                                                                                                                   Visible turbidity reduces the aesthetic acceptability of drinking-water. Turbidity can vary in colour and appearance, ranging from
                                                                                                                   milky-white clay-based particles to muddiness from sediments and soils, red-brown iron-based particles and black manganese-
                                                                                                                   based particles. At high levels, turbidity can lead to staining of materials, fittings and clothes exposed during washing.

                                                                                                                   Many consumers equate turbidity with safety, and consider turbid water as being unsafe to drink. This response is exacerbated when
                                                                                                                   consumers have been accustomed to receiving high-quality water. As a guide, “crystal-clear” water has a turbidity below 1 NTU, and
                                                                                                                   water becomes visibly cloudy at 4 NTU and above. This is well above the levels expected in well-maintained and treated surface
                                                                                                                   water supplies, and in most groundwater supplies. Although turbidity may be caused by particles with little health significance,
                                                                                                                   complaints about unexpected turbidity should always be investigated because they could reflect significant faults or breaches in
                                                                                                                   distribution systems.

Aesthetic impacts can lead to indirect health impacts if consumers lose confidence in a drinking-water supply and drink less water,
or choose to use lower turbidity alternatives that may not be safe.



6. Conclusions
Turbidity is an important and versatile operational parameter that should be included in WSPs to support water quality management
from catchment to consumer. It can be used to monitor source water quality, the effectiveness of coagulation and clarification,
filtration and disinfection performance in a water treatment plant, and the effectiveness of distribution system management. At
the household level, it can also be used to assess the appearance and acceptability of drinking-water supplied to consumers as
well as the effectiveness of household water treatment and safe storage.
