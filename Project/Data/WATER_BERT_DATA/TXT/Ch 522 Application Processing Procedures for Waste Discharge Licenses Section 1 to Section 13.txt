                of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Section 2. Applicability of Chapter 2.

Unless specified differently in this rule, the requirements of Chapter 2 of the

        Cfr 124.2] (Code of Maine Rules (2021 Edition))


Section 3. Specialized Definitions. [see 40 CFR 124.2]

(a) In addition to the definitions given in Chapter 520, the definitions below
apply to this chapter.

Consultation with the Regional Administrator (40 CFR 124.62(a)(2)) means
review by the Regional Administrator following evaluation by a panel of the
technical merits of all 301(k) applications approved by the Department. The
panel (to be appointed by the Director of the Office of Water Enforcement
and Permits) will consist of Headquarters, Regional, and State personnel
familiar with the industrial category in question.

UIC means the Underground Injection Control program under Part C of the
Safe Drinking Water Act, including an ``approved program.''

Variance (NPDES) means any mechanism or provision under section 301 or
316 of CWA or under 40 CFR part 125, or in the applicable ``effluent
limitations guidelines'' which allows modification to or waiver of the
generally applicable effluent limitation requirements or time deadlines of
CWA. This includes provisions which allow the establishment of alternative
limitations based on fundamentally different factors or on sections 301(c),
301(g), 301(h), 301(i), or 316(a) of CWA.

(b) The term Director means the Department or Regional Administrator and
is used when the accompanying provision is required of EPA-administered
programs and of State programs under Secs. 123.25 (NPDES) or 145.11
(UIC). The term Regional Administrator is used when the accompanying
provision applies exclusively to EPA-issued permits and is not applicable to
State programs under these sections.

reissuance, or termination of permits. [see 40 Cfr 124.5] (Code of
                  Maine Rules (2021 Edition))

Section 4. Modification, revocation and reissuance, or
termination of permits. [see 40 CFR 124.5]

(a) Permits may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated either at
the request of any interested person (including the permittee) or upon the
Department's initiative. However, permits may only be modified, revoked
and reissued, or terminated for the reasons specified in 38 MRSA § 414-
A(5). All requests shall be in writing and shall contain facts or reasons
supporting the request.

(b) [reserved]

(c)

(1) If the Department tentatively decides to modify or revoke and reissue a
permit under 38 MRSA, Sections 414-A(5) and 341-D or 40 CFR 144.39
(UIC), it shall prepare a draft permit under Section 5 incorporating the
proposed changes. The Department may request additional information
and, in the case of a modified permit, may require the submission of an
updated application. In the case of revoked and reissued permits, the
Department shall require the submission of a new application.

(2) In a permit modification under this section, only those conditions to be
modified shall be reopened when a new draft permit is prepared. All other
aspects of the existing permit shall remain in effect for the duration of the
unmodified permit. When a permit is revoked and reissued under this
section, the entire permit is reopened just as if the permit had expired and
was being reissued. During any revocation and reissuance proceeding the
permittee shall comply with all conditions of the existing permit until a new
final permit is reissued.

(d) If the Department tentatively decides to terminate a permit under 38
MRSA § 414-A(5), it shall issue a notice of intent terminate. A notice of
intent to terminate is a type of draft permit which follows the same
procedures as any draft permit prepared under Section 5.
