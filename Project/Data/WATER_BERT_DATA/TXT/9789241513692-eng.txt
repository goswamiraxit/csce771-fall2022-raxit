1. Introduction
Disinfection of water has greatly contributed to reducing risks to public health from microbiologically-
contaminated drinking-water.

Numerous disinfection techniques have been developed over the centuries that are used in a wide range
of applications, ranging from large and small public drinking-water plants to point-of-entry and point-
of-use (POU) treatment devices.1 Although chlorine has been used for more than 100 years, and several
other disinfectants have been studied extensively, in many cases questions remain with respect to the
optimization of biocidal effectiveness under a range of conditions (i.e. efficacy), the chemistry of the
formation and toxicological significance of disinfection by-products (DBPs), interactions with other
water components, and the biocidal effectiveness and toxicology of disinfectant residuals. Chemical
disinfectants can react with natural organic matter or break down to produce unwanted by-products.
Many newer products and applications are being developed and marketed for use, particularly in
developing countries, however, the same unanswered questions exist about these, including their
efficacy and potential for DBP formation.

Elemental bromine (Br2), bromine monochloride (BrCl), hypobromous acid (HOBr-) and
bromodimethylhydantoin are used in swimming pools and marketed as a replacement for chlorine, with
one advantage being that there are no asthma-related problems for individuals in contact with the
disinfected water (e.g. swimmers and/or lifeguards).2 Bromine in various chemical forms is also used
in water fountains and cooling towers. In general, the use of bromine in potable water disinfection is
very limited and is impeded by costs, concerns about brominated DBPs, as well as a lack of knowledge
on its efficacy in certain areas. However, some applications do exist, as bromine is used to disinfect
potable water in non-residential settings, for example, aboard ships and on oil and gas
drilling/production platforms. Due to the safety risks of handling liquid bromine (i.e. burns to hands
and eyes, release of toxic vapour), it is combined, for example, with dimethylhydantoin (DMH) to form
bromodimethylhydantoin and other polymeric brominated hydantoins for disinfection applications.
Bromodimethylhydantoin is provided as tablets or cartridges which dissolve slowly to release
hypobromous acid. Hypobromous acid can also be generated on site by reaction between sodium
bromide and chlorine. In addition, bromine is also combined with chlorine, both of which are hazardous
and corrosive, to produce bromine monochloride, which is also classified as hazardous and corrosive.3
Polymeric brominated hydantoins provide an immobilized controlled source of bromine release. For
example, an immobilized bromine flow-through product is currently used in POU water treatment
products (see section 2.2.3).

The emphasis of this literature review is to evaluate the available evidence on the biocidal efficacy and
toxicity of bromine (Br2, and other forms) as a water disinfectant. Information included in this review
was obtained using a targeted literature search strategy, with inclusion dates up to November 2013 and
further “ad hoc” searches were carried out up to the closing date for public review (16 December 2016).
Further details of the search strategy are included in Appendix 1.


1 Point-of-use devices treat only the water intended for direct consumption (drinking and cooking), typically at a single tap or
limited number of taps, while POE treatment devices are typically installed to treat all water entering a single home, business,
school, or facility.
2 Although there is some literature relating to health effects associated with dermal exposure of regular swimmers to bromine

in swimming pools, this is beyond the scope of this document.

2. Disinfectant characteristics and efficacy
2.1 Chemistry basics
Bromine, chlorine, iodine, and fluorine belong to the halogen group of elements. All of the halogens
share the common property of being oxidants with seven electrons in their outer shell. As oxidizing
agents, halogens accept an electron to become the analogous halide ion. Different halogens vary in their
oxidation potential. The halogen with the strongest oxidative power is fluorine, followed by chlorine,
bromine, and iodine. Their reactivities are directly correlated with their electronegativities, which are
as follows (based on the Pauling nomenclature of electronegativity values):4

                       fluorine (3.98) > chlorine (3.16) > bromine (2.96) > iodine (2.66).

The reactivities of the given halogens therefore decrease from left to right. Nevertheless, the usefulness
of a particular halogen as a disinfectant is determined not only by its reactivity, but also by its
manageability, selectivity, chemical stability, and other factors including the potential to form by-
products. At ambient temperature, bromine is a brownish-red corrosive liquid. It is the only non-metallic
element that is liquid under Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP5), and evaporates
easily under conditions slightly above SATP as a red vapour with a strong irritating odour resembling
that of chlorine.

2.1.1 Water solubility, taste and odour
Bromine is more soluble in water than iodine, but less so than chlorine. Water solubility is reported to
be 3.55 g/100 mL (West, 1984).

Free halogen residuals usually produce tastes and odours in potable water. Bryan et al. (1973) compared
taste threshold determinations of chlorine, iodine and bromine residuals in water. The threshold taste
values for chlorine residuals varied with pH: 0.075 mg/L at pH 5.0; 0.156 mg/L at pH 7.0; and 0.450
mg/L at pH 9.0. In contrast, threshold taste values for iodine and bromine did not vary appreciably with
pH, ranging from 0.147 to 0.204 mg/L for iodine and 0.168 to 0.226 mg/L for bromine. Chlorine has a
high vapour pressure (5100 mm Hg at 20 oC) and readily volatilizes, especially in the presence of
sunlight or higher temperatures; iodine has a low vapour pressure (1 mm Hg at 38.7 oC) resulting in
little loss by volatilization. Bromine has a vapour pressure between chlorine and iodine of 175 mm Hg
at 20 oC with an odour threshold of 0.05 to 3.5 mg/L (IPCS, 1999).

2.1.2 Chemical speciation of bromine in water and corresponding disinfection powers
Elemental bromine (Br2) disproportionates rapidly in water to give bromide (Br-) and hypobromous
acid (HOBr), which is in equilibrium with hypobromite (OBr-) in a pH-dependent manner (Table 1).

                                            Br2 + 2H2O ↔ HOBr + H3O+ + Br-

                                               HOBr + 2H2O ↔ OBr- + H3O+

Bromide can be further oxidized to form bromate (BrO3-) via a complex series of oxidation/reduction
disproportionation oscillation processes. Bromate is typically associated with use of ozone in water

treatment, but there are situations where it can be formed in chlorinated water systems. Bromate can
also be present as a by-product in hypochlorite from the electrolytic production of chlorine.

The different chemical species vary in their disinfection power. In analogy to hypochlorous acid (HOCl)
and hypochlorite (OCl-), hypobromous acid and hypobromite compounds display antimicrobial activity,
with hypobromous acid being the more effective disinfectant. The most effective pH range for bromine
to operate as a disinfectant is therefore between pH 6.0 and 8.5, when hypobromous acid predominates
(Table 1). As hypobromous acid does not dissociate at alkaline pH as much as hypochlorous acid does,
the disinfection efficacy of bromine is not as pH sensitive as chlorine (most effective pH range between
6.0 and 7.5; Table 1). In addition, bromine and hypobromous acid react with ammonia and amines to
produce bromoamines that are more effective biocides than the corresponding chloramines (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2004a). Thus, bromine has the potential to be a much more effective
disinfectant than chlorine in sewage treatment and in other waters containing ammonia and other
reduced forms of nitrogen.

2.2 Disinfection efficacy of bromine
2.2.1 Microbiocidal efficacy of bromine
In the following section and in Table 2, results from selected studies on the efficacy of bromine are
summarized.

Bromine is primarily used as an alternative disinfectant for swimming pools, spas and cooling tower
water, but not for municipal drinking-water, partly due to cost and partly to concerns about the
formation of brominated DBPs.

However, the disinfection of drinking-water with bromine has been recognized and allowed by the
USEPA since 1976, although not for use as a municipal drinking-water disinfectant.6 The use of

6 In 2010, USEPA issued a Final Registration Review Decision for bromine (Case 4015) stating that the use of bromine to
treat potable water does not trigger the need for a drinking-water assessment. In addition, the USEPA stated that “Bromine is
registered for use to treat/disinfect potable water (examples of potable water system treatment sites include, but are not
restricted to, aboard ships and on oil and gas drilling/production platforms).”

bromine to inactivate bacteria, viruses and protozoa has been reported in a number of laboratory-scale
disinfection studies (Kim, 2014). Early studies on the germicidal action of bromine were reported by
Tanner and Pitner (1939). The authors determined the concentration of free bromine (in the form of
hypobromous acid) required to reduce aerobic spore-forming bacteria, mould spores, yeasts and non-
spore forming bacteria to below detection limits within a set contact time (30 seconds) at room
temperature; for aerobic spore-forming bacteria, the effect of neutral (pH 6.8–7.2) and low (pH 3.5–
4.0) pH was also investigated (Table 2). The authors reported the resistance of the organisms to bromine
to be in the following order (decreasing resistance):

               bacterial spores > mould spores > yeasts and non-spore-forming bacteria.

For each aerobic spore-forming bacterium tested, bromine was 3–4 times more effective at the lower
pH (Table 2).

Goodenough (1964) demonstrated the use of bromine as a disinfectant for swimming pool water. A
residual of 0.8 mg/L greatly reduced (but did not eliminate) total bacterial counts; bactericidal activity
was also shown to increase with decreasing pH within the range pH 7.8–7.0. Initial studies by Lindley
(1966) on bromine efficacy against Escherichia coli and f2 coliphage, which were expanded on by
Krusé et al. (1970), showed that free bromine at a level of 4 mg/L was able to bring about a 5 log10
reduction of E. coli and a 3.7 log10 reduction of f2 coliphage within 10 minutes at pH 7.0 and 0 oC.
Williams et al. (1988) showed that a water-soluble organic N-bromo oxazolidinone was 50 times more
effective against Staphylococcus aureus than the N-chloro analog. A later study also highlighted the
effectiveness of bromine against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at higher temperatures (38 oC) (Clark and
Smith, 1992).

Sharp et al. (1975) assessed the inactivation of reovirus by bromine (in the form of hypobromous acid)
and reported a plateau of resistance after rapid inactivation of reovirus within the first three minutes (3
log10 reduction) using 0.75 mg/L bromine. As treatment continued, the disinfection rate decreased and
finally did not result in further inactivation. Such resistance was not observed when subjecting reovirus
suspensions to light centrifugation; this was probably due to the removal of aggregates (Sharp et al.,
1975). Indeed, the negative impact of aggregates on the disinfection rate was confirmed in a follow-up
study by the same authors, who reported first-order inactivation kinetics at a rate of 103 units/second
for bromine (in the form of hypobromous acid) against reovirus (pH 7.2, 3.3 µM bromine; Sharp et al.,
1976). Whereas this disinfection rate was measured with suspensions of single virus particles,
disinfection efficacy decreased in the presence of small virus aggregates. It was suggested that
aggregates strongly influenced viral resistance to bromine, as is the case with many disinfectants.

Further studies on the effects of virus particle aggregation on the effectiveness of bromine (in the form
of hypobromous acid) disinfection kinetics have been reported by Floyd et al. (1976), using
monodispersed poliovirus type 1 at pH 7.0 and a temperature range of 2 to 20 oC. Greater inactivation
was seen with increasing concentration of bromine (0.6–22 µM) and increasing temperature, with log10
reduction values (LRVs) ranging between 1 to 3.8 for contact times between 6 and 16 seconds. Use of
monodispersed virus particles minimized virus aggregation, which is considered to provide a protective
barrier against disinfection (Scarpino et al., 1972). For comparison, Floyd et al. (1978) demonstrated
the efficacy of hypobromite and molecular bromine against poliovirus, with both bromine species able
to achieve LRVs between 2 to 4 within 4 seconds at 4 oC in buffered water.

The effectiveness of bromine against cysts of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica has been
shown to be greater than chlorine or iodine (Stringer et al., 1975). In addition, evidence on bromine

inactivation of purified Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst infectivity in cell cultures has been reported
(Kim, 2014). However, cystocidal studies assessing the inactivation of the waterborne protozoan
parasite Giardia lamblia by bromine have not been identified.

Both bromine and chlorine will lose free residuals under similar conditions of oxidant demand. This
has been reported for the use of bromine in cooling tower waters (with bromine concentrations of 400
mg/L and pH 7.7) where residual levels below 0.5 mg/L were reached within hours and were seen to be
ineffective against Legionella pneumophila (Thomas et al., 1999). Further examples have been reported
(Johnson & Overby, 1970; Mercado-Burgos et al., 1975). Bromine may be a superior disinfectant to
chlorine when organic matter or ammonium is present as it provides a longer-term release of active
bromine. Bromine has been reported to be more effective than chlorine to inactivate poliovirus in
reclaimed water (derived from tertiary treated wastewater) containing dissolved organic matter and
ammonia (Freund et al., 2010).

2.2.2 Disinfection in the presence of impurities
Bromine combines with ammonia in water to form bromamines, commonly monobromamine (NH2Br),
dibromamine (NHBr2) and tribromamine (NBr3) (Johnson & Overby, 1970; Russell, 2006; Anderson et
al., 1982).

In an early study, Johannesson (1958) demonstrated the effectiveness of monobromamine against E.
coli, with 0.28 mg/L monobromamine achieving a 3.1 log10 reduction in 10 minutes at pH 8.2. Sollo et
al. (1975) and Johnson & Sun (1975) confirmed the efficacy of monobromamine against total coliforms
and E. coli respectively, with Sollo et al. (1975) also reporting increased effectiveness of
monobromamine at higher pH.

Floyd et al. (1978) reported inactivation of poliovirus by tribromamine with > 3 log10 reduction
occurring within seconds to 1 minute of contact time for concentrations between 3 and 50 µM. In
contrast, monobromamine achieved LRVs of 2.3 to > 3 within 1 and 8 minutes of contact time at doses
between 3 and 40 µM. These results indicate that monobromamine is much more effective than
monochloramine for virus inactivation for which comparable LRVs require hundreds of minutes.

Mercado-Burgos et al. (1975) showed bromamines to be effective against Schistosoma mansoni ova,
with a concentration of 25 mg/L (as bromine) achieving complete kill within 15 minutes.

In tertiary treated sewage (alum coagulated secondary effluent) with an ammonia concentration of 33.5
mg/L, poliovirus inactivation at 3 oC was 99% (2 log10 reductions) in 30 minutes by a dose of 3 mg/L
bromine or 10 mg/L dose of chlorine. Estimated times for 2 log10 reductions of bromine at doses of 2,
3 and 5 mg/L were about 10, 30 and 70 minutes, respectively, at both pH 7 and 9. Poliovirus inactivation
by bromine was equally effective at pH 7 and 9, but chlorine effectiveness was lower at pH 9 than 7
(Johnson & Sun, 1975).

Sollo et al. (1975) directly compared the use of bromine and chlorine (present as bromamines and
chloramines) as disinfectants of wastewater effluents. Brominated effluents had consistently lower
levels of total coliforms than the chlorinated effluents. The effectiveness of bromine treatment over
chlorine increased with increasing pH which is considered to be due to the predominance of the more
potent dibromamine species over monobromamine species at higher pH.

A further comparison of the use of bromine and chlorine for disinfection of highly contaminated water
was reported by McLennan et al. (2009). Samples were prepared by mixing 9 volumes of potable non-
disinfected well water with raw sewage with final turbidities averaging 7.5 ± 2.0 nephelometric turbidity
units. When passing water through POU disinfection cartridges with a contact time of 30 minutes, log
reductions for bromine and chlorine were comparable for total coliforms, E. coli, heterotrophic plate
counts, Enterococcus, and Clostridium. However, bromine was shown to be more effective than
chlorine for inactivating coliphages, with LRVs of 1.9 and 1.1, respectively.

2.2.3 Point of use water purification devices using bromine
Many communities in developing countries do not have sufficient funds or infrastructure to adequately
protect drinking-water from faecal contamination, systematically treat water for drinking purposes or
provide safe water at the tap (Coulliette et al., 2010). One option to reduce microbial (and chemical)
threats is household water treatment (HWT) or POU devices comprised of physical (e.g. biosand filter,
ceramic filter) or chemical (e.g. chlorine, flocculation/coagulation) barriers. A number of alternative
systems are available, including some utilizing bromine.

                                                        Part I – Bromine as a drinking-water disinfectant


Halogenated N-halamine media have been developed as part of a household water purification system
which is commercially available and sold throughout India and other countries. Canisters containing
chlorinated DMH or brominated DMH polymers are available; an important feature of these is their
ability to be regenerated by consumers. These have been tested and found to produce minimal amounts
of brominated species (Bridges et al., 2009). The primary function of this disinfection technology is a
contact biocide that is used as a packed bed filter when incorporated into a treatment train. These
polymers have been evaluated for disinfection efficacy; the N-bromamine version was found to be more
effective than the N-chloroamine (Sun et al., 1995). To test the disinfection impact of the media only,
Coulliette et al. (2010) used these polymers without the other toxin removal devices (e.g. filter). The
authors reported that both units were effective against MS2 bacteriophage (with a mean ± standard error
reduction of 2.98 ± 0.26 log10 and 5.02 ± 0.19 log10, respectively) and microcystin toxin (with reductions
of 27.5% and 88.5% to overall mean ± standard error concentrations of 1600 ± 98 ng/L and 259 ± 50
ng/L, respectively). However, the mono-brominated media was seen to be most effective (Coulliette et
al., 2010). Halogenated N-halamine derivatives conjugated on polystyrene beads have been reported to
show broad antimicrobial activity affected by the covalently bound oxidative bromine, not free bromine.
Tested materials have exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against E. coli and bacteriophages MS2
of 7 and approximately 4 log reduction, respectively (Farah et al., 2015). Such devices have also been
shown to be effective with water of poor quality, that is, when contaminated with sewage (Coulliette et
al., 2010; Enger et al., 2016).

2.2.4 Comparison of efficacy with chlorine
The disinfection properties of bromine and chlorine have been previously compared (Keswick et al.,
1978; Keswick et al., 1982; Taylor & Butler, 1982). Although the properties of bromine and chlorine
differ in a number of ways, as described below, they do have many performance characteristics in
common.

The commonalities of bromine and chlorine include:
   • different classes of microorganisms have different susceptibilities (activity against Giardia
       lamblia is unknown); the order of resistance to both bromine and chlorine disinfection from
       least to most resistant is:
                bacteria < viruses < bacterial spores < helminth ova and protozoan parasites; and
   • the effectiveness of bromine and chlorine is impacted by temperature, disinfectant
       concentration, contact time, pH and organic and inorganic content.

With regards to the advantages of bromine over chlorine:
   • bromine is more effective in disinfecting bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites at higher pH
       levels (pH 9 or 9.5) and in the presence of ammonia;
   • bromine provides greater protection across a wider pH range; and
   • bromine is more effective for poor quality water.

The disadvantages of bromine over chlorine include:
   • the safety of long-term consumption of bromine and its DBPs when used as a drinking-water
        disinfectant is not fully established. At present brominated DBPs are generally considered more
        toxic than chlorinated DBPs (see section 3.6.2); it should be noted that brominated DBPs are
        also produced in chlorinated water in the presence of bromide.

2.2.5 World Health Organization International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water
Treatment Technologies
Assessment of the microbial effectiveness of disinfectants as a household-level water treatment option
should, as far as possible, model actual use conditions in the field; e.g. water of varying quality, realistic
contact times and testing of all three classes of pathogens which cause diarrhoeal disease. In order to
comprehensively assess effectiveness, WHO has set tiered health based performance targets for HWT
products based on reductions of bacteria, viruses and protozoa (WHO, 2011). These targets are based
on microbial risk models using assumed levels of reference pathogens in untreated water. Since 2014,
WHO has been testing products against those performance targets through the WHO International
Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies.7 Box 1 gives further information on the
Scheme and its three tiers of log10 performance targets for bacteria, viruses and protozoans. At the time
of this report, bromine products have not been tested, but may be included in future rounds.

Box 1. WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies

The objective of the Scheme is to independently and consistently evaluate the microbiological
performance of household and POU water treatment technologies. The evaluation considers both
turbid and non-turbid water, and is carried out to manufacturers’ instructions for daily household
use.7 The results of the evaluation are intended to assist and inform Member States and procuring
UN agencies in the selection of these technologies.
The performance targets define treatment requirements in relation to source water quality for each
pathogen class as detailed below.

The performance of HWT products is classified as 3-star (); 2-star (); and 1-star (),
denoting descending order of performance, based on log10 reductions of bacteria, viruses and protozoa
from drinking-water. Performance that does not meet the minimum target is given no stars. Products
that meet 3-star () or 2-star () performance targets are classified as providing
“Comprehensive protection” against the three main classes of pathogens which cause diarrhoeal
disease in humans. The use of these products is encouraged where there is no information on the
specific pathogens in drinking-water (and a prudent approach is to protect against all three classes),
or where piped supplies exist but are not safely managed. Products that meet the performance targets
for at least 2-star () for only two of the three classes of pathogen are given one star () and are
classified as providing “Targeted protection”. In general, the use of these products may be appropriate
in situations where the burden of diarrhoeal disease is high due to known classes of pathogens, such
as a cholera outbreak.

3. Safety and toxicity of bromine
The toxicity of bromine has been reviewed by a limited number of international bodies, and opinions
from the expert bodies on intake are described below. In addition, a detailed assessment of toxicological
literature for bromine was undertaken (to November 2013, with further ad hoc searches to the closing
date for public review [16 December 2016]) and the relevant findings are included here.

The reactivity of bromine in biological systems makes it difficult to separate the effects of bromine
from those of bromine compounds and metabolites that are formed on contact with moisture in mucous
membranes and with tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal system. Due to its reactivity, bromine
does not persist as an element in living tissue, but quickly forms bromide and organobromine
compounds. For a full narrative of the toxicity of bromide, the reader is referred to the background
document prepared by the WHO (2009)8 to inform the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality
(GDWQ). However, for ease of reference, bromide exposure and toxicity data are summarized in the
sections below.

3.1 Human exposure
Bromine occurs naturally as bromide in various chemical forms in the earth’s crust and seawater.
Bromide concentrations in seawater are generally in the range of 65 mg/L to in excess of 80 mg/L in
some confined sea areas (WHO, 2009). Bromide levels in natural waters are highly variable (10–1000
µg/L), although typically range from trace amounts to approximately 0.5 mg/L (von Gunten, 2003).
Groundwaters and reservoirs located near seawater have the potential to have higher levels of bromide
related to the geology; desalinated seawater also has the potential to contain bromine (from 1 mg/L to
several mg/L; WHO, 2017) depending upon the source water and the type of desalination being
practiced.

Bromine is a volatile liquid at room temperature and, therefore, inhalation exposure is considered the
most relevant route of exposure to humans. Minimal exposure may also occur through ingestion of
food, for example, seafood has relatively high levels of bromide. The typical daily dietary intake of
bromide is 2–8 mg in the USA, and 8.4–9.4 mg in the Netherlands (WHO, 2009). Fumigants containing
bromide, mainly methyl bromide, are used for soil disinfection as well as postharvest treatment of plant
products (PHE, 2009).

3.2 Guideline values
3.2.1 WHO drinking-water quality guidelines
The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ) have not evaluated bromine as it quickly
forms hypobromous acid and bromide in water. A drinking-water guideline value has not been proposed
for bromide as it occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health concern (WHO,
2017). However, to provide guidance to Member States, should the chemical be found in drinking-water
or its sources, the GDWQ includes a health-based value of 6 mg/L for adults and 2 mg/L for children.
For bromate, a provisional guideline value of 10 μg/L is included based on achievable analytical
quantitation limits and treatment methods.

  The latest version of the background document is dated 2009 and so will undergo review. However, no new studies were
identified up to December 2016 to amend the findings of the document.

                                                                 Part I – Bromine as a drinking-water disinfectant


3.2.2 Other values
At a joint meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/WHO in 1988, an
acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–1 mg/kg bw (body weight) was established for bromide ion, based
on a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) from a human study reported by Sangster et al. (1986).

The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA, 1997) also utilized the study
by Sangster et al. (1986) to derive an ADI of 0.4 mg/kg bw based on marginal effect within normal
limits of electroencephalograms in females at 9 mg/kg bw per day, including a safety factor of 10 for
population diversity (see section 3.3.3).

The United Kingdom Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the
Environment (COT, 2000) considered dietary intake of bromine. Intake was estimated from the 1997
total diet study as 3.6 mg/person per day (equivalent to 0.06 mg/kg bw per day). The Committee noted
that the upper boundary of the ADI proposed by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations/WHO of 1 mg/kg bw could be taken as a tolerable daily intake. Estimated dietary intakes were
therefore well below the acceptable level, allowing for significant exposure from other routes (EA,
2005).

When used as a pesticide, the USEPA has defined bromide as “exempt from the requirement of
tolerance” (USEPA, 2010).

Most recently, NSF International9 has proposed a combined bromine/bromide action level of 10 mg/L
for drinking-water. The derived maximum contaminant level applies specifically to elemental bromine
and inorganic bromide ion and is considered protective of human health. The maximum contaminant
level does not consider potential formation of bromate or DBPs (NSF, 2011).

3.3 Human toxicity data

3.3.1 Toxicokinetics
3.3.1.1 Absorption
Following inhalation, bromine is absorbed by the lungs (as bromide) and deposition in the lungs is
primarily determined by the water solubility of bromine (IPCS, 1999). Following ingestion, bromide is
rapidly and completely absorbed from the intestine by passive, paracellular transport (HCN, 2005).
Bromide uptake and equilibrium concentrations are interrelated with chlorine levels: as chloride intake
increases, the excretion of bromide increases (WHO, 2009).

No data could be located regarding absorption of bromine vapours via the ocular or dermal routes of
exposure, however it is likely to react on the surface of the body immediately on contact (PHE, 2009).




9 This document was prepared to allow toxicological evaluation of bromine/bromide in drinking-water, as an extractant from

one or more drinking-water system components or as a contaminant in a drinking-water treatment chemical, evaluated under
NSF/ANSI standards.

3.3.1.2 Distribution
Absorbed bromine (as bromide and organobromine chemicals by all routes of exposure) is distributed
widely into various tissues and mainly into the extracellular fluid of the body (PHE, 2009).

3.3.1.3 Metabolism
No data could be identified regarding the metabolism of bromine. However, bromine has been shown
to quickly form bromide in living tissue and is partitioned in the body similarly to chloride. Its presence
is related to the amount of chloride intake (HCN, 2005).

3.3.1.4 Elimination
Bromide is excreted mainly by the kidneys and in small quantities in sweat, tears, and other body
excretions. The biological half-life of bromide has been reported to be between 12 and 30 days in
humans, with that in rats being markedly shorter, at approximately 3 days (HCN, 2005).

3.3.2 Acute toxicity
No median lethal dose (LD50)10 values for bromine or bromide have been reported for humans.

Due to its water solubility, bromine generally produces effects on the upper respiratory tract. However,
inhalation of high concentrations, for example, in confined spaces, may also cause marked effects on
the lower airways. Acute inhalation exposure to bromine results in symptoms of respiratory irritation
including, shortage of breath, cough, choking and wheezing, bronchoconstriction, inflammation of the
oesophagus, and laryngeal spasm; respiratory distress has led to hypoxaemia, metabolic acidosis and
death (DEFRA, 2006). Acute inhalation of high concentrations of bromine vapour has resulted in brown
colouration of the eyes, tongue, and mucous membranes of the mouth as well as catarrh (thick phlegm
or mucus in an airway), salivation, coughing, feeling of suffocation, glottis cramps, hoarseness,
bronchitis and bronchial asthma (USEPA, 2009). Central nervous system effects documented following
overdoses of bromide-containing medicines or fumigants include ataxia, slurred speech, tremor, nausea,
vomiting, lethargy, dizziness, visual disturbances, headaches, impaired memory and concentration,
disorientation, and hallucinations (IPCS).11

Accidental (acute) ingestion of liquid bromine has been associated with haemorrhagic nephritis, with
oliguria or anuria, (reduced or increased urine production respectively) developing within 1 to 2 days
(concentration not stated). Associated injuries due to corrosivity and inhalation of vapour were not
described (PHE, 2009).

Bromine is highly irritating to the skin in both liquid and vapour form. Acute dermal exposure to
bromine results in localized blister formation, brownish discolouration of the skin and slow-healing
ulcers. Appearance of injury is often delayed (Sagi et al., 1985).

Ocular effects following exposure to bromine vapour (0.5 parts per million [ppm]) include stinging and
burning of the conjunctiva and lacrimation, and at higher levels (not stated) photophobia and
blepharospasm (i.e. forcible closure of the eyelids) have been reported (PHE, 2009).

The irritating properties of bromine vapour act to prevent prolonged exposure at high concentrations.
Exposure for 50 minutes at levels of 0.006 ppm (0.04 mg/m3) is associated with some irritation of the

eyes; at levels of 0.2 ppm (1.3 mg/m3), clear irritation of eyes, nose, and throat occurs; and levels of 0.5
ppm (3.3 mg/m3) and above cannot be tolerated due to the severity of these symptoms (Rupp &
Henscler, 1967).

Doses of bromide giving plasma levels of 12 mmol/L (96 mg/L) produce bromism (the chronic state of
bromide intoxication), and plasma levels greater than 40 mmol/L (320 mg/L plasma) are sometimes
fatal. The signs and symptoms of bromism relate to the nervous system, skin, glandular secretions and
gastrointestinal tract (WHO, 2009).

3.3.3 Repeat dose toxicity
Data relating to the effects in humans following chronic exposure (by all routes) to bromine could not
be identified.

The key repeat dose toxicity study in humans for bromide reported by Sangster et al. (1986) and
described in the WHO background document (WHO, 2009), determined a conservative NOEL of 4 mg
sodium bromide/kg bw per day based on marginal effect within normal limits of electroencephalograms
in females at 9 mg/kg bw per day.

3.3.3.1 Systemic effects
No data could be located regarding systemic effects in humans following repeated exposure to bromine
or bromide.

3.3.3.2 Neurotoxicity
No data could be located regarding neurotoxic effects in humans following repeated exposure to
bromine or bromide.

3.3.3.3 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
No data could be located regarding reproductive and developmental effects in humans following
repeated exposure to bromine or bromide.

3.3.3.4 Immunotoxicity
No data could be located regarding immunotoxic effects in humans following repeated exposure to
bromine or bromide.

3.3.3.5 Genotoxicity
No data could be located regarding genotoxic effects in humans following repeated exposure to bromine
or bromide.

3.3.3.6 Carcinogenicity
Bromine and bromide are not listed as carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC). No data are available to assess the carcinogenicity of bromine or bromide in humans.

3.4 Animal toxicity studies
The predominant route of exposure reported in experimental studies to date relate to the inhalation of
bromine. Although not directly relevant to drinking-water, except potentially in cases of aerosol

formation, these studies are included as the main experimental evidence available. In addition, once
inhaled, bromine will be rapidly converted to bromide as for oral intake.

3.4.1 Toxicokinetics
No data could be located regarding the toxicokinetics of bromine or bromide in animals.

3.4.2 Acute toxicity
The 30-minute median lethal concentration (LC50)12 of bromine (vapour) in female (NMRI) mice was
reported to be 174 ppm (1158 mg/m3) with an observation period of 10 days. Generally, mortality
occurred in two distinct periods, either, within the first 4 days (the majority) or between days 8 and 10.
The cause of death in the animals was reported to be either bronchospasm (spasm of bronchial smooth
muscle producing narrowing of the bronchi) or lung oedema (fluid accumulation in the lung) in the
early deaths and peribronchitis (a form of bronchitis consisting of inflammation and thickening of the
tissues around the bronchi) with abscess formation during days 8 to10 (HCN, 2005).

An LC50 of 240 ppm (1569 mg/m3) has been reported in mice (strain and sex not specified) exposed to
bromine vapour for 2 hours (PHE, 2009).

Exposure to 22 and 40 ppm (147 and 266 mg/m3) bromine vapour for 3 hours caused mortality in 0 of
10 and 3 of 10 mice, respectively, while 7 of 10 and 8 of 10 animals, respectively, died within 10 days
following a 6-hour exposure. Bitron & Aharonson (1978) studied the delayed mortality (observation
time: 30–45 days) following a single inhalation event of bromine (in comparison with formaldehyde,
sulphur dioxide, and chlorine). Mice were exposed to bromine concentrations of 240 ppm
(approximately 1600 mg/m3) for 15–270 minutes or to 750 ppm (approximately 5000 mg/m3) for 5–30
minutes. A 100-minute LC50 of 240 ppm and a 9 minute LC50 of 750 ppm were identified.

Cats, rabbits and guinea pigs (strain and sex not specified) exposed to 23 ppm (approximately 150
mg/m3) bromine vapour for 7 hours showed slight irritation of the respiratory tract, whilst at 180 ppm
(1176 mg/m3) CNS function disturbances were seen; a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL)
of 23 ppm (150 mg/m3) was identified (Bingham et al., 2001).

Bromide is considered to have very low acute toxicity. Oral LD50 values of 3500 mg/kg bw have been
reported for the rat and 5020–7000 mg/kg bw for the mouse (WHO, 2009).

3.4.3 Repeat dose toxicity

3.4.3.1 Systemic toxicity
A limited number of experimental studies on the effects of chronic exposure to excess bromine have
been reported:
       •    Exposure to bromine vapours at 33 and 67 mg/m3 (5 and 10 ppm) for 8 hours/day for 3 days did
            not cause mortality, but body weights were decreased; this was attributed to irritation of the
            upper respiratory tract. A LOAEL of 33 mg/m3 (5 ppm) was identified from this study
            (Schlagbauer & Henschler, 1967).
       •    Rats, mice and rabbits (strain and sex not specified) were exposed via inhalation to bromine
            vapour continually for 4 months at doses of 0.13–1.31 mg/m3 (approximately 0.02–0.2 ppm).

        functions. No adverse effects were observed at the lowest dose employed. A no-observed-
        adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 0.13 mg/m3 (0.02 ppm) could be identified from this study
        (Schlagbauer & Henschler, 1967).
    •   Rats (strain and sex not specified) were fed liquid bromine (38%) at 20 mg/kg bw per day in a
        28-day oral study. Clinical signs of salivation and decreased activity were observed, with
        increased red blood cell count, haemoglobin and packed cell volume, increased serum glucose
        and increased urinary volume with protein also being reported (USEPA, 2005a).
The key repeat dose toxicity study identified for bromide, as described in the WHO background
document (WHO, 2009), determined a NOAEL for sodium bromide of 300 mg/kg diet (240 mg/kg diet
as bromide; 12 mg/kg bw per day) based on effects on the thyroid in male Wistar rats. An important
finding of this study was the increased toxicity of sodium bromide in rats fed a low-chloride diet, with
toxicity being around 10 times higher than for rats on a diet containing standard chlorine levels.

3.4.3.2 Neurotoxicity
No data could be located regarding neurotoxic effects in animals following repeated exposure to
bromine or bromide.

3.4.3.3 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Ivanov et al. (1976) reported that a 4-hour exposure to bromine vapour at 15 ppm affected
spermatogenesis in male mice; further details were not reported.

In a three-generation reproduction study (two litters per generation), Wistar rats fed sodium bromide at
19 200 mg/kg bw showed complete infertility. Fertility and offspring viability were also reduced at
4800 mg/kg diet. No treatment-related effects were observed in reproductive performance, viability or
body weight of the offspring in the second and third generations bred only from the groups dosed of 0,
75, 300 and 1200 mg/kg diet. Relative adrenal weight was significantly reduced in adult (F0) females
at 4800 and 1200 mg/kg feed but effects on other organs did not show a clear pattern of dose-response
(WHO, 2009).

No experimental studies relating to the developmental toxicity of bromine were identified.

3.4.3.4 Immunotoxicity
No data could be located regarding immunotoxic effects in animals following repeated exposure to
bromine or bromide.

3.4.3.5 Genotoxicity (in vivo)
No data could be located regarding genotoxic effects in animals following repeated exposure to
bromine or bromide. (See 3.4.4 for in vitro genotoxicity studies.)

3.4.3.6 Carcinogenicity
No experimental studies relating to the carcinogenicity of bromine or bromide were identified. Studies
are underway to assess the role of bromide in the cancers of the thyroid and testes mesothelium from
the metabolism of bromate to bromide in high dose tests (J. Cotruvo, personal communication; 1 April
2016).

3.4.4 In vitro toxicity studies
Liquid bromine, tested at a concentration of 38 % and a volume of 10 μg/plate, was positive in the
Salmonella typhimurium microsome reverse mutation assay with strains TA 1537 and TA 100 in the
absence of S9 and with strain TA 1537 in the presence of S9 activation. As would be expected from its
reactivity, bromine was cytotoxic for all strains with and without metabolic activation at more than
3333 μg/plate (USEPA 2005a).

Sodium and ammonium bromide were studied in an Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strains
TA98 and TA100. At dose levels of 0.001–10 mg/plate, both with and without metabolic activation, no
mutagenic effect was observed (WHO, 2009).

3.5 Vulnerable populations
No information on the possible impact of bromine or bromide on vulnerable populations was identified.

3.6 Toxicity of brominated disinfection by-products
3.6.1 Formation and occurrence of brominated disinfection by-products
When present in water, either as part of the ambient conditions or when used as a disinfectant, bromine
and bromide have the ability to form brominated DBPs. The common source of brominated DBPs is
chlorination of water containing bromide. The bromide is oxidized by chlorine to hypobromous acid
which rapidly halogenates organic matter, producing the following brominated and mixed halogenated
DBPs:

    •   bromoform;
    •   dibromoacetic acid;
    •   tribromoacetic acid;
    •   bromoacetic acid;
    •   bromochloroacetic acid;
    •   bromodichloroacetic acid
    •   dibromochloroacetic acid;
    •   dibromoacetonitrile;
    •   2-bromo-2-methylpropanal;
    •   2,3,5-tribromopyrrole;
    •   bromoacetone;
    •   bromoalkanes;
    •   bromohydrins; and
    •   brominated trihalomethanes (including bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and
        tribromomethane (bromoform)).

Many of the DBPs listed above are generally present at very low concentrations (fractional parts per
billion levels), although elevated levels are possible.

It has been suggested that one of the main DBPs of concern in high bromide-containing waters is
bromate (WHO, 2005), particularly when the water is ozonated or a low-quality hypochlorite is used.
Brominated trihalomethanes (THMs) may occur at concentrations exceeding those of chloroform when
source waters with elevated bromide levels are chlorinated (Krasner et al., 1989) while ozonation prior
to chlorination can further enhance the formation of brominated THMs (Shukairy et al., 1994). Among

                                                  28
                                                                 Part I – Bromine as a drinking-water disinfectant


the most prevalent brominated THMs are chlorodibromomethane, bromodichloromethane and
tribromomethane (bromoform). In recent years, there has been a growing concern of public water
systems facing higher bromide levels in their source waters from anthropogenic contamination through
coal-fired power plants, conventional oil and gas extraction, textile mills, and hydraulic fracturing
(McTigue et al., 2014; States et al., 2013).

Evaluation of the formation of brominated DBPs from use of bromine containing HWT and/or POU
devices remains to be fully investigated.

3.6.2 Toxicological evaluations of brominated by-products
Epidemiology studies indicate increased risk of bladder cancer associated with increased THM
concentrations in drinking-water, with brominated DBP species, or other co-occurring DBPs (including
chlorinated DBPs) being potentially significant contributing factors (Cantor et al., 2010). This has been
highlighted as a possible issue in recent literature, linked to a potential increase in bromide levels in
drinking-water sources in the USA as a result of anthropological contamination (Regli et al., 2015).

Several brominated DBPs have been shown in animal studies to be more carcinogenic than their
chlorinated analogs (Richardson, 2003a). Richardson (2007) has summarized the relative occurrence
and genotoxicity of a wide variety of DBPs including brominated compounds.

WHO (2009) reports that bromate is mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo. The IARC has classified
potassium bromate in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) concluding that there is inadequate
evidence for carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. The IARC
has classified dibromochloromethane and bromoform in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its
carcinogenicity to humans) and dibromoacetonitrile in Group 2B. The USEPA has also classified
bromate as a probable human carcinogen by the oral route based on data from male and female rats,
bromoform and bromodichloromethane as likely to be carcinogenic to humans by all routes of exposure,
and dibromochloromethane as having suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity (USEPA, 2005a). Health
Canada also considers bromate to be carcinogenic to humans.13 Although classified as probably
carcinogenic to humans, WHO (2009) states that there is insufficient information to conclude the
carcinogenic mode of action of potassium bromate. Later studies have reported that the mode of action
of bromate, at levels well above those found in drinking-water, does not involve genotoxicity in rats
(Bull & Cotruvo, 2013; Yamaguchi et al., 2008).

The carcinogenicity of brominated THMs were assessed in a series of older studies carried out by the
National Toxicology Program (NTP) using corn oil as the vehicle (NTP, 1985; NTP, 1987; NTP, 1989a;
NTP, 1989b). Due to concerns surrounding a possible corn oil vehicle effect, where available, studies
utilizing drinking-water as the vehicle are described below.

Limited reports of a two-year feeding study using SPF Wistar rats administered chlorodibromomethane
have been identified. The authors observed no increase in gross tumours in male rats treated with
chlorodibromomethane at doses of 10, 39, or 210 mg/kg per day, or in female rats treated at doses of
17, 66, or 350 mg/kg per day (Tobe et al., 1982).

In a 2-year oral study, CBA x C57B1/6 mice were administered chlorodibromomethane in drinking-
water at concentrations of 0, 0.04, 4.0 or 400 mg/L (equivalent to doses of 0.008, 0.76 or 76 mg/kg per

day); controls were untreated. Survival time was not related to dose in either male or female animals.
No increase in tumour incidence was observed in treated animals in comparison with controls (Voronin
et al., 1987).

Male Wistar rats were administered bromodichloromethane in drinking-water at concentrations of 0,
175, 350 or 700 mg/L (equivalent to 0, 6, 12 or 25 mg/kg per day) for 102 weeks. Body weights of
treated groups remained similar to those of control animals. An increased incidence of inflammation in
the liver was noted at the two higher doses, however the relevance of this is uncertain. There were no
increased incidences of neoplasms that were attributable to bromodichloromethane (NTP, 2006).

In a 2-year study in female B6C3F1 mice, bromodichloromethane was administered in drinking-water
at concentrations of 0, 175, 350, or 700 mg/L (equivalent to 0, 9, 18 or 36 mg/kg per day) Mean body
weights were lower in treated groups when compared to controls from week 4 of the study. The
incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma or adenoma (combined) or hemangiosarcoma in all organs
in treated animals were not statistically significantly different from those in controls. The authors
concluded that under the conditions of the assay, bromodichloromethane was not carcinogenic (NTP,
2006).

No oral study utilizing water as a vehicle for administration of bromoform could be identified and
therefore the study using corn oil as the vehicle is described. Bromoform was administered for 103
weeks in corn oil by gavage for 5 days per week to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Daily
doses of 0, 100 or 200 mg/kg were administered to rats and female mice, and 0, 50 or 100 mg/kg to
male mice. In comparison to controls, decreased body weights were noted in male rats in the high (12–
28%) and low (5–14%) dose groups, with a decrease in female rats in the high dose group only (10–
25%). Female mice also showed a decrease in body weight in the high (5–16%) and low (6–11%) dose
groups relative to controls; body weights of male mice were not decreased. Adenomatous polyps or
adenocarcinomas were noted in the large intestine (colon and rectum) of male rats at the highest dose
(3 of 50) and female rats at both doses (1 of 50 and 8 of 50) in comparison to controls (0 of 50 in both
sexes) but this was not considered significant. No tumours were apparent in mice at either dose of
bromoform. The authors concluded that under the conditions of the study, there was clear evidence of
carcinogenicity for female rats, some evidence for male rats and no evidence for male and female mice
(NTP, 1989). The IARC concluded that there was limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of
bromoform in animals, and inadequate evidence in humans, with an overall evaluation of Group 3 (not
classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans).

The NTP (1989b) has also assessed the reproductive and developmental toxicity of bromoform in CD-
1 mice following administration at doses of 0, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg per day by oral gavage. Varying
degrees of hepatocellular degeneration were seen in all treated animals, however no changes in
reproductive parameters were noted at levels below significant hepatotoxicity.

Prevalent brominated acetic acids include monobromoacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid and
bromochloroacetic acid. These DBPs have been covered in a background document from the WHO
(WHO, 2004b) to support the GDWQ. In brief, the following toxicities were identified for these
brominated acetic acids:

•   Monobromoacetic acid has an oral LD50 in rats of 177 mg/kg bw, (Linder et al., 1994), with
    observed clinical symptoms of excess drinking-water intake, hypomobility, laboured breathing and
    diarrhoea following acute exposure. Chronic studies were not identified. Monobromoacetic acid


                                                  30

    was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium (NTP, 2000a) and positive with microsomal activation
    in the Ames fluctuation test using S. typhimurium strain TA100 (Giller et al., 1997).
    Monobromoacetic acid produced DNA strand breaks in L-1210 mouse leukaemia cells (Stratton et
    al., 1981).
•   Dibromacetic acid has a reported oral LD50 in rats of 1737 mg/kg bw, with observed clinical
    symptoms of excess drinking-water intake, hypomobility, laboured breathing, diarrhoea and ataxia
    following acute exposure. Spermatotoxicity was also apparent on histopathological examination
    (Linder et al., 1994). Sub-chronic and chronic exposure studies have identified liver toxicity,
    immunotoxicity, and spermatotoxicity. Dibromoacetic acid was mutagenic in S. typhimurium (NTP,
    2000b) and in the Ames fluctuation test with S. typhimurium tester strain TA100, with and without
    metabolic activation (Giller et al., 1997). Dibromoacetic acid is associated with DNA repair in the
    SOS chromotest, with and without metabolic activation (Giller et al., 1997) and DNA damage
    (Austin et al., 1996).
•   Chronic exposure to bromochloroacetic acid has been associated with induced liver toxicity and
    reproductive changes (decreased implants and decreased number of live fetuses per litter).
    Bromochloroacetic acid was mutagenic in S. typhimurium in the standard Ames assay (NTP, 2009).
    DNA damage has been reported (Austin et al., 1996).


In USEPA’s health criteria document for brominated acetic acids (USEPA, 2005a); monobromoacetic
acid, bromochloroacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid were all identified as “not classifiable as to human
carcinogenicity” under the 1986 Carcinogen Risk Assessment Guidelines, and “inadequate for an
assessment of human carcinogenic potential” under the 1999 Draft Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk
Assessment. The IARC has classified bromochloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid as Group 2B
(possibly carcinogenic to humans).

Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity studies of brominated and chlorinated haloacetic acids (HAAs) have been
described by Plewa et al. (2008). Brominated HAAs were found to be more cytotoxic than their chlorine
analogs, with a rank order of:

          bromoacetic acid = dibromoacetic acid > chloroacetic acid > tribromoacetic acid >
                              dichloroacetic acid > trichloroacetic acid.

Brominated HAAs were also more genotoxic than their chlorine analogs, with a rank order of:

           bromoacetic acid = chloroacetic acid > dibromoacetic acid > tribromoacetic acid.



3.7 Summary of the safety and toxicity of bromine
Due to its reactivity, bromine, as with chlorine does not persist as an element in living tissue, but quickly
forms bromide and brominated organic chemicals, making the study of the toxicokinetics difficult. This
is reflected in the very limited toxicokinetic data available for bromine from human and animal studies.
Many reports have utilized data from toxicity studies for sodium bromide in place of bromine. Bromide
and chloride are always present in body fluids in animals in steady state at levels dependent upon intake,
and both are excreted readily. Increased chloride intake will increase the excretion of bromide.

Symptoms of acute bromine toxicity via the inhalation route include respiratory irritation/distress and
central nervous system effects (all dependant on concentration). Bromine is highly irritating to the skin

                                                     31

in both liquid and vapour form, with appearance of injury in the form of often delayed blister formation.
Ocular irritation following exposure to bromine vapour is reported. Although rare, ingestion of liquid
bromine is associated with haemorrhagic nephritis, with oliguria or anuria, developing within 1 to 2
days. Where comparisons can be made, the findings from human studies are supported by those from
animal studies. The acute toxicity of bromide is considered to be very low.

Sub-chronic and chronic bromine toxicity studies in humans were not identified from available
literature. Animal studies are also very limited but suggest chronic exposure to bromine may have
adverse effects on reproduction. Repeat dose oral toxicity studies with bromide in rats indicate adverse
effects on the thyroid, with toxicity being enhanced by a low chloride diet. Reproductive and
developmental toxicity of sodium bromide were also noted in a three-generation study in rats.

Bromine and bromide are not classifiable as human carcinogens. Bromine has shown positive results in
reverse mutation assays with and without metabolic activation. Bromide has not shown evidence of
mutagenicity in similar assays.

Among the most prevalent brominated THMs are chlorodibromomethane, bromodichloromethane and
tribromomethane (bromoform). These are not carcinogenic when tested by the NTP protocol (WHO,
2017). There are large toxicological data gaps across all DBPs, however where available, brominated
DBPs have been shown in general to be more genotoxic than the chlorinated analogs.

Prevalent brominated acetic acids include monobromoacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid and
bromochloroacetic acid.

Brominated HAAs have been found to be more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorine analogs (see
Section 3.6.2 for the rank order).

The potential for formation of brominated DBPs from the use of bromine as an alternative disinfectant
is unknown, although more brominated DBPs would be formed based upon dose levels compared to
chlorine.

4. Environmental considerations
Environmental considerations are largely beyond the scope of this report however, as noted in Table 3,
the impact of release of bromine into the environment to “non-target” organisms should be considered.

5. Discussion and conclusions
The decision on whether bromine can serve as a disinfectant for drinking-water and wastewater
treatment is likely to be a balance between the dose required to achieve efficacy (see section 2.2), its
advantages over other disinfectants, particularly chlorine (see section 2.2.4), aesthetic impacts,
preventing potential adverse health effects (see section 3) from chronic exposure, and cost. Any
potential risk of adverse effects should be considered in context of the benefit of water disinfection
which should always take precedence.

Disinfection with bromine and the comparison of its efficacy with chlorine appears greatly
understudied. Compared to the wealth of literature available for chlorine, a very limited number of
studies have investigated the effect of alternative halogens including bromine. Bromine has
demonstrated effectiveness in removing several pathogens in laboratory settings, but has not been tested
against many protozoan parasites including Giardia.

Bromine disinfection is superior to chlorine for microbiological inactivation when applied to low-
quality water containing ammonia and other nitrogenous components (McLennan et al., 2009). This
may give support for the use of bromine as a potential alternative to chlorine in disaster relief scenarios,
however, further investigations would be required. Also, these potential benefits should be balanced
with the significant issues surrounding the ease and safety of bromine generation and its subsequent use
for water purification purposes. Practical handling of free bromine is a safety issue; it is usually
combined with DMH, an organic carrier. Other chemical forms of bromine are currently used for
disinfection of non-drinking-waters including swimming pools and cooling towers.

At the household level, there are a number of additional considerations beyond efficacy, for determining
whether any water treatment product, including bromine, will protect against adverse health effects.
Achieving health gains from household water treatment requires products to be used correctly and
consistently, and thus, clear product information and use instructions are important. In addition, user
preferences, supply chains and availability, and cost are important factors to consider. Products such as
bromine which require a reliable supply chain can be problematic in resource-scare settings where such
systems are not in place.

Toxicity studies in humans or animals for bromine per se via ingestion are very limited; this is mostly
due to the corrosiveness and high reactivity of bromine; it quickly forms bromide in living tissues.
Human studies with sodium bromide have allowed derivation of an ADI for bromide of 0.4 mg/kg bw
based on the most sensitive toxicological endpoint relating to changes within electroencephalograms.
However, a drinking-water guideline value has not been proposed for bromide in the WHO GDWQ as
it occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health concern. However, the GDWQ
includes a health-based value of 6 mg/L for adults and 2 mg/L for children (WHO, 2017). For bromate,
a provisional guideline value of 10 μg/L is recommended as a pragmatic value based on difficulties in
removing bromate once it is formed.

The greatest potential concern to humans from using bromine as a drinking-water disinfectant may stem
from the generation of brominated DBPs. The formation of brominated DBPs during water disinfection
with chlorine has been well studied. There are toxicity data in some of these studies that indicate that
brominated DBPs may be more toxic in some respects than their chlorinated analogs. Currently the
potential for formation of brominated DBPs from the use of bromine as an alternative drinking-water
disinfectant in HWT and POU devices has not been comprehensively addressed, although some devices
have been shown to produce minimal amounts of brominated products (Bridges et al., 2009).

                                                    34
                                                          Part I – Bromine as a drinking-water disinfectant


In summary, the current evidence is sufficient to indicate that:

    •   In a similar way to chlorine, as a drinking-water disinfectant, bromine can be most effective
        against bacteria, effective to a somewhat lesser extent against viruses, and least effective against
        some protozoan parasites; however, the evidence base is more limited in comparison to
        chlorine;
    •   Bromine appears to be effective against cysts of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica,
        and there is some evidence of limited effectiveness against oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum;
        studies on the efficacy of bromine against Giardia cysts were not available; and
    •   Somewhat similar to chlorine and iodine, disinfection efficacy is impacted by the temperature,
        bromine concentration, contact time, pH and organic and inorganic content; however, bromine
        is much less affected by pH and ammonia.


In general, the use of bromine in wastewater disinfection is promising and warrants further study, and
reasons for particular consideration have been outlined above. However, active bromine would not be
recommended for use as a primary disinfectant at the current time due to the concerns with the formation
and potential toxicity of organobromine and organobromine DBPs and the availability of widely used,
well-characterized disinfectants. Although the evidence base indicates that it may be a superior
disinfectant to chlorine in several respects, there is a need for additional data on the range of
microorganisms against which it is effective and under what conditions.

POU devices that provide contact disinfection may be appropriate under targeted circumstances (such
as when pathogenic bacteria and viruses are the organisms of concern) or when combined with another
barrier that is effective against protozoa, provided that there is little release of bromine into the finished
water to minimize DBP formation. The use of POU devices should be appropriately approved or
certified to ensure efficacy and safety.

Appendix A: Methodology


Two initial literature searches were conducted in November 2013 as follows:

    i)      to update toxicity assessment; and
    ii)     to update efficacy assessment.

The search strategy and terms are outlined in Box 1 and 2 respectively, below.

Box 1- Search strategy for updating toxicity assessment for bromine

 ((KEY(human OR animal) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY({in vitro} OR {in vivo})) AND
 DOCTYPE(ar OR re) AND PUBYEAR > 2004) AND ((TITLE-ABS-KEY(toxicokinetic OR
 irritation OR sensitisation) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(genotoxicity OR mutagenicity OR
 carcinogenicity) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY({Acute toxicity} OR {Repeat dose toxicity} OR
 {Chronic toxicity}) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY({Reproductive toxicity} OR {Developmental
 toxicity})) AND DOCTYPE(ar OR re) AND PUBYEAR > 2004) AND
 (((CASREGNUMBER(7726-95-6) AND DOCTYPE(ar OR re) AND PUBYEAR > 2004))



Box 2- Search strategy for updating efficacy assessment for bromine

  (TITLE-ABS-KEY(bromine) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY({drinking water} OR {potable
  water}) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(disinfection OR microorganism OR bacteria OR virus
  OR protozoa OR antimicrobial OR bactericidal OR bacteriostatic)) AND PUBYEAR >
  2004.



Searches were carried out using Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases. Titles and abstracts of
journal articles identified from the initial literature searches included 24 papers relating to bromine
toxicity and 195 papers relating to bromine efficacy, which were reviewed to inform on their potential
relevance to the project. For those titles selected, which were included in the document, papers were
obtained in full for review to extract key data. Additional searches were carried out up to the closing
date for public review (16 December 2016), particularly for identification of “grey” literature and earlier
studies.

1. Introduction
Disinfection of water has greatly contributed to reducing risks to public health from microbiologically-
contaminated drinking-water.

Over the centuries numerous water disinfection techniques have been developed that are used in a wide
range of applications ranging from large and small public drinking-water treatment plants to point-of-
entry and point-of-use (POU) treatment devices.15 Chlorine has been used for more than 100 years and
several other disinfectants have been studied extensively, but in many cases, questions remain with
respect to optimization of biocidal effectiveness under a range of conditions (i.e. efficacy), the chemistry
of the formation and toxicological significance of disinfection by-products (DBPs), interactions with
other water constituents, and the effectiveness and toxicology of disinfectant residuals. Most chemical
disinfectants can react with natural organic matter or breakdown to produce unwanted by-products.
Many newer products and applications are being developed and marketed for use, particularly in
developing countries, and even more unanswered questions exist about some of those products,
including efficacy and DBP formation.

Iodine is an essential nutrient. In addition, it has been used generally as an antiseptic for skin wounds,
as a disinfecting agent in hospitals and laboratories, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. In terms
of the disinfection of drinking-water, iodine is commonly used in the form of tablets or solutions during
emergencies and by travellers (Ongerth et al., 1989; Backer & Hollowell, 2000). At regular intervals,
there is renewed interest in the use of iodine as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine (and other
disinfectants) for drinking-water.

Iodine-based disinfection of water has a long history: iodine in concentrations between 2.5–7 mg/L
(equivalent to parts per million [ppm]) has been used for potable water treatment since the early 1900s,
especially for military operations (Hitchens, 1922; Vergnoux, 1915). Tablet formulations have been
used since the 1940s to ensure the microbiological safety of drinking-water for military personnel
deployed in the field (Chang & Morris, 1953). Also, in more recent times, iodine (and bromine) has
become attractive for particular applications. Elemental iodine is used, for example, as a drinking-water
disinfectant aboard space vessels at a residual concentration of approximately 2 ppm (Atwater et al.,
1996). The more general use of iodine is impeded, however, by the potential for excess iodine intake,
cost and the possibility of the formation of toxic DBPs.

The emphasis of this literature review is to evaluate available evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of
iodine as a water disinfectant. Information included in this review was initially obtained using a targeted
literature search strategy, with inclusion dates up to November 2013 and further “ad-hoc” searches were
carried out up to the closing date for public review (16 December 2016). Additional details of the search
strategy are included in Appendix 1.




15Point-of-use devices treat only the water intended for direct consumption (drinking and cooking), typically at a single tap
or limited number of taps, while point-of-entry treatment devices are typically installed to treat all water entering a single
home, business, school, or facility.

                                                                        Part II - Iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant


2. Disinfection characteristics and efficacy
2.1 Chemistry basics
Iodine, chlorine, bromine and fluorine belong to the halogen group of elements in the periodic table.
All of the halogens share the common property of being oxidants with seven electrons in their outer
shell. As oxidizing agents, halogens accept an electron to become the analogous halide ion. Different
halogens vary in their oxidation potential and the halogen with the strongest oxidative power is fluorine,
followed by chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Their reactivities are directly correlated with their
electronegativities, which are as follows (based on the Pauling nomenclature of electronegativity
values):16

                       fluorine (3.98) > chlorine (3.16) > bromine (2.96) > iodine (2.66).

The reactivities of the given halogens therefore decreases from left to right. Nevertheless, the usefulness
of a particular halogen as a disinfectant is determined not only by its reactivity, but also by its selectivity,
chemical stability and other factors including the potential to form by-products. Fluorine, the most
reactive of all elements of the periodic table, is so unstable that it reacts with surrounding water
molecules in a violent reaction forming hydrogen fluoride and oxygen. The reactivity of other halogens
is more selective, making them more suitable for practical applications. Among the three halogens used
for disinfection purposes (chlorine, iodine and bromine), iodine has the highest atomic weight and is
the only one to exist as a solid at room temperature.

2.1.1 Water solubility, taste and odour
Elemental iodine is less soluble in water than chlorine or bromine. Water solubility depends on pH and
temperature and is reported to be 0.03 mg/L at 20 oC, 0.78 mg/L at 50 oC and 4.45 mg/L at 100 oC
(West, 1984). A saturated aqueous solution of iodine can be produced by passing water through a
column of crystalline iodine. The iodine concentration achieved will be approximately 200 mg/L at 10
o
  C and 400 mg/L at 30 oC (Chang, 1968). This concentrated solution can be diluted to achieve the
desired concentration of iodine.

Free halogen residuals usually produce tastes and odours in potable water. Bryan et al. (1973) compared
taste threshold determinations of chlorine, iodine and bromine residuals in water. The threshold taste
values for chlorine residuals varied with pH: 0.075 mg/L at pH 5.0; 0.156 mg/L at pH 7.0; and 0.450
mg/L at pH 9.0. In contrast, threshold taste values for iodine did not vary appreciably with pH, ranging
from 0.147 to 0.204 mg/L. In contrast to chlorine, which has a high vapour pressure and readily
volatilizes, especially in the presence of sunlight or higher temperatures, iodine has a low vapour
pressure resulting in little loss by volatilization (Black et al., 1970).

2.1.2 Chemical speciation of iodine in water and corresponding disinfection powers
Once elemental iodine (I2) is added to water, it hydrolyses in a pH-dependent manner to form
hypoiodous acid (HIO) and iodide (I-). The overall stoichiometry of iodine hydrolysis between pH 2
and 7 is given below; for a more detailed description of iodine hydrolysis, the reader is referred to
Lengyel et al. (1993):

                                                      I2 + H2O ↔ HIO + I- + H+

     The Pauling scale is a dimensionless relative quantity that describes the electronegativity of an atom in the periodic table.

Similar to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), hypoiodous acid can deprotonate to form hypoiodite (OI-)
according to the following general reaction:

                                           HIO ↔ H+ + OI-

The different chemical species of iodine vary in their disinfection power. The active disinfectants are
elemental iodine and hypoiodous acid (Backer & Hollowell, 2000). Other species including iodide,
iodate (IO3-) and hypoiodite have mild or little antimicrobial activity (Chang, 1958). Comparing the two
disinfection-active chemical species, the oxidizing power of hypoiodous acid is nearly twice that of
elemental iodine (West, 1984). A comparison of oxidizing potentials with the equivalent chlorine
species is shown in Table 1.

The disinfection efficacy of the different chemical species depends not only on oxidizing potential, but
also on penetration power. Elemental iodine has higher penetrating power than hypoiodous acid (White,
1992).

A comprehensive study of disinfection efficacy was performed by Chang & Morris (1953). Iodine
concentrations in the range 5–10 ppm were found to be effective against different types of
microorganisms within 10 min at room temperature. Organisms tested included enteric bacteria,
amoebic cysts, cercariae, leptospira and viruses. Overall, different classes of microorganisms have
different susceptibilities to iodine: vegetative bacteria tend to be most sensitive, whereas viruses have
an intermediate sensitivity and protozoa tend to be more resistant (Backer & Hollowell, 2000).
Moreover, elemental iodine and hypoiodous acid contribute to different extents to the disinfection
efficacy against different microbes. Chemical speciation is highly pH dependent (addressed in the next
section). Disinfection sometimes follows first-order kinetics with the primary determinants of
effectiveness being disinfectant concentration and time of exposure of the microorganism (expressed
as Ct in mg·min/L i.e. the product of disinfectant concentration (C in mg/L) and contact time (t in min).
Departures from first-order kinetics can occur due to such phenomena as declines in iodine
concentration over time, microbial aggregation and microbial protection by other particles.

2.1.2.1 Effect of pH
Both the hydrolysis and the subsequent equilibrium between elemental iodine and hypoiodous acid are
pH-dependent, but the effect is not as pronounced as with chlorine. Table 2 shows the proportions of

with the chlorine equivalents.

Higher pH results in a progressive decline in elemental iodine with a shift in the equilibrium toward
hypoiodous acid. As the active disinfectants are elemental iodine and hypoiodous acid, to use iodine
most effectively as a disinfectant, the pH should be near neutral to mildly alkaline (pH 7–7.5) to allow
adequate levels of both elemental iodine and hypoiodous acid (Table 2). At ≥ pH 8.0, hypoiodous acid
was reported to be unstable and to slowly decompose into iodate and iodide (Ellis & van Vree, 1989).
However, in the absence of a stronger oxidant such as chlorine, iodate formation does not occur readily
(Black et al., 1970). More detailed information about speciation and its pH dependence is available in
Gottardi (1999). Overall, the disinfection effectiveness of iodine is not as heavily influenced by pH as
chlorine is. Hypochlorite formation increases at values > pH 7. Strong evidence has been provided that
hypochlorite has less disinfection power that can be influenced by concentrations of anions, such as
sodium and potassium (Chang & Morris, 1953; Keirn & Putnam, 1968; Haas et al., 1986; Jensen et al.,
1980).

The progressive decline of free iodine residual and increasing proportion of hypoiodous acid with
increasing pH also has fundamental consequences for the disinfection power of iodine. Different effects
occur along this gradient and different iodine species have different disinfection efficacies for different
groups of microbes (Ellis et al., 1993). In generalized terms, elemental iodine is primarily effective
against bacterial spores and protozoan cysts, whereas hypoiodous acid is known to be an effective
bactericide and virucide (Ellis et al., 1993). For example, Chang (1966) reported elemental iodine to be
2–3 times more effective against Entamoeba histolytica cysts than hypoiodous acid, whereas
hypoiodous acid was found to be approximately 40 times more effective than elemental iodine against
viruses. Hypoiodous acid also had greater germicidal activity against vegetative bacteria than elemental
iodine (e.g. hypoiodous acid was found 3–4 times more effective than elemental iodine against
Escherichia coli).

The effect of pH on speciation of iodine and the resulting effect on disinfection efficacy is exemplified
in a study by Taylor & Butler (1982). The authors reported that iodine was more effective against

                                                           54

poliovirus at pH 9 than at lower pH values, probably due to the fact that at this pH most iodine will
exist in the form of hypoiodous acid, which has greater virucidal activity than elemental iodine (Chang,
1966). The virucidal efficacy of hypoiodous acid and elemental iodine was reported to be respectively
4–5 times and 200 times less than hypochlorous acid (Clarke et al., 1964).

As the prevalent iodine species varies with pH, the most suitable pH range for the disinfection of
different microbial groups will also vary. Overall trends in disinfection power of the various iodine
species for different groups of microorganisms are summarised in Table 3 below.

Information about suitable pH is based on abundance of the most effective iodine species for a certain microbial group.
Overall, vegetative bacteria are most susceptible.
a elemental iodine is effective against Giardia cysts but not effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts.




While these tendencies hold true for microorganisms suspended in clean water, disinfection efficacies
can be altered in the presence of turbidity and in poor quality water. The underlying reason is that
although hypoiodous acid is more reactive and has a higher oxidation potential, it has less penetrating
power than elemental iodine. If microorganisms are sheltered in particles, as found in turbid and poor
quality water, the enhanced penetrating power becomes more important than overall reactivity (Ellis et
al., 1993). Even if microorganisms are not attached to particles, the higher oxidation potential of
hypoiodous acid (prevalent at pH 8–9) might lead to preferential reaction with oxidizable organic matter
(e.g. in the case of turbid water with elevated total organic content) leaving less residual available for
disinfection (Ellis et al., 1993). More information on the effects of turbidity can be found in Section
2.2.2. Karalekas et al. (1970) reported the effect of 1 ppm iodine on 6 different bacterial species. A
noticeable reduction of the germicidal effect was reported when increasing the pH from 5 to 9 (while
noticing little difference between pH 5 and 7). A slight decline in disinfection efficacy against E. coli
and faecal streptococci was also observed by Ellis & van Vree (1989) when increasing the pH from pH
7 to 8.5. The reduced efficacy of iodine at higher pH was explained by Ellis et al. (1993) by the
progressive decline of free iodine residual. In studies on the effects of water quality and pH on
inactivation of hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus 1 and echovirus 1 by 8 and 16 mg/L doses of iodine,
HAV was inactivated more efficiently by iodine than were the other two test viruses, and the order of
virus inactivation was:

                            HAV > echovirus 1 > poliovirus 1 (Sobsey et al, 1991).

Virus inactivation was generally more effective at higher pH, in cleaner water, at higher temperature
and at higher iodine dose.

The partitioning into different chemical species with different disinfection power is not only dependent
on pH, but also the initial concentration of titratable iodine (Chang, 1966). The lower the iodine
concentration, the higher the relative percentage of hypoiodous acid at a given pH.

2.1.2.2 Effect of temperature
For iodine, the pH effect on disinfection efficacy is more noticeable at lower temperatures (Ellis et al.,
1993). In general, higher doses of iodine are required at lower temperatures to achieve the same degree
of disinfection (Chambers et al., 1952). As with chlorine, the reason can be found in the lower reactivity
of the disinfectant at lower temperature as the reaction rate is negatively correlated with the temperature
via the reaction constant. At low temperatures near the freezing point, a higher contact time is therefore
required to compensate for the loss in reactivity. Chang & Morris (1953) reported a doubling of required
contact time when decreasing the temperature from 25 oC to near freezing temperature (2–3 oC).
Temperature dependence of disinfection efficacy is however not fully understood as different effects
might counter-act each other. Ellis et al. (1993) found better germicidal performance at 5 oC than at 20
o
  C, whereas an increase to 35 oC further reduced the effectiveness. This contradicts previous findings
but was explained by an increase in the oxidation potential at higher temperatures leading to faster
inactivation and less residual. The authors concluded that higher temperatures favour increased
hydrolysis leading to higher concentrations of hypoiodous acid which, in turn, has a higher oxidation
potential than elemental iodine.

2.2 Efficacy of iodine
2.2.1 Bactericidal efficacy of iodine
Chang & Morris (1953) investigated the bactericidal effects of a number of Ct combinations of iodine
on different bacterial pathogens. Tests conducted with E. coli showed that iodine concentrations of ≥
0.05 ppm consistently reduced the culturability of 104 bacteria cells/mL to less than 1 cell/mL within
10 min (25 oC, pH 8.1–8.5). Other results obtained when exposing 106 E. coli cells/mL to different
iodine concentrations are shown in Table 4 below.

Chang & Morris (1953) reported stronger inactivation than seen with E. coli for other enteric bacteria
including, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae and Vibrio cholera, with initial iodine
concentrations of 7–8 ppm and pH 4.5–8.1. The authors reported that there was no effect of pH on
bactericidal efficacy of iodine in the range pH 4.5–8.1. Similar (but declining) results were obtained
with values up to pH 10, which is in sharp contrast to the strong pH dependence of chlorine.

2.2.2 Disinfection in the presence of turbidity
There is limited information discussing the effects of turbidity on the disinfection capability of iodine.
When testing the effect of ammonium and urea on the efficacy of iodine disinfection, concentrations up
to 5 ppm were not found to have any measurable effect on the inactivation of E. coli (Chang & Morris,
1953). The same held true when adding different clays in concentrations of up to 500 ppm. It is generally
accepted that iodine shows less reactivity with organic nitrogenous impurities compared to chlorine
(Punyani et al., 2006) but does react to produce iodamines. The organic colour of water (due to the
presence of natural organic substances) is associated with iodine demand and reduced efficacy. At
organic colour concentrations > 70 ppm, a doubling of the dose was found to be required for
disinfection. A study by Ellis & van Vree (1989) found that when supplementing water with sediments
from a natural stream, the stepwise increase in turbidity up to a maximum of 1000 nephelometric
turbidity units (NTU) reduced the germicidal effectiveness of iodine.

In general, the disinfection capability of iodine, as with all disinfectants is reduced with increasing
turbidity as microorganisms can be protected from the iodine by adsorption to, or enmeshment in, solid
particles in water. In addition, there may be an increasing disinfectant demand due to reactions between
organic particles and the disinfectant. Sobsey et al. (1991) reported that the inactivation of HAV by
iodine at doses of 8 and 16 mg/L was less effective in “dirty water” (i.e. 10 mg/L of a 1:1 mixture of
humic and fulvic acids and 5 NTU of bentonite clay turbidity). Ellis et al. (1993) applied iodine to water
supplemented with stream sediments to achieve three different turbidity ranges (5–7, 50–54 and 93–97
NTU). Water was additionally adjusted to values of pH 6, 7.5, and 9 and different temperatures (5, 20,
and 35 oC). Under all conditions tested, a dose of 3 mg/L iodine with a contact time of 30 min was
found sufficient to inactivate E. coli. When supplementing water with digested sludge (up to the highest
turbidity range) or raw sludge (5–7 NTU), doses of 8 or 10 mg/L iodine were necessary to achieve
inactivation for the same contact time. The authors argued that the nature of the turbidity was more
important than its density. It was hypothesized that the higher organic and nitrogen content of the sludge


                                                             57

compared to the stream sediments was responsible. When comparing disinfection efficacy with chlorine
at 1.0 mg/L, chlorine was reported to be slightly more effective for water containing stream sediments
(e.g. at 20 ˚C and pH 7.5 the percentage inactivation of E. coli ranged from 99.52–100% for chlorine at
turbidities between 94–5 NTU, with the corresponding values for iodine ranging between 98.58–
99.97%). However, iodine was found more efficient in cases where sludge was added, particularly at
the higher temperature and pH values (e.g. at 20 ˚C and pH 7.5, percentage inactivation of E. coli ranged
from 21.7–38.74% for chlorine at turbidities between 97–5 NTU, with the corresponding values for
iodine ranging between 42.40–50.70% [Ellis et al., 1993]).

2.2.3 Iodine-based disinfection products
Iodine-based disinfection products available today can be divided into two categories; iodine solutions
and iodine resins. A summary of the disinfection capabilities of each is given in Table 5.

2.2.3.1 Iodine solutions
Iodine solutions are made by adding iodine (e.g. tincture of iodine, a 2% iodine solution), or by adding
a tablet containing iodine, a carrier, and stabilizing agents to enhance dissolvability (e.g. tetraglycine
hydroperiodide, sodium acid pyrophosphate and talc) to the water to be disinfected. The United States
Army has utilised iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant since 1952, issuing iodine-based tablets to
American soldiers. The United States Army continues to provide iodine-based tablets in addition to
other emergency field drinking-water products. Today, there are several commercial off the shelf
individual water purification devices that use iodine for disinfection.

For non-drinking-water disinfectant applications, iodine has been compared with chlorine and bromine
as alternative disinfectants for swimming pools. Although not directly related to the use of iodine as a
drinking-water disinfectant, these studies provide useful evidence of the efficacy of iodine for water
disinfection and the tolerance of individuals to residual concentrations of iodine. Typical of the now
dated studies, Black et al. (1959) investigated the effectiveness of iodine solutions for disinfecting
public and domestic swimming pools in Florida, USA. The solutions were added in the form of
potassium iodide over three weeks (twice weekly) at a dose equivalent to 1–2 ppm of iodine. The
crystalline potassium iodide was either spread over the surface of the pool together with a small amount
of chlorine to release free iodine, or uniformly distributed through a recirculation system. Iodine was
found to be fully effective in meeting bacteriological standards. The amount of iodine required for
public pools with high bathing activity was reported to be only slightly higher than required for pools
with low bathing load (domestic pools), suggesting that the iodine residual appeared to be less sensitive
to bathing load than the chlorine residual. The authors considered that this was due to iodine not reacting
with ammonium, as does chlorine. However, the reason is more likely to be due to the direction of the
equilibrium between iodine and ammonium. The study concluded that a daily dosage of 1 or 2 ppm of
iodine would suffice to disinfect domestic or public pools. This translates into a residual concentration
of approximately 0.2 ppm (Black et al., 1959).

Available evidence indicates that iodine solutions can be effective disinfectants against bacteria and, to
a lesser extent, viruses. Recommended dosages range from between 4 and 16 mg/L with contact times
ranging from 20–35 min, resulting in Ct values of 80–560 mg·min/L to achieve a 6 log10
reduction/inactivation of bacteria and a 4 log10 reduction/inactivation of viruses. Iodine is least effective
against protozoa and in particular, ineffective against Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, where the doses
and contact times required are impractical for drinking-water disinfection (Gerba et al., 1997).

2.2.3.2 Resins
Iodine resins are solid-phase iodine disinfectants through which water is passed, with disinfection
occurring through direct contact of the microorganisms and the iodine sorbed onto the resin as
exchangeable ions. Iodine resins are generally considered demand-release disinfectants as iodine is
released to the microorganism after coming into contact with the resin, and generally produce a dilute
iodine residual. As is the case with iodine solutions, available data on iodine resins indicates they are
effective disinfectants against bacteria, viruses, and some protozoa (Punyani et al., 2006; Vasudevan &
Tandon, 2010). However, the resins have not, to date, been proven effective against Cryptosporidium
oocysts.

Resin-based iodine release systems comprise (1) organic iodide compounds, (2) iodophors (iodine in
combination with non-ionic surfactants) and (3) iodine incorporated resins (Punyani et al., 2006). Iodine
resins used in individual water purification devices are generally combined with other treatment
processes, such as filtration, to remove iodine residuals and iodine-resistant microorganisms. Modern
applications of resins have resulted in an increase in their use. Devices used by National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for space flights are prominent examples. Controlled release of iodine on
board the International Space Station Alpha is achieved through a flow-through device (referred to as
Microbial Check Valve) containing an iodinated polymer (Atwater et al., 1996; Gibbons et al., 1990).
The iodine residual concentration released into the water stream flow is a maximum of approximately
2 mg/L. The released dissolved iodine undergoes a series of hydrolytic reactions resulting in the
formation of iodide, triiodide, hypoiodous acid and hypoiodide, with different biocidal capabilities
associated to each inorganic species (Punyani et al., 2006; Venkobachar & Jain, 1983). Another resin
employed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration consists of the iodine-polyvinyl
pyrrolidone (iodine-PVP) complex which releases iodine and iodide at concentrations of 2–3 mg/L
and 1.5 mg/L, respectively (Punyani et al., 2006). Again, the dissolved iodine speciates into a variety
of different inorganic compounds. Greatest biocidal activity can be attributed to iodine and hypoiodous
acid (Gazda et al., 2004; Gottardi, 1991).

A number of other resins have been developed with some promising results. Considering the potential
health impact of released aqueous iodine, Punyani et al. (2006) proposed the development of resins that
do not release iodine, but inactivate microorganisms during flow through by contact. Whereas resins
loaded with iodate did not exhibit a germicidal effect, polyiodide resins were reported to be efficient
for drinking-water disinfection (Vasudevan & Tandon, 2010).

  Testing was carried out using iodinated resins only, with no filter applied, as would normally be found in individual water purification
devices. Whilst bacteria and viruses are not physically filtered by the resin, due to electrostatic interactions, Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium
oocysts are filtered by the resin bed. However, subsequent use of the resin leads to release or flushing of cysts and oocysts, which could remain
viable.

2.2.4 Comparison of efficacy with chlorine
The properties of iodine and chlorine differ in several important ways. Although speciation of iodine is
pH dependent, a notable property of iodine is that it provides protection across a wider pH range than
chlorine (Black et al., 1965; Ellis et al., 1993). Compared with chlorine, iodine has also greater chemical
stability and shows less reactivity with organic nitrogenous contaminants, leaving a higher free residual;
the reduced reactivity with organic contaminants leads to a reduction in iodine demand (Backer &
Hollowell, 2000). On the negative side, less is known about iodine in regard to disinfection performance
on some important pathogens in waters of different quality and above all on potential negative health
impacts. In addition, the lower reactivity of iodine compared to chlorine requires the use of higher doses.
A comparison with chlorine is given below:

Commonalities with chlorine:
    •    Different classes of microorganisms have different susceptibilities (e.g. neither are effective
         against Cryptosporidium oocysts); and
    •    Effectiveness is impacted by temperature, concentration, contact time, pH and organic content.

Advantages of iodine over chlorine:
    •    Provides protection across a wider pH range;

       •    Greater chemical stability;
       •    Less disinfection demand through reduced reactivity with organic nitrogenous impurities;
       •    Germicidal action of iodine occurs over a wider range of water quality conditions than chlorine;
            and
       •    Works better for water of poor quality.

Disadvantages of iodine compared to chlorine (these relate mainly to potential health concerns, as
discussed fully in Section 3):
       •    The safety of long-term consumption of iodine when used as a drinking-water disinfectant is
            not established;
       •    Excess iodine intake is not safe for people with thyroid disease; and
       •    Higher concentrations are required as compared to chlorine to achieve comparable disinfection
            efficacy.



2.2.5 World Health Organization International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water
Treatment Technologies
 Existing evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of disinfectants against all three classes of pathogens
which cause diarrhoeal disease, may not reflect actual use conditions in the field (e.g. water of varying
quality, shorter contact times). In order to comprehensively assess effectiveness, WHO has set tiered
health-based log10 reduction performance targets for household water treatment (HWT) products for the
removal and/or inactivation of bacteria, viruses and protozoa (WHO, 2011). These performance targets
are based on microbial risk models using assumed levels of reference pathogens in untreated water.
Since 2014, WHO has been evaluating products against those performance targets through the WHO
International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies.17 Box 1 gives further
information on the Scheme. At the time of this report, iodine has not been tested but may be included
in future rounds.

Box 1 WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies

The objective of the Scheme is to independently and consistently evaluate the microbiological
performance of household and POU water treatment technologies. The evaluation considers both
turbid and non-turbid water, and is carried out to manufacturers’ instructions for daily household
use.17 The results of the evaluation are intended to assist and inform Member States and procuring
UN agencies in the selection of these technologies.

The performance targets define treatment requirements in relation to source water quality for each
pathogen class as detailed below.

The performance of HWT products is classified as 3-star (); 2-star (); and 1-star (),
denoting descending order of performance, based on log10 reductions of bacteria, viruses and
protozoa from drinking-water. Performance that does not meet the minimum target is given no stars.
Products that meet 3-star () or 2-star () performance targets are classified as providing
“Comprehensive protection” against the three main classes of pathogens which cause diarrhoeal
disease in humans. The use of these products is encouraged where there is no information on the
specific pathogens in drinking-water (and a prudent approach is to protect against all three classes),
or where piped supplies exist but are not safely managed. Products that meet the performance targets
for at least 2-star () for only two of the three classes of pathogen are given one star () and are
classified as providing “Targeted protection”. In general, the use of these products may be
appropriate in situations where the burden of diarrhoeal disease is high due to known classes of
pathogens, such as a cholera outbreak.

3. Safety and toxicity of iodine
The health effects of iodine have been reviewed by a number of international bodies:

     •   European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2014);
     •   Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN, 2013);
     •   USEPA, 2006;
     •   Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR, 2004);
     •   World Health Organisation /Food and Agriculture Organisation (WHO/FAO, 2004);
     •   World Health Organisation (WHO, 2003);
     •   Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM, 2003);
     •   European Commission Scientific Committee on Food (EC, 2002);
     •   Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2001); and
     •   Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 1988).

In this section, opinions from expert bodies on intake of iodine, as detailed above, are described. In
addition, a detailed assessment of recent18 toxicological literature for iodine was undertaken and the
relevant findings are included here.

3.1 Human exposure
Iodine is an essential dietary element for mammals. It is required for the synthesis and function of the
thyroid hormones thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), as well as being the precursor of
iodotyrosines. Through these hormones, iodine has an important role in energy-yielding metabolism
and on the expression of genes that impact many physiological functions, from embryogenesis to
growth and development, neurological and cognitive functions (EFSA, 2014).

The only natural sources of iodine for humans and animals are the iodides in food and water. The use
of iodine and iodophors for sanitizing purposes has been reported to result in significant amounts of
iodine entering the food chain (Phillips, 1997). The iodine content of foods is highly variable both
between food categories as well as within each category. Marine products such as shellfish and
molluscs, and eggs and milk are the richest sources of dietary iodine (Phillips, 1997). In Japan, iodine
intake exceeds that of most other countries, primarily due to substantial seaweed consumption. Zava &
Zava (2011) utilized information from a number of sources including dietary records, food surveys,
urine iodine analysis (both spot and 24-hour samples) and seaweed iodine content, to estimate daily
Japanese iodine intake. The authors estimated that the Japanese iodine intake averages 1000–3000
μg/day (1–3 mg/day). The iodine content of drinking-water is also highly variable. In Denmark, tap
water concentrations of iodine from a number of locations were reported to contain between < 1.0–139
µg/L (median 2.6 µg/L) (Pedersen et al., 1993). Drinking-water in the USA has a reported mean
concentration of total iodine of 4 µg/L, with a maximum concentration of 18 µg/L (Andersen et al.,
2008). Chronic excessive iodine intake has been linked to development of goitre (enlarged thyroid
gland) (Zhao et al., 2000), early onset of sub-clinical thyroid disorders, hyperthyroidism (excessive
production and/or secretion of thyroid hormones) and hypothyroidism (diminished production of
thyroid hormones), an increased incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid
gland) and increased risk of thyroid cancer (Laurberg et al., 1998; Teng et al., 2006).

  To November 2013, with further ad hoc searches were carried out up to the closing date for public review (16 December
2016).

                                                           64
                                                                   Part II - Iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant


In contrast, iodine deficiency remains a major public health concern in many countries, including some
European countries (WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD, 2007; Zimmermann & Andersson, 2011; Andersson et
al., 2012). Chronic deficiency has been linked with compensatory thyroid hyperplasia with goitre, with
an associated increase in risk of thyroid cancer. In an attempt to counteract the deficiency, iodine
fortification of salt is recommended by WHO and has been implemented in approximately 120 countries
worldwide (WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD, 2007). Of these, 40 are European countries:19 it is mandatory in
13 countries, voluntary in 16 and not regulated in the remaining countries. The amount of iodine added
varies from 10–75 mg/kg salt with a majority of values in the range 15–30 mg/kg.

3.2 Guideline values
3.2.1. WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality
The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2017) did not formally establish a guideline
value for iodine. Iodine was last reviewed by WHO for the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality in
1993, when it was concluded that available data suggested that derivation of a guideline value for iodine
on the basis of information on the effects of iodide was inappropriate and there were few relevant data
on the effects of iodine. Also, because iodine is not recommended for long-term disinfection, lifetime
exposure to iodine concentrations such as might occur from drinking-water disinfection is unlikely
(WHO, 2003).

3.2.2 Other values
In 1988, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 1988) set a Provisional
Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake for iodine of 1 mg/day (17 μg/kg body weight [bw] per day) from all
sources. This upper limit was reaffirmed by WHO in 1994 (WHO, 1994). This was based on the
tolerance of high doses of iodine in healthy iodine-replete adults and did not include neonates and young
infants. In light of the recognition that excess iodine could lead to hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism
and thyroid autoimmunity in vulnerable individuals, in 2004 the WHO/FAO recommended the
following nutrient intakes for iodine (WHO/FAO, 2004):

       •    Infants and children 0–59 months: 90 µg/day
       •    Children 6–12 years: 120 µg/day
       •    Adolescents and adults, from 13 years of age through adulthood: 150 µg/day
       •    Pregnant women: 200 µg/day
       •    Lactating women: 200 µg/day

In 2001, the Food and Nutrition Board at the United States National Institute of Medicine recommended
the following dietary intakes for iodine (IOM, 2001):

       •    Infants
                o 0–6 months: 110 µg/day
                o 7–12 months: 130 µg/day
       •    Children
                o 1–3 years: 90 µg/day
                o 4–8 years: 90 µg/day
                o 9–13 years: 120 µg/day
       •    Adolescents and Adults
               o Males age 14 and older: 150 µg/day

            o   Females age 14 and older: 150 µg/day

    •   Pregnant women: 220 µg/day

    •   Lactating women: 290 µg/day

The same group derived tolerable upper intake levels of between 200 and 1100 µg/day (children
between 1–3 years and all adults respectively) from all sources. Recommendations for adults were based
on changes in serum thyrotropin concentrations in response to varying levels of ingested iodine in
adults, with children’s levels obtained by extrapolation from adult levels with adjustment on the basis
on body weight (IOM, 2001).

In 2002, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Food (EC, 2002) provided a Tolerable
Upper Intake Limit (UL) for iodine of 600 µg/day for adults (including pregnant and lactating women).
This value was based on dose-response studies of short duration (two weeks) in small numbers of
subjects (n=10–32). An increased response of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to thyrotropin-
releasing hormone (TRH) at intakes of 1700–1800 μg/day was reported by Gardner et al. (1988) and
Paul et al. (1988) but changes were not associated with any adverse clinical outcome. In a five-year
study, Stockton & Thomas (1978) also reported an absence of clinical thyroid pathology following
similar intakes. An uncertainty factor of 3 was applied to the highest intake assessed in these studies
(1800 µg/day) to derive the UL for adults. For children, an adjustment based on body weight was
applied to the adult value. The report concluded that dietary intakes are unlikely to exceed 500 μg/day,
since the 97.5 percentile intake in European men is 434 μg/day.

The UK’s Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM, 2003) set a guidance level for iodine intake,
concluding that neither human nor animal data were sufficient to set a UL value. Following assessment
of the findings from several clinical studies of supplemental iodine, the author’s concluded that 500
μg/day of supplemental iodine “would not be expected to have any significant adverse effects in adults.”
This led to recommendation of guidance levels of 500 μg/day for supplemental iodine and 930 μg/day
for total intake from all sources (EVM, 2003).

The Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN, 2013) recommended an upper limit for iodine intake of
500 µg/day based on the absence of adverse effects in healthy adults following daily oral intake of
iodine supplements of 500 µg. In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority published Adequate Intake
(AI) levels for iodine in different age groups (including pregnant and breast-feeding women), based in
part on a large epidemiological study in European school-aged children (EFSA, 2014). The study
showed that goitre prevalence is lowest for a urinary iodine concentration <100 μg/L, associated with
iodine intakes of 150 µg/day in adults.


From this, the following AI levels were recommended:

    •   Infants (< 1 year of age): 70 μg/day
    •   Children
            o Aged between 1–3, 4–6 and 7–10 years: 90 μg/day
            o Aged between 11–14 years: 120 μg/day
            o Aged between 15–17 years: 130 μg/day
    •   Adults: 150 μg/day
    •   Pregnant or breast-feeding women: 200 μg/day

                                                  66

For individuals from countries with long-standing iodine deficiency disorder, the Expert Committee on
Human Nutrition of the Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Aliments has suggested a
provisional maximal tolerable daily intake of 500 μg/day to avoid the occurrence of hyperthyroidism
(AFSSA, 2001).

3.3 Human toxicity data
3.3.1 Toxicokinetics

3.3.1.1 Absorption
Iodine is readily absorbed through inhalation and ingestion, with dermal absorption being extremely
low (< 1% of applied dose). Human volunteers exposed to radioactive elemental iodine vapour by
inhalation showed clearance with a half-life of 10 minutes, with the majority of iodine being removed
by mucociliary clearance to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Black & Hounam, 1968; Morgan et al.,
1968). Iodine ingested in the form of water-soluble salts shows 100% absorption from the GI tract
(Fischer et al., 1965). Absorption of iodine from the GI tract has been shown to be similar in adults,
adolescents, children and older infants, however, uptake in newborns is reported to be between 2–20%
lower (Ogborn et al., 1960; Morrison et al., 1963).

Iodine ingested in forms other than iodide is reduced to iodide in the gut prior to absorption by the small
intestine (Fisher et al., 1965; Fish et al., 1987; Hays, 2001) with an efficacy of 92% (IOM, 2001; Jahreis
et al., 2001; Aquaron et al., 2002). Iodide absorption is reduced in the presence of humic acids in
drinking-water (Gaitan, 1990), and of thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, nitrates, fluorides, calcium,
magnesium and iron in food and water (Ubom, 1991).


3.3.1.2 Distribution
In human volunteers exposed to radiolabelled iodine via ingestion, between 20–30% of the dose was
distributed to the thyroid within 10 hours, with between 30–60% being excreted in urine (Morgan et al.,
1967a, b). Of total body iodine typically 70–90% is concentrated in the thyroid gland. Maternal
exposure to iodine results in exposure of the fetus to thyroid hormones, with accumulation of iodine in
the fetal thyroid gland commencing at around 70–80 days gestation (Evans et al., 1967; Book &
Goldman, 1975).

3.3.1.3 Metabolism
As noted above, iodine undergoes rapid conversion to iodide which is then transported by the sodium
iodide symporter to the thyroid and utilised for the production of T4 and T3 hormones (Morgan et al.,
1967a, b; Black & Hounam, 1968). Competition with sodium iodide symporter transport of iodine
occurs from exposure to numerous anions including perchlorate, chlorate, nitrate and thiocyanate.

3.3.1.4 Elimination
Around 97% of iodine is excreted in the urine as iodide, with faecal elimination of between 1–2%
(Larsen et al., 1998; Hays, 2001). Absorbed iodine can also be excreted in breast milk, saliva, sweat,
tears and exhaled air (Cavalieri, 1997). The elimination half-life of absorbed iodine is considerably
variable between individuals, and has been estimated as 31 days for healthy adult males (Van Dilla &
Fulwyler, 1963; Hays, 2001).

3.3.2 Acute toxicity
Several biological mechanisms protect against acute iodine toxicity; these include reduced iodine
uptake and preferential production of the more heavily iodinated thyroid hormones. Not all exposed
subjects will react to excess iodine. Clinical features of acute iodine toxicity that have been produced
following accidental or deliberate ingestion, or medical procedures such as wound irrigation, include
GI disturbance (vomiting and diarrhoea), metabolic acidosis, seizure, stupor, delirium and collapse.
Sensitivity reactions, such as iodide mumps, iododerma and iodide fever may also occur following
treatment with iodine-containing drugs, or the use of radiographic contrast media (EVM, 2003).

Deaths (usually within 48 hours) in humans have occurred for iodine ingested in tinctures at doses
ranging from 1200–9500 mg (17–120 mg/kg). Acute oral toxicity is primarily due to irritation of the GI
tract, marked fluid loss and shock occurring in severe cases (ATSDR, 2004).

3.3.3 Repeat dose toxicity
A large number of human experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies on the effects of repeat
doses of excess iodine on human health has been reported.

3.3.3.1 Systemic effects
Both sub-acute (≤ 30 days) and sub-chronic (30–90 days) exposure studies for iodine intake have been
reported:

Men who drank iodized water providing iodine doses of 0.17–0.27 mg/kg bw per day for 26 weeks
reported no adverse effects (Morgan & Karpen, 1953).

The ingestion of about 3 mg iodine/day for 6 months during daily mouth-rinsing with an iodine-
containing mouthwash had no effect on thyroid function (Ader et al., 1988).

A study on the effects of doses of 250, 500 or 1500 μg iodide/day for 14 days on thyroid function was
carried out in 9 euthyroid men (normal thyroid function; mean age 34 years) and 23 euthyroid women
(mean age 32 years) with 5 age-matched controls (Paul et al., 1988). The parameters examined were
protein bound iodine (PBI) of the thyroid total serum iodine, T4, T3, TSH, integrated 1-hour serum
TSH response to an intravenous dose of 500 μg TRH, and 24-hour urinary iodine excretion. The dietary
intake of iodine was estimated from the urinary iodine excretion to be approximately 200 μg/person/day
making the total ingested doses approximately 450, 700 and 1700 µg iodide/day. The estimated dose of
1700 μg/day was associated with an increase in total serum iodine without affecting the PBI, a
significant decrease in serum T4 and T3 levels and an increase in TSH levels. Administered doses of
700 and 450 µg/day did not significantly affect the measured parameters. Only 1700 μg/day increased
the TSH response to TRH (in women more than in men). The TSH response to TRH was also increased,
though not significantly, in the individuals receiving 700 μg iodide/day. No biochemical effects were
detected with 450 μg of iodide/day. However, this study used only small groups, extended over only 2
weeks and the dietary iodine intake was not determined analytically but was estimated.

In another study, 10 males (mean age 27 years) were treated for 2 weeks with either 500, 1500 or 4500
μg iodide/day (Gardner et al., 1988). The dietary intake was estimated from urine iodine excretion to
have been approximately 300 μg/person/day making the total ingested doses approximately 800, 1800
or 4800 µg iodide/day. Serum levels of T4, T3, TSH, PBI, and total iodide, the TSH response to
intravenous TRH and 24-hour urinary excretion of iodide were measured before treatment and again on
day 15. Serum T4 levels decreased significantly after ingestion of 1800 μg and 4800 μg/day but did not

                                                  68
                                                                        Part II - Iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant


change with 800 μg/day. Serum T3 levels did not change following administration of any of the doses.
Serum TSH levels remained unchanged in those receiving 800 μg/day but increased in those receiving
1800 μg and 4800 μg/day. The TSH response to TRH was significantly enhanced with all iodide doses
administered. No adverse effects were reported and no significant symptoms of thyroid dysfunction
were noted. Again, only small groups of males were studied, exposure was rather short and the actual
dietary intake of iodine was not determined analytically but estimated.

Chow et al. (1991) assessed the effect of supplementing normal dietary intakes of iodide to give a total
iodide intake of approximately 750 μg iodide/day, or a placebo for a period of 28 days. Volunteers were
groups of women aged 25–54 years. They were either thyroid antibody positive (subclinical
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) (n=20), antibody negative (n=30), aged 60–75 years and from an area with
adequate dietary iodine supply (n=29) or from an area that was previously iodine deficient (n=35). In
all iodine-supplemented groups, mild biochemical hypothyroidism was present, evidenced by decreases
in T4 levels and increases in TSH levels. None of the groups on supplemental iodide showed any
incidence of hyperthyroidism. Following iodide supplementation TSH levels increased above the
normal level of 5 milli-international units (mU)/L in 3 of the 60–75 year-old subjects, while the raised
TSH levels increased even further in 2 antibody-positive subjects.

Chronic (> 6 months) exposure through ingestion of iodine at levels > 0.03 mg/kg bw is considered to
be associated with adverse health effects (ATSDR, 2004). The introduction of iodized bread in The
Netherlands raised the daily intake by 120–160 μg iodine resulting in an increase in the incidence of
hyperthyroidism (Van Leeuwen, 1954). The consumption of winter milk20 in the UK raised the iodine
intake of women to 236 μg/day and of men to 306 μg/day and was also associated with a peak incidence
of hyperthyroidism (Nelson & Phillips, 1985). In 32 young Swiss adults with simple goitre (and urinary
iodine excretion of 32 μg/day) administered 200 μg iodine/day, only one case of transient
hyperthyroidism appeared which showed a serum T4 of 14 μg/100 mL, a serum T3 of 293 ng/100 mL,
suppressed TSH, tachycardia and weight loss (Baltisberger et al., 1995).

Peace Corps volunteers in Niger, West Africa using iodine-resin water purification devices for 32
months during the period 1995–1998, showed an increased incidence (42%) of thyroid abnormality but
effects were reversed when iodinated water consumption ceased (Pearce et al., 2002). The purification
devices delivered a mean concentration of 10 mg iodine/L to the drinking-water, which with a daily
consumption amongst volunteers of 5–9 L resulted in consumption of 50 mg/iodine per day (300 times
the recommended dietary allowance for the USA at that time). The adjusted odds ratio for thyroid
dysfunction (abnormal thyrotropin) adjusted for age, sex, and other potential confounding factors, was
3.9 (95% CI 1.1–14.3) (p < 0.04) for the devices, with a positive relation with duration of exposure
(adjusted odds ratios 4.6 and 10.9 at 6 and 12 months, respectively).

In a 5-year study using iodinated drinking water (1 mg/L) supplied to 750 male and female prison in-
mates, no hyper- or hypothyroidism sensitization reactions and iodism (symptoms provided in the
following paragraph) were noted (Stockton and Thomas, 1978). The average dose was 30 μg/kg bw per
day. There was a statistically significant decrease in iodine uptake and an increase in PBI of the thyroid.
One hundred and seventy-seven women in-mates delivered 181 infants showing no thyroid-related
adverse effects. In four women who were already hyperthyroid, their symptoms became even more
severe. The difficulties with this study were the imprecise estimates of intakes from the diet and fluid

     Seasonal differences in the iodine content of milk are apparent and vary directly in relation to farming practices.

                                                                 69
                                                        Part II - Iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant


consumption of the participating individuals as well as the variable exposure time but the group size
and duration of exposure were adequate.

Although most individuals who ingest large amounts of iodine remain euthyroid (i.e. have normal
thyroid gland function) some will develop hypothyroidism with or without goitre or hyperthyroidism
which can manifest as thyrotoxicosis (inflammation of the gland), and changes in the incidence and
types of thyroid malignancies. Very large amounts of iodide may cause iodism, the symptoms of which
resemble rhinitis as well as salivary gland swelling, GI irritation, acneform dermatitis, metallic taste,
gingivitis, increased salivation, conjunctivitis and oedema of eye lids (ATSDR, 2004; Leung &
Braverman, 2014). In children aged between 5–15 years of age, 10 μg/kg bw per day is considered to
be a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) based on thyroid effects (subclinical hypothyroidism
with thyroid gland enlargement) (Boyages et al., 1989; Chow et al., 1991).

It has been proposed that excess iodide intake may be a contributing factor in the development of
autoimmune thyroiditis in people who are vulnerable (Brown and Bagchi 1992; Foley 1992; Rose et
al., 1997; Safran et al., 1987); however, evidence to support this in humans is incomplete.

3.3.3.2 Neurotoxicity
Iodine-induced hypothyroidism in sensitive populations (including fetuses, newborn infants, and
individuals who have thyroiditis) has the potential to produce neurological effects (Boyages, 2000b).
This is particularly applicable to fetuses and newborn infants as thyroid hormones are essential to the
development of the neuromuscular system and brain. An iodine-induced hypothyroid state can result in
delayed or deficient brain and neuromuscular development of the newborn. Iodine-induced
hypothyroidism in an older child or adult would be expected to have little or no deleterious effects on
the neuromuscular system.

Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism presenting as thyrotoxicosis in sensitive individuals (including those
who are initially iodine deficient; those who have thyroid disease; including nodular goitre; Graves’
disease; those who have been previously treated with antithyroid drugs; and those who have developed
thyrotoxicosis from amiodarone or interferon-alpha treatments [Roti and Uberti, 2001]) may experience
neuromuscular disorders, including myopathy (muscular weakness), periodic paralysis, myasthenia
gravis (weakness in skeletal muscles), peripheral neuropathy, tremor, and chorea (involuntary
movement disorder) (Boyages, 2000a).

3.3.3.3 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Chronic exposure to excess iodine has been shown to disrupt reproductive function secondary to thyroid
gland dysfunction. Induced changes in the menstrual cycle, including menorrhagia (excessive uterine
bleeding) and anovulation (no ovulation); spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and premature births have
also been associated with hypothyroidism (Longcope, 2000a).

Reproductive impairments associated with hyperthyroidism include amenorrhea (no uterine bleeding),
alterations in gonadotropin release and sex hormone-binding globulin, and changes in the levels and
metabolism of steroid hormones in both females and males (Longcope, 2000b).

Exposure to iodine may give rise to developmental defects secondary to thyroid gland dysfunction
(Boyages, 2000a, b). As noted in Section 3.3.3.2, hypothyroidism may be associated with impairment
in neurological development of the fetus or growth retardation (Boyages, 2000a, b; Snyder, 2000a).

Hyperthyroidism has been associated with accelerated growth linked to accelerated pituitary growth
hormone turnover or a direct effect of thyroid hormone on bone maturation and growth (Snyder, 2000b).

3.3.3.4 Immunotoxicity
No data could be located regarding immunotoxic effects in humans following repeated exposure to
iodine.

3.3.3.5 Genotoxicity
No data could be located regarding genotoxic effects in humans following repeated exposure to
iodine.

3.3.3.6 Carcinogenicity
The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has classified iodine as A4 - not
classifiable as a human carcinogen (ATSDR, 2004). The International Agency for Research on Cancer
has not classified non-radioactive iodine (ATSDR, 2004).

The results from several epidemiology studies suggest that increased iodide intake may be a risk factor
for thyroid cancer in certain populations, in particular, those that are iodine-deficient (Bacher-Stier et
al., 1997; Harach & Williams, 1995; Franceschi, 1998; Franceschi & Dal Maso, 1999). Studies of
populations in which iodine intakes are sufficient have not found significant associations between
iodine intake and thyroid cancer (Horn-Ross et al., 2001; Kolonel et al., 1990).

A lowest-observed-no-effect level of 3.5 µg/kg bw per day has been identified based on thyroid cancer
prevalence in Salta, an endemic goitre area in Argentina (Harach & Williams, 1995; Bacher-Stier et al.,
1997).

3.4 Animal toxicity studies
Laboratory animals, poultry, pigs and cattle have a high tolerance to large iodine intakes. Animal data
are of limited value to humans because of species differences in basal metabolic rate and in iodine
metabolism (IOM, 2001).

3.4.1 Toxicokinetics
Rapid absorption of iodine vapour following inhalation exposure observed in humans is supported by
studies in rats, mice, dogs and sheep (Willard & Bair, 1961; Bair et al., 1963). Compounds of iodine
were also seen to be rapidly absorbed in monkeys when inhaled as vapours or aerosols, with a half-life
of 10 min (Thieblemount et al., 1965; Perrault et al., 1967).

Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data from animal studies for iodine exposure via the
GI tract, were not apparent from the reviews identified during the literature search.

3.4.2 Acute toxicity
Due to the rapid conversion of iodine to iodide in vivo, the acute toxicity of iodine has been poorly
studied. Conversely, the acute toxicity of iodides and iodates have been well studied and can be used to
estimate the acute toxicity of iodine.

The acute oral median lethal dose (LD50)21 for potassium iodide in rats was 3320 mg iodide /kg bw and
in mice, 1425 mg iodide /kg bw (Stokinger, 1981).

3.4.3 Repeat dose toxicity

3.4.3.1 Systemic toxicity
A number of experimental studies on the effects of chronic exposure to excess iodine or iodide,
particularly on thyroid function have been reported, with representative studies from different species
summarized below:

       •    Two strains of chickens (CS and OS), genetically vulnerable to autoimmune thyroiditis, were
            given either 20 or 200 mg potassium iodide/L in their drinking water for the first 10 weeks of
            their lives. At both levels the incidence of the disease was increased as shown
            histopathologically, and also by measurements of, T4, T3 and thyroglobulin antibody titres
            (Bagchi et al., 1985).

       •    In female Wistar rats administered diets containing iodine concentrations between 0.015 and
            0.23 mg/kg bw per day for 10 weeks, significantly enlarged thyroids were found at all doses,
            with a dose-dependent increase at all doses (Fischer et al., 1989).

       •    Newton and Clawson (1974) reported a dose-dependent increase in thyroid weights of pigs
            administered iodine at concentrations between 3 and 218 mg/kg bw per day.

       •    Female calves fed iodine at concentrations between 0.011 and 3.96 mg/kg feed twice daily for
            5 weeks from day 4 of age showed a significant decrease in body weight gain at the highest
            dose; food intake was also decreased. Haematological changes (decreased packed cell volume)
            and clinical signs of nasal discharge were noted in the highest dose group and lacrimation was
            noted in the two highest dose groups (Jenkins & Hidiroglou, 1990).

       •    A NOAEL of 10 mg/L has been proposed for the most sensitive endpoint of thyroid hormone
            imbalance in rats. This was based upon a decrease in T3 levels and an increase in T4/T3 ratio
            after 100 days of iodine treatment (Sherer et al., 1991). When considering the use of rat models,
            it should be noted that rats are much more sensitive to thyroid hormone imbalance than humans
            (requiring around 10 times more T4/kg than humans).

3.4.3.2 Neurotoxicity
No data could be located regarding neurotoxic effects in animals following repeated exposure to
iodine.

3.4.3.3 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Arrington and colleagues (Arrington et al., 1965) investigated the reproductive and developmental
toxicity of iodine in a series of studies:

       •    Iodine administered to pregnant Long-Evans rats at a concentration of 2500 mg/kg in the diet
            for 12 days in the latter part of gestation was associated with an increased incidence of death in
            the neonates, < 10% of the neonates survived for more than 3 days. Length of labour
            (parturition) was also increased.

                                                                  72

    •   Syrian hamster pups from mothers fed iodine at 2500 mg/kg in the diet for 12 days in the latter
        part of gestation showed decreased feed intake (10%) and weaning weights at 21 days were
        significantly less than controls.

    •   Pups from pregnant rabbits (Dutch and New Zealand) fed iodine at concentrations between 250
        and 1000 mg/kg feed for 2–5 days before parturition showed decreased survival rates.

    •   Pregnant pigs receiving diets containing 1500 or 2500 mg iodine/kg feed for the 30 days prior
        to parturition delivered litters that were unaffected by dietary levels of iodine that were toxic to
        rabbits and rats.

In female rats administered 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg potassium iodide/kg diet throughout
gestation, lactation and weaning, pup survival was reduced from 93% in controls to 16% in rats given
the highest dose; milk secretion was also diminished. There were no adverse effects on ovulation rate,
implantation rate and fetal development (Ammermann et al., 1964). Brain enzymes of pups from
pregnant rats administered 11 mg potassium iodide/day in their drinking water (37 mg/kg bw per day)
showed transient increases in glutamate dehydrogenase and transient decreases in succinate
dehydrogenase. Phosphofructokinase and malate enzymes were increased; however, hexokinases were
unaffected. Serum T4 levels were also unchanged compared to controls (Morales de Villalobos et al.,
1986).

In further studies a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw per day has been derived for reproductive and
developmental toxicity in rats administered iodine by oral gavage (based on no observed toxicity at any
dose level). A NOAEL for parental toxicity of 10 mg/kg bw per day was also established (based on no
supported changes at any dose level) (EC, 2002).

Mares given 48–432 mg iodine/day during pregnancy and lactation produced foals with disturbed
metabolism. The long bones of the legs of the foals showed osteopetrosis (hard, dense bones). Serum
phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels were increased (Silva et al., 1987).

3.4.3.4 Immunotoxicity
No data could be located regarding immunotoxic effects in animals following repeated exposure to
iodine.

3.4.3.5 Genotoxicity (in vivo)
No data could be located regarding genotoxic effects in animals following repeated exposure to
iodine. (See 3.4.4 for in vitro genotoxicity studies.)

3.4.3.6 Carcinogenicity
Metaplasia of the thyroid was reported in rats given potassium iodide in their drinking water for two
years (dose not quoted by authors). This was thought to occur through a non-genotoxic proliferation
dependent mechanism (EVM, 2003)

3.4.4 In vitro toxicity studies
The mutagenicity data for iodine are generally negative; iodine has been shown to be non-mutagenic
using the mouse (TK +/-) lymphoma assay and no induction of unscheduled deoxyribonucleic acid
synthesis was seen in Syrian Hamster Embryo cells (ATSDR, 2004).

3.6 Toxicity of iodinated disinfection by-products
3.6.1 Formation and occurrence of iodinated disinfection by-products
When present in water, either at background levels or when used as a disinfectant, iodine has the ability
to form iodinated DBPs. These have been identified in some chloraminated drinking-water in countries
including the USA (Weinberg et al., 2002) and include:

    •   iodoacetic acid;
    •   bromoiodacetic acid;
    •   (Z)-3-bromo-3-iodopropenoic acid;
    •   (E)-3-bromo-3-iodopropenoic acid; and
    •   (E)-2-iodo-3-methylbutenedioic acid.

In addition, iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs) identified in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking
water (Richardson et al., 2007) have been identified as:

    •   dichloroiodomethane;
    •   bromochloroiodomethane;
    •   dibromoiodomethane;
    •   chlorodiiodomethane;
    •   bromodiiodomethane; and
    •   iodoform.

When chloramine or chlorine is used as a disinfectant, these compounds are usually present in very low
concentrations (fractional parts per billion) due to the low background presence of iodide in natural
waters.

Smith et al. (2010) compared the formation of DBPs from a number of iodine-based disinfectants (used
at the manufacturer’s recommended levels) to chlorination and chloramination under overdosing
conditions. The authors reported the following findings:

    •   the predominant THM formed during iodination was iodoform; chloroform predominated
        during chlorination or chloramination;
    •   THM formation increased with pH during chlorination but was only slightly elevated at neutral
        pH during iodination;
    •   use of iodine tincture was associated with higher levels of iodoform than with iodine tablets;
    •   iodoform formation with iodine tincture was 20–60% (on a molar basis) of chloroform
        formation during chlorination;
    •   total organic iodide formation was twice that of total organic chlorine;
    •   iodoacetic acid, diiodoacetic acid, and other iodoacids were also formed with iodine tincture
        treatment, but at levels < 11% of iodoform formation;
    •   a POU device combining an iodinated anion exchange resin with activated carbon post-
        treatment, indicated minimal formation of iodinated DBPs, no iodine residual and N-
        nitrosamine formation below 4 ng/L after the first few flushes of water.

3.6.2 Toxicological evaluations of iodinated disinfection by-products
Concern has arisen regarding iodinated DBPs as they are considered, on current evidence, to be of
greater toxicological concern than their brominated and chlorinated analogues (Richardson et al., 2007).

                                                   75

However, it should be noted that this view is predominantly based on findings from a very limited
dataset of in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays, which are described below; the applicability of
findings from in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays to humans has not been established at
present. A dataset of basic toxicological information on DBPs, as presented for iodine, is not available
at the current time. An exception to this is that iodoform has been tested in National Toxicology
Program bioassays and was not carcinogenic under test conditions (NCI, 1978).
Following the identification of iodoacids and iodinated THMs in chloraminated and chlorinated
drinking waters in the USA (section 3.6.1), Richardson et al. (2008) assessed the cytotoxicity and
genotoxicity of five iodoacids (iodoacetic acid, bromoiodoacetic acid, (Z)-3-bromo-3-iodo-propenoic
acid, (E)-3-bromo-3-iodo-propenoic acid, and (E)-2-iodo-3-methylbutenedioic acid) and two iodinated
THMs (dichloroiodomethane and bromochloroiodomethane) using in vitro assays with Chinese
Hamster Ovary cells.

The chronic cytotoxicity of the compounds measured in the study were ranked and compared to other
iodinated compounds by the authors. This resulted in a ranking order as follows:

  iodoacetic acid > (E)-3-bromo-2-iodopropenoic acid > iodoform > (E)-3-bromo-3-iodo-propenoic
      acid > (Z)-3-bromo-3-iodo-propenoic acid > diiodoacetic acid > bromoiodoacetic acid >
       (E)-2-iodo-3-methylbutenedioic acid > bromodiiodomethane > dibromoiodomethane >
              bromochloroiodomethane ~ chlorodiiodomethane > dichloroiodomethane.

With the exception of iodoform, the iodinated THMs were much less cytotoxic than the iodoacids.

Of the iodo-compounds analysed, 7 were genotoxic; their rank order was:

        iodoacetic acid >> diiodoacetic acid > chlorodiiodomethane > bromoiodoacetic acid >
            (E)-2-iodo-3-methylbutenedioic acid > (E)-3-bromo-3-iodo-propenoic acid >
                                 (E)-3-bromo-2-iodopropenoic acid.

The authors reported that, in general, compounds containing an iodo-group had enhanced mammalian
cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as compared to their brominated and chlorinated analogues.

In the study described previously (section 3.6.1), Smith et al. (2010) compared the cytotoxicity of THMs
in four natural waters treated with different disinfectants (free chlorine, 20mM monochloramine, 20mM
iodine tincture, 72 mM elemental iodine, 172mM potassium iodide as iodine tablets, and a personal
POU treatment unit). THMs formed following treatment with iodine tincture were associated with
between 19–92 times higher cytotoxicity than for chlorination, with toxicity being driven by total
organic iodine content of the water samples. The cytotoxicity of THMs formed with the iodine tablet
treatment was around 40% lower than for treatment with iodine tincture. The authors estimated that
from an exposure perspective, chlorination may be preferable to iodination for long-term disinfection,
where comparable degrees of disinfection are achieved. Use of the personal POU treatment unit was
also associated with THM formation, with associated cytotoxicity approximately 10% of that with
iodine tincture, but 6-fold higher than for chlorination, with no iodine residuals apparent.

The authors highlight the importance of considering all iodinated DBPs when evaluating potential risks,
with measurement of iodoacids, and iodoforms as the dominant DBPs, following iodination.
Diiodoacetic acid and iodoacetic acid were formed at levels < 10% of iodoform following treatment
with iodine tincture. However, iodoacetic acid has greater cytotoxicity (> 2 times) in mammalian cells
than iodoform, and distinct from iodoform is genotoxic.

3.7 Summary
    •   Limited data (both from human and animal studies) suggest that the bioavailability of iodine
        from foods and water is high, with inorganic iodine (usually in the form of iodide) being readily
        absorbed (92%) from the small intestine. Iodine is rapidly distributed, including across the
        placenta, and is stored in the thyroid gland for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3).
        Excess iodine is mainly excreted in the urine, with very small amounts excreted in sweat, faeces
        and exhaled air and secreted into human breast milk.
    •   In humans, several mechanisms help regulate iodine levels, to protect against toxicity; these
        include reduced iodine uptake and preferential production of more heavily iodinated thyroid
        hormones. Symptoms of acute iodine toxicity include vomiting and diarrhoea, metabolic
        acidosis, seizure, stupor, delirium, and collapse. Sensitizing reactions include iodine mumps,
        iododerma, and iodine fever.
    •   Chronic and sub-chronic iodine toxicity in humans includes disruption of thyroid function,
        leading to hypothyroidism which can present with or without goitre, hyperthyroidism, and
        changes in the incidence and types of thyroid malignancies. Responses of this type are
        associated with a general high iodine intake or where intervention has taken place to
        compensate for iodine deficiency. Measures of serum thyroid hormone levels (T4, T3 and TSH)
        are used as indicators of iodine disturbances in humans.
    •   Iodine-induced hypothyroidism in humans has the potential to produce neurological effects
        (delayed or deficient brain and neuromuscular development) in sensitive populations,
        particularly in fetuses and new-born infants. Hyperthyroidism in humans has been associated
        with accelerated growth.
    •   Dysfunction of the thyroid in humans has also been associated with reproductive disruptions
        including changes in the menstrual cycle, menorrhagia, anovulation, spontaneous abortions,
        stillbirths, and premature births.
    •   Iodine is not classifiable as a human carcinogen. Chronic iodine exposure has been associated
        with metaplasia of the thyroid, considered to occur via a non-genotoxic mechanism.
        Mutagenicity data for iodine are generally negative.
    •   Acute, sub-chronic, and chronic toxicity studies in animals support the findings from human
        studies.
    •   The adverse effects associated with high levels of iodine intake are linked to the disruption of
        thyroid hormone metabolism, the thyroid-pituitary axis, and the compensatory mechanisms that
        exist to protect such metabolism against low or high levels of iodine intake. Previous exposures
        to iodine and the complex effects of pre-existing thyroid conditions also influence the effects
        of subsequent exposure.
    •   A threshold level for inducing thyrotoxicosis has not been established and available data are
        inadequate to establish a dose-response relationship.
    •   Vulnerable members of the general population to iodine toxicity include pregnant and lactating
        women, and neonates.


Due to limited available evidence, there are uncertainties regarding both the potential for formation of
iodinated DBPs and likely adverse effects at the concentrations predicted to be formed from use of
iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant. The applicability of findings from in vitro cytotoxicity and
genotoxicity assays to humans has not been established at present.

4. Environmental considerations
Environmental considerations are largely beyond the scope of this report; however, as noted in Table
8, the impact of release of iodine into the environment to ‘non-target’ organisms should be considered.

5. Discussion and conclusions
The use of iodine for drinking-water disinfection, as with all water disinfectants, should be considered
in terms of risk versus benefit. Known issues of water quality in many parts of the world necessitate
additional measures to ensure potability. The risk of enteric infection should therefore be weighed
against the risk for, and severity of, acquiring thyroid disease from exposure to iodine over a short- and
long-term period of exposure, as well as alternative disinfection options.

Ideally a water treatment product (or combination of products) should be effective against all three
classes of pathogens, i.e. bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The evidence presented in this review indicates
that iodine is most effective against bacteria, has some effectiveness against viruses (particularly
iodinated resins) and comparatively less effectiveness against certain species of protozoa. Higher
dosages and longer contact times will be required when used as a disinfectant against protozoan cysts
such as Giardia. Iodine is not effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts at practical Ct values. At the
time of this publication, iodine has not been tested against WHO HWT performance targets and no
evaluations have been carried out on the health impacts in low-income settings with microbiologically
contaminated drinking-water.

From a disinfection perspective, iodine offers some advantages over chlorine:

    •   Water disinfection process requires less supervision, is simple and cost effective (although
        more expensive than chlorine); and
    •   Iodine may provide superior disinfection to chlorine for water of poor quality. The reduced
        overall reactivity of iodine prompts slower reactions with organic material and thus a lower
        disinfectant demand. The low reactivity with organic nitrogenous contaminants results in
        improved maintenance of residual iodine concentrations (Backer and Hollowell, 2000).

At the household level, there are a number of additional considerations beyond efficacy for determining
whether any product, including iodine, will protect health. Achieving health gains from HWT requires
products to be used correctly and consistently, and thus clear product information and use instructions
are important. In addition, user preferences, supply chains and availability, and cost are important
factors to consider. Products such as iodine and other drinking-water disinfectants which require a
reliable supply chain can be problematic in resource-limited settings where such systems are not in
place.

The lack of knowledge on long-term toxic effects of iodine consumption impedes the use of iodine for
disinfection of municipal or community supplies. Considerable controversy exists about the maximal
“safe” dietary dose of iodine (in the range of 500 to 1000 µg/day in healthy adults) and the maximum
“safe” period of consumption for iodine treated water. Although a number of studies have been carried
out, the data are not adequate to establish a linear and temporal dose response between iodine intake
and altered thyroid function (Backer & Hollowell, 2000).

Current POU water disinfection devices that are both effective in terms of disinfection and can achieve
low residual levels (0.01 ppm) of iodine (such as triiodinated resins including a granular activated
carbon filter), are considered to be “safe” from a toxicological perspective to use for long periods of
time in euthyroid individuals (see Table 6). Assuming drinking water consumption in an adult of 2 L
per day, residual iodine at this level would result in intakes of approximately 0.02 mg/day. This is well
below the low-end range of the recommended upper limit of 0.5 mg/day (CRN, 2013) even allowing
for greater consumption of drinking-water and/or intake of iodine from other sources. It is also low in

                                                   79

comparison to the AI of 0.15 mg/day for an adult recommended by EFSA (2014). However, for those
disinfection devices/methods that produce higher residual iodine levels (> 1 mg/L; such as iodine
tablets, which leave residual concentrations from 8–16 mg/L), intake of 2 L of purified water per day
would result in intakes of up to 32 mg/day, exceeding the recommended upper limit. Advice is given to
limit the use of such devices to a few months (Backer & Hollowell, 2000; WHO, 2011b). Current
evidence (outlined in section 3.3) suggests that intake at levels of 18 mg/day and above are associated
with changes to serum T4 and TSH levels and TSH response to TRH (Gardner et al., 1988). Although
no significant symptoms of thyroid dysfunction were associated with these biochemical changes, this
study was conducted over a two-week period; hence, it is unclear if thyroid dysfunction would become
apparent with prolonged exposure. Supporting evidence from a study of Peace Corps volunteers (Pearce
et al., 2002), which showed a positive relationship between thyroid dysfunction and intake of iodine at
50 mg/day over 32 months, suggests that this would occur.

Iodine use for water disinfection is therefore not recommended for high-risk members of the population
including:

    •   Infants and young children;
    •   Pregnant women (the fetus is vulnerable to goitre);
    •   Individuals with known hypersensitivity to iodine;
    •   Individuals with a history or strong family history of thyroid disease; and
    •   Individuals from areas of severe iodine deficiency (may lead to hyperthyroidism).

In summary, the current evidence indicates that:

    •   As a drinking-water disinfectant, iodine can be most effective against bacteria. Iodine is less
        effective against viruses and least effective against protozoa. Specifically, based on the
        information presented in Table 5, iodine solutions are less effective against these two pathogen
        classes compared to iodine resins.
    •   Effectiveness of iodine is impacted by the temperature, concentration, contact time, pH and
        organic content of water; however, this is to a lesser extent than for chlorine. In addition, the
        effectiveness of individual disinfectant products will vary according to manufacturing
        processes and related quality management.
    •   Higher dosages and longer contact times for iodine will be required when used as a disinfectant
        against protozoan cysts; iodine shows some effectiveness against Giardia cysts, but does not
        appear to be effective against Cryptosporidium oocysts.

Iodine would not be recommended for use as a primary disinfectant due to the lack of knowledge on
long-term toxic effects and the availability of widely used, well-characterized disinfectants.

Use of POU applications of iodine as a water disinfectant may be appropriate under certain
circumstances. In POU applications, the potential toxicity associated with iodine consumption from
drinking-water will be variable depending on the method employed for disinfection and individual
susceptibility. When considering to use iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant compared to other water
disinfectants, recommendations should be considered in the context of overall benefits versus harm
from potential iodine toxicity and ingestion of contaminated water, as outlined below:

    •   For euthyroid individuals using resin-based disinfection devices that result in low residual
        concentrations of iodine (e.g. those using resins with carbon filters), few adverse effects are
        anticipated. Although there is insufficient evidence to support long-term use of devices

                                                   80
                                                         Part II - Iodine as a drinking-water disinfectant


        containing resin-based disinfectants and carbon filters, it is anticipated that these devices could
        be used over extended periods of time. However, activated carbon filters should be replaced at
        frequencies recommended by the manufacturer. In addition, care should be taken to ensure the
        treated water is safely stored to prevent recontamination as the finished water will have no
        residual disinfectant.
   •    For euthyroid individuals using other iodine disinfection techniques that result in higher residual
        concentrations of iodine (e.g. solutions or tablets and resins without carbon filters), use should
        be restricted to as short a period of time as possible. If longer term use of a disinfectant is
        needed, another disinfectant should be utilized.
   •    For high-risk members of the population (noted on the previous page), water disinfection with
        iodine is not recommended and an alternative disinfectant should be utilized. However,
        disinfection should not be compromised due to the public health significance of
        microbiologically unsafe water, and therefore if iodine is the only disinfectant available, use
        should be limited to as short a time as possible, and an alternative disinfectant sought.

On the basis of limited effectiveness against viruses and particularly protozoa, as well as uncertainties
around the safety and toxicity, the use of iodine products may be appropriate for short-term use for
euthyroid individuals in targeted situations where the causative agent of disease is known. However,
where the causative disease agent is unknown, use by euthyroid individuals should ideally be combined
with another HWT method (e.g. with a filter) to provide comprehensive protection. The use of POU
devices should be appropriately approved or certified to ensure efficacy and safety.

Appendix A: Methodology
Two initial literature searches were conducted in November 2013 as follows:

    iii)    to update the toxicity assessment; and
    iv)     to update the efficacy assessment

The search strategy and terms are outlined in Box 1 and 2 respectively, below.

Box 1- Search strategy for toxicity assessment for iodine

 ((KEY(human OR animal) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY({in vitro} OR {in vivo})) AND
 DOCTYPE(ar OR re) AND PUBYEAR > 2004) AND ((TITLE-ABS-KEY(toxicokinetic
 OR irritation OR sensitisation) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(genotoxicity OR mutagenicity OR
 carcinogenicity) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY({Acute toxicity} OR {Repeat dose toxicity} OR
 {Chronic toxicity}) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY({Reproductive toxicity} OR {Developmental
 toxicity})) AND DOCTYPE(ar OR re) AND PUBYEAR > 2004) AND
 (((CASREGNUMBER(7553-56-2) AND DOCTYPE(ar OR re) AND PUBYEAR > 2004))



Box 2- Search strategy for efficacy assessment for iodine

 (TITLE-ABS-KEY(iodine) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY({drinking water} OR {potable
 water}) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(disinfection OR microorganism OR bacteria OR virus
 OR protozoa OR antimicrobial OR bactericidal OR bacteriostatic)) AND PUBYEAR >
 2004.



Searches were carried out using Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases. Titles and abstracts of
journal articles identified from the initial literature searches included 62 papers relating to iodine
toxicity and 155 papers relating to iodine efficacy, which were reviewed to inform on their potential
relevance to the project. For those titles selected, which were included in the document, papers were
obtained in full for review to extract key data. Additional searches were carried out as needed,
particularly for identification of “grey” literature, earlier studies and during the period of document
preparation (up to 16 December 2016).

1. Introduction
The emphasis of this literature review is to evaluate available evidence on the efficacy and toxicity of
silver as a water disinfectant. The report considers both ionic silver (Ag+) and silver nanoparticles
(AgNP) and also examines the effectiveness of copper-silver disinfection in plumbing systems for the
control of Legionella spp. The initial review was written in autumn 2013, but some aspects of the report
(specifically the efficacy of silver in household water treatment devices, in vivo oral toxicity studies, in
vitro studies on primary mammalian cell lines and genotoxicity) have been updated to account for
literature published until September 2015.

1.1 Antimicrobial properties
Silver has been known to have antibacterial properties since Roman times. However, the increased use
of nanosilver in a range of (as yet largely) experimental drinking-water treatment systems, its use in
conjunction with ceramic filters, and its perceived potential to be a water disinfectant that does not
result in disinfection by-products in the treated water, have raised the profile of this chemical.

Silver has been shown to have general (i.e. not specifically water disinfection related) antibacterial
properties against a range of both Gram-negative (e.g. Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas,
Salmonella and Vibrio) and Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Listeria,
Staphylococcus and Streptococcus) (Wijnhoven et al., 2009). Some researchers have also demonstrated
that fungi, such as Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisia, are sensitive to
silver (reviewed by Marambio-Jones & Hoek, 2010). In addition, a number of studies have suggested a
biocidal action of silver nanoparticles against hepatitis B virus (Lu et al., 2008), HIV-1 (Elechiguerra
et al., 2005), syncital virus (Sun et al., 2008) and murine norovirus (De Gusseme et al., 2010 – see
Sections 2.1.1. and 2.2). There is also a suggestion that silver nitrate (AgNO3) and some silver
nanoparticles may reduce the infectivity of Cryptosporidium oocysts (Abebe et al., 2015).

1.2 Nanoparticles
According to a review issued by the European Commission (2013) and cited by Bondarenko et al.
(2013), nanomaterial is defined as “a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles,
in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the
particles in the number size distribution, one or more of the external dimensions is in the size range 1–
100 nm.” In the scientific literature, nanoparticles are usually defined as particles having one or more
dimensions in the order of 100 nm or less (Moore, 2006). Although the terminology may be relatively
new, the use of silver nanoparticles is not (Nowack et al., 2011), with Lea (1889) reporting on the
synthesis of a citrate-stabilized silver colloid (which has an average particle size between 7 and 9 nm).

The most common method of producing silver nanoparticles is the chemical reduction of a silver salt
(often silver nitrate) dissolved in water with a reducing compound such as sodium borohydride, citrate,
glucose, hydrazine and ascorbate (Marambio-Jones & Hoek, 2010). There are, however, numerous
different manufacturing methods (including spark discharging, electrochemical reduction, solution
irradiation and cryochemical synthesis) some of which have been outlined by Marambio-Jones & Hoek
(2010). In addition to different manufacturing methods, different capping or stabilizing agents may be
used; these are generally used to prevent the silver nanoparticles from aggregating or agglomerating
(Ema et al., 2010) and common examples include polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citrate (Völker et
al., 2013). The different methods employed in the manufacturing process result in silver nanoparticles
with different sizes (typically < 50 nm), shapes (e.g. spheres, rods and cubes) and other characteristics.

1.3 Water-related applications
In terms of water disinfection-related applications, silver is most commonly used in domestic water
filters (allegedly to reduce the level of biofilm growth within the filter or, hypothetically, as an
additional level of treatment); it is used in both granular and powdered activated carbon filters and also
domestic ceramic water filters. It is also quite commonly used in conjunction with copper ionization as
a preventative measure against colonization by a variety of bacteria (especially Legionella spp.) in
plumbing hot water systems. Silver nanoparticles are currently being tested in a number of experimental
point-of-use (POU) treatment systems and ionic silver has been investigated for its potential use as a
secondary disinfectant in drinking-water supplies. Silver ions (in combination with both copper and
chlorine) have also been investigated for use in swimming pool disinfection. This report focuses on
both established and experimental use of silver for drinking-water disinfection and, briefly, the use of
copper-silver ionization for Legionella spp. control within plumbing systems.


2. Disinfection efficacy of silver
Numerous studies have been conducted on the disinfection efficacy of silver and silver nanoparticle
applications against a range of microorganisms found in water. Although the majority of these have
focused on bacterial disinfection (often using indicator bacteria), some have also looked at the impact
on bacteriophages, viruses and protozoa. In addition to the material below, which focuses on water
disinfection, there is also a short section (Appendix A) on the general disinfectant mode of action of
silver and silver nanoparticles.

2.1 Ionic silver applications
2.1.1 Efficacy of ionic silver for disinfection of potable water
In the studies outlined below, silver ion (ionic silver) efficacy (generated from silver salts [silver nitrate,
silver chloride (AgCl)] or produced electrolytically) was tested against a range of bacteria; the
inactivation was principally assessed by the log10 reduction in bacterial numbers. Initial bacterial
concentrations ranged from 3.5 cells/mL up to 1.5 x 107 cells/mL. Single studies examined the impact
of silver nitrate on bacteriophage (De Gusseme et al., 2010) and Cryptosporidium oocysts (Abebe et
al., 2015).

Hwang et al. (2007) looked at the efficacy of silver ions (up to 100 µg/L), derived from silver nitrate,
against Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli (all at 1.5 x 107
cells/mL) in synthetic drinking-water (pH 7, temperature 25 ᵒC – defined chemical composition outlined
in Hwang et al., 2006). After a three-hour contact time with the highest concentration of silver the
following log10 reductions were reported:

    •   2.4 log10 reduction – L. pneumophila;
    •   4 log10 reduction – P. aeruginosa;
    •   7 log10 reduction – E. coli.


Similar work was conducted by Huang et al. (2008), where the efficacy of silver ions, derived from
silver chloride, against 3 x 106 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL of P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii was investigated. A 5 log10 reduction in P. aeruginosa was
seen with 80 µg/L silver (the highest concentration used) after 12 hours. S. maltophilia was more


                                                     100

sensitive to Ag, with a 5 log10 reduction seen after 6 hours when exposed to 80 µg/L. For A. baumannii,
however, a 5 log10 reduction was only seen after 72 hours exposure to 80 µg/L Ag.

Silvestry-Rodriguez et al. (2007) investigated the inactivation of P. aeruginosa and Aeromonas
hydrophila by silver in tap water, with a view to assessing the possibility of using silver as a secondary
disinfectant to replace or reduce the level of chlorine. Dechlorinated municipal water (obtained from a
groundwater source) was seeded with 106 cfu/mL bacteria and silver nitrate added to a concentration of
100 µg/L. Experiments were performed at pH 7 and pH 9 at 24 ᵒC for both bacterial species and at 4 ᵒC
for P. aeruginosa. In addition, 3 mg/L of humic acid was added to the dechlorinated tap water (to
simulate a surface water source). Inactivation of the bacteria was time and temperature dependent; after
8 to 9 hours of exposure to 100 µg/L silver at 24 ᵒC, there was more than a 6 log10 reduction in both
bacteria (at 4 ᵒC a 4.5 log10 reduction in P. aeruginosa was seen only after 24 hours). Silver was found
to be almost as effective in reducing bacteria in the presence of humic acid (5.5 log10 reduction in P.
aeruginosa at pH 7, 24 ᵒC after 8 hours in the presence of 3 mg/L humic acid). This group also looked
at the potential for exposure to silver (100 µg/L) to reduce biofilm formation in drinking-water
distribution systems (Silvestry-Rodriguez et al., 2008). In this role, silver was found to be ineffective,
and there was no difference seen between the silver treatment and the control.

Cunningham et al. (2008) used flow cytometry to examine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
of silver nitrate on E. coli, with a view to the methodology being used to examine water and wastewater
disinfection. They reported a 24 hour MIC of between 60 and 80 µg/L for silver. A 4 log10 reduction
(approximately) was seen at 100 µg/L after 24 hours of exposure.

Pathak & Gopal (2012) evaluated the efficacy of silver ions against E. coli. Bacteria (concentration –
1.75 x 103 cfu/mL) were exposed to various concentrations of silver ions (1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 µg/L),
produced from silver electrodes, for up to 60 minutes. A 3 log10 reduction was seen at neutral pH and
ambient temperature after a 20 minute period for the 20 µg/L concentration. A 3 log10 reduction was
also seen for the other silver concentrations (with the exception of 1 µg/L), although a longer contact
time was required (10 µg/L – 40 minutes; 5 µg/L – 50 minutes; 2 µg/L – 60 minutes). Disinfection was
most efficient at pH values between pH 8 and 9 and at temperatures greater than 20 ᵒC.

Nawaz et al. (2012) looked at the efficacy of silver (silver nitrate) in inactivating P. aeruginosa and E.
coli in rooftop harvested rainwater supplies. Prior to disinfection, samples were found to contain
between 350–440 cfu/100 mL P. aeruginosa and 740–920 cfu/100 mL E. coli. The disinfection rate and
residual effect of silver was determined using final silver concentrations between 10–100 µg/L over a
period of up to 168 hours. Samples were taken for microbial analysis every two hours for 14 hours after
the application of silver and then daily for one week, to examine regrowth. At higher concentrations
(80–100 µg/L) complete inactivation (log10 reduction values [LRVs] between 2.5 and 2.9) of both
microorganisms was seen in 10 hours, with no regrowth of E. coli seen after 168 hours. Inactivation
was slower at lower silver concentrations (LRVs between 1.3 and 2 for silver concentrations between
10–40 µg/L after 14 hours) and regrowth was also observed (e.g. 7.5% survival of P. aeruginosa
exposed to 10 µg/L silver for 168 hours compared to approximately 4.5% survival at 14 hours). Thus,
at the lower concentrations, silver only seemed to delay bacterial reproduction and did not cause
permanent damage or loss of ability to increase in number. There were, however, a number of
methodological issues with this study, including a lack of follow-up investigation to document
regrowth.

Adler et al. (2013) also looked at the effectiveness of silver disinfection as part of rainwater harvesting
treatment. Ten rainwater harvesting systems in Mexico, equipped with silver electrodes, were evaluated


                                                   101
                                                         Part III - Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


for a number of water quality parameters. The silver electrodes were located in line with the filtering
system (after a mesh filter, designed to remove large particles, and before an activated carbon filter).
On average, the ionizers reduced the level of total coliforms by approximately 1 log10 and E. coli by
approximately 0.4 log10 and resulted in a silver concentration of approximately 0.01 mg/L in the final
water. The systems, as a whole, delivered water containing 0/100 mL E. coli and less than 10/100 mL
total coliforms.

In a comparative study of disinfectants, the potency of silver ions, derived from silver nitrate, was
examined in a batch disinfection test of ground water using 106 cfu/mL E. coli (Patil et al., 2013). It
was found that for a 6 log10 reduction (i.e. complete inactivation), the minimum concentration of silver
required was 10 mg/L with a contact time of 3 hours. The bacterial studies are summarized in Table 1
below.

De Gusseme et al. (2010) in a study of ionic silver and silver nanoparticles (outlined in more detail in
Section 2.2) found that silver nitrate, at a concentration of 5.4 mg/L, added to UZ1 bacteriophage-spiked
(2 x 106 plaque-forming units (pfu)/100 mL) bottled water, produced a 3.1 log10 reduction after 2 hours
and a > 4 log10 reduction after 5 hours.

The infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum to mice following exposure of the oocysts to high levels of
silver ions (100 mg/L ionic silver from silver nitrate for 30 minutes) was investigated by Abebe et al.
(2015). Infectivity was determined by the effect on animal weight and the number of parasites shed in
the stool, relative to those exposed to untreated oocysts. Mice receiving silver nitrate treated oocysts
demonstrated 3% weight loss at 3 days post infection, compared with 12% weight loss in those mice
exposed to untreated oocysts. Parasite shedding was also significantly lower in the animals receiving
treated oocysts.

It can be seen from these studies that LRVs varied widely, with some bacteria being more sensitive to
silver (i.e. more easily killed or inactivated) than others. Generally, relatively long contact times were
required to effectively reduce bacterial concentrations (e.g. 3 hours or longer), the exception being the
study of Pathak & Gopal (2012), where silver ions were generated electrolytically (rather than from
silver salts), and a 3 log10 reduction was seen after 20 minutes at a relatively low silver concentration
(20 µg/L). In contrast to the laboratory-spiked samples, where generally higher LRVs were reported,
relatively LRVs were seen in harvested rainwater samples (with a low initial bacterial concentration)
used by Nawaz et al. (2012). The bacteriophage study of De Gusseme et al. (2010), while suggesting
that silver nitrate can result in 3 log10 reduction of UZ1, used a high silver concentration (5 mg/L),
which would not be relevant as a drinking-water application. The one study on C. parvum (Abebe et
al., 2015) indicates that silver may potentially be effective for protozoa reduction, but more research is
needed.

2.1.2 Copper/silver ionization
Copper/silver is generally applied to water as an ionization process, with the electrolytic generation of
copper and silver ions. Sometimes it is used in combination with a halogen (e.g. chlorine, iodine),
although it may also be applied as copper and silver salts. Copper/silver systems are generally used for
Legionella control (typically in hospital hot water systems), where there are long contact times within
the plumbing system. They have been investigated for the treatment of swimming pool water (which is
beyond the scope of this report).

2.1.3 Hospital water systems
Copper/silver ionization is often used for Legionella control in hot water distribution systems especially
in hospital environments. The studies outlined in this sub-section typically relate to systems that are in
use and so tend to assess samples for the presence/absence of the organism of interest, rather than using
quantitative tests to determine log10 reduction. It is generally considered that ion levels should be
regularly monitored and remain within prescribed concentrations (USEPA, 2015; WHO, 2007);
published studies suggest levels of between 0.2 to 0.8 mg/L for copper and 0.01 to 0.08 mg/L silver are
needed to maximize efficacy (Cachafeiro et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2011).

Liu et al. (1998) looked at the intermittent use of a single copper/silver ionization system in the hot
water systems of two buildings. Twenty distal sites in each building were examined for Legionella
before the start of ionization and then monthly after installation. The elimination of Legionella took
between 4 and 12 weeks. After cessation of disinfection (16 weeks), re-colonization did not occur for
between 6 to 12 weeks (depending on the sampling site) in the first building, and 8 to 12 weeks in the
second building. The control building (no ionization) remained positive for Legionella throughout the
study period.

In 2003, Stout & Yu (2003) reported on surveys of the first 16 hospitals in the USA to install
copper/silver ionization systems for Legionella control. Prior to installation, all of the hospitals had
reported cases of hospital-acquired Legionnaires’ disease and 75% had attempted other disinfection
methods. Two postal surveys (1995 and 2000) gathered information on environmental monitoring of
Legionella, identification of hospital-acquired legionellosis, and monitoring and maintenance of the
copper/silver ionization systems. Legionella monitoring was conducted at 15 out of the 16 hospitals at
both time points, although the frequency of monitoring was markedly lower at the second survey (9/16
hospitals reported monthly or quarterly monitoring in 1995, compared to only 4/16 hospitals reporting
quarterly monitoring in 2000). Regular monitoring (undefined) of copper/silver concentrations was
reported by 15/16 hospitals in 1995; no information is presented for the 2000 survey. Colonization of
distal water sites with Legionella was much less frequent after installation of the copper/silver ionization
(with between 7 and 8 of the hospitals reporting zero positivity of monitoring sites, and the remaining
hospitals reporting 30% positivity or lower). A single case (shortly after installation) of hospital-
acquired Legionnaires’ disease was reported from the surveyed hospitals after implementation of
copper/silver ionization.

In Switzerland, Blanc et al. (2005) found that at a water temperature of 50 ᵒC, copper/silver ionization
was not effective at reducing Legionella in their hospital hot water system (90% of water samples were
positive for Legionella before treatment, 93% were positive after the introduction of ionization),
although they acknowledged that the low concentration of ions (copper 0.3 mg/L, silver not reported)
and the high pH (7.8–8.0) of the hot water may have explained the poor results. High pH had previously
been shown to have a detrimental effect on the ability of copper ions to kill Legionella (Lin et al., 2002).
In addition, trisodium phosphate was used within the hospital hot water system to protect against

                                                    104

corrosion; copper ions are known to bind to phosphate (Lin & Vidic, 2006), which will reduce their
efficacy against Legionella. Blanc et al. (2005) found that ionization in conjunction with increased
temperature (65 ᵒC) was more effective, with the number of Legionella positive samples falling to 39%,
and the level of Legionella in the positive samples also decreasing (mean of 7.6 cfu/mL with ionization
alone, compared to a mean of 0.23 cfu/mL with ionization and a raised temperature).

In Spain, Mòdol et al. (2007) looked at hospital-acquired Legionnaires’ disease following introduction
of a copper/silver ionization system. Prior to installation, hospital-acquired Legionnaires’ disease was
2.45 cases/1000 patient discharges. After installation, the level dropped to 0.18 cases/1000 patient
discharges and, after increasing ion levels, no further cases of Legionnaires’ disease were reported up
to the end of the study period (19 months). Prior to installation, 57% of water samples were positive
for L. pneumophila compared to 16% after installation, when the system was running consistently with
copper/silver ion levels greater than 0.3 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively.

Pedro-Botet et al. (2007) investigated the impact of copper/silver ionization on fungal colonization of
a number of health-care centre water systems after noticing that the number of consultations regarding
fungal infections in their centre had dropped markedly since the installation of an ionization system (for
Legionella control). Samples from ionized water distribution systems (nine health care centres) were
compared with non-ionized systems (seven health care centres). The prevalence of fungi was
significantly lower in the samples of ionized water (29% compared to 77%) in both hot and cold water
systems – with the most marked difference seen in the cold water samples (14% compared to 88%). A
decrease in fungal colonization following the implementation of copper/silver ionization was also
reported by Chen et al. (2013). They found a 40% reduction in fungal colonization during ionization
treatment, with fungi isolated from only 2% of samples during this period.

Chen et al. (2008) looked at the efficacy of a point-of-entry copper/silver ionization system (designed
to treat both hot and cold water) against L. pneumophila in a hospital water distribution system. Prior
to installation, typically between 32% and 50% of samples were positive for L. pneumophila. In the
first three months (when ion levels were well below recommended levels: average copper and silver
levels of 0.095 and 0.012 mg/L respectively), no change was seen in the number of positive samples.
However, when ion concentrations were reportedly increased (average copper and silver levels of 0.135
and 0.011 mg/L respectively) in months 4 to 7, the number of positive samples decreased significantly
to between 5 and 16%. Rates of Legionella positivity dropped further to between 0 and 5% after month
7. Mean positivity remained at 50% in the control (non-treated) sites. The ion concentrations varied
between sampling sites and over the course of the monitoring. Mean levels (between months 4 to 12)
were 0.132 mg/L copper and 0.012 mg/L silver, below the target concentrations of 0.2 and 0.02 mg/L
respectively. The authors note that, while the system was not operating at the required ion
concentrations and did not completely eradicate L. pneumophila, no cases of hospital-acquired
Legionnaires’ disease were reported during the year-long study.

According to Lin et al. (2011) emergence of L. pneumophila with resistance to copper/silver ions has
been documented in some cases, usually several years after installation of the ionization system,
although hospitals where ion concentrations and Legionella positivity were monitored were less likely
to report resistance problems.

In 2012, five confirmed and 16 probable hospital-acquired cases of Legionnaires’ disease were
identified in Pittsburgh, USA at one of the first hospitals to adopt copper/silver ionization for Legionella
treatment in 1993. The system was successful for several years. Reports suggest that prior to the
outbreak and until the outbreak was formally identified the system had not been subject to appropriate

monitoring and control and the system had not been properly run (with issues such as an incorrect
amperage being used and staff not appreciating the importance of maintaining the correct pH range).24
A Centre for Disease Control study noted that the outbreak coincided with construction work at the
hospital, which may have introduced organic matter to the water system, increasing consumption of
chlorine leading to amplification of Legionella.25

Typically, it would seem that copper/silver ionization reduces the number of Legionella (and fungal)
positive samples in treated systems; however, it may not completely eradicate the pathogen. This point
was made by Cachafeiro et al. (2007) who, following a review of the literature, noted that eradication
cannot be achieved by any method in isolation and that maintaining high temperatures in hot water
systems maximizes the effectiveness of the ionization approach. Despite the fact that complete
eradication of the pathogen is not achieved, a number of studies have suggested that the implementation
of copper/silver ionization markedly reduces the number of cases of hospital-acquired Legionnaires’
disease.

2.2 Silver nanoparticle applications
The potential of silver nanoparticles for household POU drinking-water disinfection is currently being
extensively explored, principally in conjunction with filtration. The medium or matrix utilized for the
nanoparticles varies widely and includes coating on polyurethane foams (Jain & Pradeep, 2005),
fibreglass (Nangmenyi et al., 2009), copolymer beads (Gangadharan et al., 2010), paper (Dankovich &
Gray, 2011), polystyrene resin beads (Mthombeni et al., 2012), alginate composite beads (Lin et al.,
2013), ceramic (Lv et al., 2009), titiania (Liu et al., 2012), activated carbon composite incorporating
magnetite (Valušová et al., 2012) and bacterial carriers (De Gusseme et al., 2010; 2011). As the focus
here is on the efficacy of silver in water disinfection, only studies where this can be distinguished from,
for example, the filtration effect, have been considered below. In addition to considering the LRVs of
microorganisms exposed to the test material, a number of studies also conducted zone of inhibition
tests.26

Jain & Pradeep (2005) coated polyurethane foam with citrate-stabilized silver nanoparticles. The
antibacterial efficacy was assessed by adding small pieces of Ag-treated or untreated foam to E. coli
suspensions (105–106 cfu/mL) and assessing bacterial growth after a 5- or 10-minute exposure period.
No bacterial growth was seen in the samples exposed to Ag-treated polyurethane, while the untreated
polyurethane samples showed “substantial growth”. In addition, no growth of E. coli was detected on
agar plates beneath pieces of silver nanoparticle-treated foam in a zone of inhibition test. A prototype
filter was created using the treated foam, which was found to be effective at eliminating E. coli growth,
but equivalent data are not available for untreated foam, making the contribution of the silver treatment
difficult to determine.

Nangmenyi et al. (2009) looked at the performance of silver nanoparticle (< 30 nm) impregnated
fibreglass during immersion and during filtration. For the immersion test, a silver-impregnated mat (1%
silver by weight) was added to a 100 mL E. coli suspension (106 cfu/mL). After an hour of immersion,
E. coli could not be detected in the suspension. Using an E. coli concentration of 1012 cfu/mL, the silver
nanoparticle fibreglass mat (1.8% silver by weight) resulted in a 7 log10 reduction in concentration in

   The zone of inhibition is the area on an agar plate containing a lawn of bacteria where the growth of the microorganisms is
prevented by the antimicrobial activity of the test material placed on the agar surface.

five minutes. Antibacterial filters (5% silver by weight) were fabricated and a bacterial solution (106
cfu/mL E. coli) was pumped through the filter at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. E. coli were not found in
the treated water, amounting to a 6 log10 reduction. The untreated fibreglass accounted for only an
approximately 1 log10 reduction.

Lv et al. (2009) examined the efficacy of silver nanoparticle-coated porous ceramic tiles. The ceramic
was modified (using a coupling agent) to ensure that the silver nanoparticles were fixed to the material
(rather than relying on weak forces of attraction). There was no obvious loss of silver nanoparticles
when the tiles were exposed to water. Antibacterial action was assessed by exposing a solution of E.
coli (104–105 cfu/mL) to pieces of the treated and untreated (control) ceramic, followed by conducting
a zone of inhibition test and a flow test. After 24 hours, no bacteria could be grown from the samples
exposed to silver-treated ceramic and, in the zone of inhibition test, there was a clear zone where no
bacteria grew on the agar plate after 24 hours of exposure to the ceramic. In the flow test using an
experimental water filter (flow rate 10 mL/min), no bacteria were detected in the filtered water.
Substantial (unquantified) concentrations of bacteria, however, were detected in water filtered through
untreated ceramic. The authors suggest two possible antimicrobial mechanisms, namely: (a) the bacteria
are killed by ionic silver released from the ceramic; and/or (b) the bacteria flowing from the ceramic
are contaminated with silver, which prevents their subsequent growth. Silver measurements, however,
were not reported from the filtered water.

Gangadharan et al. (2010) investigated the antibacterial effectiveness of polymer microspheres
containing non-leaching silver nanoparticles by incubating various bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, B.
subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, with concentrations of between 10 x 106–300 x 106 cfu/mL), with
the beads for up to 24 hours. The beads were found to be effective against both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria, with bacterial counts reduced to zero for all strains tested, with the exception
of B. subtilis (where a 3 log10 reduction was seen). Zones of inhibition were seen around agar plated
beads for all of the bacteria tested. There was no bacterial adsorption or adhesion to the silver-containing
beads.

Heidarpour et al. (2011) investigated the ability of silver nanoparticle-coated polypropylene filters to
remove E. coli from water. Fifteen litres of distilled water containing 103 cfu/mL E. coli was passed
through either uncoated or silver-coated filters at a flow rate of 3 litres per hour. After 7 hours of
filtration and re-circulation, the E. coli level from the silver-treated filter was zero, while the
concentration from the untreated filter remained at 103 cfu/mL. Scanning electron micrographs
demonstrated E. coli cells attached to the surface of the silver nanoparticle-coated filter. No silver
nanoparticles were detected in the treated water. The reported bacterial removal is likely to be a
combination of the bacteriostatic/bactericidal impact of the silver and the decreased pore size of the
silver-treated polypropylene in comparison with the untreated material (pore size of 1.3 µm and 9.9 µm,
respectively).

Dankovich & Gray (2011) investigated the efficacy of nanosilver impregnated paper for reducing
bacterial contamination in water. The silver nanoparticles were produced in situ by the reduction of
silver nitrate in the paper sheet. The bactericidal impact was assessed by passing model bacterial
suspensions (E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis) through the paper and analysing the effluent water for
viable bacteria. The average percolation time for 100 mL of bacterial solution was 10 minutes. Plate
counts showed up to a 7.6 and a 3.4 log10 reduction of viable E. coli and E. faecalis (respectively) in the
effluent compared to the initial concentration of bacteria (109 cfu/mL) at the highest silver concentration
(5.9 mg silver/dry g paper). Of this reduction, less than 1 log10 was attributed to the filtration of the
paper. The average silver content of the effluent water was 50 µg/L. Dankovich (2014) has done further

work, examining the effect of producing the nanosilver paper using a safer technique. Filtration through
the paper, produced using glucose as a reducing sugar in combination with a domestic microwave oven,
produced similar results to the earlier work, with an 8.1 log10 reduction for E. coli (initial concentration
1 x 109 cfu/mL) and a 2.3 log10 reduction for E. faecalis (initial concentration 2 x 108 cfu/mL), with a 1
log10 reduction attributed to the paper alone. It was thought, based on filtration time, that there was a
greater physical retention of E. coli compared to E. faecalis. The average silver content in the treated
water was 105 ± 36.3 µg/L.

Mpenyana-Monyatsi et al. (2012) compared the bacterial removal by a number of low-cost filter
materials coated with silver nanoparticles. Various concentrations of silver nanoparticles were
deposited on zeolite, sand, fibreglass, anion resin and cation resin substrates. In the first phase of
analysis, the substrates were tested using E. coli spiked water samples (106 cfu/100 mL), to determine
the optimal silver loading (0.1 mM). In the second phase, each of the substrates (with the optimal silver
loading) was tested against E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, S. dysenteriae and Vibrio cholerae in
groundwater samples (all bacteria present at 103 cfu/100 mL). The silver/cation resin filter was found
to be the best performing, achieving 3 log10 reduction of all the targeted bacteria, with no regrowth over
2 hours. The silver/zeolite filter was found to have the worst performance, with log10 reduction rates
between 0.5 and 2. The amount of silver ions eluted from the filter material varied according to material
type and time, with high concentrations released from zeolite, sand, fibreglass and anion resin substrates
within the first 10 minutes (maximum concentration 1.8 mg/L). The cation resin filter released the
lowest concentration of silver (less than 100 µg/L) in the eluent and, thus was found to be the best
performing in terms of bacterial reduction and silver loss.

Lin et al. (2013) synthesized and studied the efficacy of three types of silver nanoparticle-alginate
composites for application as a POU technology for water disinfection. Alginate was chosen as the
immobilization/delivery material because of both its natural abundance and biocompatibility. The
finished beads were used to create porous columns and the bacterial removal abilities of the different
beads were compared using E. coli (approx. 105 cfu/mL). Two of the three bead types consistently
produced a 5 log10 reduction during filtration, even with a short hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the
third bead type produced a 2 log10 reduction. Silver was also measured in the filtered water, and again
the three bead types produced different results ranging from 11–98 µg/L to 4–22 mg/L (depending on
the type and HRT). The authors speculate that the disinfection efficacy, despite the short retention time,
is probably due to released silver ions or silver nanoparticles in the effluent, which continue to exert an
influence over the test bacteria even after plating for culture assay, although one bead type produced
both low silver concentration in the filtered water and excellent removal of E. coli. The authors
concluded that the results suggest that the beads show promise, but note that long-term breakthrough
studies are needed. Other researchers have noted that the validity of efficacy studies could be biased
because they did not correct for the presence of toxic contaminants. Samberg et al. (2011), for example,
investigated the efficacy of silver nanoparticles against a number of bacteria in culture medium and
found that washed and unwashed silver nanoparticles had notably different MICs (e.g. for the 20 nm
silver nanoparticles against E. coli J53, MICs were 64 µg/mL and < 4 µg/mL, respectively). The
additional toxicity of the unwashed particles was attributed to the presence of formaldehyde.

Loo et al. (2013) explored the use of silver nanoparticles in cryogels as a possible POU treatment. The
silver nanoparticle-treated gels were added to water containing 108 cfu/mL of E. coli or B. subtilis. After
15 seconds, to allow swelling, the gel was removed from the bacterially spiked (bulk) water and
squeezed to recover the absorbed water. Gels with different silver contents (0 and approximately 20, 90
and 170 mg/g) were assessed. Significantly higher disinfection efficacies (5.4–7 log10 reduction) were
seen for the “squeezed” water compared to the remaining bulk water (maximum 2 log10 reduction). The

highest log10 reduction was seen from the gel with the greatest silver nanoparticle content
(approximately 6.5 and 7 log10 reduction for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively). Untreated gel was
capable of less than 1 log10 reduction. The silver content of the squeezed water was assessed and found
to range between 36.4 to 76.6 µg/L (with the lower concentrations being from the 90 and 170 mg/g
gels; 59.6 and 36.4 µg/L, respectively). The squeezed water contained both ionic silver (45–56%) and
silver nanoparticles.

De Gusseme et al. (2010; 2011) have investigated the possibility of using biogenic silver for water
disinfection, where bacteria are used as reducing agents for the production of nanosized elemental silver
particles. In comparison with chemically produced silver nanoparticles, the biogenic particles were
found to be far more effective at disinfection. In a spiking experiment using a bacteriophage (106
pfu/mL), biogenic silver produced a 4 log10 reduction after three hours, while the chemically produced
elemental silver particles showed no inactivation. The biogenic particles were also found to be effective
against murine norovirus, with a greater than 4 log10 reduction after only 30 minutes. The capacity of
biogenic silver for use in continuous disinfection was assessed following coating of an electropositive
cartridge filter. Addition of the biogenic silver increased the reduction of virus from 1.5 log10, with the
filter alone, to 3.8 log10. Low concentrations of ionic silver (3 µg/L) were initially detected in the filtrate
(up to 5 minutes); thereafter, none was detected (De Gusseme et al., 2010). This group has also looked
at the immobilization of biogenic silver to microporous membranes (De Gusseme et al., 2011). The
system was found to be capable of achieving at least a 3.4 log10 reduction in bacteriophage concentration
(compared to a less than 1 log10 reduction by the membrane alone). Silver was found to leach out of the
system; initially levels of 271 µg/L were recorded, but these soon dropped to below 100 µg/L.

Patil et al. (2013) conducted a comparative study of disinfectants for use in household water treatment
systems and considered both silver ions (outlined in Section 2.1.1) and silver nanoparticles, using a
batch disinfection test of ground water spiked with E. coli (106 cfu/mL). Silver nanoparticles
(synthesized from silver nitrate using citrate as a reducing agent) at 1 mg/L required a 3 hour contact
time for a 6 log10 reduction.

Mecha & Pillay (2014) investigated the efficacy of silver nanoparticle-impregnated woven fabric
microfiltration membranes. Turbidity removal was examined using water with up to 700 nephlometric
turbidity units (NTU) and disinfection performance was assessed using three concentrations of E. coli,
based on river water (2500 and 10 000 cfu/100 mL) and one on synthetic feed water (77 000 cfu/100
mL). The silver nanoparticle impregnated membranes, after an initial priming period, reduced turbidity
to below 1 NTU, irrespective of the turbidity of the feed water. E. coli removal for the membrane alone
was between 84–91%, while the coated membrane completely removed E. coli (i.e. up to 5 log10
reduction). Silver eluted from the coated filters was below 0.02 mg/L. A long-term study showed that
the silver-coated membrane was effective at removing E. coli for at least 2 months of continuous
operation (Mecha et al., 2014).

Liu et al. (2014) examined the use of nanosilver textile fixed to a plastic tube as a POU disinfection kit.
The kit is immersed in the water to be treated and then used to stir the water (for 1, 5 or 10 minutes).
The system produced minimal reduction in bacteria naturally present in rainwater (LRVs between 0.61
and 0.96 depending upon contact time) and also spiked concentrations of E. coli (1.65 log10 reduction
after 5 minutes).

In mice infectivity tests (outlined in Section 2.1.1), Abebe et al. (2015) found that treatment of
Cryptosporidium oocysts with proteinate-capped or PVP-capped silver nanoparticles resulted in a minor
reduction (statistical significance not stated) in the level of weight loss (12% reduction in body weight

in mice receiving untreated oocysts compared with an 8% and 6% loss [respectively] for the mice
receiving silver nanoparticle-treated oocysts). Some reduction was also seen in the amount of oocyst
shedding in the stool, with the proteinate-capped silver nanoparticles resulting in a marked (but non-
statistically significant) reduction in shedding.

The majority of studies considering silver nanoparticles for drinking-water treatment applications tested
efficacy against bacteria, typically E. coli, with the exception being the work of De Gusseme et al.
(2010, 2011), who considered the effects against bacteriophage and murine norovirus and Abebe et al.
(2015) who considered Cryptosporidium infectivity. Typically, good bacterial LRVs were reported (as
summarized in Table 2), with values up to 7 log10 reduction (depending upon the spiking concentration)
for E. coli. However, in many cases, contact times were generally long. Generally, the silver
nanoparticle test materials were effective in both test tube trials (where the silver-treated material is
immersed in microbially spiked water) and, where tested, following filtration. Where reported, levels
of silver in the filtered water were usually below 50 µg/L.

2.3 Silver-coated ceramic filter applications
A number of different types of silver-coated or silver-impregnated ceramic filters (using e
nanoparticles or silver nitrate) have been used as POU devices, typically in developing co
household treatment of drinking-water. Much of the literature on ceramic filter studies, ho
been designed to look at the effectiveness of the filters, rather than the impact of the si
effectiveness (e.g. Baumgartner et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2008; Clasen et al., 2004, 2005;
al., 2008; Salsali et al., 2011; Abebe et al., 2014). In addition to filters employing silver
microbial removal, domestic (and travel) filters may also incorporate silver into the filte
biofilm formation, however, no published literature (in terms of silver efficacy) was fou
application.

Van Halem et al. (2007) reported results from filter challenge studies with E. coli (K12), C
spores and MS2 bacteriophage for six silver nanoparticle-coated and six uncoated Nicaragu
filters (Table 3). Although the silver-coated filters slightly outperformed the uncoated filter
removal, the difference was not statistically significant. There was very little difference in p
for Clostridium spore removal and the silver-free filters outperformed the coated filters a
points for MS2 bacteriophage removal.

The two MS2 experiments were done at different points in a long-term study, namely week 5 and week 13. The a
that the improvement in performance between the two time points may be due to biofilm formation.




Wubbels et al. (2008) looked at the bacterial removal efficiency of silver (unspecified) im
ceramic filters in extensive laboratory-based testing. Ceramic, candle-type filters with a
silver were compared for their ability to remove E. coli WR1 (106 cfu/L) spiked into drinkin
further details available), at two different flow rates, over time. Over 8000 litres of drinking
passed through each of the filters and samples were periodically spiked with E. coli an
reduction efficacy assessed (Table 4). Initially, there was little difference between the filter
generally, between 5 and 6 log10 reduction seen in all cases. After passage of almost 5500 litr
however, the silver filters started to out-perform the non-silver filters. After over 8000
reduction rates had dropped for both silver (log10 reduction 2.2–3.2) and non-silver (log10 red
1.2) filters. The silver concentration in the effluent from the silver filters ranged between 11
µg/L at the start of the experiment to 1.72 to 3.65 µg/L at the end.

Bielefeldt et al. (2009) showed that the disinfection efficacy of ceramic filters could be variable. In tests
of untreated (2 filters), or previously heavily used silver nanoparticle-treated filters, E. coli (K12) LRVs
varied between < 1 to > 4 for both the untreated and heavily used filters. The initial filter run tended to
show the best reduction, with LRVs of between 3.7 and 4 in the untreated filters, and 2.9 to 4.1 in the
heavily used filters. Re-coating of the previously heavily used filters improved LRVs slightly, but filters
still showed high variability between filter runs and the improved removal efficiencies were not
maintained. As with the initial tests, the first filter run was generally the one with the best reduction
(3.5 log10 to 4.5 log10). It is not clear from the paper whether the short-term improvement with re-coating
was statistically significant. Silver, however, was found to be important in preventing contamination of
subsequent batches of un-spiked dechlorinated water passing through the filter (levels of < 20 to 41
cfu/mL in recoated filters compared to 103–105 cfu/mL prior to re-recoating).

Bloem et al. (2009) looked at E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage removal from filters with and without
silver (silver nitrate). Water was spiked with 103–106 cfu/mL E. coli or 103–104 pfu/mL MS2 and passed
through the filters. Twenty litres of water was treated daily for up to six months. Over the lifetime of
the experiment, the silver-treated filters outperformed the untreated ones with mean E. coli LRVs of 5.9
and 3.1, respectively. No difference was seen between treated and untreated filters in MS2 removal,
with removal being uniformly low (0.5 log10). As reported in some other studies, high variability in
removal efficiencies were seen, with E. coli LRVs in silver-treated filters ranging between 3.82 and
7.65 compared to 2.01 and 4.3 in untreated filters.

Brown & Sobsey (2010) found no significant difference in the removal of E. coli – CN13 (challenge
dose 104–107 cfu/mL) or MS2 (challenge dose 105–108 pfu/mL) between silver-treated (silver nitrate)
and untreated filters. E. coli LRVs were between 2.2 and 2.3 in the silver-treated filters, compared to
2.1 in the untreated filters. MS2 removal was between 1.3–1.5 log10 in the silver-treated filters,
compared to 1.6 to 1.7 log10 in the untreated filters.

Kallman et al. (2011) looked at E. coli (wild strain) removal and compared untreated and silver
nanoparticle-treated filters made with different percentages of sawdust. Although the authors comment
that silver improves the LRVs for the filters (Table 5), probably the only significant improvement is
that seen for the 17% sawdust filter.

Zhang & Oyanedel-Craver (2013) compared E. coli (wild strain) log10 reduction values (challenge dose
1010–1011 cfu/mL) in ceramic disks with or without silver nanoparticle treatment. Silver treatment did
not noticeably improve the performance of the disks (4.2–4.3 log10 reduction by the untreated disks
compared to 4.4 log10 reduction by the treated disk).

Rayner et al. (2013) investigated the impact of the type of silver (ionic or silver nanoparticles) on
bacterial removal efficacy using ceramic disks. Using different silver concentrations (0.003, 0.03 and
0.3 mg of silver/g of disk), bacterial removal performance was assessed using 106 cfu/mL E. coli
continuously fed to the disks at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/minute. Samples were taken daily for 10 days,
with the concentration of bacteria measured in both the influent and effluent. In addition, viable bacterial
retention on and within the disks was also examined. A sharp decrease in LRVs was seen from day 1 to
day 4, with a levelling off seen thereafter, so the LRVs are based on samples taken from days 5 to 10.
The results varied according to the source of the clay used for the disks. For the Indonesian and
Tanzanian clays, 0.3 mg/g silver nanoparticles was found to be the most effective, with > 4 log10
reduction seen on day 10 (1 to 1.7 log10 reduction improvement over the control disks without silver).
Disks coated with other concentrations of silver either produced no improvement or a less than 1 log10
reduction improvement over the control. Silver desorption was greater for the disks coated with silver
nitrate compared to silver nanoparticles. Effluent silver concentration, bacterial removal and viable
bacteria retention were dose-dependent on the amount of silver applied. The authors recommend that,
based on the results, ceramic filter factories should use silver nanoparticles rather than silver nitrate, to
improve silver-filter retention and that silver nanoparticle application should be increased to 0.3 mg/g
to maximise microbiological performance without compromising the effluent quality.

Although Ren & Smith (2013) did not measure microbial reduction, they compared the retention of
silver nanoparticles in a ceramic porous medium following different application methods (paint-on,
dipping and fire-in methods). The fire-in method appeared to significantly improve silver nanoparticle
retention and even where the amount of silver applied to the disk was increased by a factor of 10 (27.3
mg silver per disk), the effluent silver concentrations did not exceed 0.02 mg/L.

Bielefeldt et al. (2013) looked at the impact of various water quality parameters on the detachment of
silver nanoparticles from a solid silica surface (representative of ceramic pot filters). Over typical ranges
of pH, ionic strength, turbidity and dissolved organic matter, minimal impact was seen on the rate of
release and dissolution of silver nanoparticles. Free chlorine (added as sodium hypochlorite), however,
rapidly removed silver (whether applied as ionic silver or silver nanoparticles) even at drinking-water
levels, leading to the suggestion that contact between ceramic pot filters and pre-chlorinated water and
cleaning with bleach should be avoided. Mittelmann et al. (2015) also examined the impact of different
water chemistries on silver dissolution and release from ceramic water filters (coated with casein-coated
silver nanoparticles or silver nitrate) and concluded that saline, hard or acidic waters should be avoided
to minimize eluent silver concentrations and preserve silver treatment integrity.

Van der Laan et al. (2014) looked at the role of silver (silver nitrate) during both filtration and storage,
comparing different silver applications (non-silver-treated, silver-treated either on the outside or on both
sides of the filter) in long-term loading experiments using E. coli (K12 and WR1 strains) and MS2
bacteriophage. Comparison of samples taken within 5 minutes of filtration and after 11 hours of storage
showed that, for silver nitrate coated filters, there is very little inactivation during the filtration phase,
with no significant difference found immediately after filtration between the filters, with or without
silver treatment (median LRVs between ~ 0.7 and 1.1 for E. coli and an average of 0.6 for MS2). Storage
time, post filtration, was found to be the dominant parameter in E. coli inactivation (no post-storage
data presented for MS2); after 11 hours of storage the median LRVwas approximately 4 in the silver
treated filters.

Simonis et al. (2014) tested silver-treated ceramic filters (with silver applied either by sputter coating
or through dipping [silver impregnation] and drying in different atmospheres to coat the filters with
ionic silver or silver oxide) against F-specific and somatic phages. Initial spiking levels were 2.5 x 105
pfu/mL for F-specific phage and 2.1 x 103 pfu/mL for the somatic phage. The LRVs varied according
to both the coating method and the phage type. For the F-specific phage, LRVs were between < 0.1 and
0.56. Greater inactivation was seen for the somatic phage (LRVs between 1.2 and 1.84). In both cases
the sputter coated filter was the most effective.

Matthies et al. (2015) looked at bacterial and bacteriophage removal using silver-coated (silver nitrate)
Indonesian filters. Bacterial LRVs from spiked samples were between 3.4 and 5 (E. coli 5.1–5.2 log10
reduction; Enterococcus faecium 3.4–> 4.5 log10 reduction; P. aeruginosa 3.4–5.0 log10 reduction).
Log10 reduction values for bacteriophages MS2 and øX174 were considerably lower and, typically,
were between 0.5 and 0.6.

Although some studies have suggested that silver treatment improves the E. coli removal performance
of filters, others have shown only small benefits, short-term improvements or negligible impact (beyond
the filtration effect) as a result of silver, with no clear pattern of removal in relation to the type of silver
used (i.e. ionic or nanoparticles) – see the summary of LRVs in Table 6.

Work directly comparing filters using ionic silver versus silver nanoparticles, however, suggest that
silver nanoparticles may be as effective at bacterial reduction but shows better retention within the filter
(Rayner et al., 2013). The silver concentration used to treat the filter is likely to be important reducing
bacterial numbers. Rayner et al., (2013) suggest that this can be increased to 0.3 mg/g silver
nanoparticles without high silver leaching. The use of differing concentrations and application methods
may go some way to explaining the contradictory results. Studies which looked at the impact on
bacteriophage concentrations, typically found that silver treatment has a limited effect, with LRVs often
below 1.

2.4 World Health Organization International Scheme to Evaluate Household
Water Treatment Technologies: Performance evaluations of silver
Assessment of the microbial effectiveness of silver as a household-level water treatment option should,
as far as possible, model actual use conditions in the field, for example, water of varying quality,
realistic contact times and testing of all three classes of pathogens which cause diarrhoeal disease. In
order to comprehensively assess effectiveness, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set health-
based performance targets for household water treatment products based on the removal of bacteria,
viruses and protozoa (WHO, 2011). These targets are based on microbial risk models using assumed
levels of reference pathogens in untreated water. Since 2014, WHO has been testing products against
those targets through the WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment
Technologies.27 Box 1 gives further information on the Scheme and its three tiers of log10 performance
targets for bacteria, viruses and protozoans. Two silver products were evaluated in the first round of
testing (WHO, 2016); a silver coated ceramic filter and a liquid colloidal silver suspension designed to
be added in the form of drops to drinking-water to be treated. Testing of the filter had to be discontinued
because of unacceptably low filtration rates and the colloidal silver product demonstrated no reduction
against viruses and only a mean LRV of 2 against bacteria (the efficacy against protozoa was not
evaluated). Therefore, the two products containing silver failed to meet the WHO performance criteria.

Box 1. WHO International Scheme to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies

The objective of the Scheme is to independently and consistently evaluate the microbiological
performance of household and POU water treatment technologies. The evaluation considers both
turbid and non-turbid water, and is carried out to manufacturers’ instructions for daily household
use.4 The results of the evaluation are intended to assist and inform Member States and procuring
UN agencies in the selection of these technologies.

The performance targets define treatment requirements in relation to source water quality for each
pathogen class as detailed below.

        ‒                   Fails to meet WHO performance criteria                Little or no protection



The performance of HWT products is classified as 3-star (); 2-star (); and 1-star (),
denoting descending order of performance, based on log10 reductions of bacteria, viruses and
protozoa from drinking-water. Performance that does not meet the minimum target is given no stars.
Products that meet 3-star () or 2-star () performance targets are classified as providing
“Comprehensive protection” against the three main classes of pathogens which cause diarrhoeal
disease in humans. The use of these products is encouraged where there is no information on the
specific pathogens in drinking-water (and a prudent approach is to protect against all three classes),
or where piped supplies exist but are not safely managed. Products that meet the performance targets
for at least 2-star () for only two of the three classes of pathogen are given one star () and are
classified as providing “Targeted protection”. In general, the use of these products may be
appropriate in situations where the burden of diarrhoeal disease is high due to known classes of
pathogens, such as a cholera outbreak.

3. Safety and toxicity of silver
This section outlines the potential for human exposure to silver and silver nanoparticles through all
routes (i.e. it is not confined to ingestion) and outlines opinions from various expert bodies on intake.
In addition, an assessment of recent (up to autumn 2015) toxicological literature was undertaken and
relevant findings are included here. It should be noted that as the study of silver nanoparticles toxicity
is relatively new, it is likely that methods of assessment will continue to develop as different challenges
posed by nanoparticles are identified (Doak et al., 2012).

3.1 Human exposure
Silver is not considered an essential metal and therefore any exposure is unwanted (Lansdown, 2010).
Since ancient times, silver has been used in a variety of products such as jewellery, utensils and coins.
More recently, however, largely due to its antimicrobial properties, its uses (and hence potential for
human exposure) have expanded rapidly and it can now be found in food packaging materials, babys'
bottles and pacifiers, cleaning products, food supplements, cosmetics, medical devices and products,
electronics, odour-resistant textiles (e.g. socks and shirts) and household appliances, such as washing
machines and refrigerators (Wijnhoven et al., 2009). Dietary intake of silver is estimated to be in the
range of 7–90 µg/day (Winjhoven et al., 2009; Lansdown, 2010), although this does not take into
account some of the more recent forms of exposure, or non-dietary ingestion of silver (e.g. Tulve et al.,
2015). Inhalation of silver dust and fumes may occur in some occupational settings and skin contact
can occur in occupational settings, from contact with jewellery and application of topical creams for
burns (Wijnhoven et al., 2009).

3.2 Guideline values
3.2.1. WHO drinking-water quality guidelines
There is currently no health-based guideline value for silver in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water
Quality (WHO, 2017). Silver was last reviewed by WHO in 1993 (WHO, 1993), when it was concluded
that, on the basis of epidemiological and pharmacokinetic knowledge at the time, a total lifetime oral
intake of about 10 g of silver could be considered as the human no-observable-adverse-effect level
(NOAEL). It was felt that the contribution of drinking-water to this NOAEL would normally be
negligible and so it was not deemed necessary to establish a health-based guideline value. However, it
was suggested that, where silver salts are used for drinking-water treatment, a concentration of 0.1 mg/L
could be tolerated without risk to health (a concentration that would give a total dose over a 70-year
period of half of the NOAEL outlined above). The 0.1 mg/L level is thus a health advisory rather than
a guideline value, a distinction that is rarely appreciated by researchers (e.g. Pelkonen et al., 2003) who
often refer to 0.1 mg/L as a guideline or allowable amount.

3.2.2 Other values
In Germany, the drinking-water regulations (Trinkwasserverordnung) set an allowable maximum for
silver of 0.08 mg/L.

In the 2012 edition of the USEPA drinking-water standards and health advisories document (USEPA,
2012) silver has the following health advisory28 values:


28A USEPA health advisory is defined as an estimate of acceptable drinking-water levels for a chemical substance based on
health effects information; it is not a legally enforceable Federal standard, but serves as technical guidance.

3.3 Human toxicity data
3.3.1 Toxicokinetics

3.3.1.1 Absorption
Absorption following oral administration in humans has been described qualitatively in several case
studies (Chang et al., 2006; Mirsattari et al., 2004; Ohbo et al., 1996). The occurrence of generalized
argyria29 in a woman who repeatedly applied silver nitrate solution to her gums has been reported as
evidence to show that absorption of silver can occur across oral mucosa (Marshall & Schneider 1977).

Quantitative data has been reported by East et al. (1980) who estimated an absorption of 18% of the
administered dose in a 47-year-old woman who already suffered from argyria. Transit time in the
gastrointestinal tract has been shown to affect absorption, with a faster transit time leading to lower
absorption (Furchner et al. 1968).

Evidence of the absorption of silver in humans following inhalation exposure is limited to occupational
studies. Inhalation of silver nitrate and silver oxide in the range 0.039 to 0.378 mg silver/m3 was
associated with detectable blood silver levels in workers (Rosenman et al., 1979). Di Vincenzo et al.
(1985) reported detectable silver levels in the blood and faeces of workers exposed to time weighted
average levels of 0.001 to 0.1 mg/m3 insoluble silver in a photographic materials manufacturing facility.

Several silver compounds appear to be absorbed through the intact skin of humans, although the degree
of absorption is thought to be low.

3.3.1.2 Distribution
Silver and silver nanoparticles have been reported to be distributed to a wide range of organs in the
human body following oral administration, however some organs are suggested to be more prone to
silver deposition than others (Hadrup & Lam, 2014). Human data relating to silver ingestion is largely
limited to a number of case reports where people have ingested varying amounts of colloidal silver,
generally over a protracted period (Chung et al., 2010). The most common presenting feature is argyria29
(Brandt et al., 2005; Wadhera & Fung, 2005). Silver has also been found to cross the placental barrier
in humans. Lyon et al. (2002) looked at liver samples, collected at autopsy, and found significant levels
of silver (median 15.5 ng/g wet weight) in livers of children under 6 years old. It was speculated that
silver is accumulated from the mother (probably from maternal mercury amalgam fillings) during
pregnancy and lactation.

Very limited information was identified concerning the distribution of silver in humans following
inhalation of elemental silver or silver nanoparticles. Newton & Holmes (1966) estimated that 25% of


29Argyria is where tissues become impregnated with silver sulfide, which forms a complex in elastic fibres; large amounts of
this complex under the skin give it a bluish, grey-blue or (in extreme cases) a black colour. Generalized argyria results from
increased serum silver levels and silver granules can be detected in all body tissues, with the highest concentrations found in
the skin, liver, spleen and adrenal glands (Brandt et al., 2005).

                                                             122
                                                          Part III - Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


a dose of radioactive silver (dose unknown) was distributed to the liver between 2 and 6 days after
exposure.

Following the topical application of silver nitrate for the treatment of burns in two humans, silver was
distributed to the muscles (0.03–2.3 ppm), liver (0.44 ppm), spleen (0.23 ppm), kidney (0.14 ppm),
heart (0.032–0.04 ppm), and bones (0.025 ppm) (Bader 1966).

3.3.1.3 Metabolism
Metallic silver is inert and absorption through any route is determined by ionization (under oxidizing
conditions) to release the biologically active ionic silver. Ionic silver subsequently binds to sulfydryl
groups and other anionic ligands of proteins, cell membranes, and tissue debris (Hadrup & Lam, 2014).
Controversies exist on the predominant routes of silver metabolism in the human body (Wan et al.,
1991; East et al., 1980).

3.3.1.4 Excretion
Following absorption via any route, ionic silver can be excreted in bile, urine, hair and nail, with the
biliary route predominating over the urinary route. However, urinary silver measurement provides a
convenient index of silver absorption by all routes. At higher concentrations, patterns of urinary
excretion are irregular (Lansdown, 2010).

Following oral exposure to silver acetate (AgAc) in humans, silver is eliminated primarily in the faeces,
with only minor amounts eliminated in the urine. The rate of excretion is most rapid within the first
week, after a single oral exposure (East et al., 1980).

Accidental inhalation of silver isotope (110m) resulted in rapid removal from the lungs (primarily by
ciliary action), with subsequent ingestion and ultimate elimination in the faeces, with biological half-
lives of 1 and 52 days (Newton & Holmes 1966).

No studies were identified concerning the excretion of silver or silver nanoparticles by humans
following dermal exposure. Once absorption through the skin and distribution to bodily tissues occurs,
it can be expected that elimination would be similar to that of silver ions absorbed via oral or inhalation
exposure, that is, primarily via the faeces, with minimal amounts excreted in the urine.

3.3.2 Acute toxicity
No information concerning toxicity in humans following acute exposure to silver or silver nanoparticles
through oral or dermal routes could be identified. Acute exposure through inhalation during work with
molten silver has been linked to acute respiratory failure in one worker. However, quantitative
measurements of exposure and history of pre-exposure are unavailable (ATSDR, 1990).

3.3.3 Repeat dose toxicity

3.3.3.1 Systemic effects
Munger et al. (2013) conducted a study looking at human exposure (60 healthy subjects) to commercial
nanoscale silver colloid in a single dose, blinded, cross-over, intent-to-treat design. Two commercial
silver nanoparticle (colloid) solutions were used, one with particle sizes between 5–10 nm (10 ppm
solution) and one with particles of sizes between 25–40 nm (32 ppm solution). With the 10 ppm
solution, subjects were dosed for 3, 7 or 14 days (150 µg/day – equivalent to 2.1 µg/kg body weight
[bw] – assuming 70 kg adult), while for the 32 ppm solution all subjects were dosed for 14 days (480

                                                   123

µg/day – equivalent to 6.8 µg/kg bw). No clinically important changes in human metabolic,
haematologic and urinalysis were noted. Physical findings and imaging morphology of organs was also
unchanged.

Occupational inhalation exposure to silver nitrate and/or silver oxide at estimated exposure levels of
between 0.039 and 0.378 mg silver/m3 for less than 1 to greater than 10 years, has been linked to upper
and lower respiratory tract irritation. The same exposure levels can also cause gastric discomfort in
humans. Occupational exposure to silver compounds has not been observed to affect blood counts or
the cardiovascular system (ATSDR, 1990).

No studies could be identified to assess the potential systemic toxicity of silver or silver nanoparticles
in humans following dermal exposure.

3.3.3.2 Neurotoxicity
No studies could be identified to assess the potential neurotoxicity of silver or silver nanoparticles in
humans by any route of exposure.

3.3.3.3 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
No studies could be identified to assess the potential reproductive and developmental toxicity of silver
or silver nanoparticles in humans by any route of exposure.

3.3.3.4 Immunotoxicity
No studies could be identified to assess the potential immunotoxicity of silver or silver nanoparticles in
humans by any route of exposure.

3.3.3.5 Genotoxicity (in vivo)
A single cross-sectional study in Turkey (Aktepe et al., 2015) has examined DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) damage in peripheral mononuclear leucocytes (measured using the comet assay) in 35 silver
jewellery workers (mean age 31.7 ± 8.4 years) exposed to silver particles or silver nanoparticles and 41
non-exposed healthy subjects (mean age 29.42 ± 7.4 years). The exposed group were reported to work
for at least 4 hours a day, however, no further information is given by the authors on exposure
conditions. A statistically significant increase in DNA damage, measured as endogenous mononuclear
leukocyte DNA strand breaks, was reported in the silver workers (mean 15.4 versus 7.48 [arbitrary
units] in the control group). Workers were also significantly more likely to have an increased oxidative
stress index, increased ceruloplasmin levels and decreased total thiol measurements. As an acute phase
reactant, ceruloplasmin concentration increases during periods of inflammation, infection and trauma.
In addition, thiols play an important role in mediating oxidative stress, and reduced levels in the workers
was shown to correlate with an increased oxidative stress index. The authors conclude that exposure of
workers to silver particles increases oxidative stress, leading to inflammation and decreased levels of
thiols; the subsequent DNA damage results from both the direct interaction of silver and the
overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The findings of this study, however, should be
interpreted with care as there are a number of study limitations, particularly in terms of the small number
of participants, and the lack of direct measurements or estimate of exposure for either the workers or
the control population.

3.3.3.6 Carcinogenicity
No studies could be identified regarding the possible carcinogenic activity of silver or silver
nanoparticles in humans. The USEPA has determined that silver is not classifiable as to human
carcinogenicity.

3.4 Animal toxicity studies
3.4.1 Toxicokinetics

3.4.1.1 Absorption
Quantitative absorption data are available for silver from a limited number of oral studies using
radiolabelled 110Ag (as silver nitrate or silver acetate) in monkeys, dogs, rats and mice (Furchner et al.,
1968). Absorption has been estimated to be around 6% in monkeys, 10% in dogs, 2% in rats and < 0.5%
in mice. As for humans, absorption is also linked to transit time in these species (Furchner et al., 1968).

A study in dogs exposed by inhalation to metallic silver particles (median aerodynamic diameter of
approximately 0.5 µm) estimated absorption to be 3.1% (0.8 µg) (Phalen & Morrow 1973).

Absorption of silver nitrate across intact skin has been demonstrated in guinea pigs and is similar to that
of intact human skin, with approximately 1% of the applied dose being absorbed within 5 hours
(Wahlberg 1965).

3.4.1.2 Distribution
It is clear that silver (largely irrespective of the route of exposure or form) can distribute widely within
the body and has been shown to cross the placenta, and potentially the blood-brain barrier in
experimental animals. In addition to skin, silver has been detected in liver, kidneys, brain, spleen, eyes,
muscles, blood, small intestine, stomach, lungs, bladder, prostate, tongue, teeth, salivary glands,
thyroid, parathyroid, heart, pancreas and duodenum (Hadrup & Lam, 2014).

Particular targets for silver deposition are the small and large intestines, stomach, liver and kidneys
(Loeschner et al., 2011). Of particular note is deposition of silver within the glomerular basement
membrane in kidneys, and potentially within glial cells and neurons in some brain regions including the
hippocampus and pons (Hadrup & Lam, 2014). Other lines of evidence suggest that silver is deposited
within the lining of the blood-brain barrier and does not cross over (Hadrup & Lam, 2014).

Ionic silver and silver nanoparticles administered through the oral route are distributed in a similar way.
Van der Zande et al. (2012) compared an oral dose of 9 mg of ionic silver per kg bw per day
(administered as silver nitrate) with an oral dose of 90 mg of nanoparticulate silver per kg bw per day
for 28 days (the nanoparticle sizes were 15 and 20 nm). The authors reported the majority of the silver
in the stomach and small and large intestines, followed by (in descending order) the liver, spleen, testes,
kidneys, brain, lungs, blood, bladder and heart. In the same study, less deposition was observed
following silver nanoparticle administration than following ionic silver administration. However, the
differences were pronounced for all organs.

Silver nanoparticle inhalation (in various doses and exposure periods) studies in rats have shown that
silver is distributed to the lungs, liver, kidney, brain, heart, nasal cavity, olfactory bulb, eyes, spleen,
ovaries, testes and blood (Ji et al., 2007; Song et al., 2013; Sung et al., 2009; Takenaka et al., 2001). In
mice (in a single study) only the lungs were found to exhibit elevated silver concentrations after

                                                    125
                                                          Part III - Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


exposure (Stebounova et al., 2011). In addition, a study of intra-nasal administration of silver
nanoparticles in natal rats reported concentrations of almost 20 µg total silver/g in the cerebellum (the
only tissue investigated) following administration of 1 mg silver nanoparticles (20–30 nm) per kg bw
for 21 consecutive days (Yin et al., 2013). Silver was also found to be widely distributed following
intravenous administration (Lankveld et al., 2010; Dziendzikowska et al., 2012).

3.4.1.3 Metabolism
Silver deposition in cells is caused by precipitation of insoluble silver salts, such as silver chloride and
silver phosphate which are transformed to soluble silver sulfide albuminates (Berry & Galle 1982). The
sulfides can bind to or complex with amino or carboxyl groups in ribonucleic acid, DNA, and proteins,
or can be reduced to metallic silver by ascorbic acid or catecholamines (Danscher 1981).

3.4.1.4 Excretion
Faecal and urinary levels of silver, post-exposure, were measured in two ingestion studies. Loeschner
et al. (2011) found very low levels in the urine (< 0.1%) and reported slightly different levels in the
faeces, depending upon the nature of the original challenge, with higher faecal levels from silver
nanoparticles compared to silver acetate (63% and 49% of the daily dose, respectively). The faecal
excretion levels reported by Loeschner et al. (2011) are notably lower than those reported by van der
Zande et al. (2012), who reported that over 99% of the daily dose was excreted in faeces. Based on the
higher faecal excretion and lower absolute levels seen in organs in animals orally exposed to ionic silver
or silver nanoparticles, it would seem that silver nanoparticles are less bioavailable than ionic silver
(Loeschner et al., 2011; van der Zande et al., 2012; Hadrup & Lam, 2014).

Van der Zande et al. (2012) reported a generally rapid reduction in tissue silver concentrations following
28 days of ingestion. In most tissues, silver concentrations were already significantly reduced (to below
50% of the immediate post-exposure levels) just one week following cessation of exposure and
approached a return to control levels in most samples within 12 weeks. There were, however, four
exceptions, namely brain, testis, kidney and spleen, where silver concentrations were still elevated after
12 weeks, with the brain retaining over 90% of the original post-exposure levels. Lee et al. (2013)
looked at clearance of tissue-accumulated silver from rats administered 10 or 25 nm citrate-stabilized
silver nanoparticles administered (by gavage) either 100 or 500 mg/kg per day for 28 days, followed by
up to 4 months recovery. While the clearance half-times differed according to dose and gender; liver,
spleen and kidney elimination showed similar clearance trends. Silver concentrations in the testes and
brain (i.e. tissues with a biological barrier), however, did not decrease to control levels, even after a 4-
month recovery period.

Following inhalation of metallic silver particles (average aerodynamic diameter of 0.5µm) in dogs, the
predominant route of clearance was reported as dissolution of the silver and transport through the blood
to the liver. A proportion of silver particles were also cleared by the mucociliary escalator and
swallowed. Approximately 90% of the inhaled dose was excreted in the faeces within 30 days of
exposure (Phalen & Morrow 1973).

No studies could be identified assessing the excretion of silver or silver nanoparticles by animals
following dermal exposure. However, once absorption through the skin and distribution to bodily
tissues occurs, it can be expected that elimination would be similar to that via oral or inhalation
exposure, that is, primarily via the faeces, with minimal amounts excreted in the urine.

3.4.2 Acute toxicity
A number of studies have reported no adverse acute effects as a result of silver or silver nanoparticle
ingestion.

Tamimi et al. (1998) investigated the acute toxicity of an anti-smoking mouthwash containing silver
nitrate as the active ingredient. The oral median lethal dose (LD50)30 in rats was found to be 280 mg of
silver per kg bw and in rabbits, 800 mg of silver per kg bw.

Orally administered nanoparticulate silver was not toxic to mice or guinea pigs at acute doses of up to
5000 mg/kg bw (Maneewattanapinyo et al., 2011). The authors found no mortality or signs of toxicity
throughout a 14-day post treatment observation period. In addition, there was no difference in the
percentage of body weight gain between the treatment and control groups or a significant difference in
haematological parameters.

Following a large single dose (2.5 g) of silver nanoparticles (13 nm) or silver microparticles (2–3.5 µm)
administered by gavage, Cha et al. (2008) reported focal lymphocyte infiltration in the mouse liver
portal tracts, suggesting the induction of inflammation. They also reported nonspecific focal
haemorrhages in the heart, focal lymphocyte infiltration in the intestine and nonspecific medullary
congestion in the spleen in the mice exposed to silver nanoparticles.

Korani et al. (2011) conducted an acute dermal toxicity study in guinea pigs, exposed to either 1000 or
10 000 µg silver nanoparticles/mL, with observations following exposure for 14 days. A dose-
dependent reduction in thickness in the epidermis and papillary layers of skin was observed.

3.4.3 Repeat dose toxicity

3.4.3.1 Systemic effects
In a drinking water study, Sprague-Dawley rats were administered silver nitrate at doses of 6, 12 and
24 mM for 60 weeks. Death occurred in 3 of 12 rats at the highest dose within 2 weeks and this group
was discontinued; the group receiving 6 mM silver nitrate was also discontinued after 12 weeks,
although the reasons for this are not clearly stated by the author. A decreased body weight gain was
observed in the remaining group and a NOAEL of 181.2 mg/kg bw per day has been reported by the
ATSDR (1990) for this study. In a further study, albino rats were administered silver (as silver nitrate)
as a 0.25% solution (in drinking water; equivalent to a dose of 222.2 mg/kg bw per day) for up to 8.5
months. Deaths were recorded between 23 and 37 weeks, which the authors propose may have been
related to decreased weight gain during the same period. A lowest-observed-adverse-effect level
(LOAEL) of 222.2 mg/kg bw per day has been reported by the ATSDR (1990) for this study.

Patlolla et al. (2015) conducted an oral study in which rats were administered silver nanoparticles at
doses between 5–100 mg/kg bw per day in deionized water for 5 days. A dose-related increase in ROS
concentration was seen, with the two highest doses being statistically significant when compared with
controls. Statistically significant increases in activity (at the two highest doses) were also seen for
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Lipid hydroperoxide (a
marker of cellular injury and death) in serum also increased in a dose-dependent manner when compared
to the control group. Histopathological damage was seen to the liver at doses of 25 mg/kg bw per day
and above.

Kulthong et al. (2012) administered silver nanoparticles to rats at concentrations between 0 and 100
mg/kg bw per day for two weeks. No differences were seen in body weight or liver weight between
groups and no effect was seen on plasma levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase nor in hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. It should be
noted, however, that while the silver nanoparticles were purchased as being < 100 nm in diameter,
analysis by the authors showed an average size of 181 nm. Similarly, Kim JS et al. (2013) found no
difference in body weight gross findings at necropsy or mortality in rats treated with up to 2000 mg/kg
bw per day of citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (10 nm), and Van der Zande et al. (2012) reported that
there was no hepatotoxicity or immunotoxicity in a 28-day feeding study in rats exposed to silver
nanoparticles (< 20 nm non-coated; < 15 nm PVP-coated) at 90 mg/kg bw per day or silver nitrate at 9
mg/kg bw per day.

Conversely, Kim et al. (2008) reported significant dose-dependent changes in alkaline phosphatase and
cholesterol values in male and female rats in a 28-day feeding study with silver nanoparticles
administered at doses of 30, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw per day (60 nm, suspended in carboxymethyl-
cellulose). This led the authors to suggest that exposure to levels of silver nanoparticles greater than
300 mg/kg may result in slight liver damage. Hadrup et al. (2012a) examined the oral sub-acute toxicity
of 14 nm silver nanoparticles (stabilised with PVP) and silver acetate in rats. Doses of 2.25, 4.5 or 9
mg/kg bw per day of silver nanoparticles or 9 mg/kg bw per day of silver acetate were given daily, by
gavage, for 28 days. The authors found no toxicological effects following silver nanoparticle
administration. Following silver acetate administration, however, they found lower body weight gain,
increased plasma alkaline phosphatase, decreased plasma urea and lower absolute and relative thymus
weight. The authors also conducted a metabolomics investigation of the rat urine obtained on day 18 of
the study. The analysis revealed differences in the urine composition of female (but not male) rats when
compared to the control group. Differences were found in the levels of uric acid and its degradation
product, allantoin. Silver nanoparticle ingestion led to an increase in both metabolites, while silver
acetate only increased allantoin levels. As both silver nanoparticles and silver acetate altered urine
composition this suggests that female rat physiology was affected by silver ingestion (Hadrup et al.,
2012b).

Jeong et al. (2010) and Shahare et al. (2013) reported adverse effects of silver nanoparticles on the
intestinal mucosa following consumption. In rats administered with silver nanoparticles up to 1000
mg/kg bw per day (60 nm in carboxymethylcellulose) by oral gavage for 28 days, a dose-dependent
increase in silver nanoparticles in the lamina propria (connective tissue under the epithelia) in both the
small and large intestine and also in the tip of the upper villi in the ileum and protruding surface of the
fold in the colon were found (Jeong et al., 2010). In addition, silver nanoparticle-treated rats showed
higher numbers of goblet cells that had released their mucus granules resulting in more mucus materials
in the crypt lumen and ileal lumen; they also showed an abnormal mucus composition in the intestinal
goblet cells.

In mice administered silver nanoparticles (3–20 nm) up to 20 mg/kg bw per day by oral gavage for 21
days, a significant decrease in body weight was seen in all treatment groups compared to the control on
days 14 and 21 (despite no difference in food consumption between the groups). The maximum weight
loss was observed in the 10 mg/kg bw per day group. In this treatment group (results are not given for
the others) there was damage to the microvilli in the small intestine. The authors suggest that silver
nanoparticles interact with the protective layer of the glycocalyx and other structural elements of the
microvilli of the intestinal absorptive cells causing structural changes, which results in the alteration of
membrane permeability and the destruction of the microvilli. In addition, it was also suggested that the

epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract are destroyed leading to the observed decrease in body
weight, although they do not comment as to why the effects are more pronounced in the 10 mg/kg group
compared to the 20 mg/kg group (Shahare et al., 2013).

In a 28-day silver biodistribution study, rats were administered two sizes (10 and 25 nm) of citrate-
stabilized silver nanoparticles by oral gavage at doses of 100 or 500 mg/kg bw per day (Section 3.4.1.4).
The authors reported evidence of liver toxicity, based on an increase in cholesterol in male rats at both
doses for the 10 nm partices and at the lowest dose for the 25 nm particles. In females, an increase in
alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase was reported for both doses of the 10 nm particles
and at the highest dose of the 25 nm particles. One case of bile duct hyperplasia was observed among
the male rats treated with the 10 nm silver nanoparticles, with a non-significant increase in inflammatory
cell infiltration (Lee et al., 2013).

Sardari et al. (2012) reported adverse effects on liver, spleen and kidney in rats fed 1 and 2 mg of silver
nanoparticles (70 nm) per kg bw per day by gavage for 30 days. Within the spleen, red pulp was
decreased in rats treated with high doses of silver nanoparticles, while the number of lymphocytes
(white pulp) was increased. The authors reported pathological changes to the kidney including necrosis
of glomerular cells, bowman capsule, and proximal tubules. Inflammation of the parenchymal cells was
seen in the liver and intracellular space enlargement was observed in the hepatic lobules, in addition
apoptosis (programmed cell death) was reported around the central vein.

A study exposing rats to two sizes of silver nanoparticles (14 and 36 nm) in water by oral administration
(ad libitum–535 µg/mL) over 55 days was conducted by Espinosa-Cristobal et al. (2013). Daily
ingestion was found to average 157 mg/kg bw per day and no changes were seen in in individual
behaviour, body weight, sociability and food consumption between the test groups and the control. The
clinical chemistry and haematology conducted only showed a significant difference (at 55 days) in
blood urea nitrogen concentration for the smaller silver nanoparticles (14 nm) tested, leading the group
to suggest that the smaller silver nanoparticles altered the normal glomerular filtration from the kidneys.
A number of other parameters were found to be different from the control group but only after 25 days
of exposure and were within normal values at the end of the study.

Ebabe Elle et al. (2013) suggested that silver nanoparticles led to liver damage by altering the regulation
of lipid metabolism. Rats fed 500 mg/kg bw per day of silver nanoparticles (20 nm) by gavage for 81
days were found to have significantly elevated cholesterolemia and LDL-cholesterol and lowered
triglycerides. They also found increased liver and cardiac superoxide anion production and raised liver
inflammatory cytokines.

In a sub-chronic oral study in rats (Kim et al., 2010) using 30, 125 and 500 mg/kg doses of silver
nanoparticles (60 nm) over a 90-day exposure period, the group found that there were significant
differences in the body weights of the males exposed to the mid and high dose of silver nanoparticles
compared to the control animals. As in the short-term study (Kim et al., 2008), the group also found
significant dose-dependent changes in alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol for male and female rats.
In addition, histopathologic examination revealed a higher incidence of bile duct hyperplasia
(enlargement).

Yun et al. (2014) administered citrate stabilized silver nanoparticles (< 20 nm) to rats by gavage daily
over a 13-week period (highest dose of 1030.5 mg/kg bw per day). They reported increases in serum
alkaline phosphatase and calcium as well as lymphocyte infiltration in the liver and kidney, suggesting
liver and kidney toxicity.

Thakur et al. (2014) investigated the impact of 5–20 nm spherical silver nanoparticles (20 µg/kg bw per
day) administered by repeated gavage (90 days) on male rats. No overt signs of toxicity recorded as
deaths, changes in body weight or behavioural changes were seen.

In a 14-day feeding study, 20 nm silver nanoparticles (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg bw per day) were administered
to mice by oral gavage and the effects on erythrocytes and tissues examined (Shrivastava et al., 2014).
The group found a significant decrease in body weight in both test groups compared to the control
(despite the relatively low doses given) and also found a number of statistically significant differences
in various blood and urinary biochemical variables indicative of oxidative stress, including elevated
ROS, blood gluathione (high dose only), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and urinary
8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (a biomarker of DNA damage). The levels of ROS increased
significantly in all of the tissues examined (brain, liver, kidney and spleen) at the higher concentration
and in all except brain at the lower concentration. Hepatic and renal toxicity was evident from liver and
kidney function tests.

In a 28-day feeding study in mice, Park et al. (2010a) found that silver nanoparticles (42 nm) at the
highest dose given (1 mg/kg per day) resulted in some changes in serum biochemistry, with increased
levels of alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase in both male and female mice. Levels of
alanine transaminase were also increased following high dose administration, but only in female mice.
They also found that pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Minor
histopathological changes were seen in the kidney (slight cell infiltration in the cortex), but not in the
liver or small intestine following high dose administration.

A number of inhalation studies have been performed with silver nanoparticles (typically 12–18 nm in
size) in rats and mice via whole body inhalation chambers. The degree of toxicity observed is considered
to be dependent on the duration of exposure. With short-term exposure (up to 28 days) no significant
adverse effects have been reported (Ji et al., 2007; Hyun et al., 2008; Sung et al., 2011; Stebounova et
al., 2011). In contrast, some longer-term exposure studies (≥ 90 days) suggest a dose-dependent toxicity
of silver nanoparticles to lungs and liver in rats exposed via whole body inhalation to silver
nanoparticles (18–19 nm) at low (49 µg/m3), medium (133 µg/m3) or high (515 µg/m3) doses for six
hours a day, five days a week for 13 weeks (Sung et al., 2008, 2009). Although a small degree of
recovery of lung function following a 12-week rest period was apparent, an exposure-related lung
function decrease in males (exposed to the highest silver nanoparticle dose) persisted during the
recovery period (Song et al., 2013).

There are relatively few in vivo animal studies that assess the potential dermal toxicity of silver
application (Samberg et al., 2010; Korani et al., 2011; Maneewattanapinyo et al., 2011; Kim JS et al.,
2013). In the main, reported studies have evaluated the use of silver-impregnated wound dressings. Kim
JS et al. (2013) conducted dermal toxicity/irritation tests using citrate-coated 10 nm silver nanoparticles.
Rats were exposed for 24 hours to up to 2000 mg/kg bw per day and then observed for 15 days; no
toxicity was observed. Similarly, no skin reaction was seen in three rabbits subjected to the same form
of silver nanoparticles. In a skin sensitization test using 20 guinea pigs, a single animal showed some
erythema, suggesting that the tested silver nanoparticles could be classified as a weak skin sensitizer.
In pigs dosed topically with a solution of silver nanoparticles (0.34–34 µg/mL) for 14 consecutive days,
microscopic observations showed intracellular and intercellular epidermal oedema at the lowest dose,
and severe intracellular and intercellular epidermal oedema with focal dermal inflammation and the
highest dose (Samberg et al., 2010). Korani et al. (2011) assessed dermal toxicity in guinea pigs exposed

to either 1000 or 10 000 µg/mL of silver nanoparticles, five times a week for 13 weeks. Toxic skin
responses were noted which were dose and time-dependent.

3.4.3.2 Neurotoxicity
Evidence to show that silver crosses the blood brain barrier remains equivocal, however, even in
absence of silver in the extracellular fluid of the brain, silver-induced neurotoxic effects may occur via
secondary molecules that are released from the periphery (Hadrup & Lam, 2014). Silver appears to have
some neurotoxic effects in rats. Rungby & Danscher (1983) reported hyperactivity in rats administered
0.01% silver nitrate in drinking water for 4 months. Hypoactivity was found to be induced in mice
following withdrawal of silver nitrate in drinking water at a dose of 14 mg/kg bw per day, that had been
previously administered for 125 days (Rungby & Danscher, 1984).

Hadrup et al. (2012c) assessed the effect of silver nanoparticles (14 nm stabilized with PVP) and silver
acetate on the levels of brain neurotransmitters. The authors reported that silver nanoparticles (4.5 and
9 mg/kg bw per day) and silver acetate (9 mg/kg bw per day) increased the brain dopamine
concentration after 28 days of oral administration. In contrast to the results seen after a 28-day exposure
period, after 14 days of exposure, dopamine concentration was decreased by silver nanoparticles (at
concentrations of 2.25 and 4.5. mg/kg bw per day), leading to the suggestion that there are differential
effects of silver on dopamine depending on the length of exposure. In the 28-day exposure, brain
noradrenaline levels were significantly increased only by silver acetate (9 mg/kg bw per day) and brain
5-hydroxytryptamine was increased only by silver nanoparticles (9 mg/kg bw per day).

Skalska et al. (2015) administered rats with silver nanoparticles (10 nm stabilized in sodium citrate, 0.2
mg/kg bw per day), silver citrate (0.2 mg/kg bw per day) or saline, over a 14-day period,. Both types of
silver were found to result in ultrastructural pathological changes in the forebrain cortex and
hippocampus of the treated animals, with the synaptic degeneration being greater in the hippocampus
region.

No studies could be identified to address potential neurotoxic effects of silver or silver nanoparticles in
animals following inhalation or dermal exposure.

3.4.3.3 Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Pregnant female rats administered 50 mg of silver chloride per animal (corresponding to 190 mg of
silver per kg bw per day) orally during gestation days 1–20 showed increased post-implantation
lethality. The incidence of visceral damage in the offspring was considerably higher compared to the
control group and all offspring died within 24 hours of birth (Shavlovski et al., 1995).

Pregnant rats were treated with silver nanoparticles (< 10 nm suspended in carboxymethylcellulose,
maximum concentration 1000 mg/kg per day) for 14 days during their pregnancy and the impact on
fetal development determined on day 20 of gestation. There were no significant differences between
the groups during the feeding stage. On post mortem examination, there were signs of oxidative stress
in maternal hepatic tissues at 100 mg/kg and above (decrease in liver catalase and glutathione reductase
activities), but no evidence of developmental toxicity (Yu et al., 2013). Hong et al. (2014) also failed to
find any impacts of reproduction/development (mating, fertility, implantation, delivery and fetuses) in
rats fed up to 250 mg/kg bw per day of citrate-stabilized silver nanoparticles (7.9 nm) for up to 52 days.
They also did not show any differences in haematology, serum biochemical investigation or
histopathological analysis.


                                                   131

In a study by Mathias et al. (2015), prepubertal male rats were fed either 15 or 30 µg/kg bw per day of
silver nanoparticles for 35 days from postnatal day 23 to postnatal day 58 and then sacrificed 44 days
later. While no changes were seen in growth and the animals showed no changes in sexual behaviour
and serum hormone concentrations, silver nanoparticle exposure delayed the onset of puberty and
reduced the acrosome and plasma integrities, reduced the mitochondrial activity and increased the
abnormalities of the sperm in both treatment groups.

In male rats administered silver nanoparticles at 20 µg/kg bw per day by oral gavage for 90 days,
histopathological changes in the testes were seen. These were reported as: disorganization of the normal
appearance of the testis with varying degrees of atrophy in the seminiferous tubules; depletion of germ
cells and germinal cell necrosis in spermatogonia; degenerative changes in form of necrosis and severe
vacuolisation in sertoli cell cytoplasm; and vacuolated Leydig cells (Thakur et al., 2014). As only one
dose of silver nanoparticles was utilised in this study, a LOAEL of 20 µg/kg bw per day only can be
derived.

Kovvuru et al. (2015) reported that in mice, maternal ingestion of 500 mg/kg bw per day of silver
nanoparticles (PVP-coated) for 5 days during the post-coitum period induced DNA deletions in
developing embryos. They also reported irreversible chromosomal damage in bone marrow and double
strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow.

In mice administered 0.03% silver nitrate in the drinking water for 1 month (corresponding to 23 mg of
silver/kg bw per day), changes in ovarian nuclear and cytoplasmic cell morphology were reported
(Hadek, 1966).

No studies could be identified to address potential reproductive or developmental effects of silver or
silver nanoparticles in animals following inhalation or dermal exposure.

3.4.3.4 Immunotoxicity
Reported effects of silver or silver nanoparticles on the immune system following oral administration
are variable. Lymphocyte infiltration was reported in mice fed a single, very high dose (125 g/kg bw
per day) of 13 nm nanoparticulate or 2–3.5 µm micro-particulate silver (Cha et al., 2008). Silver induced
an autoimmune condition in the genetically susceptible H-2s mouse strain following the administration
of 0.5 g of silver nitrate/L in the drinking water (which corresponded to 47 mg of silver per kg bw per
day) for 10 weeks (Havarinasab et al., 2009). In a 28-day oral study, administration of nanoparticulate
and ionic silver at does up to 9 mg/kg bw per day were associated with a decreased thymus weight
(Hadrup et al., 2012b). Park et al. (2010a) observed increases in plasma concentrations of interleukin 1
(high dose), interleukin 4 (high dose), interleukin 6 (middle and high dose), interleukin 10 (all doses),
interleukin 12 (middle and high dose) transforming growth factor b (middle and high dose) and
immunoglobulin E (high dose), as well as an increase in cell infiltration in the kidney cortex (high dose)
following oral exposure of mice to 42 nm silver nanoparticles at doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg bw per
day.

Conversely, Van der Zande et al. (2012) observed no immunotoxicity following the oral administration
of silver nanoparticles (15 and 20 nm) at 90 mg/kg bw per day or ionic silver at 9 mg/kg bw per day for
28 days.

No studies could be identified to address potential immunotoxic effects of silver or silver nanoparticles
in animals following inhalation or dermal exposure.

3.4.3.5 Genotoxicity (in vivo)
A number of in vivo genotoxicity studies have been carried out with ionic silver and silver nanoparticles
in rats and mice. Those using the comet assay, micronucleus assay and chromosome aberration test are
summarized in Table 7 below. With regards to genotoxicity testing, the the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development has produced a series of test guidelines for genetic toxicology which
includes the follow battery of tests:

    •   bacterial reverse mutation test (e.g. the Ames test) TG 471;
    •   in vivo mammalian alkaline comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis assay) TG 489;
    •   mammalian micronucleus assay (in vivo TG 474; in vitro TG 487);
    •   mammalian chromosome aberration test (in vitro TG 473, in vivo TG 475, TG 483); and
    •   mammalian gene mutation assay (in vitro TG 476, in vivo TG 488).

Many of the test guidelines have recently been updated and a new genetic toxicology guidance
document is in draft form (OECD, 2015). While it is acknowledged that some substances, including
nanomaterials, may require special modifications to the test guidelines, no guidance is provided on this
within the test guidelines. It is becoming increasingly clear, for example, that the Ames test is not
effective at assessing the genotoxic potential of nanoparticles as the results following challenge with a
variety of nanoparticles have predominantly been negative, although nanoparticles have been shown to
produce positive genotoxic responses from in vitro mammalian cell test systems (Landsiedel et al.,
2009; Doak et al., 2012). In addition, the comet assay is an “indicator” test which detects primary DNA
damage, but not the consequences of the damage. The DNA measured in the comet assay may, for
example, lead to cell death or it may result in DNA repair (which can result in return the DNA to its
original state or may result in a mutation). The micronucleus assay and chromosome aberration test
both test for chromosomal aberrations resulting from exposure to the test chemical.

Of the 11 studies outlined in Table 7, five used rats and six used mice and, most studies analysed bone
marrow samples. Doses of silver nanoparticles ranged from 0.01 mg/kg bw per day (Taveres et al.,
2012) to 1000 mg/kg bw per day (Kim et al., 2008; Kim JS et al., 2011). The comet assay was used in
eight of the studies. In rats, Patolla et al. (2015) found a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage in
the comet assay (significant at 50 mg/kg bw per day and above) in a 5-day oral feeding experiment,
while Dobrzynska et al. (2014) saw no significant effect on bone marrow leukocytes after a single
intravenous injection (maximum concentration 10 mg/kg bw). In mice, the comet assay gave more
consistent results with five out of the six studies showing an increase in DNA damage following
exposure to silver nanoparticles using a variety of routes of adminstration. Asare et al. (2015) found no
effect in mouse liver, lung or testes following a single intravenous dose (5 mg/kg) of 20 nm silver
nanoparticles. The micronucleus assay gave mixed results, where two of the five tests were positive.
Both of the positive tests were in bone marrow tissue from rats; one using a 5-day oral administration
and one using a single intravenous injection. There is some suggestion that different cells within the
same tissue (Dobrzyńska et al., 2014) and different tissues (Li Y et al., 2013) may display different
susceptibility to genotoxic effects. Dobrzyńska et al. (2014), for example, found a statistically
significant increased frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes from bone marrow, following exposure
to silver nanoparticles, but not reticulocytes; although other authors have reported negative results in
rat bone marrow erythrocytes (e.g. Kim JS et al., 2011). Chromosome aberrations were seen in each of
the three studies that employed this test; two in rats (Patolla et al., 2015; El Mahdy et al., 2014) and one
in mice (Ghosh et al., 2012). The most frequently noted abberations varied by study. One study (Li Y
et al., 2013) used the Pig-a assay (a relatively new in vivo gene mutation test – not shown in Table 7)


                                                    133

in mice exposed to 5 nm PVP silver nanoparticles by intravenous injection and reported no effect over
the control.

There was no evidence of genetic toxicity in male or female rats based on an analysis of micronucleus
induction from bone marrow, following inhalation exposure of rats to silver nanoparticles at levels up
to 515 µg/m3 over a 90-day period (Kim JS et al., 2011). Dong et al. (2013) exposed rats to silver
nanoparticles at an inhalation level of 381 µg/m3 for 12 weeks. Although they found a change in gene
expression in the kidneys with, overall, male rat kidneys showing a higher expression of genes involved
in xenobiotic metabolism and the female rat kidneys showing a higher expression of genes involved in
extracellular signalling, this was not considered to be of toxicological significance.

No studies could be identified to assess genotoxic effects of silver of silver nanoparticles following
dermal exposure in animals.

3.4.3.6 Carcinogenicity
Silver is not classified as a human carcinogen. Fibrosarcomas have been induced in rats following
subcutaneous imbedding of silver foil; imbedded silver metal foil appeared to produce fibrosarcomas
with a latent period of 275 days in 32% of implantation sites (Oppenheimer et al., 1956). However, the
relevance of this to humans is uncertain and may reflect solid-state carcinogenesis in which even
insoluble solids such as plastic have been shown to result in local fibrosarcomas (Coffin & Palekar,
1985). Both positive (Schmahl & Steinhoff, 1960) and negative (Furst & Schlauder, 1977) results for
tumorigenesis have been reported following subcutaneous and intramuscular injection, respectively, of
colloidal silver in rats. However, the relevance of these routes of exposure to humans is, again, unclear
(ATSDR, 1990). No studies on carcinogenicity from silver nanoparticles were identified.

3.4.4 In vitro toxicity
There has been a marked increase in the number of in vitro studies investigating the potential toxicity
of ionic silver and silver nanoparticles in recent years. A wide range of cell types from human, rat,
mouse, hamster and porcine origin have been investigated, including cells derived from: blood (e.g.
Zhang et al., 2013); brain (e.g. Haase et al., 2012); bone (e.g. Hardes et al., 2007); cervix (e.g. Mukherjee
et al., 2012); immune system (e.g. Pratsinis et al., 2013); intestine (e.g. Gopinath et al., 2010); kidney
(e.g. Kermanizadeh et al., 2013); liver (e.g. Gaiser et al., 2013); lung (e.g. Suliman et al., 2013); skin
(e.g. Samberg et al., 2010); and testes (e.g. Ema et al., 2010). It is possible that secondary cells (i.e.
cancer-derived or immortalized cell lines) may not provide useful information in terms of silver or silver
nanoparticle toxicity on normal undifferentiated cells, which are most relevant to human exposure
scenarios, as these may have multiple molecular pathways that are deregulated (Franchi et al., 2015).
Thus, the emphasis in this document is data derived from toxicological studies that have utilized primary
cells.

The interpretation of in vitro data in terms of its relevance to human exposure scenarios is unknown
and so, for clarity, a summary of findings is provided below, with full details provided in Appendix B.

    •   Ionic silver and silver nanoparticles cause toxic effects in a wide variety of cell types from a
        range of organs and tissues. The degree of toxicity varies according to the form of silver (ionic
        silver or silver nanoparticles), the silver nanoparticle size and coating and the sensitivity of
        individual cell types.
    •   In the liver, although toxic effects are reported, primary cells seem to be much more resilient
        to the effects of silver than secondary cell lines.
    •   Silver is cytotoxic to lung macrophages and fibroblasts and also brain cells, including astrocytes
        and neurons. Based on work using cells derived from the rat adrenal medulla it has been
        suggested that both ionic silver and silver nanoparticles are developmental neurotoxicants.The
        majority of studies identified relating to the gut are based on secondary cancer-derived cell lines
        and have suggested that silver is cytotoxic to colon epithelial cells (Caco-2, HT29 and SW480),
        although there is a suggestion that uptake of silver by intestinal cells (HT29) is less than other
        cells and that the production of mucin may be protective. Normal colon mucosal epithelial cells
        (NCM460) seem to be less susceptible to the impact of silver nanoparticles than the secondary
        cell lines.
    •   Baby hamster kidney cells and human embryo kidney cells (HEK293) are sensitive to silver
        nanoparticles, with DNA damage seen in HEK293 cells detected following exposure to 1µg
        silver nanoparticles per mL.
    •   In the blood, silver nanoparticles can cause platelet aggregation in vitro (human platelets) and
        in vivo (rats following intravenous or intratracheal administration) and has been shown to result
        in rupture of human red blood cells. Silver nanoparticles have also been shown to be cytotoxic
        to human blood mononuclear cells at concentrations as low as 1µg/mL.
    •   Silver shows cytotoxicity in macrophages and keratinocytes and also affects zinc and selenium
        metabolism in keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts.
    •   Potential reproductive effects of silver have been shown, in vitro with a decrease in oocyte
        maturation and inhibition of the proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells.
    •   The comet assay and micronucleus test, in particular, indicate that silver nanoparticles (and
        ionic silver) may be genotoxic, with results dependent upon both the size and type of silver
        nanoparticles and also the sensitivity of the cell type although, as noted earlier, there is no
        regulatory approved comet assay for in vitro use and damage can be reversible.

    •   Generally, exposure of cells to silver (ionic silver and silver nanoparticles) results in oxidative
        stress; in susceptible cells this can result in a range of toxic effects including apoptosis, changes
        in gene expression and DNA damage. Different cell sensitivity is likely to be due to a range of
        factors and includes protection produced by mucin (e.g. HT29 cells) and intracellular
        antioxidant levels.

3.4.5 In vitro to in vivo extrapolations
Monteiro-Riviere et al. (2013) looked at the impact that pre-incubation of silver nanoparticles with a
number of different proteins (albumin, IgG and transferrin – to form protein-complexed nanoparticles)
had on the uptake of silver nanoparticles by human epidermal keratinocytes. Silver nanoparticle
association with serum proteins significantly modulated silver uptake compared to native silver
nanoparticle uptake. Shannahan et al. (2015) also examined how the formation of a protein corona as a
result of exposure to a biological environment can impact on the uptake and also toxicity of silver
nanoparticles; this group used citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (20 nm) and two rat cell types. The
silver nanoparticles were incubated with human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, high-density
lipoprotein or water (control) to form a protein corona. Silver nanoparticles readily associated with
human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin and high-density lipoprotein and, in each case, there was
an increase in the hydrodynamic size of the silver nanoparticles. The addition of the protein corona
decreased cellular uptake of silver nanoparticles and, at higher concentrations (25 and 50 µg/mL),
reduced cytotoxicity.

3.5 Vulnerable populations
No information on the possible impact of silver or silver nanoparticles on vulnerable populations was
identified.

3.6 Summary of the safety and toxicity of silver
The findings from identified in vivo studies relating specifically to the oral route of exposure are
summarized below.

    •   Metallic silver is inert, and absorption is determined by ionization (under oxidizing conditions)
        to release the biologically active ionic silver, which is absorbed into the systemic circulation.
        Absorption rates of 18% have been reported for orally administered silver in humans, and
        between 0.4 and 18% in other mammals. Ionic silver binds strongly to metallothionein,
        albumins, and macroglobulins and is distributed to all tissues in the descending order of:
        stomach and small and large intestines, liver, spleen, testes, kidneys, brain, lungs, blood,
        bladder and heart. Silver deposition can occur through precipitation of insoluble silver salts,
        which are transformed to soluble silver sulfide albuminates. Excretion occurs via the bile and
        urine.
    •   There are a limited number of toxicity studies in humans relating to the toxicity of ionic silver
        or silver nanoparticles following exposure by any route. Of those available, no substantial
        toxicity has been reported.
    •   There are a limited number of experimental oral toxicity studies for silver. In the rat, silver (as
        silver nitrate) has moderate acute toxicity and is slightly toxic following acute exposure in the
        rabbit. Silver nanoparticles are considered to have slight to no acute toxicity via the oral route.
    •   There are a limited number of animal studies relating to the toxicity of silver following repeated
        exposures. A NOAEL of 181.2 mg/kg bw per day has been determined for silver based on
        reduced body weight gain in Sprague-Dawley rats.

                                                    139

•   There are a large number of animal studies in rats (principally), mice and guinea pigs, relating
    to the toxicity of silver nanoparticles following repeated oral exposure. These have shown
    evidence of a dose dependent toxicity of silver nanoparticles related to a number of endpoints,
    namely: death, decreases in body weight, hypoactivity, altered neurotransmitter levels, altered
    liver enzymes, altered blood values, enlarged hearts, immunological effects, increased sperm
    abnormalities; delayed onset of puberty. Histopathological changes to liver, kidney, spleen,
    intestine, epidermis and brain tissue have also been reported.
•   Of the studies identified, the most sensitive toxicological endpoint relates to histopathological
    changes in the testes in male rats. A LOAEL of 20 µg/kg bw per day has been derived for this
    endpoint.
•   No in vivo genotoxicity studies carried out with silver in humans or animals could be identified.
    Although in vitro findings suggest that ionic silver may be genotoxic, the relevance of these
    findings to humans is unknown.
•   Genotoxicity studies have been carried out in vivo with silver nanoparticles in the rat and in
    mice, at repeated oral doses between 5 and 1000 mg/kg bw per day for up to 35 days. The
    findings suggest that silver nanoparticles administered by the oral route may induce DNA
    damage at the chromosomal level, becoming clastogenic at higher levels. However, there is no
    indication of direct mutagenicity.
        o In the rat and mouse, a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage was seen using the
             comet assay, which was significant at 50 and 10 mg/kg bw per day and above in rats
             and mice respectively.
        o A dose-dependent increase in micronucleus formation has been reported in rats, which
             reached significance at a dose of silver nanoparticles of 50 mg/kg bw per day and
             above.
        o A dose-dependent increase in chromosome aberrations has also been observed in rats
             administered silver nanoparticles at doses between 5 and 100 mg/kg bw per day.
             Chromatid gaps and breaks were the most frequently noted aberrations.
        o The mode of action for silver nanoparticle toxicity is at present undefined, however it
             is closely related to its transformation in biological and environmental media:
                   nanosilver particles can interact with membrane proteins and activate
                      signalling pathways, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation;
                   nanosilver particles can enter the cell through diffusion or endocytosis to cause
                      mitochondrial dysfunction, generation of ROS, leading to damage to proteins
                      and nucleic acids inside the cell, and finally inhibition of cell proliferation; and
                   both the ionic and nano-form of silver can interact with sulfur containing
                      macromolecules such as proteins.

4. Environmental considerations
Environmental considerations are largely beyond the scope of this report; however, it has been noted
that release of silver and silver nanoparticles (from whatever source) into the environment may pose a
threat to “non-target” organisms (such as natural microbes and aquatic organisms). Bondarenko et al.
(2013) reviewed the toxicity of silver salts and silver nanoparticles to selected environmentally relevant
test organisms as well as target organisms. Table 8 shows the median L(E)C50 31or MIC data for silver
nanoparticles and silver salts.

The most sensitive organisms to both silver salts and silver nanoparticles are crustaceans (non-target
organisms). Based on the lowest median L(E)C50 value of the key environmental organisms both silver
salt and silver nanoparticles would be classified as “very toxic to aquatic organisms” under EU Directive
93/67/EEC (CEC, 1996).

5. Discussion
A review of the recent literature reveals that there is a considerable interest in silver and silver
nanoparticles, in particular, both in terms of potential applications and toxicity.

5.1 Efficacy
In many of the studies reported in Section 2, it is often difficult to determine the efficacy of the silver
component (especially in the studies outlined in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) as the impact of filtration alone
is often not reported. In a number of cases, silver measurements in the treated water are not reported
(meaning that it is not possible to assess human exposure to silver via this route).

5.1.1 Copper/silver ionization in hospital water systems
Copper/silver ionization is often used for microbial control (especially against Legionella spp.)
particularly in hospital hot water distribution systems. In well-run systems (where ion concentrations
are monitored and kept at recommended levels) most studies have shown that Legionella spp. are
reduced to low levels and that implementation of the ionization system markedly reduces the number
of cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease.

5.1.2 Ionic silver in drinking water
Studies on the bacterial inactivation resulting from ionic silver added to water have shown that LRVs
vary widely (generally between 3 and 7), with some bacteria being more sensitive (i.e. more easily
killed or inactivated) than others. Generally, long contact times are required to reduce bacterial
concentrations. In addition, the majority of studies spiked water samples with laboratory grown bacteria.
Studies using silver on harvested rainwater, for example, typically showed poorer LRVs (0.4–2.9). The
use of laboratory grown bacteria, (which tend to be “less virulent and hearty than wild microbial
consortiums”– Madrigan et al., 2000) may, thus, overstate the effectiveness of treatment.

Two non-bacterial studies were identified. De Gusseme et al. (2010) showed a 3 log10 reduction in
bacteriophage after 2 hours of exposure to a high silver concentration (5 mg/L). Abebe et al. (2015)
found that silver nitrate-treated C. parvum oocysts were significantly less infective in mice than
untreated oocysts.

The role of water chemistry is also likely to be important in determining the efficacy of silver as a
disinfectant in real world conditions. Silver forms numerous salts with low water solubility and silver
ions are easily sequested by anions commonly found in natural waters including chloride, bromide,
carbonate and phosphate. Even at low concentrations which do not induce silver precipitation, chloride
and phosphate have been shown to hinder the bioavailability and mitigate the antibacterial activity of
silver ions (Xiu et al., 2011).

5.1.3 Silver nanoparticle applications
The exploratory drinking-water applications (principally employing filtration) identified used a wide
range of media/matrices (e.g polyurethane foam, paper and polystyrene beads). The majority of studies
tested efficacy against bacteria (typically E. coli), with values up to 7 log10 reduction being reported
(range 1.6–7.6). De Gusseme et al. (2010) showed that biogenic silver nanoparticles produced a 4 log10
reduction in bacteriophage after three hours and murine norovirus after 30 minutes; this was in stark
contrast to chemically-produced silver nanoparticles, which showed no inactivation. Abebe et al. (2015)



                                                   142

found that silver nanoparticle-treated Cryptosporidium oocysts showed some reduction in mouse
infectivity compared to non-treated oocysts.

5.1.4 Silver-coated ceramic filter applications
A number of studies have considered the impact of silver coating on ceramic filters. In terms of the
efficacy of the silver within silver-coated ceramic filters, it seems likely that the type of silver employed
(silver nitrate or silver nanoparticles), how it is applied (painted on, dipped or fired in) and in what
concentration the silver is applied affects both the bacterial removal and the effluent silver
concentration. Overall, however, many of the studies which compared silver-coated and non-coated
filters have not shown convincing benefits of silver nitrate or silver nanoparticle application, as shown
in Table 9.

While some studies (e.g. Bloem et al., 2009) have shown that silver application can improve microbial
removal (e.g. by between 1.8 and 3.3 log10 reduction in E. coli) compared to non-treated ceramic filters,
silver-coated ceramic filters (even from the same manufacturer) seem to show great variability in
bacterial removal. A number of studies have shown that water chemistry may greatly affect the
longevity of the treatment effect (Bielefeldt et al., 2013; Mittelmann et al., 2015). Of the silver-coated
ceramic filter studies which considered virus reduction, viruses were poorly removed and did not meet
the 3 log10 reduction required for 2-star performance classification (WHO, 2016).

5.1.5 General points for potential drinking-water applications
Although an initial glance at the results suggests that silver may reduce microbial contamination in
water (in some circumstances), there are a number of limiting factors that need to be considered,
including:

    •   There is an emphasis on bacterial testing (this has been highlighted above).
    •   Few studies have tried to assess the silver applications in field conditions, using both turbid and
        non-turbid water and realistic contact times (and this may account for the diversity of reported
        results and the higher reported LRVs seen in the laboratory compared to field studies). Of the
        two reported silver-containing water treatment products tested against the WHO Scheme, one
        using colloidal silver and one using silver-treated ceramic filters, neither met requirements for
        effective household water treatment performance (i.e. providing comprehensive protection).
    •   There is a lack of consideration that silver may be acting as a bacteriostat and the impacts of
        silver leaching on the mid- to long-term performance of the product. Few studies have looked
        at regrowth (i.e. the possibility that silver is acting as a bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal
        agent in the low concentrations required for drinking-water applications – i.e. ≤ 100 µg/L), or
        the presence of silver in stored filtered water and the mode of action of silver at low
        concentrations is unclear.
    •   There is no clear accounting for the presence of potentially toxic contaminants in applications
        using silver nanoparticles (which may, at least in some instances, be the cause of microbial
        inactivation). Silver nanoparticles can be synthesized in a variety of ways, some of which use
        toxic reagents. It is often not clear from the studies on silver nanoparticle applications whether
        adequate steps were taken to remove these contaminants before efficacy testing.

5.2 Toxicity
It is clear that silver (largely irrespective of route of exposure or form) can distribute widely within the
mammalian body and is capable of crossing the blood-brain and placental barriers. Tissue distribution
varies between studies but the liver and kidneys seem to be target organs following silver ingestion.
Animal in vivo study results suggest a range of toxic effects including decreases in body weight,
histopathological changes to a number of organs and tissues, alterations to serum enzymes and
neurotransmitter levels, increased sperm abnormalities, delayed onset of puberty and indications of
genotoxicity. In vivo and in vitro studies have, however, produced an array of often conflicting
information, which means that drawing clear conclusions about silver toxicity is difficult, although there
are a number of reasons for the conflicting results as illustrated in the following sections.

5.2.1 Silver nanoparticles
There are numerous different methodologies for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles; they can be
produced in a wide range of sizes and shapes and stabilized with a variety of capping agents, and these
factors alone make generalizations difficult.

5.2.1.1 Synthesis and capping
Chernousova & Epple (2013) have noted that the reproducible laboratory synthesis of silver
nanoparticles is “more difficult than expected”. They relate this to the initial formation of the nuclei of
metallic silver, which develop different morphologies and crystal sizes when reaction conditions (such
as concentrations, reduction agent, temperature or presence of additives) change. In addition, a number



                                                    144
                                                              Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


of studies have shown that the choice of capping or stabilizing agent can change the toxicity of silver
nanoparticles.

5.2.1.2 Size
There are a number of techniques for determining silver nanoparticle size; those most commonly used
are transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Transmission electron microscopy
is useful to capture the size of the individual (or primary) particle, but it is limited as it can only be used
to measure particles after they have been suspended and then dried (it may also be affected by the
solvent used for silver nanoparticle dispersion prior to drying). Dynamic light scattering captures the
hydrodynamic size and is performed in solution, but may be affected by the suspension media and how
the sample was mixed, for example, sonication intensity and duration (Choi et al., 2011). The size of
the silver nanoparticles also depends on the medium in which they are suspended, with Bouwmeester
et al. (2011), for example, finding larger hydrodynamic sizes for silver nanoparticles when they were
suspended in cell culture medium, compared to water. In the review sections and below, usually only
the primary size of the silver nanoparticles has been reported to avoid over complicating the text.

Some studies have suggested that smaller silver nanoparticles are more toxic to mammalian cells than
larger nanoparticles and microparticles. Carlson et al. (2008), for example, found that 15 nm carbon-
coated silver nanoparticles caused more toxicity than 50 nm carbon-coated silver nanoparticles in rat
alveolar macrophages and Li et al. (2012) reported similar results for PVP-coated silver nanoparticles
(25, 35, 45, 60 and 70 nm) in human lung fibroblasts. Liu et al. (2010) found that small PVP-coated
silver nanoparticles (5 nm) were more toxic to four different cell lines than both ionic silver (silver
nitrate) and larger particles, as shown in Table 10.

Dasgupta et al. (2015) reported that 60 nm silver nanoparticles were more toxic to both A549 (lung
carcinoma cells) and HCT116 (colon carcinoma cells) than 85 nm silver nanoparticles, manufactured
using the thermal co-reduction. However, this does not seem to be universally the case as Powers et al.
(2011), for example, found that larger PVP-coated silver nanoparticles (50 nm) had greater effects on
DNA synthesis and caused a higher degree of oxidative stress in PC12 cells than the smaller PVP-
coated particle (10 nm). Park et al. (2010b) reported greater cytotoxicity of 70 nm silver nanoparticles

in mouse macrophages than Shavandi et al. (2011), although it has been suggested that this may have
been an artefact of the preparation method, which could have led to high ionic silver concentration, but
reduced silver nanoparticle concentration (Pratsinis et al., 2013). In a review of toxicity data on
mammalian cell lines, Bondarenko et al. (2013) found that when plotting L(E)C50 data for PVP-coated
silver nanoparticles (to avoid coated versus non-coated toxicity issues) against the primary size of the
silver nanoparticles, no correlation was seen (R2=0.1); plotting the data from Liu et al. (2010) resulted
in a correlation of R2=0.4, while plotting data from just one study on A549 cells (Liu et al., 2010)
revealed a correlation of R2=0.81. This demonstrates how difficult it is to make generalizations about
the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to mammalian cells.

5.2.1.3 Experimental quality
There are numerous pitfalls that await the unwary silver nanoparticle researcher. These include lack of
characterization of the silver nanoparticles, gradual release of silver ions from the dissolved silver
nanoparticles following preparation, toxicity of the capping agent or suspending solvent, presence of
biological contaminants, failure to account for possible contaminants remaining after the manufacture
of the silver nanoparticles, and interference of silver nanoparticles with the toxicity tests.

In order to improve comparability between studies it is important that the silver nanoparticles used are
adequately characterized. It has been suggested that complete characterization of silver nanoparticles
may include measurements of size distribution, shape and other morphological features, solubility,
surface area, state of dispersion, surface chemistry and other physico-chemical properties (Park et al.,
2010b). Studies which go to those lengths are rare, but silver nanoparticle characterization is
increasingly being reported, and it is clear that where commercial silver nanoparticles are utilized, it is
not always adequate to rely on the manufacturers claims (Choi et al., 2011).

Kittler et al. (2010) examined the toxicity of freshly prepared silver nanoparticle and previously stored
silver nanoparticles on human mesenchymal cells. The aged silver nanoparticles were found to be
considerably more toxic than those that were freshly prepared, with the silver nanoparticles that had
been prepared for 1 or 6 months causing 100% loss of cell viability, compared with a 70% loss of
viability seen in the cells treated with freshly prepared silver nanoparticles. The difference in toxicity
was attributed to differing amount of released silver ions. The authors comment that some of the
published discrepancies in reported toxicity studies may be explained by this observation. Oostingh et
al. (2011) investigated a number of possible issues relating to toxicity testing of nanoparticles. Some of
the agents used to stabilize silver nanoparticles may have a toxic effect in their own right; with citrate,
for example (a common capping agent) exerting a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on BEAS-2B human
primary lung cells. They also looked at biological contamination which may be important when
studying immunomodulating/immunotoxic effects. Although the nanoparticles they used were sterile
(i.e. devoid of live microbiological contamination), they found that both the nanoparticles and their
solvents contained variable levels of endotoxin (to which many immune cells are especially sensitive).
As noted above, some of these aspects may also impact on disinfection efficacy studies.

A number of traditional measures of cytotoxicity rely on optically based tests, but it has been shown
that nanoparticles can interfere with these tests. Small nanoparticles (4–15 nm) have been shown to
absorb at the wavelengths typically used in most biological assay readouts (this could suggest improved
viability), while some nanoparticles can inhibit colour formation – which would mimic a cytotoxic
effect (Oostingh et al., 2011).

5.2.2 In vivo toxicity
The studies outlined in Section 3.4, largely focus on the effects of silver nanoparticles (with some
comparisons with silver salts). A number of dose-dependent animal toxicity findings have been
reported including death, weight loss, hypoactivity, altered neurotransmitter levels, altered liver
enzymes, altered blood values, enlarged hearts and immunological effects (Hadrup & Lam, 2014).
While many studies show no negative impacts, toxicological effects (histopathogical changes in the
testes) following chronic oral administration in rats were seen at a silver nanoparticle concentration of
20 µg/kg bw per day.

There has been a recent increase in interest in the possible genotoxic effects of silver. Although a
number of studies have been reported only three of the in vivo studies looked at oral exposure. Two of
these found possible genotoxic effects (Awasthi et al., 2015; Patolla et al., 2015) of which one reported
a dose-dependent increase in chromosome aberrations at 5 mg/kg bw (the lowest dose examined) and
above. A human study of silver jewellery workers (Aktepe et al., 2015) found evidence of possible
DNA damage (based on the comet assay), but gave no information about working conditions or
exposure to silver and other possible contaminants.

5.2.3 In vitro toxicity
Primary cells are more representative of tissue. They can be expected to reproduce the normal response
of normal individuals (Oostingh et al., 2011) and therefore are ideal for in vitro toxicity studies. The
use of primary cells, however, is not always feasible as they may be difficult to obtain (e.g. human lung
epithelial cells) and they have limited cellular life spans, which means that fresh cells (probably
obtained from different donors) are required for each assay, making standardization difficult (Oostingh
et al., 2011). Thus, secondary cell lines (transformed or tumour cells with unrestrained proliferative
capacity), which are easier to maintain and produce reproducible results, are preferred in many toxicity
studies (Arora et al., 2008). There may, however, be a number of issues related to the widespread use
of secondary cell lines in in vitro toxicity testing. Oostingh et al. (2011) make the point that particular
caution should be used when testing the cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects of nanoparticles on
secondary cells as they have different cell cycle regulation and cell survival compared to primary cells.
Indeed, it has been reported (e.g. Arora et al., 2009) that secondary cells are more susceptible to the
impacts of silver nanoparticles than primary cells and this has led to the exploration of silver
nanoparticles as a possible cancer treatment (e.g. Sriram et al., 2010).

As noted by Samberg et al. (2012), there is currently no consensus on the cytotoxicity of silver
nanoparticles; however, the majority of publications do show reduced cell viability and increased ROS
generation following silver nanoparticle exposure. Some however, clearly show that ROS are not
always produced (e.g. Xiu et al., 2011). Zanette et al. (2011) point out that while many studies consider
evidence for the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis in cells exposed to silver nanoparticles, less
investigate the intracellular pathways involved in the processes. While such details are beyond the scope
of this review, Zanette et al. (2011) suggest that silver nanoparticles may act on different cellular targets
and may differentially affect specific intracellular pathways depending on the cell types used.
Chernousova & Epple (2013) in their review of silver as an antimicrobial agent comment that, given
the different possibilities for silver to disturb biological processes, a general statement about the origin
of the toxic action of silver is not possible.

6. Conclusions
It is difficult to draw any strong conclusions about the efficacy of silver (ionic silver and silver
nanoparticles) in drinking-water treatment because of the wide range of approaches used in the various
studies reviewed. The studies have used different types of silver (silver salts versus silver nanoparticles;
capped silver nanoparticles versus bare silver nanoparticles; differently sized silver nanoparticles; silver
nanoparticles created using different synthesis methods), different methodologies, different cells and
microorganisms, different concentrations of test organisms and exposure for different time periods.

In drinking-water treatment applications, silver (ionic silver, experimental silver nanoparticle
applications and silver-coated ceramic filters [ionic silver and silver nanoparticles]) has generally only
shown to be effective against bacteria (i.e. 1.6 to 7.6 log10 reductions), most notably E. coli, with
relatively long contact times. Based on the current available evidence, which is particularly limited for
viruses and protozoa, silver does not appear to meet the WHO minimum performance recommendations
for POU treatment products, which require effectiveness for two of the three pathogen classes. This is,
partly, because of the paucity of data documenting performance efficacy against these classes of
microbes in water. In the one study on protozoan parasite reduction by silver, there was only limited
effectiveness on Cryptosporidium infectivity and a log10 reduction was not documented. For silver ions
and nanoparticles, only one study on bacteriophage reduction in water has been reported, with effective
log10 reduction (i.e. 3–4 log10 reductions) by ions and “biogenic” silver (zerovalent silver nanoparticles
on a bacterial carrier matrix) but not by chemically-produced nanoparticles. It should also be noted that
two silver containing products have failed the WHO evaluation scheme for household water treatment
products, one a colloidal silver added to water and the other a silver-treated ceramic filter. Furthermore,
it should be noted that relatively long contact times were required for effectiveness, which would reflect
conditions where water would need to be stored.

Silver in combination with copper (copper/silver ionization) has been used to successfully supress the
growth of Legionella bacteria in plumbing (principally hospital) systems.

The body of evidence on safety seems to suggest that silver (in ionic form or as silver nanoparticles) is
toxic to mammalian cells, although the sensitivity of the cells varies according to the cell type and the
type of silver to which it is exposed. Most of the evidence on the toxicity of silver comes from in vitro
studies. However, there is accumulating evidence from mammalian in vivo data, especially with silver
nanoparticles, that suggest that exposure to silver may result in toxic effects in exposed subjects, given
sufficient dosage and lengths of exposure. In particular, available data indicate that silver nanoparticles
have potential to damage DNA, although the potential for genotoxicity or DNA damage with silver
nanoparticles requires further investigation as to its significance for humans.

In summary, the current evidence is sufficient to indicate that:

    •   Silver has not demonstrated significant capability to be considered a candidate for primary
        disinfection of drinking water.
            o There are insufficient data to document that it acts against a broad spectrum of
                pathogenic organisms. Performance efficacy has been adequately documented only for
                some bacteria and not for viruses and protozoan parasites. The impact of water
                chemistry is often neglected in efficacy studies, and further, long contact times are
                generally required.
    •   Silver/copper continuous ionization systems can be effective supplemental disinfectants to
        control Legionella regrowth and reduce legionellosis risks in hospital hot water plumbing

        systems at concentrations well below current recommended drinking-water concentrations. The
        hot water system is not considered to be drinking water, so human exposure from consumption
        is minimal. This approach is favoured by the long contact times that are achieved in those
        systems. Proper operation and maintenance and periodic monitoring is required to assure
        continued performance.
    •   In some studies, at least, silver may be toxic to mammalian cells in vitro, and there is an
        indication that some toxic effects can also be seen from in vivo animal studies.

It should also be noted that in its current applications in POU household water treatment devices, as a
supplement or amendment to microporous filters, it is difficult to determine if silver is acting as a
bacteriostat or bacteriocide.

On the basis of the significant data and performance gaps in disinfection efficacy as a primary
disinfectant of water, the limited data on the range of microorganisms against which it is effective and
under what conditions, and the availability of widely used, well-characterized disinfectants, silver is not
recommended for use as a primary disinfectant in drinking-water supplies at this time. There are also
uncertainties around the toxicology, particularly with regard to human health end points. While there
is no evidence that the use of silver in household water filters has either caused adverse health effects
or leached excessive levels of silver into filtered water, the overall evidence base does not indicate that
such supplemental use of silver in water filters improves the microbiological quality and safety of the
filtered water.

Appendix A: Disinfectant mode of action


This short section outlines the disinfectant mode of action of silver ions and silver nanoparticles.

Silver ions are believed to impact on bacteria in a number of ways, including:

    •   extracellular binding or precipitation of silver to bacterial cell walls (Bellatone et al., 2002);
    •   the inhibition of essential enzymatic functions via interaction of the ions with the thiol-group
        (sulfhydryl group) of L-cysteine (Liau et al., 1997);
    •   the production of ROS (Park et al., 2009); and
    •   interaction with DNA (Thurman & Gerba, 1989).

Feng et al. (2000) conducted a mechanistic study of the antibacterial effect of silver ions on Escherichia
coli and Staphyococcus aureus. Following treatment with silver nitrate, silver ions were detected inside
the cells and both types of bacteria showed similar morphological changes, with the cytoplasmic
membrane detaching from the cell wall. In addition, an electron-light region appeared in cells, with
condensed DNA molecules within the centre of this region. DNA in a condensed form is unable to
replicate.

Thurman & Gerba (1989) showed that silver binds to DNA, with the metal displacing the hydrogen
bonds between adjacent nitrogens of purine and pyrimidine bases.

Dibrov et al. (2002) investigated the antimicrobial activity of silver ions on Vibrio cholerae and found
that, at low concentrations of ionic silver, massive proton leakage through the cell membrane could be
observed, which resulted in complete de-energization and, probably, cell death.

In their study, Park et al. (2009) found that almost half of the log10 reduction, caused by the silver ion
disinfection in the bacteria they studied (E. coli and S. aureus), could be attributed to reactive oxygen
species ROS-mediated activity, with the major form of ROS generated being the superoxide radical.
The authors comment that the silver ions are likely to generate superoxide radicals by impairing
enzymes in the respiratory chain and that this impairment may be caused by the thiol-interaction
mechanism (as mentioned above).

The antimicrobial mode of action of silver nanoparticles is not fully understood (Wijnhoven et al.,
2009), although some of the mechanisms may be the same as those for ionic silver or, as increasingly
seems likely (e.g. Xiu et al., 2012), may result from the release of ionic silver from the silver
nanoparticles (Li et al., 2008). A number of authors have shown that silver nanoparticles can anchor to
and then penetrate the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi, 2004; Morones
et al., 2005). Such damaged cell walls enhance cell permeability and inhibit appropriate regulation of
transport through the plasma membrane.

Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004) looked at the biocidal effect of silver nanoparticles on E. coli using
both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The bacteria were cultured
in a liquid medium supplemented with silver nanoparticles (50 µg/cm3) for 4 hours before electron
microscopy. The silver-treated cells were significantly changed in comparison with untreated E. coli
and showed major damage, which was characterized by the formation of pits in the cell walls. The
analysis showed that the silver nanoparticles were incorporated into the cell walls and accumulated in


                                                   165

the membrane, with some penetrating the cells. As a result, intracellular substances were found to be
leaking from the affected bacteria.

As with ionic silver, it has been suggested that silver nanoparticles may cause free-radical generation,
leading to subsequent cell damage. Kim et al. (2007) looked at the free-radical generation effect of
silver nanoparticles on microbial growth inhibition using electron spin spectroscopy. The group showed
that free-radicals were generated by the silver nanoparticles and that addition of an antioxidant reduced
the bactericidal efficacy of the silver nanoparticles. They suggested that the free-radicals may be derived
from the surface of the silver nanoparticles.

Shrivastava et al. (2007) studied the impact of silver nanoparticles on E. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella
typhus. The silver nanoparticles were found to be more effective against the Gram-negative bacteria.
The group found that the principal antimicrobial mechanisms were silver nanoparticles anchoring and
penetration of the cell wall, along with modulation of cellular signalling (leading to growth inhibition).

Hwang et al. (2008) performed a study on stress-specific bioluminescent bacteria, based on which they
proposed a synergistic toxic effect between the silver nanoparticles and the silver ions that they produce.
The stress-specific bacterial strains used were designed to respond to protein/membrane, oxidative
stress and DNA damage. They found that the silver nanoparticles caused toxicity via protein/membrane
and oxidative damage. In their study, the silver nanoparticles released silver ions and subsequently
superoxide radicals.

Appendix B: In vitro toxicity of silver and silver nanoparticles


There has been a marked increase in the number of studies looking at the in vitro toxic effects of silver
(principally silver nanoparticles) in recent years, with a wide range of cells investigated, including cells
derived from:

       •    blood (e.g. Zhang et al., 2013);
       •    brain (e.g. Haase et al., 2012a);
       •    bone (e.g. Hardes et al., 2007);
       •    cervix (e.g. Mukherjee et al., 2012);
       •    immune system (e.g. Pratsinis et al., 2013);
       •    intestine (e.g. Gopinath et al., 2010);
       •    kidney (e.g. Kermanizadeh et al., 2013);
       •    liver (e.g. Gaiser et al., 2013);
       •    lung (e.g. Suliman et al., 2013);
       •    skin (e.g. Samberg et al., 2010); and
       •    testes (e.g. Ema et al., 2010).

These cells came from a variety of different sources including human, rat, mouse, hamster and porcine
cells. These are described in detail below and the genotoxicity studies are summarised in Table B1.

In vitro studies covering exposure to cells derived from many of the target organs identified from in
vivo studies are outlined below. It is likely that secondary cells (i.e. cancer-derived or immortalized cell
lines) may not provide useful information in terms of silver nanoparticle toxicity on normal
undifferentiated cells, which are most relevant to human exposure scenarios. For example, molecular
pathways in cancer-derived cells are potentially deregulated (Franchi et al., 2015). Thus, in the 2015
literature update, the emphasis is on toxicological studies using primary cells.

B1. Liver
In the studies outlined below, researchers tested different silver nanoparticles against a variety of liver
cell types although, generally, these were secondary cells (i.e. cancer-derived or immortalized cell
lines). Different tests were used to assess toxicity but, usually, at least one test of cytotoxicity was
included. Results were expressed in a variety of ways and include measures of the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) and LC50.

Cha et al. (2008) exposed Huh-7 (hepatoma) cells to silver nanoparticles (13 nm) and found little impact
on mitochondrial activity or glutathione production. DNA contents in the treated cells, however,
decreased by 15% and the expression of genes related to apoptosis and inflammation were altered.

Kim et al. (2009) compared the cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (5–10 nm) and silver nitrate to
human hepatoma (HepG2) cells using three different measures of cell viability. The MTT32 (a
tetrazolium dye) and Almar Blue tests assess cell metabolic activity (through mitochondrial function),
while the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tests assesses membrane integrity. The IC50 values for the LDH
tests in both silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate were markedly lower than the other tests, suggesting

     3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide.

                                                             168
                                                                     Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


that in HepG2 cell membrane integrity is more readily affected by silver than the tested metabolic
activities (which is in contrast to the results of Hussain et al., 2005).

The finding that the cytotoxicity seen in all three tests could be prevented by the addition of N-
acetylcysteine (a precursor for the synthesis of glutathione, and thus, an important antioxidant) suggests
that the cytotoxicity may be due to oxidative stress. Nowrouzi et al. (2010) reported an IC50 value (tests
based on the tetrazolium dyes MTT and XTT33) for HepG2 cells exposed to silver nanoparticles (5–10
nm) of between 2.75 to 3 mg/L, very similar to that reported by Kim et al. (2009). They went on to
subject HepG2 cells to 0, 1, 4 and 8% of the IC50 value, and found significant impacts on indicators of
oxidative stress at levels of 4% and above (increases in the activity of LDH, alanine aminotransferase
and aspartate aminotransferase activity; increase in nitric oxide (NO) concentration; increases in lipid
peroxidation and cytochrome c content; decrease in glutathione (GSH) content and a decrease in
superoxide dismutase [SOD] activity). Kawata et al. (2009) investigated the effects of silver
nanoparticles (7–10 nm and stabilized with polyethylenimine) and silver carbonate on HepG2 cells at
concentrations below those resulting in cytotoxicity. As silver nanoparticles were found to result in
significant toxicity above 1 mg/mL (although silver carbonate still appeared to be non-cytotoxic at that
dose), a concentration of 1 mg/mLwas used in further experiments. At that concentration, silver
nanoparticles were found to significantly increase the frequency of micronucleus formation, indicating
DNA damage and chromosome aberrations (silver carbonate did not increase levels above those seen
in the control). In addition, exposure to silver nanoparticles also altered gene expression, including the
up-regulation of stress-related genes. Sahu et al. (2015) evaluated gene expression profiles in HepG2
cells exposed to 2.5 mg/L of 20 or 50 nm silver nanoparticles for 4 and 24 hours, and found that exposure
to 20 nm silver nanoparticles resulted in a transient upregulating of stress response genes (such as
metallothioniens and heat shock proteins). A number of cellular pathways, including the p53 signalling
pathway and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway, were also impacted by silver
nanoparticle exposure.

Gaiser et al. (2013) looked at the impact of silver nanoparticles (mean 17.5 nm) on C3A cells. The silver
nanoparticles were found to be highly toxic to the cultured cells (LDH LC50 of 2.5 µg/cm3; Almar Blue
LC50 of 20 µg/cm3). It was also shown that hepatocyte homeostasis was affected, with a decrease in
albumin release.

In 2005, Hussain et al. showed that silver nanoparticles (15 nm and 100 nm) were toxic to immortalized
rat liver (BRL 3A) cells. Silver nanoparticles resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in LDH
leakage and showed significant cytotoxicity at 10–50 µg/mL. The MTT assay also showed that silver
nanoparticles caused significant cytotoxicity above 5 µg/mL. In addition, the level of ROS was found
to increase in a concentration-dependent manner and a significant depletion of GSH was observed
relative to control cells.

Arora et al. (2009) also looked at the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (7–20 nm) to mouse liver cells but,
in contrast to other studies (e.g. Hussain et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009), used primary cells. Exposure of
the liver cells to up to 100 µg/mL for 24 hours did not alter cell morphology. The onset of apoptosis
was seen at 12.5 µg/mL, which was much lower than the necrotic concentration (500 µg/mL). The
primary cells seemed to be more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of silver nanoparticles, with an IC50
for the XTT assay of 449 µg/mL (although, not strictly comparable, the IC50 for the MTT test [similar
to XTT] in human hepatoma HepG2 cells reported by Kim et al., 2009 was < 3.5 µg/mL). Exposure of
the cells to silver nanoparticles at half of the IC50 value resulted in increased levels of SOD and GSH

     (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide).

                                                             169
                                                           Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


as compared to unexposed cells suggesting that antioxidant defence mechanisms were triggered by
silver nanoparticles exposure.

Kulthong et al. (2012) looked at the impact of silver nanoparticles on rat liver microsomes and
specifically any changes in activity in hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity. The silver
nanoparticles strongly inhibited CYP2C and CYP2D activities, but had no, or less, effect on other CYP
activities. The impact in microsomes was in contrast to the in vivo study where no toxic effects were
seen and where no change in CYP activity was observed.

The potential differences between primary and secondary cells is illustrated by Faedmaleki et al. (2014),
who compared the impact of silver nanoparticles on mice primary liver cells in comparison to human
HepG2 cells. Cell viability was measured using MTT and HepG2 were found to be significantly more
sensitive to silver nanoparticles than the primary liver cells, with an IC50 value of 2.7 µg/mL (HepG2)
compared to 121.7 µg/mL.

B2. Lung
A number of studies have been conducted on the toxicity of various types of silver nanoparticles
(different sizes and coatings) to lung cells in vitro. Typically, either A549 cells (a lung carcinoma
alveolar epithelial cell) or, less frequently, other cells have been used as test systems. Generally, authors
have found impacts on cell viability and demonstration of oxidative stress (Carlson et al., 2008;
Foldbjerg et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012: Suliman et al., 2013). Other studies have also considered impacts
on the cell cycle (AshaRani et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2011; Chairuangkitti et al., 2013). As with the
results from studies on liver cells, there is an indication that size and coating of the silver nanoparticles
impacts on toxicity with smaller silver nanoparticles typically being more toxic than larger particles
(Carlson et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012; Gliga et al., 2014).

Foldbjerg et al. (2011) compared the toxic effects of silver nanoparticles (PVP-coated, 69 nm, up to 20
µg/mL) and silver nitrate (up to 10 µg/mL) on A549 cells. Both silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate
were cytotoxic (as determined by impact on mitochondrial activity), although the cytotoxic impacts of
silver nitrate (EC50 – 6 µg/mL) were seen at lower doses than those following silver nanoparticle
exposure (EC50 – 12.5 µg/mL). The measured toxicity of both types of silver could be significantly
reduced by pre-treating cells with antioxidant. It was found that cell death was primarily due to a dose-
dependent increase in necrosis/late apoptosis, whereas only a minor increase in early apoptosis was
detected. The silver nanoparticles were found to induce a greater increase in ROS than the silver nitrate.
In comparison to the control, ROS levels were increased almost 16-fold at 10 µg silver
nanoparticles/mL, but only approximately 8-fold by the same concentration of silver from silver nitrate.
This group (Foldbjerg et al., 2012) also looked at the effects of silver nanoparticles (16 nm) and silver
nitrate at low (non-cytotoxic) doses on gene expression in A549 cells. Exposure to silver nanoparticles
altered the regulation (2-fold difference or greater) of more than 1000 genes, compared to only 133
genes following exposure to silver ions.

Suliman et al. (2013) investigated the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (56 nm, 10–100 µg/mL) on A549
cells using a wide array of methods. Morphological changes were clearly seen in cells exposed to 25
µg silver nanoparticles/mL for 48 hours. The silver nanoparticles caused cytotoxicity, as measured by
mitochondrial function (MTT assay) and membrane permeability (LDH assay). Silver nanoparticles
induced the generation of ROS and induced oxidative stress (shown by a depletion of GSH and increases
in lipid peroxidation, SOD and catalase concentrations). Increased apoptosis following exposure to


                                                    170
                                                          Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


silver nanoparticles was seen, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was up-regulated and a
concentration and a time-dependent increase in DNA damage was also observed.

In addition to changes in mitochondrial activity, membrane permeability and increases in ROS
generation etc., a number of authors have shown that silver nanoparticles modulate the cell cycle in
A549 cells. Lee et al. (2011) showed that silver nanoparticles (hydrodynamic diameter 480 nm) with
an IC50 of 106 µg/mL for cell viability caused accumulation of cells at G2/M and sub-G1 (apoptosis)
following exposure to 50 µg/mL for 4 hours. Chairuangkitti et al. (2013) showed that silver
nanoparticles increased the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 population, increased S phase arrest and
caused down-regulation of the cell cycle associated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein.
Pre-treatment with an antioxidant, while decreasing some of the effects, did not change the silver
nanoparticle-mediated impact on S phase arrest or down-regulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
protein, leading the authors to suggest that the in vitro toxic effects on A549 cells are mediated via a
ROS-dependent (cytotoxicity) and a ROS-independent (cell cycle arrest) pathway. AshaRani et al.
(2009a) looked at the anti-proliferative activity of silver nanoparticles (6–20 nm, starch coated) in
normal human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90). Electron micrographs showed that silver nanoparticles were
taken up by the cells and showed a uniform distribution both in cytoplasm and nucleus. Although the
silver nanoparticle-treated lung fibroblasts exhibited chromosome instability and mitotic arrest, the cells
recovered completely from the proliferation arrest.

Sur et al. (2010) looked at the impact on toxicity of modifying silver nanoparticles with glucose, lactose,
oligonucleotides and combinations of these ligands in comparison with bare silver nanoparticles on
A549 cells. While the modification seemed to increase the uptake of the silver nanoparticles into the
cells it also acted to decrease the toxicity, with the bare silver nanoparticles being cytotoxic at a lower
dose than the modified particles.

Li et al. (2012) treated human lung fibroblasts (unspecified) with five different sized PVP-coated silver
nanoparticles (25, 35, 45, 60 and 70 nm) at the same doses (31.75, 62.5, 125, 250 µg/mL). Both tests of
cell viability (MTT and LDH assay) showed size-dependent cytotoxicity which decreased with
increasing silver nanoparticle size. Gliga et al. (2014) also examined the size-dependent cytotoxicity of
silver nanoparticles, using 10, 40 and 75 nm citrate-coated, 10 nm PVP-coated and 50 nm uncoated
silver nanoparticles. Using BEAS-2B cells (immortalized bronchial epithelial cells), they found that
only the 10 nm silver nanoparticles were cytotoxic irrespective of coating; the reason for the greater
toxicity of the smaller particles was believed to be due to the release of significantly more ionic silver
compared with the other silver nanoparticles.

Carlson et al. (2008) explored the possible toxicity of inhaled silver nanoparticles using rat alveolar
macrophages. The toxicity of three silver nanoparticles (coated in hydrocarbon) of different sizes (15
nm, 30 nm, 55 nm) was assessed at various doses. In general, the 15 nm silver nanoparticles showed
the greatest toxicity and the 55 nm silver nanoparticles showed the least toxicity (e.g. the EC50 for
increased LDH leakage was 27 µg/mL for the 15 nm silver nanoparticles and > 75 µg/mL for the larger
particles). The authors also found a significant increase in ROS and a correlated decrease in levels of
GSH following exposure to silver nanoparticles (15 nm) and increased secretion of inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines.

B3. Brain and the blood-brain barrier
The brain is essentially made up of two key cell types – neurons and glial cells (including microglia,
astrocytes/astroglia and oligodendrocytes). A number of recent toxicity studies focusing on brain cell

                                                   171
                                                           Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


cultures, a model system for neuronal differentiation (PC12 cells) and cells involved in the blood-brain
barrier have been identified in the literature.

B3.1 Astrocytes
The ability of astrocytes to withstand silver seems to depend upon the form of the silver and the silver
nanoparticle coating. Luther et al. (2011), for example, exposed primary cultures of rat astrocytes to
PVP-coated silver nanoparticles (70 nm) for up to 24 hours (approximately 10 µg silver/mL) and found
that, while incubation led to a time- and concentration-dependent accumulation of silver in the cells, it
did not affect the cell viability or lead to a reduction in cellular glutathione level. In contrast, exposure
to a similar concentration of silver nitrate, was found to severely compromise cell viability. This group
found that the silver nanoparticles taken up by the astrocytes remained sequestered in the cells following
7 days of incubation in silver nanoparticle-free medium (Luther et al., 2012). The same robustness to
silver nanoparticle toxicity was not seen when rat astrocytes were exposed to smaller, peptide coated
silver nanoparticles (20 and 40 nm), where the silver nanoparticles were seen to induce a strong size-
dependent cytotoxicity and an increase in ROS formation (Haase et al., 2012a). In secondary astrocyte
cells lines, derived from human glioblastomas, silver nanoparticles (starch coated, 6–20 nm) were found
to result in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in U251 cells (AshaRani et al., 2009a, b) and silver chloride
was found to cause oxidative stress in A172 cells (Simmons et al., 2011).

B3.2 Neurons
Some studies show that silver nanoparticles seem to be particularly toxic to neurons (Yin et al., 2013;
Xu et al., 2013), although Haase et al. (2012a) found in their study that astrocytes were more sensitive
to peptide coated silver nanoparticles than neurons. In rat cerebellum granule cells, commercial silver
nanoparticles (sized 20–30nm) were found to cause cytotoxicity, based on an alcian blue staining assay,
at very low doses – with a reported IC50 of 0.96 µg/mL. Cell-body shrinkage was seen after 24-hour
exposure to 1 µg/mL silver nanoparticles and the silver nanoparticles were seen to cause oxidative stress
(Yin et al., 2013). Xu et al. (2013) found that 20 nm silver nanoparticles caused cytotoxicity in rat
cortical cell cultures at the lowest concentration examined (1 µg/mL) in developing cells and at 5 µg/mL
in more mature cultures. The silver nanoparticles were found to inhibit not only the sprouting of
neuronal branches and elongation of neurites, but also, they caused fragmentation and degeneration of
mature neurons. In contrast, Haase et al. (2012a) found that a significant cytotoxic effect of peptide
stabilized 20 nm silver nanoparticles was not seen until ≥ 50 µg/mL on their rat neuronal-enriched
cultures.

B3.3 Neurodevelopment and neurogenesis
The possible impacts of silver on neurodevelopment have been examined using PC12 cells. PC12 cells,
which are derived from rat adrenal medulla, stop dividing and terminally differentiate when treated with
nerve growth factor. They are used as a model for neuronal differentiation. Powers et al. (2010, 2011)
have looked at the impact of silver nitrate and silver nanoparticles on these cells. A one-hour exposure
of undifferentiated PC12 cells to 10µM ionic silver was found to inhibit DNA synthesis and protein
synthesis. Longer exposure resulted in oxidative stress and loss of viability. Ionic silver directly
inhibited mitotic activity. The same concentration of ionic silver was found to elicit even stronger
effects with the onset of cell differentiation, with greater DNA synthesis inhibition and greater levels
of oxidative stress. In addition, selectively impaired neurite formation was seen and there was
suppressed development of the acetylcholine phenotype in favour of the dopamine phenotype (Powers
et al., 2010). This group has also looked at the effects of silver nanoparticles (citrate- and PVP-coated)
in PC12 cells. In undifferentiated cells, citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (10 nm) impaired DNA and

                                                    172
                                                          Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


protein synthesis, but did not result in significant oxidative stress or loss of cell viability. In
differentiating cells, however, the citrate-coated silver nanoparticles caused oxidative stress and
impaired differentiation into the acetylcholine phenotype. In undifferentiated cells, PVP-silver
nanoparticles (10 nm and 50 nm) reduced DNA synthesis; the 50nm particle size had a greater effect.
All three silver nanoparticles significantly suppressed the acetylcholine phenotype, but the small PVP-
silver nanoparticles enhanced differentiation into the dopamine phenotype (Powers et al., 2011). The
authors suggest that their results point to the likelihood that silver and silver nanoparticles are
developmental neurotoxicants.

Cooper & Spitzer (2015) used rat neuroblastoma cells (B35) and cultured adult neural stem cells from
the subventricular zone from Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the sublethal effects of silver nanoparticles
(1 µg/mL) on neural function. Silver nanoparticle exposure in differentiating NSC induced the
formation of f-actin inclusions (indicating a disruption of actin function). The silver nanoparticle
exposure in B35 cells resulted in a decrease in neurite extension and branching, thus interfering with
cytoskeleton-mediated processes that are vital to neurogenesis (which is thought to play a key role in
cognitive functions such as learning and memory).

B3.4 Brain endothelial cells
Two recent studies have examined the impact of silver nanoparticles on rat brain endothelial cells
(Trickler et al., 2010; Grosse et al., 2013). Trickler et al. (2010) used cultured rat brain microvessel
endothelial cells as a model to examine cellular accumulation, changes in pro-inflammatory mediators
and changes in morphology and permeability following exposure to PVP-coated silver nanoparticles
(25, 40 and 80 nm in size). Silver nanoparticles were found to accumulate in the cells in a size-dependent
manner (with less accumulation seen for the 80 nm silver nanoparticles). The cellular association of
silver nanoparticles led to significant cytotoxicity and caused the release of cytokines and other
inflammatory mediators from the cell monolayers. The changes in the pro-inflammatory mediators
correlated with morphological changes and increased cell permeability.

Grosse et al. (2013) investigated the impact of citrate-coated silver nanoparticles (10, 50 and 100 nm)
on rat brain endothelial cells (RBE4). Based on the neutral red uptake assay (membrane permeability
as an indicator of cytotoxicity), toxicity was seen for all of the silver nanoparticles examined, with the
smaller particles being more toxic (effects seen at lower concentrations and after a shorter period of
time). Exposure of the cells to silver nitrate, suggested that the ionic form was less toxic to the
endothelial cells than silver nanoparticles.

B4. Gut
A number of studies have looked at the impact of silver nanoparticles on intestinal cells, some of which
have attempted to account for the likely effects of digestion or have used synthetic drinking-water as a
medium for silver nanoparticles, rather than cell culture medium, to try and more closely simulate in
vivo conditions.

Bouwmeester et al. (2011) used an in vitro model of the human intestinal epithelium (consisting of
Caco-2 and M-cells) to study the passage of four different preparations of silver nanoparticles (nominal
sizes 20, 34, 61 and 113 nm) and silver ions (from silver nitrate). Concentrations of silver nanoparticles
of up to 50 µg/mL (irrespective of size) reduced metabolic activity in the Caco-2 cells by less than 20%,
while a concentration of 5 µg/mL silver nitrate resulted in a 70% reduction in metabolic activity.
Translocation of silver derived from either silver nanoparticle suspensions or silver nitrate was clearly


                                                   173
                                                           Part III- Silver as a drinking-water disinfectant


shown and the authors speculate that the translocation of silver is likely to be in the ionic and not the
particulate form.

Walczak et al. (2013) studied the likely impact of digestion on 60 nm silver nanoparticles (citrate) and
silver ions (silver nitrate). The model comprised artificial saliva, gastric, duodenal and bile juice,
simulating digestion in the oral, gastric and intestinal compartments with salt and protein composition,
pH differences, and transit times similar to human in vivo digestion. The silver nanoparticles, in the
presence of proteins, were found to survive gastric digestion and reach the intestine where they were
present in large clusters and co-localized with chlorine. The chlorine was thought to be involved in
connecting separate silver nanoparticles inside clusters with “chlorine inter-particle bridges”. Following
intestinal digestion, the silver nanoparticles were found to be present in, essentially, their original form.
Silver ions were also found to reach the intestine, but they were generally present as complexes of silver,
sulfur and chlorine (20–30 nm in size). The authors suggest that ingestion of silver nanoparticles and
silver ions results in intestinal exposure to nanoparticles, albeit with different chemical compositions.
Böhmert et al. (2014) conducted some similar work, subjecting silver nanoparticles to simulated
digestion (both Böhmert et al., (2014) and Walczak et al., (2013) based their digestion model on the
method described by Versantvoort et al., 2005) but then examined their toxicity to Caco-2 cells. Cells
were exposed to primary and digested particles as well as a digestion fluids mixture without silver
nanoparticles to act as a control. It was found that silver nanoparticles seemed to overcome
gastrointestinal juices in their particulate form, without forming large quantities of aggregates, and there
seemed to be only a slight reduction in their cytotoxic potential following digestion. This work has been
extended by also including the main food components (i.e. carbohydrates, proteins and fatty acids) in
the in vitro digestion process to further simulate realistic conditions (Lichtenstein et al., 2015). The
uptake and cytotoxicity of digested and undigested polyacrylic acid-coated silver nanoparticles were
investigated in Caco-2 cells. Silver nanoparticles digested with simulated food had a similar cellular
uptake to undigested ones. However, silver nanoparticles digested in the absence of food simulants had
a considerably lower cellular uptake, leading the authors to suggest that without the use of food
components during in vitro digestion, uptake may be under estimated. Hsin et al. (2008) looked at the
impact of two different commercially available preparations of silver nanoparticles (1 and 100 nm) on
human colon cells (HCT116). One preparation (Ching-Tai) was found to result in significant decreases
in cell viability after 24 hours at 50 µg/mL, while the other (Sun-Lan) at the same concentration did not
result in significant cytotoxicity even after 72 hours. Compared to the other cells examined (mouse
fibroblasts – NIH3T3 and rat vascular smooth muscle cells – A10), HCT116 cells were relatively
insensitive to silver nanoparticles.

Gaiser et al. (2009) looked at the potential human exposure to silver nanoparticles via ingestion of
contaminated food sources. They looked at both bare silver nanoparticles (35 nm) and “bulk” silver
(0.6–1.6 µm) on secondary intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) and human hepatocytes (C3A).
Cytotoxicity was only assessed on the hepatocytes, with silver nanoparticles being more cytotoxic
(LDH assay) than bulk silver. Both silver nanoparticles and silver were, however, shown to be taken up
by Caco-2 cells.

The impact of silver nanoparticles (18 nm) on gene expression in HT29 cells (and human kidney cells
– see below) was explored by Gopinath et al. (2010). A concentration of 11 µg/mL (less than half of
the concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% – Gopinath et al., 2008) resulted in changes in
cell morphology and caused an 11% increase in early apoptotic population, 21% increase in late
apoptotic population, and a 7% increase in necrotic population. Exposure to silver nanoparticles resulted
in an up-regulation of apoptotic genes and a down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes.

                                                    174

Kruszewski et al. (2013) looked at the impact of bare 20 nm and 200 nm silver nanoparticles on liver
(HepG2), lung (A549) and gut (HT29) cells in terms of DNA damage and colony forming ability. They
found a substantial difference in the cell uptake of silver nanoparticles, with uptake by the gut cells
being markedly lower than the other cell lines. The authors suggest that this might be due to the
production of mucin by HT29 cells which prevents nanoparticle uptake. The cellular uptake of silver
nanoparticles was found to correspond to the formation of ROS and the subsequent pattern of DNA
breakage and base damage induction was found to correspond to intracellular ROS formation.

Abbott Chalew & Schwab (2013) looked at the cytotoxic effects of uncoated silver nanoparticles (20–
30 nm) on Caco-2 and SW480 intestinal cells. The silver nanoparticles were not found to be particularly
toxic to the intestinal cells when dispersed in cell culture medium (with LC50 values for the two cell
lines greater than 100 mg/L). Far greater cytotoxicity was seen for SW480 when the cells were exposed
to silver nanoparticles in buffered synthetic water, with a significant drop in viability seen after exposure
to 1 mg/L. The authors suggest that the lower toxicity in silver nanoparticles in cell culture media may
be due to the stabilizing effect of foetal bovine serum in the cell culture medium.

Giovanni et al. (2015) looked at a wide range of silver nanoparticles concentrations and their impact on
selected human cell models representative of tissues in oral and gastrointestinal systems (TR146 –
buccal epithelial cells and NCN460 – colon mucosal epithelial cells). After 24 hours incubation, very
little cytotoxicity was seen in either cell type at silver nanoparticle levels of 100 µg/mL.

B5. Kidney
A number of different kidney cell types have been subjected to silver, these include embryo kidney
cells, which are a heterogeneous mix of almost all the types of cells present in the body (although most
are endothelial, epithelial or fibroblasts), proximal tubule cells (HK 2) and renal epithelial cells (A498).

Hudecová et al. (2012) exposed human embryo kidney cells (HEK293) to 20 nm silver nanoparticles.
Although there was clear agglomeration of the particles, the silver nanoparticles were still taken up by
the cells and could be identified in vacuoles and cytoplasm. No cytotoxicity was reported after exposure
of the cells to 100 µg/mL for 30 minutes (based on Trypan Blue exclusion), although there was a 48%
reduction in proliferation activity and a 21% reduction in colony number at that concentration. No
cytotoxicity (in any of the employed tests) was seen at concentrations up to 25 µg/mL, although DNA
damage could be detected even after exposure to 1 µg/mL silver nanoparticles. Singh and Ramarao
(2012) found that renal epithelial cells (A498) were sensitive to 44 nm silver nanoparticles, with a
significant reduction in viability (MTT and Coomassie Blue assay) at 1 µg/mL. This group looked at
five different cell lines; the kidney cells were the most sensitive. Kermanizadeh et al. (2013) looked at
the impacts of a variety of nanomaterials on renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. The silver
nanoparticles (< 20 nm, capped with polyoxylaurat Tween) were one of the more toxic nanomaterials
examined, with an LC50 of between 4.5–10 µg/cm2 (depending on the cell culture medium used). Silver
nanoparticle exposure resulted in a significant increase in ROS, interleukins 6 and 8 and evidence of
DNA damage. Ionic silver has also been found to be toxic; with Simmons et al. (2011) reporting that
silver chloride caused an increase in the oxidative stress response in four out of five cell lines examined,
including kidney cells – HEK293T.

Gopinath et al. (2010) used baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) to investigate the impact of 18 nm
silver nanoparticles on primary cells. Cells exposed to 11 µg/mL (a concentration below the IC50 value)
showed altered morphology and a 9% increase in the early apoptotic population compared to control

cells. An examination of gene expression showed that silver nanoparticles induced the p53-mediated
apoptotic pathway.

B6. Blood
The toxic effects of silver on blood have been studied by a number of groups, using a variety of different
methodologies. Foldbjerg et al. (2009) looked at the toxicity of PVP-coated silver nanoparticles (69
nm) and silver ions (from silver nitrate) on the human monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). Cells
were exposed for up to 24 hours: it was found that both silver nanoparticles and ionic silver induced
apoptosis and necrosis (depending upon the dose and exposure time) and caused increased ROS levels
after six hours. In the cytotoxicity test (Annexin V/PI) silver ions were found to be four times more
toxic than silver nanoparticles (EC50 of 0.62 µg/mL ionic silver compared to 2.44 µg silver
nanoparticles/mL). Haase et al. (2012b) also looked at the toxicity of silver nanoparticles on THP-1
cells. They used two peptide coated silver nanoparticles (20 nm and 40 nm) and found that while both
silver nanoparticles were toxic to the monocytes, the 20 nm silver nanoparticles were more toxic. The
toxic effect was found to increase with time, thus, the IC50 for 20 nm silver nanoparticles at 24 hours
was 110 µg/mL, compared to 18 µg/mL at 48 hours.

Jun et al. (2011) looked at the effect of silver nanoparticles on platelet aggregation. The group used
washed platelets from humans as an in vitro test and rats as an in vivo test. In platelets, the silver
nanoparticles (< 100 nm) were found to induce platelet aggregation:
    •   control–5.4% aggregation;
    •   100 µg silver nanoparticles/mL–28% aggregation; and
    •   250 µg silver nanoparticles/mL–54% aggregation.

The aggregation was potentiated by co-treatment with a sub-threshold concentration of thrombin.
Consistent with the human platelet studies, in vivo exposure of rats to silver nanoparticles (0.05–0.1
mg/kg by intravenous administration or 5–10 mg/kg by intratrachael instillation) enhanced venous
thrombus formation and platelet aggregation. The authors suggest that silver nanoparticles may increase
the prothrombotic risk in susceptible patients with compounding cardiovascular diseases.

Choi et al. (2011) used heparinized human blood to look at the impact of silver on haemolysis. They
used four different silver preparations (two nano and two micron sized particles). Both silver
nanoparticle preparations (citrate stabilized and bare particles) were significantly more haemolytic than
the micron sized particles (of equivalent mass concentration). The haemolysis was related to the release
of silver ions (with the silver nanoparticles releasing considerably more than the micron preparations).

Silver nitrate at various concentrations (up to 33 µM) was added to human whole blood and levels of
GSH measured at time intervals (Khan et al., 2011). The GSH level was found to decrease in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner in both the plasma and cytosolic fraction, with the depletion
suggesting that the silver nitrate penetrated the blood cells and resulted in oxidation of the reduced
glutathione or the formation of a silver-glutathione complex.

Barkhordari et al. (2014) explored the impact of naked silver nanoparticles (1–1500 µg/mL) on human
blood mononuclear cells. MTT assays were conducted after 6 or 24 hours incubation. The percentage
cell death was higher after 24 hours than 6 hours, and all concentrations of silver nanoparticles resulted
in significantly more cell death than in the control cells. The greatest impact seemed to be at 500 µg/mL,



                                                   176

although the authors do not report whether the differences between the cells incubated with 500 µg/mL
silver nanoparticles and the higher concentrations are statistically significant.

Wang et al. (2013) used mouse erythroleukemia cells to study the impact of a range of PVP-coated
silver nanoparticles (10, 25, 40, 45 and 110 nm) on mRNA transcription. At 1 µg/mL (a non-cytotoxic
dose) a large reduction in alpha- and beta-globin was seen. The shape of the silver nanoparticles seemed
to be important as the spherical silver nanoparticles showed a greater impact on globin expression
compared to the plate form; it was speculated that spherical silver nanoparticles may have a greater
capability to cross the plasma membrane. Small spherical silver nanoparticles (10, 25 nm) showed a
greater inhibition of globin expression than the larger particles. The group demonstrated that silver
nanoparticles caused a significant suppression of RNA polymerase activity and overall RNA
transcription through direct silver binding to RNA polymerase.

B7. Skin
Most researchers have used cell lines (keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and skin epithelial cells) to look
at the potential toxicity of skin application of silver, but the potential for skin penetration of silver
nanoparticles has also been investigated using an in vitro system.

B7.1 Skin penetration
Larese et al. (2009) looked at the penetration of silver nanoparticles through human skin using an in
vitro test system that utilised abdominal full thickness skin obtained as surgical waste. Skin was
essentially bathed in silver nanoparticles (25 nm in size, dispersed in ethanol and diluted with synthetic
sweat) for 24 hours. The experiments were conducted using both intact and abraded skin. Low, but
detectable, silver nanoparticle absorption through intact skin was seen. As might be expected,
penetration through damaged skin was five times greater than that through intact skin. Silver
nanoparticles could be seen (using transmission electron microscopy) in the stratum corneum and upper
layers of the epidermis.

B7.2 Skin cells
Arora et al. (2008) used secondary human skin epithelial cells (A431) to study cellular responses
induced by spherical silver nanoparticles (7–20 nm). As the IC50 (XTT assay) was 11.6 µg/mL, cells
were subsequently exposed to a dose roughly half of that value. At 6.25 µg/mL, cellular morphology
was unchanged, but there were clear signs of oxidative stress, namely decreased GSH (~ 2 fold),
decreased SOD (~ 3 fold) and increased lipid peroxidation (~ 2 fold). Comfort et al. (2011) also found
indicators of oxidative stress in A431 cells after exposure to low levels of silver nanoparticles (10 nm).
In addition to inducing high quantities of ROS, silver nanoparticles caused a disruption in the epidermal
growth factor signalling response.

Cortese-Krott (2009) treated primary human skin fibroblasts with low levels of silver nitrate (below
that impacting on proliferation, mitochondrial activity or cell viability) and found that subtoxic
concentrations (5–10 µM) strongly increased the intracellular production of ROS (including superoxide
anion radicals) and impacted on intracellular zinc homeostasis.

Samberg et al. (2010) looked at the cytotoxicity of bare silver nanoparticles (20, 50 and 80 nm) and
carbon-coated silver nanoparticles (50 and 80 nm) to primary neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes.
If silver nanoparticles were applied to the keratinocytes unwashed, a 24-hour exposure resulted in a
significant dose-dependent decrease in viability. However, application of the carbon-coated silver


                                                   177

nanoparticles or washed silver nanoparticles did not cause a decrease in cell viability, suggesting that
the toxicity seen in the unwashed silver nanoparticles is a result of residual contamination from the
silver nanoparticle synthesis (in this case formaldehyde). Although washed silver nanoparticles did not
result a decrease in viability, they were taken up and were found to be internalized into the membrane-
bound vacuoles in the keratinocytes.

Zanette et al. (2011) found that PVP-coated silver nanoparticles (25–50 nm) caused a concentration-
and time-dependent decrease in cell viability (based on mitochondrial function) in HaCaT cells at
concentrations of 11 µg/mL and greater. A long-lasting inhibition in cell proliferation was seen as cell
proliferation was still showing a concentration-dependent decrease 6 days after the silver nanoparticles
had been washed out of the system.

Comparative silver nanoparticle (~ 65 nm) cytotoxicity tests using HaCaT and cervical cancer cells
(HeLa) were conducted by Mukherjee et al. (2012). They used a wide range of cytotoxicity tests and
found that, in both cell lines, a measure of mitochondrial function (MTT assay) was the most sensitive
test (HaCaT LD50 at 24 hours of 51.8 mg/L). After 24 hours, the LD50 values for the MTT test for both
cell types were similar. After 48 and 72 hours, however, HeLa cells were found to be much more
sensitive (LD50 after 72 hours for HaCaT of 30.4 mg/L compared to HeLa of 0.04 mg/L). The authors
note that a major difference between the two cell types is their natural antioxidant levels, with HaCaT
having over 30 times more glutathione than HeLa; this could be an important factor in the different
sensitivity to silver nanoparticles.

Srivastava et al. (2012) investigated the impact of silver nanoparticles (size unstated) and silver ions
(silver sulfate) on selenium metabolism in keratinocytes (HaCaT). They found that, while there was no
clear cytotoxic effect of silver nanoparticle (up to 10 µM) or silver sulfate (up to 1000 nM) exposure
on the keratinocytes, silver nanoparticles and ionic silver led to a dose-dependent inhibition of selenium
metabolism. The authors commented that the decrease in selenoprotein synthesis could have significant
implications in the defence against oxidative stress in the event of long-term exposures.

B8. Macrophages
Macrophages constitute the first line of defence upon uptake of silver nanoparticles by humans and
other mammals (Pratsinis et al., 2013). Macrophages function in both nonspecific defence (innate
immunity) as well as helping to initiate specific defence mechanisms (adaptive immunity).

Shavandi et al. (2011) looked at the cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (18–34 nm) to murine peritoneal
macrophages using an assessment of mitochondrial activity (MTT assay). A significant decrease in
viability was seen at concentrations of 1 ppm and above after 24 hours of exposure. Significant
reductions in NO production were seen at 0.4 ppm silver nanoparticles. Park et al. (2010) also used
murine peritoneal macrophages (RAW 264.7) to examine the impact of silver nanoparticles. Silver
nanoparticles with an average size of ~70 nm were dispersed in foetal bovine serum and cells were
exposed for up to 96 hours to concentrations between 0.2 to 1.6 ppm. Cell viability (MTT assay)
decreased in a concentration and time-dependent manner, with the lowest concentration causing
significant cytotoxicity after 96 hours. The silver nanoparticles also significantly reduced levels of
intracellular GSH at concentrations of 0.4 ppm and above. In contrast to Shavandi et al. (2011), Park
and colleagues found that NO was significantly increased. Park et al. (2010) reported that silver
nanoparticles were ingested by phagocytosis, but that they were not observed in the dead cells,
suggesting that the particles were released back into the culture medium by the damaged cells where
they were available for further biological responses.

Four different silver nanoparticles with a similar size (< 10 nm) and shape (spherical), but different
coatings and surface charge were tested against two cells lines: mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) and
mouse lung epithelial cells. The same pattern of toxicity was seen in both cell lines with, essentially,
the silver nanoparticles with the greater positive surface charge being more toxic. The macrophage cells
were more sensitive to the silver nanoparticles than the lung epithelial cells (Suresh et al., 2012). Singh
and Ramarao (2012) also found that RAW 264.7 macrophages were highly sensitive to silver
nanoparticle (44 nm) toxicity, with a significant reduction in cell viability (MTT assay) seen after 72
hours exposure to 3 µg/mL. Of the six cell lines examined only renal epithelial cells (A498) were more
sensitive. Interestingly, J774.1 macrophages were one of the more resistant cells line (significant
cytotoxicity was seen at 30 µg/mL).

Pratsinis et al. (2013) synthesized uncoated silver nanoparticles (6 to 20 nm) supported on inert
nanostructured silica and looked at the impact of silver ion release on the viability of murine
macrophages (RAW 264.7). Small silver nanoparticles (< 10 nm) released or leached larger fractions
of their mass as ionic silver upon dispersion in water and this strongly influenced the cytotoxicity.

B9. Reproductive system
Tiedemann et al. (2014) assessed the impact of silver (silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate) on porcine
gametes. The 11 nm bovine serum albumin coated silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate led to a
significant decrease in oocyte maturation or complete arrest of maturation respectively. The silver was
found to accumulate mainly in the cumulus cell layer surrounding the oocyte. None of the sperm vitality
parameters assessed (motility, membrane integrity and morphology) were significantly affected by
silver.

Zhang et al. (2015) exposed male mouse somatic Leydig (TM3) and Sertoli (TM4) cells to two different
sizes of silver nanoparticles (10 nm and 20 nm) and examined effects on cell viability, metabolic
activity, oxidative stress and apoptosis. TM3 and TM4 cells which had been exposed to silver
nanoparticles for 24 hours were then used as feeder cells for spermatogonial stem cells and the impact
on gene expression examined. The silver nanoparticles inhibited the viability and proliferation of both
TM3 and TM4 cells by damaging cell membranes and inducing the generation of ROS. The 10 nm
silver nanoparticles were found to be more cytotoxic than the 20 nm silver nanoparticles. Silver
nanoparticle exposure was found to significantly down-regulate the expression of genes related to
testosterone synthesis (TM3) and tight junctions (TM4). In addition, exposure of the TM3 and TM4
cells to silver nanoparticles inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells.

B 10. Genotoxicity
A total of 19 in vitro studies are outlined in Table B1, of these the majority (14) used human cells
including stem cells, bronchial epithelial cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and keratinocytes. A range of
different silver nanoparticles were examined including naked particles and also those stabilized with
citrate, bovine serum albumin, PVP, polyethylenimine, polyoxylaurat tween and polyetherimide; 2
studies (Jiang et al., 2013 and Milić et al., 2015) also looked at silver nitrate in parallel to silver
nanoparticles.

The comet assay was the most frequently employed test (14 of 19 studies) and, in each case, suggested
that silver nanoparticles can cause DNA damage. The lowest concentration at which DNA damage was
seen was 0.01 µg/mL following exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to 59 nm naked silver
nanoparticles (Kim HR et al., 2011) and exposure of hamster ovary cells to 40–59 nm naked silver


                                                   179

nanoparticles (Kim HR et al., 2013). As with the in vivo results, there is a suggestion that sensitivity to
the genotoxic effects of silver nanoparticles is cell specific (e.g. Tomankova et al., 2015). Castiglioni
et al. (2014), however, found that the DNA damage in human microvascular endothelial cells exposed
to 35 nm naked silver nanoparticles was reversible (when silver nanoparticles were removed from the
culture medium) suggesting, in this case, that no permanent modifications occurred. In line with other
(non-genotoxicity) studies, cells seem to be more sensitive to smaller silver nanoparticles (e.g. Avalos
et al., 2015).

The micronucleus assay was used in 7 of the studies and was found to result in increased micronuclei
in six cases. Nymark et al. (2013) reported no increase in micronucleus formation after exposure of
human bronchial epithelial cells to 42 nm PVP silver nanoparticles (although positive results were
reported for the comet assay). Vecchio et al. (2014) found that silver nanoparticle-induced genotoxicity,
measured using the micronucleus assay, was dependent on lymphocyte sub-type and was particularly
pronounced in CD2+ and CD4+ cells.

Only three studies used the chromosome aberration test. Chromosome damage was reported in a single
study, where chromatid deletions and exchanges were significantly elevated following exposure of
mesenchymal stem cells to 46 nm bovine serum albumin silver nanoparticles (Hackenberg et al., 2011).

One study used a gene mutation assay. Huk et al. (2015) looked at silver nanoparticles, with different
surface coatings, using the HPRT gene mutation test in hamster lung fibroblast cells (V79-4). All the
tested silver nanoparticles induced HPRT gene mutation, but it was shown that the stabilizing agent
could play a significant role in the degree of reported toxicity, with sodium citrate and Tween being
found to be mutagenic in their own right.
