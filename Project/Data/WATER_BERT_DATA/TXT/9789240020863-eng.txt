Lead is recognized as a chemical of major public health concern. There is a need to decrease human exposure to all sources of lead
in the environment, including in drinking-water.

Lead should be included in national drinking-water quality standards and monitored as part of a drinking-water quality
surveillance programme.

The primary source of lead in drinking-water is leaching from lead-containing materials in water systems, including plumbing
in buildings (e.g. homes, childcare facilities, schools) and hand pump components. These materials can be made of lead, lead-containing
metal alloys, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) with lead stabilizers. Other exogenous sources include
pollution or leaching from lead-containing bedrock.

Prevention is the most effective action. For materials in contact with water, only low-lead or lead-free water system parts should be
used when constructing new water systems or rehabilitating old ones. Programmes should be developed to support the adoption of standards,
including appropriate procurement and installation of parts. Compliance with these standards should be monitored to minimize and ideally
prevent the introduction of lead into new water systems.

Elevated lead levels in drinking-water should trigger a systematic investigation to understand exposure and contamination
sources, and to inform remedial actions. Where elevated lead levels in drinking-water are confirmed, remedial actions should be taken to
progressively reduce lead concentrations to levels as low as reasonably achievable and ideally to below the World Health Organization
provisional guideline value of 10 μg/L.

Actions should take into consideration that lead concentrations in drinking-water can vary over time. Because of this
variability, a probability-based adaptive sampling plan should be used to assess exposure. If prior knowledge exists about possible lead
sources, sampling and actions can be directed towards these sources.

Cooperation and coordination are critical, including with drinking-water suppliers, agencies responsible for overseeing drinking-water
safety and agencies responsible for broader public health. Cooperation and coordination are needed to communicate about issues relating to
lead in drinking-water and to understand the broader public health significance of lead in drinking-water. This understanding is appropriate
to inform investment decisions and communications with the public.

Remedial actions may include a combination of interim and long-term measures. Interim measures include alternative sources
of safe water for vulnerable groups, certified lead removal units at points of consumption (e.g. at the customer tap), flushing at the tap or
hand pump, or corrosion control. Longer-term measures include replacing materials in contact with drinking-water. Shutting down water
supplies is generally considered an inappropriate response.

Actions should be prioritized to areas where exposures or risks are high. Remedial actions should ideally be implemented first
in settings with the highest lead concentrations in drinking-water, particularly focusing on infants, children and pregnant individuals.

Lead in drinking-water should be considered as part of broader efforts to improve the safety of drinking-water and public
health. Reducing any exposure to lead supports health protection efforts. However, reducing lead in drinking-water should also be part of
an overall programme to reduce microbial and other priority chemical risks from drinking-water systems.

Introduction
Lead is recognized as a chemical of major public health concern that should be included in national drinking-
water quality standards and monitored as part of a drinking-water quality surveillance programme. Lead
concentrations in drinking-water should be kept as low as reasonably achievable.

     BOX 1
     Understanding the WHO drinking-water guideline value
     Since 1993, the guideline value for lead in the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality has been 10 µg/L. In 2011, this health-based guideline
     value was changed to a provisional value to reflect treatment achievability, recognizing that it is difficult to achieve lower than 10 µg/L with central
     treatment. Previously, the guideline value was supported by the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for infants and children established by
     the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). In 2010, the PTWI was
     withdrawn because JEFCA concluded that it was no longer considered health-protective and that there is no apparent health-based threshold for
     lead (i.e. no safe level of lead). At this time, JECFA reaffirmed that fetuses, infants and children are the population groups most sensitive to lead, with
     neurodevelopment effects still considered the key end-point. However, uncertainties remain in the epidemiology of lead exposure, associated with
     very low blood lead levels, and end-points (e.g. neurodevelopmental effects) that are affected by many other factors. Nevertheless, every effort
     should be made to maintain lead levels in drinking-water as low as reasonably practical and below the guideline value when resources are available.

     Although the guideline value of 10 µg/L has been in place since 1993, many authorities had standards that were higher than this until recently. For
     example, in the European Union (EU), the decrease in the lead limit in drinking-water from 50 to 10 μg/L in 2011 (SCHER, 2011) was approached by
     setting an interim limit of 25 μg/L (Postawa, 2015) for 5–15 years after the EU drinking-water directive took effect. Setting an interim limit allowed
     water suppliers sufficient time to implement the necessary actions, recognizing the practical difficulties and time required to achieve the stricter
     standard in many countries.1

     Accordingly, exceeding the WHO provisional guideline value of 10 µg/L does not necessarily constitute an emergency unless concentrations are
     continuously very high (e.g. over 100 µg/L). Where concentrations are high and vulnerable groups (fetuses, infants and children) are exposed, interim
     remedial actions should be considered – for example, flushing if the source is suspected to be in the plumbing system or use of an alternative safe
     drinking-water supply if the water source is contaminated.

    In 2021, a new EU drinking-water directive lowered the limit further to 5 μg/L, which must be met by 12 January 2036 at the latest. This is in line with legislation in several other
    countries. The parametric value for lead until that date is 10 μg/L. However, caution is needed when comparing limits because interpretation should be informed by the sampling
    regime, which may or may not be specified in the regulation.

                                                                                                                                                                                            3
What to do if elevated lead levels are
detected in drinking-water
Elevated lead levels in drinking-water above the WHO guideline value or national standard should trigger
a systematic investigation of exposure and the contamination source. Remedial actions, informed by
investigations on source contamination, should be taken if elevated lead levels in drinking-water are
confirmed.

Since lead concentrations in a water system can be highly variable and, therefore, highly dependent on the
sampling strategy, an understanding of what the results represent is gained through further, structured
sampling. Rarely should remedial actions be taken based on only a few samples.

6            Lead in drinking-water: health risks, monitoring and corrective actions
   BOX 2
   Example of a sampling strategy for lead contamination in China, Hong Kong Special
   Administrative Region (SAR)
   After lead in drinking-water was initially identified in Hong Kong SAR in 2015 as a potential issue, the need to undertake sampling to cover large
   areas including households was identified. To increase efficiency, authorities used a combination of different protocols, taking a tiered approach.

   Tier 1
   The first tier consisted of a single screening sample using random daytime (RDT) sampling. A 1 L unflushed sample was randomly taken during the
   daytime.

   Tier 2
   The second-tier sample provided better representation of an individual’s potential exposure to lead. A 30-minute stagnation (30MS) sampling was
   used. If exceedance was found in the Tier 1 sample, the Tier 2 sample was analysed to verify exposure of consumers to lead. The tap was flushed for 5
   minutes and then stagnated for 30 minutes. After stagnation, a 1 L unflushed sample was taken at the tap.

   Simultaneous sampling for exposure and the source of lead
   While collecting the Tier 1 and Tier 2 samples, auxiliary samples were also taken simultaneously, which were only tested to provide supplementary
   information if exceedance was found in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 samples. A number of 1 L sequential samples (generally 2–6) were taken from taps at
   the premises for assessing whether the problem was confined to the premises or not. In addition, a 2-minute flushed sample was taken to confirm
   the applicability of flushing advice provided to consumers as a mitigation measure in case of exceedance. The approach meant that all samples from
   one apartment could be collected for analysis on one occasion by professional samplers.

   The investigation determined that the soldered joints in the copper piping installed in a limited number of buildings were the dominant lead source
   in the drinking-water, with brass fixtures and fittings identified as a second potential source.

              Investigate the source of
              lead


The primary source of lead in drinking-water is leaching from lead-containing materials in water systems, including
service pipes, plumbing in homes (see Fig. 2) and other buildings, and components in well parts and hand pumps
(see Fig. 3). These materials can be made of lead, lead-containing metal alloys, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or
unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) with lead stabilizers. Exogenous sources may be pollution or bedrock.

Suggested co-parameters to analyse when sampling water to investigate the source of lead in drinking-water

 Parameter                     Rationale                                                                                                           Relevancy
 Alkalinity, pH and            Combinations of low alkalinity and low pH, or low–moderate pH and high DIC favour the release of
 dissolved inorganic           lead into water from solids. High pH and low DIC, respectively and in combination, reduce the

 Cadmium, iron, zinc,          Lead, cadmium and iron are correlated with zinc when galvanized iron is the source of lead (Clark,
 aluminium, copper,            Masters & Edwards, 2015). Aluminium and iron coagulant residuals can mobilise lead from premise

                               Zinc, and in some cases copper and nickel, is associated with brass corrosion (Korshin, Ferguson &
                               Lancaster, 2000; Asami et al., 2021). Some studies have shown a gradual decrease in zinc leaching over
                               time, which affects its value as an indicator of brass corrosion (Langenegger, 1994; Chao et al., 2021).
 Chlorine and chloramine       Concentration changes of chlorine and chloramine (used as disinfectants) can affect lead
                               concentrations.
                               The presence of free chlorine decreases dissolved lead by oxidizing it into a highly insoluble Pb(IV)
                               oxide (PbO2) (Triantafyllidou et al., 2015).
                               Monochloramine is not a strong enough oxidant to form PbO2, and thus a switch to this oxidant
                               destabilizes any PbO2 scales present and results in lead release into drinking-water.
 Chloride:sulfate ratio        Galvanic corrosion is favoured by a chloride:sulfate ratio higher than 0.58 (Nguyen et al., 2011;
                               Triantafyllidou & Edwards, 2011).
                               The chloride and sulfate content in water can change if coagulants are changed from sulfate-based
                               coagulants to chloride-based coagulants, or vice versa. The chloride concentration might change in

                               NOM, iron and manganese can act as reductants that can accelerate the dissolution of PbO2 scales in
                               piped supplies with excess chlorine.

Note: When analysing water for the purpose of corrosion control, additional parameters such as corrosion inhibitors, aluminium, hardness, buffer capacity and redox
potential might also be useful.

How to take action

The issue of lead in drinking-water requires action from multiple stakeholders. Below are some recommended actions that key stakeholders can
take to reduce exposure to lead from drinking-water. Depending on the institutional framework, responsibilities might be divided differently

Annex 1
Analysing water samples for lead
Since the provisional guideline value for lead of 10 µg/L is not a health-based value, the limit of detection (LOD) or limit of quantification
(LOQ) should be the lowest achievable. Several laboratory- and field-based methods have detection limits lower than 1 µg/L. Double or
triplicate samples should always be taken to quantify uncertainty, regardless of the chosen method. However, it should be kept in mind that
lead distributes unevenly in water, resulting in large differences in concentrations between samples (Deshommes et al., 2010; Chan et al.,
2020). Since a significant proportion of lead can be adsorbed to colloids, filtration using a 0.45 µm filter to target dissolved lead will not be
effective because colloids can pass through (Locsin et al., 2022).

In addition to approved methods using laboratory instruments in certified laboratories by skilled technicians, portable field analysers with
adequately low detection limits are becoming increasingly available commercially (Table 2). Field analysers should be validated against
reference methods. As well, they only measure dissolved lead; particulate lead is excluded.

Analysis in a laboratory (Table 3) generally means less uncertainty than use of field analysers because it is easier to keep surfaces and equipment
clean in the laboratory, avoiding contamination of samples. The increased precision often comes at a cost because trained laboratory staff
and costly equipment are required.
