vi   Guide to ship sanitation
Foreword

Historically, ships have played a significant role in the global transmission
of infectious disease. Some of the earliest recorded evidence of attempts
to control human disease transmission via ships dates to the 14th
century, when ports denied access to ships suspected of carrying
the plague. In the 19th century, the spread of cholera pandemics was
thought to have been facilitated by merchant shipping. A World Health
Organization (WHO) review identified more than 100 disease outbreaks
associated with ships between 1970 and 2003 (Rooney et al., 2004).
Today’s world fleet of propelled seagoing merchant ships of more than
100 billion tonnes comprises 99 741 ships, with an average age of
22 years, registered in more than 150 nations and crewed by more than
a million seafarers of virtually every nationality (IHS Fairplay, 2010).
World seaborne trade figures suggest that the amount of goods loaded on
ships has increased considerably in recent decades; in 2007, it reached
7.3 billion tonnes, a volume increase of 4.8% over the previous year
(United Nations, 2008). During the three decades to 2008, the annual
average growth rate of world seaborne trade was estimated at 3.1%
(United Nations, 2008). The shipping industry also supports tourism
and recreation. American cruise ships alone carried 13.4 million people
during 2009, for an average period of 7.3 days per person, a passenger
number increase averaging 4.7% per year over the preceding four years
(Cruise Lines International Association, 2010). Naval ships also carry
considerable numbers of crew, sometimes more than 5000 per ship.
Ferries are ubiquitous around the world in port cities and at some river
crossings and are used by many people on a daily basis.
Because of the international nature of ship transport, international
regulations relating to sanitary aspects of ship transport have been in
place for more than half a century. The International Sanitary Regulations
of 1951 were replaced by the International Health Regulations (IHR)
adopted by WHO in 1969. The IHR were revised at the Fifty-eighth
World Health Assembly in 2005.
The WHO Guide to ship sanitation has become the official WHO global
reference on health requirements for ship construction and operation.
Its original purpose was to standardize the sanitary measures taken in
ships, to safeguard the health of travellers and workers and to prevent
the spread of infection from one country to another. Today, however,
given the number of specific guidance documents, conventions and
regulations currently available that provide full accounts of the design


                                                                           vii
and operational detail relating to ships, the primary aim of the guide is
to present the public health significance of ships in terms of disease and
to highlight the importance of applying appropriate control measures.
The guide was first published in 1967 and amended in 1987. This revised
third edition of the guide has been prepared to reflect the changes in
construction, design and size of ships since the 1960s and the existence
of new diseases (e.g. legionellosis) that were not foreseen when the
1967 guide was published.
The guide has been developed through an iterative series of drafting
and peer-review steps. In revising the guide, expert meetings were held
in Miami, United States of America (USA), on 3–4 October 2001 and in
Vancouver, Canada, on 8–10 October 2002 to discuss and recommend
the proposed contents. Expert meetings to review the draft guide were
held on 25 October 2007 in Montreal, Canada, and on 12–13 October
2009 in Lyon, France. Participants represented cruise ship operators,
seafarer associations, collaborating member states for the IHR 2005,
port state control, port health authorities and other regulatory
agencies. A complete list of contributors to the guide can be found in the
Acknowledgements section.
The Guide to ship sanitation and the International medical guide for ships
(WHO, 2007) are companion volumes oriented towards preventive
health and curative health, respectively, on board ships.

The preparation of this third edition of the Guide to ship sanitation
involved the participation of many experts from diverse developing and
developed countries.
The work was facilitated greatly by the existence of prior editions and by
a systematic review of outbreaks on board ships prepared by Dr Roisin
Rooney, WHO, Geneva, which was previously published by WHO (2001).
The international branch of the National Sanitation Foundation, Ann
Arbor, USA, seconded a staff member to WHO Geneva whose main line
of activity was the initial development of this guide.

1 Introduction

1.1    Significance of ships to health
Ships can have significance to public health beyond their role in ship-
acquired infection. For example, ships can transport infected humans
and other vectors, such as mosquitoes and rats, between ports and can
therefore act as a means of national and international dissemination of
disease and disease agents.
Historically, ships have played an important role in transmitting
infectious diseases around the world. The spread of cholera pandemics
in the 19th century was thought to be linked to trade routes and
facilitated by merchant shipping. Efforts to control the movement of
human disease on ships can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when,
in 1377, Venice and Rhodes denied access to ships carrying passengers
infected with the plague, giving rise to the term “quarantine”. On arrival,
travellers were detained in isolation for 40 days before they were
allowed to proceed to their final destination. Overcrowding on ships,
filth and lack of personal hygiene were often associated with epidemics
of rickettsial typhus fever. Preventive measures, such as quarantine,
delousing and maintaining personal cleanliness by use of soap, were
gradually adopted, and the incidence of typhus decreased.
More than 100 outbreaks of infectious diseases associated with ships
were reported between 1970 and 2003 (Rooney et al., 2004). Reported
outbreaks included legionellosis, influenza, typhoid fever, salmonellosis,
viral gastroenteritis (e.g. norovirus), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
infection, shigellosis, cryptosporidiosis and trichinosis. Naval ships,
cargo ships, ferries and cruise ships were all affected, often with serious
operational and financial consequences.
These reported outbreaks represent just a small proportion of the total
disease burden attributable to ship-acquired disease. For every notified
and reported case listed in outbreak reports, there are likely to be many
more cases that go unreported.
If proper control measures are not in place, ships are particularly
prone to disease outbreaks. Ships contain isolated communities with
close accommodations, shared sanitary facilities and common food
and water supplies. Such conditions can be favourable to the spread
of infectious diseases. The inevitable publicity that comes along with a




                                                                          1
disease outbreak on board can have a serious financial impact on the
ship owners and those relying on use of the ship for transport or leisure.
It is estimated that 1.2 million seafarers are employed on ships around
the world (IMO, 2009). As many spend months at sea, sometimes
in remote regions of the world, cargo ships on long voyages contain
particularly isolated communities. Good sanitary conditions on ships
are crucial to both the health and the welfare of seafarers.
By taking sensible preventive control measures, it is possible to protect
passengers, crew and the public at large from disease transmission
related to ships. To the extent possible, control strategies should be
targeted to minimizing contamination at source. From a public health
perspective, the focus should be on proactive and preventive measures
rather than reactive and curative. For example:
• the design and construction of the ship should be as failsafe as possible
  with respect to maintaining a sanitary environment;
• the food, water and materials taken on board should be as safe as
  possible;
• crew should be well trained in ship sanitation and have all the
  equipment, facilities, materials and capacity necessary to permit the
  maintenance of a sanitary environment on board;
• a risk management system should be put in place and maintained to
  ensure the identification, reporting and mitigation of public health
  risks.

1.2       Scope, purpose and objective
The primary aim of the revised Guide to ship sanitation is to present the
public health significance of ships in terms of disease and to highlight
the importance of applying appropriate control measures. The guide is
intended to be used as a basis for the development of national approaches
to controlling the hazards that may be encountered on ships, as well as
providing a framework for policy-making and local decision-making. The
guide may also be used as reference material for regulators, ship operators
and ship builders, as well as a checklist for understanding and assessing the
potential health impacts of projects involving the design of ships.
In 1967, the World Health Organization (WHO) first published the Guide
to ship sanitation, which was subjected to minor amendments in 1987.
In the past, the guide was directly referenced in the International Health
Regulations (IHR) (Article 14), and its purpose was to standardize the
sanitary measures taken in relation to ships to safeguard the health of
travellers and to prevent the spread of infection from one country to another.

2     Guide to ship sanitation
The 1967 guide was based on the results of a survey of 103 countries
and represented a synthesis of best national practices at the time. It
covered potable water supply, swimming-pool safety, waste disposal,
food safety and vermin control. Before publication, it was circulated
to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and a number of other
international agencies for comment. The guide supplemented the
requirements of the IHR and was the official global reference for health
requirements for ship construction and operation.
Since 1967, a number of specific guidance documents, conventions
and regulations have evolved that provide full accounts of the design
and operational detail relating to ships, and many take sanitation into
consideration. To some extent, these have made the original purpose of
the guide obsolete, and the purpose of this revised guide is different.
The guide has not been explicitly referenced since the 2005 version of
the IHR, hereafter referred to as IHR 2005 (WHO, 2005) (see section
1.3.1).
This document is intended to provide examples of accepted good
practices. However, it is acknowledged that there may be equally
effective alternative solutions that could be deployed to achieve the
desired objectives. If alternative solutions are adopted, there is a
need to provide objective evidence of their effectiveness. The primary
consideration is that the results are effective.

1.3   Harmonization with other international regulations

1.3.1 International Health Regulations
The International Sanitary Regulations were developed in 1951 to
prevent the spread of six infectious diseases: cholera, plague, yellow
fever, smallpox, typhus and relapsing fever. These regulations were
revised and renamed the International Health Regulations (IHR) in
1969.
The purpose of the IHR 2005 is “to prevent, protect against, control and
provide a public health response to the international spread of disease
in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health
risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international
traffic and trade”.
The IHR were amended in 1973 and 1981. The diseases subject to these
regulations were reduced to three: plague, yellow fever and cholera.
In 1995, the World Health Assembly called for the regulations to be
revised. The IHR were revised and presented to the Fifty-eighth World
Health Assembly on 23 May 2005 (WHO, 2005).

                                                         1 Introduction   3
The IHR 2005 apply to world traffic: ships, aircraft, other conveyances,
travellers and cargoes. Ships and aircraft are discussed specifically in
the Guide to ship sanitation and the Guide to hygiene and sanitation in
aviation (WHO, 2009), respectively. The guides provide a summary
of the health basis behind the IHR 2005 and help to bridge the gap
between the regulations, as a legal document, and the practical aspects
of implementation of appropriate practices.
Articles 22(b) and 24(c) of the IHR 2005 require State Parties to take all
practicable measures to ensure that international conveyance operators
keep their conveyances free from sources of contamination and infection,
and competent authorities are responsible for ensuring that facilities at
international ports (e.g. potable water, eating establishments, public
washrooms, appropriate solid and liquid waste disposal services) are
kept in sanitary condition.
Article 22(e) of the IHR 2005 states that the competent authority in
each State Party is responsible for the supervised removal and safe
disposal of any contaminated water or food, human or animal dejecta,
wastewater and any other contaminated matter from a conveyance.
Article 24 of the IHR 2005 requires each ship operator to ensure that no
sources of infection and contamination are found on board, including
in the water system. Annex 4 requires ship operators to facilitate
application of health measures and provide the health documents
under the IHR 2005 (e.g. Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/
Ship Sanitation Control Certificate [also known as Ship Sanitation
Certificates], Maritime Declaration of Health).
For this purpose, it is important that these measures are upheld on
ships and at ports and that health measures are taken to ensure that
conveyances are free from sources of infection or contamination.

1.3.2 International Labour Organization

Maritime Labour Convention, 2006
The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006,1 adopted by the 94th (Maritime)
Session of the International Labour Conference, the main body of the ILO,
consolidates more than 60 existing ILO maritime labour standards, adopted
by the ILO since 1919, several of which address issues relevant to health
on board ships. Article IV, Seafarers’ Employment and Social Rights, of the
Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 provides, in paragraph 3, that “Every

4    Guide to ship sanitation
seafarer has a right to decent working and living conditions on board ship”
and, in paragraph 4, that “Every seafarer has a right to health protection,
medical care, welfare measures and other forms of social protection”. The
following regulations of the convention specifically address health issues:
• Regulation 1.2: Medical certificate, paragraph 1, provides that
    “Seafarers shall not work on a ship unless they are certified as
    medically fit to perform their duties”. The related mandatory standard
    sets out the requirements related to the medical examination of
    seafarers and the issuing of a medical certificate attesting that they
    are medically fit to perform the duties they are to carry out at sea.
• Regulation 3.1: Accommodation and recreational facilities, paragraph
    1, provides that “Each Member shall ensure that ships that fly its
    flag provide and maintain decent accommodations and recreational
    facilities for seafarers working or living on board, or both, consistent
    with promoting the seafarers’ health and well-being”. It sets out
    specific requirements concerning the size of rooms and other
    accommodation spaces, heating and ventilation, noise and vibration,
    sanitary facilities, lighting and hospital accommodation. Standard
    A3.1, paragraph 18, provides that “The competent authority shall
    require frequent inspections to be carried out on board ships,
    by or under the authority of the master, to ensure that seafarer
    accommodation is clean, decently habitable and maintained in a
    good state of repair. The results of each such inspection shall be
    recorded and be available for review”. (The competent authority is
    the one under the ILO.)
• Regulation 3.2: Food and catering, paragraph 1, provides that “Each
    Member shall ensure that ships that fly its flag carry on board and
    serve food and drinking water of appropriate quality, nutritional
    value and quantity that adequately covers the requirements of
    the ship and takes into account the differing cultural and religious
    backgrounds”. Standard A3.2 provides, inter alia, that “Each Member
    shall ensure that ships that fly its flag meet the following minimum
    standards: … (b) the organization and equipment of the catering
    department shall be such as to permit the provision to the seafarers
    of adequate, varied and nutritious meals prepared and served in
    hygienic conditions; and (c) catering staff shall be properly trained
    or instructed for their positions”. There are further requirements
    and guidance related to proper food handling and hygiene.




                                                            1 Introduction   5
• Regulation 4.1: Medical care on board ship and ashore provides, in
  paragraph 1, that “Each Member shall ensure that all seafarers on
  ships that fly its flag are covered by adequate measures for the
  protection of their health and that they have access to prompt and
  adequate medical care whilst working on board”; in paragraph 3,
  that “Each Member shall ensure that seafarers on board ships in its
  territory who are in need of immediate medical care are given access
  to the Member’s medical facilities on shore”; and, in paragraph 4, that
  “The requirements for on-board health protection and medical care
  set out in the Code include standards for measures aimed at providing
  seafarers with health protection and medical care as comparable as
  possible to that which is generally available to workers ashore”.
Furthermore, Regulation 5.1: Flag State responsibilities, paragraph 1,
provides that “Each Member is responsible for ensuring implementation
of its obligations under this Convention on ships that fly its flag”; and
paragraph 2 provides that “Each Member shall establish an effective
system for the inspection and certification of maritime labour conditions
… ensuring that the working and living conditions for seafarers on
ships that fly its flag meet, and continue to meet, the standards in
this Convention”. Regulation 5.1.3: Maritime labour certificate and
declaration of maritime labour compliance provides, in paragraph 3, that
(for ships of 500 gross tonnage and above) “Each Member shall require
ships that fly its flag to carry and maintain a maritime labour certificate
certifying that the working and living conditions of seafarers on the
ship, including measures for ongoing compliance to be included in the
declaration of maritime labour compliance … have been inspected and
meet the requirements of national laws or regulations or other measures
implementing this Convention”; and, in paragraph 4, that “Each Member
shall require ships that fly its flag to carry and maintain a declaration
of maritime labour compliance stating the national requirements
implementing this Convention for the working and living conditions
for seafarers and setting out the measures adopted by the shipowner
to ensure compliance with the requirements on the ship or ships
concerned”. The flag State, or a recognized organization that has the
delegated authority to do so, is required to inspect, among other things,
accommodation, food and catering and onboard medical care before
issuing the certificate, which is valid for a period that shall not exceed
five years (interim and intermediate certificates are also prescribed).

Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 (No. 188)1 and Work
in Fishing Recommendation, 2007 (No. 199)2
These instruments apply to fishers and fishing vessels and set out
requirements and guidance on the issues of medical examination and
certification of fishers, accommodation (including requirements aimed
at ensuring vessels are constructed to be both safe and healthy) and food
on board fishing vessels, medical care at sea, and access to medical care
ashore. Annex III of the convention, paragraph 83, provides that “For
vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the competent authority [under
ILO] shall require frequent inspections to be carried out, by or under
the authority of the skipper, to ensure that: (a) accommodation is clean,
decently habitable and safe, and is maintained in a good state of repair;
(b) food and water supplies are sufficient; and (c) galley and food storage
spaces and equipment are hygienic and in a proper state of repair” and
that “The results of such inspections, and the actions taken to address
any deficiencies found, shall be recorded and available for review”.

Consideration of the ILO standards
It is highly recommended that those involved in the design, construction,
operation and inspection of ships, including port health officials, become
fully aware of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention,
2006, the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 and the Work in Fishing
Recommendation, 2007, as these standards are the basis for flag and
port State control of living and working conditions of merchant ships
and fishing vessels.

1.3.3 International Maritime Organization
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is a specialized agency
of the United Nations, which is based in the United Kingdom, with
around 300 international staff. The convention establishing the IMO
was adopted in Geneva in 1948, and the IMO first met in 1959. The
IMO’s main task has been to develop and maintain a comprehensive
regulatory framework for shipping, and its remit today includes safety,
environmental concerns, legal matters, technical cooperation, maritime
security and the efficiency of shipping.3

1.4       Roles and responsibilities
Infectious diseases on board may have a considerable toll on the
operational capacity of ships and in extreme circumstances become
impediments to international commerce and travel. Prevention of such
incidents and a proper response should they occur are a top priority for
all those responsible for ship design, construction and operation.
There are distinct roles for different organizations and individuals in
maintaining good sanitation on ships. However, the objective of good
ship sanitation is a common one that requires all to play their part. From
design through construction, procurement, operation and docking, all
professionals involved in shipping have an important role to play within
the preventive risk management approach to protecting passengers,
crew, port populations and international communities from harm.
The major roles of accountability on board that relate to maintaining a
safe environment for passengers and crew are assigned to the owner,
operator, engineer, master and medical personnel. These roles and
responsibilities are briefly outlined below.

1.4.1 Designer/constructor
Good sanitary design greatly reduces the chances of poor health
outcomes arising on board or when the ship is in contact with external
risks at port. Therefore, those who design and construct ships need to
ensure that their ships can be readily operated in a sanitary manner.
The construction and layout of the ship must be suitable for its intended
purposes. This requires attention to important details of design and
construction that affect ship sanitation. The better and more failsafe
a ship’s sanitary design, the easier it is for the owner/operator to
minimize the inherent risk. In contrast, a ship’s design that has many
flaws and places excessive reliance on operational practices is likely to
lead to disease outbreaks.
In general, design and construction of ships and associated equipment
should meet internationally accepted standards (e.g. various IMO,
Codex Alimentarius Commission and International Organization for
Standardization standards).

1.4.2 Owner/operator
Upon receiving a ship, the owner should ensure compliance with
sanitary design standards that support sanitary ship operation.
Examples include the physical separation of clean food and water from
waste, and adequate design capacities for facilities such as recreational


8     Guide to ship sanitation
water environments. Responsibility for ensuring that a ship received is
designed and built in a manner that does not expose passengers and
crew to unacceptable health risks rests with the ship owner. The owner
bears ongoing responsibility for ensuring that the ship design is fit for
its intended purpose.
Responsibility for ensuring that the ship can be operated in a manner
that provides a safe environment for passengers and crew rests with
the ship operator. The operator must ensure that there are adequate
and properly maintained equipment and provisions, with sufficient
numbers of adequately trained crew to properly manage health risks
on board.

1.4.3 Master/crew
According to the IMO’s International Management Code for the
Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention,1 the ultimate
responsibility for all aspects of crew safety on board is vested with
the ship’s master, as delegated by the operator. Responsibilities are
often delegated such that they effectively become shared, although not
abrogated, via the chain of command. The master must ensure that all
reasonable measures are taken to protect crew and passenger health.
Conscientious and diligent monitoring of operational control measures
is the responsibility of the master and crew.
The ship’s engineer is likely to be chiefly responsible, as delegated
by the master, for the proper operation of the engineered systems
that protect passengers and crew. These include many aspects of the
ship’s operation, such as the cooling and heating systems designed to
maintain food and water at safe temperatures, water treatment systems
for drinking-water, waste management and the integrity of piping and
storage systems.

1.4.4 Port authorities
A responsibility of port authorities is to provide the required equipment,
facilities, expertise and materials so that ships can undertake operations
(e.g. providing safe food and water, safely removing ballast and waste)
in a sanitary manner. One or more agencies may fulfil the roles of the
port authority, health authority and competent authority of a flag State
under the IMO.

Prevention of contamination at source to the maximum degree
practicable is a key tenet of preventive control strategies. As ships
load at ports, the port authorities play a vital role in protecting public
health by seeking to provide the best practicable raw materials for
ships. Authorities should clarify which entity has the Ship Sanitation
Certificate and food inspection responsibilities.

1.5     Structure of the Guide to ship sanitation
This guide is structured into the following chapters:
• Chapter 1. Introduction
• Chapter 2. Water
• Chapter 3. Food
• Chapter 4. Recreational water environments
• Chapter 5. Ballast water
• Chapter 6. Waste management and disposal
• Chapter 7. Vector and reservoir control
• Chapter 8. Controlling infectious disease agents in the environment.
Chapter 1 sets the guide in its legal context, considering the IHR 2005
and describing its relationship to other international documents,
regulations and standards.
Each of chapters 2–8 follows the same structural approach and consists
of two sections: background and guidelines.
The background section describes critical issues and supporting health
evidence applicable to ships and the specific topic of the chapter.
The guidelines section provides user-targeted information and guidance
applicable to the topic of the chapter, identifying responsibilities and
providing examples of practices that should control risks. This section
contains a number of specific guidelines (a situation to aim for and
maintain), each of which is accompanied by a set of indicators (measures
for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance notes (advice on
applying the guidelines and indicators in practice, highlighting the most
important aspects that need to be considered when setting priorities for
action).




10    Guide to ship sanitation
2 Water

2.1     Background
Improperly managed water is an established route for infectious disease
transmission on ships. The importance of water was illustrated in the
review of more than 100 outbreaks associated with ships undertaken by
Rooney et al. (2004), in which one fifth were attributed to a waterborne
route. This is probably an underestimate, as more than one third of
the 100 reviewed outbreaks could not be associated with any specific
exposure route, so some may have been waterborne. Furthermore,
water may be a source of primary or index cases of a disease that might
then be transmitted via other routes.
Most waterborne outbreaks of disease on ships involve ingestion of
water contaminated with pathogens derived from human or other
animal excreta. Illnesses due to chemical poisoning of water have also
occurred on ships, although chemical incidents are much less commonly
reported than microbial ones.
To protect the health of passengers and crew, water used for potable
purposes on board ship should be provided with sanitary safeguards
in a multiple-barrier system (from the shore and distribution system,
including connections to the ship system, through the ship treatment
and storage systems and on to each water supply outlet), in order to
prevent contamination or pollution during ship operation.
Waterborne outbreaks have been associated with bunkering water of
poor quality. Therefore, the first strategy for prevention of waterborne
disease should be to load ships with water that conforms to the WHO
Guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) (WHO, 2011) or relevant
national standards, whichever are stricter.
Even if the water at the port is safe, this does not ensure that it will
remain safe during the transfer and storage activities that follow. An
understanding of the ship drinking-water supply and transfer chain will
help to illustrate the points at which the water can become contaminated
en route to the taps on board.
Generally, the ship drinking-water supply and transfer chain consists of
three major components (Figure 2‑1):

       water boats and water barges; this water transfer process provides
       multiple opportunities for the introduction of contaminants into
       the drinking-water;
3.     the ship water system, which includes storage, distribution and
       onboard production of drinking-water from overboard sources,
       such as seawater.

2.1.1 Standards related to potable water
The GDWQ (WHO, 2011) describe reasonable minimum requirements
for safe practices to protect the health of consumers and derive
numerical guideline values for constituents of water or indicators of
water quality. Neither the minimum requirements for safe practices nor
the numerical guideline values are mandatory limits, but rather health-
based guidance to national authorities to help them establish their
own enforceable standards, which may also consider other factors. In
order to define such limits, it is necessary to consider the GDWQ in the
context of local or national environmental, social, economic and cultural
conditions. Nevertheless, given the global nature of ship travel and the
need for ships to board water from areas with variable and possibly
inadequate standards of general hygiene and sanitation, the GDWQ (or
national standards, if more stringent) should be followed. This approach
will provide passengers and crew with consistent, reliable protection
from the potential risks posed by contaminated drinking-water.
The GDWQ provide comprehensive guidance to ensure the quality and
safety of drinking-water. Microbial risks in water on board ships are the
principal concerns, although a few risks associated with toxic chemicals
also exist.

        The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2011) (GDWQ)
        identify the broad spectrum of contaminants, including micro­organisms,
        inorganic and synthetic organic chemicals, disinfection by-products
        and radionuclides, that can reach hazardous concentrations in potable
        water supplies and describe systematic approaches to risk management.
        Safe drinking-water, as defined by the GDWQ, does not represent any
        significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including different
        sensitivities that may occur between life stages.

ILO Convention C133 (Accommodation of Crews [Supplementary
Provisions] Convention, 19701) defines minimum standards for
provision of potable water for crews and has been ratified by many
States.

The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 provides comprehensive
rights and protections at work for seafarers. The new labour standard
consolidates and updates more than 65 international labour standards
related to seafarers adopted over the past 80 years. Regulation 3.2 of the
Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 includes requirements for drinking-
water on board.
In the IMO’s Life-Saving Appliance Code (IMO, 2010), additional
information about potable water requirements in rescue boats is
provided.
Reference can be made to seven international standards in relation to
sanitary design and construction of ship water supplies and potable
water quality assessment:1

   supply on ships and marine structures—Part 1: Planning and design;
2. ISO 15748-2:2002—Ships and marine technology—Potable

2.1.2 Role of the International Health Regulations (2005)
The IHR 2005 contain provisions for the State Party to designate
ports to develop core capacities, such as the capacity to ensure a safe

from sources of contamination and infection, and competent authorities
are responsible for ensuring that the facilities at international ports are
in sanitary condition and for supervising the removal and safe disposal
of any contaminated water and food from a conveyance.
However, it is the responsibility of each ship operator to establish
all practicable measures to ensure that no sources of infection or
contamination are present on board, including in the water system. For
this purpose, it is important that regulations and standards are upheld
on board ships and at ports, in terms of the safety of food and water
served on board, from the source of supply ashore to distribution on
board ship.

2.1.3 Potable water sources from ashore and uses on board ships
A port may receive potable water from either a municipal or a private
supply and usually has special arrangements for managing this water
after it has entered the port.
Potable water is used in various ways on board ships, including direct
human consumption, food preparation and sanitation/hygiene activities.
Potential uses include:
• preparation of hot and cold beverages, such as coffee, tea and
   powdered beverages;
• ice cubes in drinks;
• reconstitution of dehydrated foods, such as soups, noodles and infant
   formula;
• food washing and preparation;
• direct ingestion from cold-water taps and water fountains;
• reconstitution and/or ingestion of medications;
• brushing of teeth;
• hand and face washing, bathing and showering;
• dishwashing, and cleaning of utensils and work areas;
• laundering purposes (could potentially use a lower grade of water);
• emergency medical use.
Although some uses do not necessitate consumption, they involve
human contact and possibly incidental ingestion (e.g. tooth brushing).
Although, whenever practicable, it is useful to have only one water system
installed to supply potable water for drinking, culinary, dishwashing,
ablutionary and laundering purposes, two or three systems are
sometimes installed or required: potable, sanitary and wash water, for


                                                               2 Water   15
example. A wash-water system can be used to supply slop sinks, laundry
facilities, water closets, bibcock connections for deck flushing and
cleaning purposes, heated water for dishwashing and water for other
special uses. All non-potable water taps need to be labelled with words
such as “UNFIT FOR DRINKING”. There should never be a connection
between wash-water or other non-potable systems and the potable
water system without using an appropriate backflow-prevention device.

2.1.4 Health risks associated with potable water on ships
Some of the causal hazardous agents associated with waterborne disease
outbreaks on board ships are listed in Table 2‑1. Note that in some
waterborne disease outbreaks, the causative agent was not identified.
Outbreaks were associated with such causes as:
• contaminated water supplied at the port
• contaminated bunkered water
• cross-connections between potable and non-potable water
• poor design and construction of potable water storage tanks
• inadequate disinfection.
Some ports were found not to have supplied a safe source of water. In
these cases, contaminated water bunkered from port was associated
with a number of outbreaks due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,
Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium.

16    Guide to ship sanitation
Space is often very limited on ships. Potable water systems are likely
to be physically close to hazardous substances, such as sewage or
waste streams, increasing the chance of cross-connections. Cold-water
systems may be close to sources of heat, and this elevated temperature
increases the risk of proliferation of Legionella spp. and the growth of
other microbial life.
In considering evidence from outbreaks, the presence of pathogens
generally transmitted to humans from other human sources (e.g. viral
pathogens and Shigella spp.) indicates that contamination with sewage is
one of the more common causes of waterborne disease outbreaks on ships.
Legionnaires’ disease is perhaps the most widely known form of
legionellosis. It is a form of pneumonia acquired from inhaling aerosols
of water that contain excessive numbers of Legionella bacteria. Ships are
considered high-risk environments for the proliferation of Legionella spp.
for a variety of reasons. Firstly, source water quality could potentially be
a health concern if untreated or subject only to treatment with a residual
disinfectant prior to or upon bunkering. Secondly, water storage and
distribution systems on ships are complex and could provide greater
opportunities for bacterial contamination, as ship movement increases
the risk of surge and back-siphonage. Thirdly, potable water may vary in
temperature (e.g. due to high temperatures in the engine room). In some
tropical regions, the risks of bacterial growth and occurrence of Legionella
contamination in cold-water systems are greater because of higher
water temperatures. Finally, proliferation is encouraged due to long-
term storage and stagnation in tanks or pipes. Importantly, Legionella
spp. can proliferate in warm-water temperatures between 25 °C and
50 °C, such as those experienced in showerheads and spa pools, leading
to potential exposure through aerosolization arising from showers and
other plumbing fixtures. Many cases of Legionnaires’ disease associated
with ships are linked to whirlpool spas (WHO, 2001; see also chapter 4).
Legionella pneumophila has been found in drinking-water systems on
general cargo ships (Temeshnikova et al., 1996).
The production of water on ships can be associated with its own
potential health problems. Ships can produce their own water by several
different processes, such as reverse osmosis or evaporation of seawater.
Desalination demineralizes seawater, which can make it more corrosive,
shortening the life of containers and conduits. Desalinated water may also
cause health impacts associated with insufficient minerals in seafarers’
diets or the consumption of dissolved metals (e.g. lead, nickel, iron,
cadmium or copper) from corrosion products. Desalinated water may
also be considered bland, flavourless and unacceptable by passengers
and crew.

                                                                2 Water   17
Evaporation systems on board ships are supplied with seawater that has
been sucked in through so-called sea chests and is typically led directly
into the evaporator. In the evaporator, the seawater that is heated by the
engine cooling water typically starts boiling at low temperatures (<80 °C),
due to low pressure within these systems. When these low process
temperatures are used, there is no guarantee of producing water free from
pathogens. According to International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) standards, water that has been produced below 80 °C needs to be
disinfected before it can be defined as potable water. The emerging steam
condenses as distillate inside the evaporator. This distillate is collected
and flows to further treatment components. It should be considered
that the distillate is free from any minerals and almost free from carbon
dioxide. As a result, it is necessary to add carbon dioxide to the distilled
water to prepare it for the rehardening process.
Reverse osmosis involves pretreatment and transport of water across
membranes under pressure so that salts are excluded. Post-treatment
may also occur before distribution. Partial desalination or breaches in
membranes may have potential health implications due to trace elements
and organic compounds, including oil and refined petroleum products,
occurring within the source seawater. In addition, seawater sources may
contain hazards not encountered in freshwater systems. These include
diverse harmful algae and cyanobacteria, certain free-living bacteria
(including Vibrio species such as V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae) and
some chemicals, such as boron and bromide, which are more abundant in
seawater.
Repair work on a treatment and distribution system can offer several
opportunities for widespread contamination of water supplies. Ship
operators should take special precautions when carrying out repairs to
storage tanks. For example, an outbreak of typhoid on a ship occurred
after the potable water was contaminated with sewage while the ship
underwent repairs in dry dock. Good hygienic practice and post-repair
cleaning and disinfection are necessary. Ship builders and rehabilitators
typically have written procedures for physical cleaning and disinfection
before commissioning or recommissioning ships.

2.1.5 Bottled water and ice
Bottled water is considered as drinking-water by some regulatory
agencies and as a food by others (WHO, 2011). International quality
specifications for bottled water exist under the Codex Alimentarius
Commission (FAO/WHO, 2001) and are derived from the GDWQ (WHO,
2011). As it is commonly designated as a food product, bottled water is
considered in chapter 3 on food.

18   Guide to ship sanitation
Within this guide, ice supplied to ships or manufactured on board for
both drinking and cooling is classified as food. Guidance pertaining to
ice used on ships is contained in chapter 3. The GDWQ (WHO, 2011)
apply to both packaged water and ice intended for human consumption.

2.1.6 Definitions, overview and objectives of water safety plans
Water safety plans (WSPs) are an effective overarching management
approach for ensuring the safety of a drinking-water supply. WSPs are
equivalent to food safety plans or programmes, incorporating hazard
analysis and critical control points, implemented as part of food safety
management (see chapter 3). As discussed above, a potable water source
at the port is not a guarantee of safe water on board, because water may
become contaminated during transfer to the ship or during storage or
distribution on board. A WSP covering water management within ports,
from receipt of water through to its transfer to the ship, complemented
by water quality measures on board, provides a framework for water
safety on ships. A general overview of WSPs follows; their specific
application to the safety of drinking-water on board ships is described
in section 2.2.
A WSP has three key components, guided by health-based targets and
overseen through drinking-water supply chain surveillance. They are:
• system assessments, which include
    –– description of the water supply system in order to determine
        whether the drinking-water supply chain (up to the point of
        consumption) as a whole can deliver water of a quality that
        meets health-based targets;
    –– identification of hazards and evaluation of risks;
    –– determination of control measures, reassessment and
        prioritization of risks;
    –– development, implementation and maintenance of an
        improvement plan;
• operational monitoring, which includes identification and monitoring
   of the control measures that will ensure that management processes
   are functioning efficiently;
• management and communication, including verification, preparation
   of management procedures and development of supporting
   programmes to manage people and processes, including upgrade
   and improvement.

The various steps involved in designing and implementing a WSP are
illustrated in Figure 2-2. For more information on general principles of
WSPs, see the GDWQ (WHO, 2011) and the Water safety plan manual

2.2    Guidelines
2.2.1 Guideline 2.1: Water safety plan for shore supplies,
      delivery system and bunker boats or barges

  Guideline 2.1—A water safety plan has been designed and
  implemented for the port water source, for the bunker boats or
  barges and for the delivery system to the ship.


Indicators for Guideline 2.1
1. A potable water system assessment has been carried out, with risks
   and control points identified.
2. Operational monitoring, including operational limits and target
   criteria, has been defined for the port water system and bunker
   boats or barges, and corrective action plans have been developed.
3. Management systems, including record keeping, validation,
   verification and communication, have been included in the WSP of
   the port water system and bunker boats or barges.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.1
The GDWQ are intended to cover a broad range of water supplies and
are not specifically targeted at ships. Therefore, in drawing from the
guidance provided in the GDWQ, the specific context of the port and
the ship needs to be taken into consideration. The overall approach
promoted, involving the development and implementation of a WSP
(Bartram et al., 2009; WHO, 2011), is as relevant to ships and ports as it
is to any other water supply situation.

Roles and responsibilities
A WSP is an effective means of achieving consistency in ensuring the safety
of a drinking-water supply. The entity responsible for each component
of the drinking-water supply chain (i.e. port water source, shore water
distribution system, transfer and delivery system and ship water system)
should be responsible for the preparation and implementation of a WSP
for that part of the process. Examples of roles and responsibilities for each
component are as follows:
• Source water supplier (public or private): Role is to provide to the port
    a safe water supply of sufficient quantity and quality. Responsibilities
    are to monitor the water system by sampling water and providing
    sampling results to the port authority on request, informing the port
    authority of any adverse results and actions to be taken, with the

                                                                 2 Water   21
  obligation to inform the port authority when the water supply has,
  or may, become contaminated. This is typically the municipal water
  supplier for the area in which the port is located.
• Port operator and water supplier: Role is to maintain the integrity of
  water supplied throughout the shore water distribution system and
  to provide safe water to the ship. Responsibilities are to maintain a
  safe water supply from the shore water distribution system through
  delivery to the ship; to monitor the water system and share sampling
  results with the source water supplier, authorities and appropriate
  stakeholders; and to take corrective action as necessary.

1. System assessment for port water system, water boats and barges and
delivery to the ship
Potable water for ships, including water boats and barges, needs to be
obtained only from those water sources and supplies that provide potable
water of a quality that meets the standards recommended in the GDWQ
(WHO, 2011) or national standards, whichever are stricter. Particular
attention should be paid to microbial water quality, although physical and
chemical requirements are also important.
Water is delivered to ships by hoses on the dockside or transferred to the
ship by water boats or barges. Designated filling hoses must be provided
at each pier or wharf for the use of ships not equipped with them. Facilities
for the direct delivery of water from shore sources to the filling line for the
ship’s potable water system include piping, hydrants, hoses and any other
necessary equipment.
Plans for the construction or replacement of facilities for bunkering
potable water on board must be submitted to the competent authority
under the IHR 2005 for review. Plans must show the location and size
of the distribution lines, location and type of check valves or backflow
preventers, location and type of hydrants, including details of outlet
protection, and storage lockers for filling hoses and attachments.
In some instances, local source water may be contaminated with
protozoan pathogens (e.g. Cryptosporidium) or viruses, whose presence
may not be well indicated by E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms,
and which require more stringent treatment. Based on the findings of
the WSP, additional controls and measurements may be necessary. Some
disinfectants are effective at inactivating E. coli, but not Cryptosporidium
or viruses. For instance, typical doses of chlorine or chloramine are
ineffective against Cryptosporidium, so membrane filtration or ultraviolet
(UV) disinfection might need to be used; commonly used doses of UV
disinfection are of limited value in controlling viruses, so higher UV doses
or free chlorine may need to be used.

22   Guide to ship sanitation
2. Operational limits, control measures and corrective action

Disinfection
The water supply delivered to ports must be suitable for distribution and
consumption without further treatment, except as necessary to maintain
water quality in the distribution system (e.g. supplemental disinfection,
addition of corrosion-control chemicals). A disinfectant residual should
be detectable in water samples at the port, on the water barge and on
the ship. Presence of a measurable disinfectant residual contributes to
ensuring that water is microbiologically safe for the intended use. Presence
of the residual will be affected by the original dose of disinfectant, type of
disinfectant used, disinfectant demand, temperature and pH of the water
and time since application. A significant reduction in disinfectant residual
may also indicate post-treatment contamination.
New or repaired facilities must be disinfected before they are returned to
service.
In the event of contamination of the water provided to the port, the
port must complete corrective action and notify the party responsible
for bunkering water as soon as possible to enable mitigation to prevent
contaminated water from being transported onto ships.

Prevention of backflow and cross-contamination
The lines’ capacity should maintain positive pressure at all times to
reduce the risk of backflow. There must be no connections between the
potable water system and other piping systems. All fittings, meters and
other appurtenances used for bunkering of potable water need to be
handled and stored in a sanitary manner. Inlets and outlets of potable
water meters are typically capped when not in use.
Approved backflow preventers need to be properly installed between
the ship and shore systems to permit effective operation and inspection.
Drainage to prevent freezing may be needed.
Non-potable water hydrants are not normally located on the same pier
as hydrants for potable water unless absolutely necessary. Potable water
hydrants must be identified with signs such as “POTABLE WATER”, and
non-potable water hydrants with signs marked “NON-POTABLE WATER”.
Hydrants need to be adequately covered and located so as not to receive
waste discharge from ships. Drainage lines from supply lines or hydrants
(or taps and faucets) should terminate above normal high-water level or
the surge of water from incoming ships. Where compressed air is used to
blow water out of lines and hydrants, a filter, liquid trap or similar device
must be installed in the supply line from the compressed air system to
protect the water supply.

                                                                  2 Water   23
Water boats and barges
Water boats and barges are ships especially constructed and equipped
to receive and provide water for both potable and non-potable water
systems on board ships when direct shore delivery is not practicable.
These boats have water tanks, water hoses and fittings, pumps and
independent pipe systems to provide potable water to onboard systems.
Reception, handling, storage and delivery to ship water systems need to
be carried out under controlled, sanitary conditions. All hoses, fittings
and tools need to be stored in designated lockers that are closed and
clean. Operators need to possess knowledge of water hygiene and good
sanitary practice.
Facilities for disinfection, when and where necessary on board, need
to be available. Regular cleaning and disinfection of hoses and fittings
should be performed. Plans for construction of ships must show filling
lines, storage tanks, pumping equipment and protective measures for
approval by the port health authority or other designated authority.
In the event of contamination of potable water at the delivery point or
on the water boat or barge, the party responsible for transfer of the
water must complete corrective action and notify the ship’s operator as
soon as possible so that they can take mitigative measures to prevent
contaminated water from being transported onto the ship.

3. Monitoring and verification
By far the greatest risks associated with drinking-water involve
microbial contamination from human excreta. Source water is
monitored at the port to ensure that water is safe. Recommended
parameters to be monitored include E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal)
coliforms, disinfectant residual, corrosion-related contaminants,
turbidity, heterotrophic plate count (HPC) and aesthetic parameters.
Escherichia coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms are used as the
indicators of potential contamination from pathogens associated with
human excreta. Total coliforms are not necessarily indicators of faecal
contamination, but may reflect a lack of general cleanliness. Escherichia
coli and thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms should be measured using
generally accepted analytical techniques. HPC should be measured to
provide an overview of the general status of microbial life in the system.
Faecal indicators such as E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms
are valuable for ongoing verification or for batch testing of water that
is on hold, but are of limited use for operational monitoring of water
supplied on the ship, as even very brief exposure to unsafe water can


24   Guide to ship sanitation
lead to an outbreak. The tests typically take 18–24 hours to report, by
which time water may have been consumed. No E. coli or thermotolerant
(faecal) coliforms should be detected in any 100 ml sample of the water.
A positive test may indicate potential pathogenic (primarily bacterial)
microorganisms associated with excreta, suggesting recent or substantial
post-treatment faecal contamination or inadequate treatment.
It is important to check turbidity levels of the source water, as high levels
of turbidity can protect microorganisms from disinfection, stimulate
growth of bacteria and cause a significant disinfectant demand. In case
of high turbidity, filtration can help to solve an acute problem, but the
reason for high turbidity should be identified to avoid further problems.
Provided that water entering the port conforms to acceptable standards,
the principal concern regarding chemical contamination is likely to be
metals leaching from the shore water distribution system. Corrosion in
plumbing systems is a function of the stability and aggressiveness of the
water towards the surfaces and fixtures with which the water will be in
contact during transport and storage. Metals such as lead, nickel, iron,
cadmium and copper can be leached from some materials into the water
and may adversely affect taste or, in some cases, lead to health concerns.
The need to monitor other chemicals of concern should be determined,
depending on the local situation. All samples should meet GDWQ or
national standards for chemicals, as there are potentially significant
effects associated with chronic exposures.
Documentation of monitoring should be kept for assurance and analysis
in the event of an incident.

2.2.2 Guideline 2.2: Water quantity

  Guideline 2.2—Potable water is available in sufficient
  quantities.

Indicators for Guideline 2.2
1. Potable water quantities at the port are sufficient to ensure adequate
   pressure at all taps to minimize the potential for contamination.
2. Potable water quantities on board are sufficient to meet foreseeable
   needs for all purposes (e.g. drinking, food preparation, sanitation
   and hygiene activities) and to achieve sufficient water pressure at
   each tap to minimize the potential for contamination.




                                                                 2 Water   25
Guidance notes for Guideline 2.2
In providing adequate storage for potable water, consideration needs
to be given to the size of the ship’s complement of officers and crew, the
maximum number of passengers accommodated, the time and distance
between ports with potable water sources and the availability of water
suitable for treatment on board. Sufficient storage is needed to preclude
the need for treating overboard water from heavily contaminated areas
and to allow time for maintenance and repair.
The amount of storage may be decreased if the potable water supply
can be supplemented by water produced on board to adequate safety
standards.
An insufficient or non-existent quantity of potable water under pressure
on board for drinking, culinary purposes and personal hygiene can have
an impact on the health and welfare of passengers and crew. However,
the amount of water required for these purposes should be adequately
dealt with in typical ship designs. In no case should potable water
storage be less than a reasonable base level that would allow water to be
supplied during maintenance or repair of treatment systems, typically a
two-day supply.

2.2.3 Guideline 2.3: Water safety plan for ship water supply

     Guideline 2.3—A water safety plan has been designed and
     implemented for the ship water system.

Indicators for Guideline 2.3
1. A potable water system assessment has been carried out, with risks
   and control points identified.
2. Operational monitoring, including operational limits and health-
   related targets, has been defined for the ship’s water supply system,
   and corrective action plans have been developed, where necessary.
3. Management systems, including documentation, validation,
   verification and communication, have been included in the ship WSP.
Examples of hazards, control measures, monitoring procedures and
corrective actions taken as part of a WSP for a ship water supply system
are given in the Annex.




26     Guide to ship sanitation
Guidance notes for Guideline 2.3

Roles and responsibilities of ship operator
The ship operator’s role is to provide a safe water supply to passengers
and crew, fit for all intended purposes. Water on board should be kept
clean and free from pathogenic organisms and harmful chemicals.
Responsibilities are to monitor the water system, particularly for
microbial and chemical indicators, to share sampling results with
stakeholders, to report adverse results to the competent authority under
the IHR 2005, where required, and to take corrective action. Adverse
results should also be communicated to the crew and passengers
when and where necessary. Where there are methods or materials
recommended by WHO for particular tests, these should be applied.
The ship’s master or officer responsible for bunkering water must be
responsible for ascertaining whether or not the source of the water is
potable. All staff should be encouraged to report symptoms indicating
a potential waterborne disease. The ship’s operator needs to provide
adequate toilet and washing facilities for the crew to maintain personal
hygiene. Known carriers of communicable diseases should never come
into contact with potable water supplies. An adequate ratio of crew
to facilities is required on board ship to enable proper servicing and
maintenance activities. Minimum requirements can be found in ILO
Convention C133 and the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006. The
term “fresh water” used in ILO conventions and the Maritime Labour
Convention, 2006 should be interpreted as meaning potable water. To
reduce disease spread among crew, shared drinking receptacles should
not be used on ships unless they are sanitized between uses.

1. Assessment of the ship’s potable water system: hazards and hazardous events
The ship operator should be aware of all hazards (biological, chemical
or physical) and hazardous events that may occur in port water when
transferring water from port to ship or when water is produced, stored
and distributed on board. All potential hazards and hazardous events
should be assessed within the WSP. Knowledge of these hazards may be
obtained from various sources, including data on water quality from the
port health authority and epidemiological data on waterborne disease
in the region of concern.
Outbreaks of illness due to toxic chemicals are much less frequent than
those due to microbial hazards. Nevertheless, passengers and crew may
be exposed to chemical contaminants in drinking-water over extended
periods of time. These contaminants may have been present in the
source water, be introduced into the water from leaching of components


                                                                  2 Water   27
within the ship water distribution system or be present in water
produced on board, such as boron and bromide from improperly treated
seawater. Therefore, water on board should meet the GDWQ (or national
standards, if more stringent) for chemicals of concern.
Corrosion in plumbing systems is a function of the stability and
aggressiveness of the water towards the surfaces and fixtures that the
water will contact during transport and storage. Desalinated water
produced on board ships may be corrosive, for example, and salt water
and saline atmospheres may have corrosive effects on fixtures.

Source of potable water
Potable water for ships needs to be obtained only from water sources
and water supplies that provide potable water of a quality in line
with standards recommended in the GDWQ (WHO, 2011) or national
standards, if more stringent, specifically in relation to microbial,
chemical, physical and radiological requirements.
The ship’s operator must seek assurance as to the quality and nature
of the source water before bunkering. Ship operators may choose to
directly engage with port and local authorities to investigate levels of
safety. If water is suspected to come from an unsafe source, testing for
contamination may be necessary. If water provided at the port does not
meet the GDWQ (or national requirements, if stricter), the port will need
to utilize an alternative, higher-quality source. Terminal disinfection is
a treatment step and, where a residual disinfectant is required, a final
safeguard.
Ships using ports where water treatment is unreliable must carry
calibrated equipment for basic testing (turbidity, pH and disinfectant
residual) and ensure capacity to dose disinfectant or filter to appropriate
levels to provide a minimum level of safety.
Detection of undesirable aesthetic parameters (odour/colour/taste)
may indicate cross-connections with the liquid waste system or other
potential contamination problems and should be investigated.

Bunkering stations
To mitigate risks during bunkering of potable water, multiple-
barrier protection should be established. This starts with the use of
appropriate hoses and fixtures, backflow preventers and filters at the
bunker station and chlorination before water enters the storage tank.
To help protect the quality of water passing through filling hoses, they
should be durable, with a smooth, impervious lining, and equipped


28   Guide to ship sanitation
with fittings that are designed to permit connection to the shore water
supply system. Interior surfaces of potable water hoses should be made
of material suitable for being disinfected and should not support the
growth of biofilm. Hoses that are designed to be used for firefighting
are not appropriate for use as potable water hoses. Potable water hoses
should be clearly identifiable with words such as “POTABLE WATER”.
Hoses used exclusively for the delivery of potable water should be kept
on each ship. The ends should be capped when not in use. Keeper chains
will prevent misplacement of caps. The hose needs to be handled to
prevent contamination by dragging ends on the ground, pier or deck
surfaces or by dropping into the harbour water. A hose that has become
contaminated should be thoroughly flushed and disinfected. The hose
must be flushed in all cases before being attached to the filling line. It
must be drained and dried after each use.
The filling hoses should be stowed, with the ends capped, in special
lockers designated and marked “POTABLE WATER HOSE ONLY”. Lockers
must be closed, self-draining and fixed above the deck. The lockers
should be constructed from smooth, non-toxic, corrosion-resistant and
easily cleanable material. Hoses and fittings need to be maintained in
good repair.
Non-potable water, if used on the ship, should be bunkered through
separate piping using fittings incompatible with potable water
bunkering. This water should flow through a completely different piping
system that is identified with a different colour.
To provide for safe bunkering, every potable water tank must have a
dedicated, clean filling line to which a hose can be attached. To avoid
accidental connections of sewage hoses, the flange of this filling line
should refer to suitable criteria such as defined in ISO 5620-1/2. To
prevent contamination of water, the filling line needs to be positioned
a suitable distance above the top of the tank or of the deck that the
line penetrates. It is typically painted or marked in blue and labelled
“POTABLE WATER FILLING”. The filling line can have a screw cap or plug
fastened by a chain to an adjacent bulkhead or surface in such a manner
that the cap or plug will not touch the deck when hanging free. Lines
to divert potable water to other systems by valves or interchangeable
pipe fittings are not generally considered acceptable, except where an
air gap follows a valve. If only one filling line is used to load potable
water to all tanks, a direct connection between the potable water tank
and other tanks through an air gap is a satisfactory practice. To avoid
intake of unwanted particles, a filter can be used in the filling line. These
filters need to be backwashed or exchanged regularly according to the


                                                                 2 Water   29
manufacturer’s instructions. All potable water passing through the
potable water filling line should pass through an automatic chlorination
unit before it enters the potable water tanks.

Water production on board
To help prevent cross-contamination, when seawater is to be treated on
board for use as potable water, the overboard discharges should not be
on the same side as the water intake. When it is not practicable to locate
the overboard discharges on the opposite side of the ship, they should
be located as far aft of, and as far below, the water intake as practicable.
Water may be produced on ships by desalination, reverse osmosis or
distillation. A complete desalination process demineralizes seawater.
This makes it corrosive, shortening the life of containers and conduits
with which it is in contact. Special consideration needs to be given to
the quality of such materials, and normal procedures for certification
of materials as suitable for potable water use may not be adequate for
“aggressive” desalinated water.
Because of the aggressive nature of desalinated water and because
this water may be considered bland, flavourless and unacceptable, it
is commonly stabilized by the addition of chemicals such as calcium
carbonate. Once such treatment has been applied, desalinated waters
should be no more aggressive than waters normally encountered in
drinking-water supply. Chemicals used in such treatment must be
subject to procedures for certification and quality assurance. The
process of remineralization of desalinated water must be validated by
the use of a testing kit for pH, hardness and turbidity. Water that has
not been stabilized as a result of a failure in the rehardening process
typically shows a very low electrical conductivity (e.g. 50 µS/cm) and an
elevated pH (above 8.0). High pH can be a reason for an unsatisfactory
disinfection result, and reduced hardness may lead to leaching of metals
into the water.
An evaporating plant that distils seawater and supplies water to the
potable water system must be of such a design to produce potable
water reliably. Distillation uses heat and pressure changes to vaporize
seawater, thus liberating it of its dissolved and suspended solids and
almost all dissolved gases. High- and low-pressure units connected
directly to the potable water lines should have the ability to go to the
waste system if the distillate is not fit for use. As water is evaporated
at low temperatures (<80 °C) in low-pressure units, it cannot be
guaranteed that the distillate is free from pathogens. According to ISO
standards, water that has been produced at temperatures below 80 °C
needs to be disinfected before it can be defined as potable.

30   Guide to ship sanitation
Disinfection should be implemented in the water treatment process,
ideally in a way that guarantees that all water (including bunkered
water) is treated before reaching the potable water tank. A distillation
plant or other process that supplies water to the ship’s potable water
system must not operate in polluted waters or harbour areas, as some
volatile pollutants may be carried through this process.
Treatment facilities should be designed to ensure efficient operation
with the production of potable water that conforms to the GDWQ (WHO,
2011) or any relevant authority’s requirements.

Materials
Materials used in the construction of all of the surfaces (hoses,
couplings, pipes, tanks, fixtures, soldered joints) with which water
may be in contact during production, transfer and storage should be
approved for this purpose by an appropriate authority (regulatory or
independent third party). The water that is being provided should not
be corrosive to those surfaces and fixtures. Factors such as temperature,
pH and alkalinity need to be controlled within appropriate ranges for
the particular water type (see WHO, 2011). Concerns have emerged in
relation to plasticizers, solvents, jointing compounds and coatings used
in water supply and transport systems. It is important to ensure that all
materials that may come in contact with the water supply are suitable
and will not contribute hazardous chemicals to the water. If a pipe or
tank is constructed of a material that requires coating, such coating
should not lead to the water becoming toxic or otherwise unfit for
human consumption (e.g. chemical odour). Materials and devices must
be suitable for hot or cold water use, as applicable.

Potable water tanks
Potable water needs to be stored in tanks constructed and located so as
to be protected from any contamination from inside or outside the tank.
Tanks need to be designed so that cross-connections between them and
tanks holding non-potable water or pipes containing non-potable water
are prevented. Ideally, potable water tanks should be located in rooms
that have no sources of heat emission or dirt.
Potable water tanks must be constructed of metal or other suitable
material that is safe for contact with potable water, and must be robust
enough to exclude contamination. Proper maintenance of anticorrosive
coatings in water tanks is important. Ideally, potable water tanks would
not share a common wall with the hull or other tanks containing non-
potable liquids. No drainage line of any kind or any pipe carrying wash



                                                             2 Water   31
water, salt water or other non-potable liquid should pass through potable
water tanks. If this is unavoidable, pipes should only pass through
potable water tanks in a watertight tunnel that is self-draining. Similarly,
it is best that soil waste drains not pass over potable water tanks or
wash-water tank manholes. It is also best if toilets and bathroom spaces
do not extend over any part of a deck that forms the top of a potable
water or wash-water tank.
Every potable water storage tank will need to be provided with a vent
located and constructed to prevent the entrance of contaminating
substances and vectors. For example, the opening of the vent should be
protected by a tight mesh to prevent the entrance of insects. Because
of the ship’s movement, increased air exchange may take place in
potable water tanks. To avoid intrusion of harmful particles, filters
that are designed to exclude substances such as dirt and exhaust gases
should be used. These filters need to be cleaned or exchanged regularly.
Ventilating pipes should not end directly above the water surface, to
avoid substances dripping into the water body. A potable water tank vent
should not be connected to the vent of any tank holding, or intended for
holding, non-potable liquid, as cross-contamination may occur.
It is important that the potable water tank be provided with an overflow
or relief valve, located so that the test head of the tank is not exceeded.
The overflow must be constructed and protected in the same manner
recommended for vents. An overflow may be combined with a vent, but
the provisions described for the construction and protection of both
vents and overflows must be observed.
The potable water tank should be designed to be completely drained in
case there is a need to dump water to remove contamination. The end
of the tank suction line should be no closer than 50 mm above the tank
bottom, to avoid the intake of sediment or biofilms.
Any means provided for determining the depth of water in potable
water tanks should be constructed to prevent the entrance of
contaminated substances or liquids. Potable water tanks need to be
equipped with facilities to read the filling level of the tank from outside.
This construction should not produce areas of stagnating water that
could become a source of contamination. Manual sounding should not
be performed, as this may lead to unnecessary contamination of the
potable water.
All potable water tanks need to be clearly labelled with their capacity
and words such as “POTABLE WATER TANK”.



32   Guide to ship sanitation
The potable water tank will need an inspection cover giving access for
cleaning, repair and maintenance. To avoid contamination when opening
the cover, the opening should not give direct access to the unprotected
water surface. Construction rules should be in line with standardized
international regulations. An inspection of the empty tank should
be performed periodically (e.g. once per year). If tanks are entered
by people, clean protective clothing should be worn. Staff should be
equipped with a clean, single-use overall, face mask, disposable rubber
gloves and rubber boots that are light in colour, very clean and used only
inside potable water tanks. Boots and any tools used in the tank need
to be disinfected before entering. No people with any acute illness (e.g.
diarrhoea) should be allowed to enter potable water tanks.
Sample cocks should be installed directly on each tank to allow tests
to be taken to verify water quality and must point downwards to avoid
contamination. Sample cocks should be made of material that allows
disinfection and contact with flames for sterilizing. Cold potable water
should always be stored at temperatures below 25 °C. More detailed
information about technical requirements of potable water tanks can be
found in ISO 15748-1.
Potable water tanks and any parts of the potable water distribution
system shall be cleaned, disinfected and flushed with potable water:
• before being placed in service; and
• before returning to operation after repair or replacement; or
• after being subjected to any contamination, including entry into a
   potable water tank.
Potable water tanks shall be inspected, cleaned and disinfected during
dry docks and wet docks or every two years, whichever is less.
Disinfection following potential contamination shall be accomplished
by increasing free residual halogen to at least 50 mg/l throughout the
affected area and maintaining this concentration for 4 hours, or by way
of another procedure recognized by WHO.

Potable water pumps
The potable water pump needs the capacity for regular servicing. To
prevent contamination, the pump should not be used for any purpose
other than pumping potable water. A filter can be installed in the
suction line of the pump. Filters need to be maintained according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (e.g. exchange or regularly backwash).
The installation of a standby pump is recommended for emergencies,
such as breakdown in the main unit serving the potable water system.


                                                              2 Water   33
If this secondary pump and piping are filled with water, they must
be operated alternating with the primary pump to avoid buildup of
microbial contamination in stagnating water. Hand pumps, installed on
some ships to serve galleys and pantries for emergency or routine use as
a supplement to pressure outlets, need to be constructed and installed
to prevent the entrance of contamination. Pumps should ensure
continuous operation when required to maintain pressurization—for
example, by priming automatically. A direct connection from the pump,
with no air gap, should be used when supplying to a potable water tank.

Hydrophore
Hydrophore tanks are used to pressurize the potable water installation
and facilitate the transport of the water through the system. In extended
potable water installations, permanent running potable water pumps
are used instead of hydrophore tanks to establish a continuous positive
pressure at all taps.
Hydrophore tanks need to meet the same criteria as other potable water
tanks. The tanks should be equipped with maintenance openings for
cleaning. They should be of adequate size and located away from any
heat sources. Where compressed air is used to produce the air cushion
inside the hydrophore tank, a filter, liquid trap or similar device must be
installed in the supply line from the compressed air system to protect
the water supply. More detailed information can be found in the ISO
standards.

Calorifier
Calorifiers are used to produce hot water. In small potable water
systems, a so-called decentralized hot-water production system can
be used wherever hot water is needed. In more extended installations,
however, a central hot-water production unit is typically installed in
combination with a hot-water circulation system. Calorifiers should
meet the same materials and construction criteria as all other parts of
the potable water system. They should be equipped with a maintenance
opening and with thermal insulation. To avoid the growth of Legionella
spp., hot water should leave the calorifier at a temperature of at least
60 °C. A hot-water circulation system should be used, and the returning
water should not be colder than 50 °C.




34   Guide to ship sanitation
Water distribution system
Ships should have plumbing suitable to protect water safety. Before being
supplied, new ships should be inspected for compliance with the design
specifications by the relevant competent authority or other authorized
independent body. Technical standards such as ISO standards should be
considered. A clear and accurate layout of the engineered system on the
ship is likely to be needed to support this inspection.
Materials in contact with water need to be safe for the intended purpose.
To help ensure this, in new construction and in repairs and replacements
on old ships, new pipes, tubing or fittings should be used in the potable
water system and in the wash-water system when wash water may be
used to supplement potable water after treatment. All materials used
should be acceptable to the national health administration of the country
of registration. Lead and cadmium materials should not be in contact with
water via pipes, fittings and joints and should not be used anywhere in the
potable water system, as these can leach into and contaminate the water.
Potable water piping should be clearly identifiable to help prevent cross-
connection plumbing errors. To identify potable water piping, a colour
code according to international standards (ISO 14726: blue–green–blue)
can be used.
Crew must be trained to take hygienic precautions when laying new
pipes or repairing existing pipes. It is important in designing the ship to
minimize the points where water could collect and become warm (>25 °C)
and stagnant. For example, temperature-control valves that prevent
scalding must be fitted as close to the point of use as possible to minimize
the formation of warm-water pockets. The number of distribution system
dead ends should be minimized.
If hot-water piping and cold-water piping are laid side by side, appropriate
thermal insulation must be applied to prevent warming or cooling of the
respective pipes and the possibility of bacterial growth.
All piping components should be able to resist water temperatures of
90 °C, to facilitate thermal disinfection whenever necessary.
The distribution system should be designed to avoid the bypassing of any
important treatment or storage processes.

Fixtures (taps, showerheads)
Fixtures and fittings can harbour contamination, and the design needs
to consider how to select suitable attributes to control these risks. To
maintain their integrity, an accepted safe practice is to ensure that all
fixtures are resistant to the corrosive effects of salt water and saline

                                                                2 Water   35
atmospheres. In addition, fixtures must be easy to clean and designed
to function efficiently. To aid cleaning, rounded internal corners are
preferred, wherever practicable.
All fixtures should be able to resist water temperatures of at least 70 °C to
facilitate thermal disinfection whenever necessary.
Potable water outlets must be labelled “POTABLE WATER”. Similarly, non-
potable outlets must be labelled “UNFIT FOR DRINKING”. To encourage
use of the safe potable supply, potable water outlets must be provided in
convenient locations, such as near passenger, officer and crew quarters
and in the engine and boiler rooms. To support food safety, hot and cold
potable water must be supplied under pressure to the galley, pantry and
scullery. Steam to be applied directly to food must be made from potable
water. Boiler steam is a safe means of heating potable water and food if
applied indirectly, through coils, tubes or separate chambers. Hot and
cold potable water must be supplied under pressure to the medical care
spaces for hand-washing and care purposes. Only potable water must be
piped to the freezer for making ice for drinking purposes.
A wash-water system, when installed, can be used to supply slop sinks,
laundry facilities, water closets, bibcock connections for deck flushing
purposes, heated water for dishwashing and water for other special uses.
Wash-water storage tanks shall be constructed and protected so as to
prevent the possibility of contamination in a similar way to potable water.
Any faucets on the wash-water system must be clearly marked “UNFIT
FOR DRINKING”.
Washbasins should have hot and cold potable water lines ending in
a simple mixing outlet to help control growth of bacteria that would
otherwise proliferate in warm-water lines. It is useful to encourage
hygienic behaviour by passengers and crew by placing a sign above the
basin with instructions to “WASH BASIN BEFORE AND AFTER USE”.
Seldom-used taps or showers have a risk of high microbial growth due to
water stagnation. This can lead to contamination of the whole distribution
system and should be avoided. Therefore, seldom-used fixtures should
be regularly flushed for a few minutes to mitigate this risk. A flushing
schedule can be a useful tool to ensure that flushing is performed during
regular maintenance.
The potable hot-water system, including showerheads, shall be
maintained to minimize the growth of pathogenic Mycobacterium or
Legionella bacteria. Showerheads should be cleaned and disinfected




36   Guide to ship sanitation
every six months. Aerators may harbour very high numbers of pathogenic
bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, the aerators should
be regularly cleaned and disinfected.

2. Operational limits, monitoring and corrective actions

Disinfection
When treatment, purification or disinfection is necessary, the method
selected should be recommended by the competent authority under
the IHR 2005 and should be easily operated and maintained by the
ship’s officers and crew. Disinfection is most efficient when the water
has already been treated to remove turbidity and when substances
exerting a disinfectant demand or capable of protecting pathogens from
disinfection have been removed. However, disinfection does not always
eliminate all infectious agents. For example, cross-contamination
can easily affect water with a low residual disinfection. Furthermore,
parasites such as Cryptosporidium produce oocysts that are very
resistant to chlorine or chloramine disinfection and need to be removed
by filtration or inactivated by an alternative method, such as UV
irradiation.
In extended distribution systems, a residual disinfectant should be
maintained to limit the growth of microbial hazards that can impart off-
flavours to the water and foul lines and fittings. Maintaining residual
disinfection (e.g. free chlorine at >0.5 mg/l) will contribute to the
control of Legionella spp., for instance. In addition, this residual may kill
very low levels of some pathogens that may gain entry to the network.
Where chlorine is used as the disinfectant, a satisfactory chlorine
residual (typically around 0.5–1 mg/l for free chlorine or 1 mg/l for
chloramines as water enters the distribution or storage system) should
be maintained.
The disinfectant residual for chlorine (the most common disinfectant)
should ideally be no less than 0.2 mg/l and no more than 5 mg/l. For
effective primary disinfection, there should be a residual free chlorine
concentration of at least 0.5 mg/l after at least 30 minutes’ contact time at
a pH below 8.0. The chlorine residual should be maintained throughout
the distribution system; at the point of delivery, the minimum residual
concentration of free chlorine should be 0.2 mg/l.
A pH above 8.0 will decrease the disinfecting effect of chlorine
significantly. Test kits to check pH before any disinfection and the level
of free and total chlorine during disinfection should be available on
board and used as per the manufacturer’s specifications.


                                                                 2 Water   37
These normal residuals are not adequate, and should not be relied upon,
to disinfect large ingress events. Presence of the residual disinfectant
does not mean that water is necessarily safe. Similarly, absence of a
residual does not mean that the water is necessarily unsafe if the source
is secure and distribution is fully protected.
Process control parameters, such as disinfectant residuals at water
disinfection plants and at the farthest tap (e.g. bridge deck), should
be monitored at a sufficient frequency to detect deviations in control
processes early enough to prevent contaminated water from reaching
users, which ideally means continuous automated monitoring.
Absence of a residual where one would normally be found can be a
useful indicator of cross-contamination. However, many viral and
parasitic pathogens are resistant to low levels of disinfectant, so residual
disinfection should not be relied upon to treat contaminated water. Low
levels of residual may inactivate bacterial indicators such as E. coli and
mask contamination that might harbour more resistant pathogens. In
such cases, superchlorination treatment is typically applied to destroy
the resistant viral and parasitic pathogens. Superchlorination involves
various combinations of time and concentration—for instance, dosing
chlorine to give a final chlorine residual of around 20 mg/l after 1 hour
of contact time.
Whenever the potable water tanks and system or any of their parts have
been placed in service, repaired, replaced or contaminated, they must
be cleaned, disinfected and flushed before being returned to operation.
Where a water distiller is connected to the potable water tank or system,
the pipe and appurtenances between the distiller and the potable water
tank or system must be disinfected and thoroughly flushed with potable
water.
If UV light is intended for disinfection, these devices need to be approved
by the national authorities. UV devices need regular maintenance,
including cleaning and lamp exchange, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Typically, UV devices should be installed vertically to
avoid accumulation of sediments on the lamp. Bypass around UV
devices is neither allowed nor useful because of the increased risk of
contaminating the whole system. In the case of high turbidity, pre-filters
should be used before UV devices to ensure that the unit is operating
within the manufacturer’s specifications. It should be considered that
UV light has no residual effect and that all water needs direct contact
with the light.




38   Guide to ship sanitation
Chemical parameters
Temperature, pH, hardness and alkalinity are controlled within
appropriate ranges for the particular water type to minimize corrosivity
and potential leaching of metals. Metals such as lead, nickel, iron,
cadmium or copper can be leached from some materials into the water
and contribute to adverse taste or, in some cases, health concerns.
Excess copper or iron can cause a metallic taste; copper can cause
gastrointestinal upset; and excess lead can cause cognitive deficits after
long-term high-level exposure in young children. The GDWQ guideline
value for copper is 2 mg/l; iron can be detectable by taste at about
0.3 mg/l; and the lead (provisional) guideline value is 0.01 mg/l. In lieu
of, or in addition to, monitoring for metals, appropriate management
should be achieved through a corrosion control programme.
Disinfectant residuals should be monitored throughout the distribution
system.

Physical and aesthetic parameters
Electrical conductivity of the water should be measured whenever
water is produced on board. A very low electrical conductivity gives
information about a malfunction in the remineralization process.
Turbidity in the potable water on the ship could indicate a gross
contamination with biological material or that dirt has entered the
system during delivery.
No undesirable tastes, colours or odours should be present in the
drinking-water. Aesthetic parameters such as undesirable taste, colour
or odour that appear after water treatment may indicate corrosion or
cross-connections, contamination by foreign substances during transfer
to the ship or inadequate plumbing conditions on board. Complaints
about aesthetic parameters (odour, colour or taste) should trigger
further investigations into water quality and may indicate the need to
monitor turbidity. All these parameters signify the need to determine
their cause and to take corrective actions so that water on the ship is
both potable and palatable. Furthermore, water that is not aesthetically
acceptable will not be consumed, and passengers and crew may instead
consume alternative, less safe water.
Cool water is generally more palatable than warm water, and temperature
will have an impact on the acceptability of a number of other inorganic
constituents that may affect taste. High water temperature enhances the
growth of microorganisms and may increase taste, odour, colour and
corrosion problems (WHO, 2011).


                                                              2 Water   39
The occurrence of Legionella spp. in high numbers in drinking-
water supplies is preventable through implementation of basic water
quality management measures, including maintaining piped water
temperatures outside the range at which Legionella spp. proliferate to
high levels (25–50 °C). This can be achieved by setting heaters to ensure
that hot water is delivered to all taps at or above 50 °C (which can mean
requiring temperatures above 55 °C at the recirculating point and in the
return line of hot-water circulation systems) and insulating all pipes and
storage tanks to ensure that water is maintained outside the temperature
range 25–50 °C. However, maintaining operating temperatures of hot-
water systems above 50 °C may result in increased energy requirements
and present a scalding risk for young children, the elderly and mentally
handicapped persons. In cold-water distribution systems, temperatures
should be maintained at less than 25 °C throughout the system to
provide effective control. However, this may not be achievable in all
systems, particularly those in hot climates. Maintaining disinfectant
residuals above 0.2 mg/l throughout the piped distribution system and
storage tanks will contribute to the control of Legionella spp. in such
circumstances. Disinfection devices using UV light can be installed in the
distribution system to reduce the risk of contamination by Legionella
spp. Water flow in the distribution system should also be maintained
during periods of reduced activity (Bartram et al., 2007).

Prevention of backflow
When potable water is delivered to non-potable systems and supplied
under pressure, the system must be protected against backflow by either
backflow preventers or air gaps. If backflow preventers fail, negative
pressure can arise, and this can lead to ingress of contaminants into
the system. The ship should have a comprehensive programme that
provides safe connections to the potable water system through air gaps
or appropriate backflow-prevention devices at high-hazard locations.
To prevent contamination, it is advisable to ensure that the potable water
system is not connected to any non-potable water system. To achieve this,
overflows, vents and drains from tanks, and drains from the distribution
system must not be connected directly to sewage drains. When drain
lines are extended towards the bottom of the ship, they must terminate
a suitable distance above the inner-bottom plating or above the highest
point of the bilge in the absence of such plating, unless backflow is
impossible. Air gaps and receiving funnels must be installed in these lines
when they discharge to a closed tank of a non-potable water, to a deck
drain or to a sanitary drain. Potable water piping must not pass under
or through sewage tanks, or pipes or tanks holding non-potable liquids.
The distribution lines, including suction lines of the potable water pump,

40   Guide to ship sanitation
should not be cross-connected with the piping or storage tanks of any
non-potable water system. Potable water lines must be located so that
they will not be submerged in bilge water or pass through tanks storing
non-potable liquids.
Examples of areas where backflow prevention may be used are:
• potable water supply lines to swimming pools, whirlpools, hot tubs,
   bathtubs, showers and similar facilities;
• photographic laboratory developing machines;
• beauty and barber shop spray-rinse hoses;
• garbage grinders;
• hospital and laundry equipment;
• air-conditioning expansion tanks;
• boiler-feed water tanks;
• fire systems;
• toilets;
• freshwater or saltwater ballast systems;
• bilge water or other wastewater locations;
• international shore connections;
• any other connection between the potable and non-potable water
   systems.
Each backflow preventer must be scheduled for inspection and service
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and as necessary to
prevent the device’s failure. To facilitate this, backflow preventers should
be located in easily accessible areas. A standard backflow preventer or
other device to prevent the flow of water from ship to shore must be
installed on every ship. Drainage to prevent freezing may need to be
provided. The ship’s crew needs to undertake, or commission, regular
checks and tests on the adequacy of backflow preventers, possible cross-
connection points, leaks, defective pipes, pressure and disinfectant
residuals. This should be included in a routine, comprehensive sanitary
inspection programme.
Individual air gaps must be placed in drain lines from certain types of
fixtures, such as refrigeration units and all hospital, food preparation
and food-servicing equipment, when such drainage is to a system that
receives sewage or hospital wastes, unless, for example, drains are
independent of each other and of all other drainage systems.
The sanitary or overboard water system, including all pumps, piping
and fixtures, should be completely independent of the potable water

                                                                2 Water   41
and wash-water systems. All faucets and outlets on the sanitary system
should be clearly labelled “UNFIT FOR DRINKING”. Any bidets installed
should be of the jet type, and any potable or wash-water line serving
them should be equipped with a backflow preventer.
To control cross-contamination, saltwater service to bathtubs and
showers must be independent, with no cross-connections to either the
potable water or wash-water systems.
When a ship is without power to operate its pumps, it may connect its
firefighting system to the shore potable water system. If the connection
remains after the ship’s power system is restored, the non-potable
water from the ship’s firefighting system may accidentally be pumped
back into the shore potable water system. Measures should be put in
place to ensure that this does not occur.

Verification monitoring
Regular water quality monitoring must be performed to demonstrate
that source water being supplied to the port and potable water on board
are not contaminated with fresh faecal material or other microbial and
chemical hazards. Regular monitoring of each parameter is necessary to
ensure that safe water quality is maintained, as each step in the water
transfer chain provides an opportunity for contamination. Monitoring
needs to be specific in terms of what, how, when and who. The focus for
the control of process operations should be on simple measurements
that must be done online and in the field. In most cases, routine
monitoring will be based on simple surrogate observations or tests,
such as turbidity or structural integrity, rather than complex microbial
or chemical tests. Infrastructure should be monitored (e.g. checks for
filter cracks and pipe leaks, defective backflow preventers or cross-
connections). Filters need to be exchanged or backwashed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Seldom-used taps and showers should
be flushed regularly to avoid microbial growth due to stagnating water,
with both actions described in the WSP. Disinfection must be monitored
online by measurements of residual disinfectant, turbidity, pH and
temperature; a direct feedback and control system must be included.
As such tests can be carried out rapidly, they are often preferred to
microbiological testing. It is essential that all monitoring equipment
be calibrated for accuracy and checked against independent readings.
Records of readings must be documented. Periodic sanitary surveys of
the storage and distribution system are an important part of any WSP.
These are inexpensive to carry out and can complement routine water
quality measurements.


42   Guide to ship sanitation
Monitoring actions need to provide information in sufficient time that
corrective action can be taken to ensure that process controls will
prevent contaminated water from reaching passengers and crew.
Aesthetic parameters such as odour, colour or taste are typically
“measured” through consumer complaints, although the crew may also
wish to do an independent periodic check. This is a subjective parameter,
as individuals have different sensitivities.
Some countries may request additional monitoring for parameters over
and above those suggested by the GDWQ within their jurisdiction, for
operational or regulatory reasons. Ports and ship operators should verify
with their local authority whether additional monitoring is required. This
should be included in the WSP.

Investigative and corrective action
In the event of contamination of water on the ship, the ship’s operator
or master should notify persons on board who may be affected to take
immediate mitigation measures or arrange for an alternative water
supply. Appropriate action may include additional treatment, or flushing
and disinfection of transfer equipment or ship water tanks.
Specific corrective actions must be developed for each control measure
in the WSP to deal with deviations when they occur. The actions must
ensure that the control point has been brought under control. They may
include repair of defective filters, repair or replacement of pipes or tanks
or breaking of cross-connections.
The ability to change temporarily to alternative water sources is one of
the most useful corrective actions available but is not always possible.
Backup disinfection plans may be necessary.
Investigative action and response could be as basic as reviewing records
or could include more comprehensive corrective action. Corrective action
should involve remedying any mechanical, operational or procedural
defect in the water supply system that has led to critical limits or guideline
values being exceeded. In the case of mechanical defects, remedies should
include maintenance, upgrading or refurbishment of facilities. In the case
of operational defects, actions should include changes to supplies and
equipment. In the case of procedural defects, such as improper practices,
standard operating procedures and training programmes should be
evaluated and changed, with personnel retrained. Any such changes
should be incorporated into the WSP.
The competent authority under the IHR 2005 should be informed
whenever required by the national regulations of the port State and in

                                                                  2 Water   43
all cases of illnesses and/or complex problems on board. Reporting of
illnesses and sanitary conditions that may pose a public health risk (e.g.
water system in poor condition) is an international obligation under the
IHR 2005.
Oversight should be provided to ensure that corrective actions are
implemented in accordance with written procedures and quickly
enough to minimize exposure of the travelling public and crew members.
Oversight could be performed by the responsible party for that segment
of the supply chain or by an independent party, such as a regulatory
authority.
Emergency or contingency actions may need to be taken, such as
provision of water from alternative sources. During periods when
corrective action is being taken, increased monitoring is required.

3. Management and communication

Verification monitoring
Verification monitoring of potable water on the ship is carried out at
locations selected to ensure that persons on board are provided with
safe water. Verification steps should be adequate to provide assurance
that water quality has been maintained at, or restored to, safe levels. It
is important to separate verification monitoring from less sophisticated
measures such as simple on-site tests and more complex procedures
such as sampling for microbiological and chemical laboratory analysis.
While simple on-site tests (e.g. regular verification and operational
monitoring of pH and chlorination) can be performed by appropriately
trained and competent ship staff, sampling for complex chemical and/
or microbiological analysis should always be performed by well-trained
professional persons who are authorized by a certified laboratory. Only
special sampling containers (e.g. sterile glass bottles that contain sodium
thiosulfate for microbiological samples or special polyethylene bottles
for chemical samples) should be used. Usually samples are taken in one
port, and the ship will leave port while the results are still pending. Often
the results need to be interpreted by the next port, and therefore it is
desirable to follow a defined sampling scheme and sampling procedures
(e.g. according to ISO 19458) to provide internationally comparable
results.
A standard sampling scheme should be developed for each ship,
depending on the size and complexity of the potable water system.
At a minimum, it is diligent to take a sample directly from the tank
(sampling taps are necessary) and one sample at the farthest point of


44   Guide to ship sanitation
the distribution system (e.g. tap at the bridge deck). The tank sample
gives information about the quality of the water supply on board, while
the bridge sample gives information about the quality of the water for
the consumer. If both samples have been taken at the same time, they
can be compared to provide information about the influence of the
distribution system. This is an easy and affordable way to obtain a quick
overview of the system’s status.
Sampling guidelines for physicochemical and microbiological analysis
can be found in Volume 3 of the 2nd edition of the GDWQ, Surveillance and
control of community supplies (WHO, 1997), and in ISO 19458:2006—
Water quality—Sampling for microbiological analysis.
Detailed information about useful sampling schemes, sampling
procedures, standard parameters and action triggers is given in
section 2.2.4.
Laboratories engaged for potable water analysis should refer to
international quality standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 17025).
It is recommended that E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms be
monitored at representative taps (e.g. drinking fountains). Monitoring
should take place at each major servicing, in addition to regular E. coli
spot checks while in service.
HPC can be used as an indicator of general water quality within the
distribution system. An increase in HPC indicates post-treatment
contamination, regrowth within the water conveyed by the distribution
system or the presence of deposits and biofilms in the system. A sudden
increase in HPC above historical baseline values should trigger actions
to investigate and, if necessary, remediate the situation.
Testing for Legionella bacteria serves as a form of verification that the
controls are working. It should be undertaken periodically, such as
monthly, quarterly or annually, depending on the type of ship environment
and the climate of the shipping passage. This testing should not replace or
pre-empt the emphasis on control strategies. Furthermore, the tests are
relatively specialized and need to be undertaken by properly equipped
laboratories with experienced staff. Verification sampling should focus on
system extremities and high-risk sites.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause a range of infections but rarely
causes serious illness in healthy individuals without some predisposing
factor. It predominantly colonizes damaged sites such as burns and
surgical wounds, the respiratory tracts of people with underlying
disease and physically damaged eyes. From these sites, it may invade


                                                               2 Water   45
the body, causing destructive lesions or septicaemia and meningitis.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa can multiply in water environments and
also on the surface of suitable organic materials in contact with water.
Pseudomonas can be found frequently in aerators and showerheads.
The presence of high numbers of P. aeruginosa in potable water can be
associated with complaints about taste, odour and turbidity. If there is
any evidence of stagnating water or inappropriate maintenance of taps
and showerheads (especially in medical areas), a test for occurrence of
P. aeruginosa should be completed.
The principal concern for toxic chemicals in potable water on board
is most likely metals, such as lead, nickel, iron, cadmium or copper, or
other chemicals leached from the distribution system into the water
that can contribute to adverse taste or, in some cases, health concerns.
For ships that produce their own water from seawater, other chemicals
may be of concern, such as boron and bromide. The choice of chemicals
to be monitored depends on the situation. All samples need to meet
GDWQ or national standards (whichever are stricter) for chemicals with
potentially significant effects associated with chronic exposures.
In certain situations, the frequency of monitoring should be increased for
a period necessary to determine appropriate corrective action and/or
provide assurance that measured parameters have been maintained at,
or returned to, safe levels. Examples of situations warranting increased
monitoring are positive E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliform
results, excessively humid conditions, natural disasters affecting source
water quality, significant increase in HPC and maintenance activities
that have the potential to affect water quality.

Record keeping
Documentation of monitoring should be kept for assurance and analysis
in the event of an incident. Documentation should be showed to the
competent authority under the IHR 2005 whenever requested.
Documentation of inspection, maintenance, cleaning, disinfection (to
include concentration and contact time of disinfectant) and flushing
shall be maintained for 12 months and shall be available.

Training
Crew should be suitably trained by experienced professionals in all
aspects of their operation and maintenance of the water supply system.
Examples of specific training areas are aspects of bunkering procedures,
onboard water production, temperature and stagnation, maintenance of
the water system and all treatment components.

2.2.4 Guideline 2.4: Independent surveillance

  Guideline 2.4—Independent surveillance of potable water
  safety is performed by a competent authority under the
  IHR 2005.

Indicators for Guideline 2.4
1. Audit/inspection procedures are put in place by a competent
   authority under the IHR 2005.
2. Documentation and implementation of a WSP are reviewed, and
   feedback is provided.
3. An independent competent authority under the IHR 2005 responds
   to reports of incidents with the potential to adversely affect public
   health.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.4
One limitation with water quality monitoring is that, by the time
contamination is detected, it is likely that some of the contaminated
water has been consumed. Therefore, surveillance should extend to
auditing, whereby the processes in place to protect water quality are
checked on board ship and at port by an appropriately experienced
auditor.
Ship water quality surveillance is an ongoing investigative activity that
is undertaken to identify and evaluate potential health risks associated
with the use and consumption of potable water on board. Surveillance
protects public health by promoting the improvement of quality,
quantity, accessibility and continuity of potable water supplies. This
guideline addresses surveillance of these factors only and does not
address surveillance relating to monitoring of, or response to, outbreaks
or other disease events (i.e. public health surveillance).
Levels of surveillance of drinking-water quality differ widely.
Surveillance should be developed and expanded progressively, by
adapting the level to the local situation and economic resources,
with gradual implementation, consolidation and development of the
programme to the level ultimately desired. When accepting a WSP, the
competent authority under the IHR 2005 in a given jurisdiction may take
responsibility for surveillance of the programme, which may include
performing random water sampling and auditing the WSP programme.




                                                             2 Water   47
Although this guideline addresses surveillance by oversight authorities,
many concepts discussed could be employed by the water supplier to
ensure that the WSP is being implemented effectively.

1. Establishment of procedures
In most cases, surveillance consists primarily of sanitary inspections,
based on the WSP, of ports, watering facilities or ships. Sanitary
inspection is a tool for determining the state of the water supply
infrastructure and identification of actual or potential faults and should
be carried out regularly.
A State health inspector should have the authority to conduct
independent inspections and verify the reliability of the supplier’s
information. This does not normally need to be as frequent as the
continuous control performed by ports and ship operators.
Surveillance should be accomplished by authorized and trained officers
from public health authorities. Alternatively, the services of qualified
independent auditors may be used if they have been authorized by the
relevant competent health authority.
Specifications for qualifications of the inspectors should be established,
and inspectors should undergo adequate training, including periodic
updates and recertification. Independent auditors and inspectors should
meet the same requirements as those from the public health authorities.

2. Review of documentation and plan implementation
WSPs should be provided by the port authority and the ship operators,
and all documentation pertaining to the WSPs should be reviewed. The
independent review of the WSPs should include a systematic approach,
based on the components of the WSPs, by external auditing of the
documentation, implementation and monitoring of critical control
points.
Components of the independent review include inspection of crew
personal hygiene through the demonstration of crew members following
procedures, inspections of equipment and environmental conditions
to ensure that dedicated equipment is used and stored under sanitary
conditions, recording these inspections, and water sampling through
on-site or laboratory tests. Periodic microbiological surveillance of the
entire water supply system from the source to representative taps on
board should be a key priority because of the acute risk to health posed
by pathogens in drinking-water. Verification of compliance with water
standards should start at the source and extend throughout the water


48   Guide to ship sanitation
distribution system. Each water source, transfer point or critical point
in the distribution system and end-point should be monitored. If this is
not possible, at a minimum, end-points and tanks should be monitored,
but it should be possible to trace back when an unsatisfactory result is
found.
Inspection of procedures or control systems should be adequate to
provide assurance that responsible parties in the water supply chain are
able to implement timely corrective measures. Supporting programmes
should be reviewed to ensure that management procedures and training
are adequate to maintain a safe supply of water.
Communication procedures by and to the water supplier, port authority,
delivery points, ship operator and the public should also be reviewed.
A notification system should be established that integrates all parties
within the water supply and transfer chain.

3. Response to incidents
Response to incidents may include written reports from the responsible
party or independent inspectors or written or verbal reports
from affected individuals or their representatives. The competent
authority under the IHR 2005 should investigate reports of incidents
by interviewing reporters, responsible parties and other affected
individuals and independently verifying water quality and relevant
process parameters (maintenance checklists, training records, etc.)
through on-site inspections and other means. The competent authority
under the IHR 2005 should coordinate with and advise responsible
parties on appropriate corrective actions (modifications to water safety,
management, training and maintenance plans, notification of potentially
affected individuals, etc.) and ensure that remedial action plans are
effective and implemented.

Sampling scheme
Sampling must be done by professionally trained personnel only.
Sampling procedures for microbiological testing of potable water are
described in ISO 19458. Laboratories should analyse the water according
to internationally accepted technical standards, such as ISO/IEC 17025.
It is important that sampling methods and analytical procedures are
comparable from laboratory to laboratory and from State to State.
Examples of parameters frequently tested in potable water and typical
values are given in Table 2‑2.

Before a standard sampling scheme can be defined, it is necessary to
consider that there are two reasons for sampling:
• standard surveillance to perform verification of good management
• more detailed inspection in case of suspected problems.
In case of suspected problems, either a broad assessment or a focused
search in the system can be completed. The sampling should be performed
after an inspection of the whole system. WHO’s Recommended procedures
for inspection of ships and issuance of ship sanitation certificates (WHO,
2010) provide more detailed information for a system assessment on
board. When monitoring, a standard sampling scheme can be very
useful to provide reliable and comparable information.
The explanations below give information about how to select a sampling
point, action triggers to decide which parameters should be examined
and procedures for taking samples.
All procedures should be discussed in advance with the laboratory that
will analyse the samples to avoid any misunderstandings.
If the water has been produced on board or water has been bunkered
from ashore, the water quality in the ship’s tank gives information
about the source water quality. Sampling should be performed directly
from a defined and labelled sampling tap installed at the tank, referring
to a suitable procedure such as that described in ISO 19458 purpose
“A”: “Disinfect or sterilize the sampling tap with a gas burner or with
suitable disinfection liquid (e.g. Ethanol 70%), let water flow out until
the temperature is constant (or at least 10 litres if directly taken from
the tank) and fill the sterile sampling bottle”.
Where water is used for human consumption on board ship, it has to be
potable. If information is needed about the influence of the distribution
system, the farthest tap should be examined to inform the assessor of
the highest potential risk. This tap typically can be found at the bridge
deck. Here an additional sample should be taken, referring to a suitable
procedure such as ISO 19458 purpose “B”: “Remove aerator, clean the
tap, disinfect or sterilize the tap by using disinfection liquid or gas
burner, let some water flow out (approximately 2–3 Litres) and fill the
sterile sampling bottle”.
Whenever the water temperature is between 25 °C and 50 °C, a high
risk of contamination by Legionella spp. exists. The main risk is that
contaminated aerosols can be inhaled (e.g. in the shower). Therefore, at
least one shower should be examined within a monitoring programme.
It is useful to take a cold-water and hot-water sample from the same


52   Guide to ship sanitation
shower to avoid unnecessary follow-up sampling. Sampling for Legionella
spp. analysis is not defined in ISO 19458 but could be performed as
follows: Choose a sampling point (e.g. showerhead), do not remove the
showerhead and hose, do not disinfect the showerhead or hose, open
the cold-water tap, let 2–3 litres flow out, take the sample, measure
the temperature, let the cold water flow for 5 minutes and measure the
temperature again, then close the cold-water tap. Open the hot-water
tap, let 2–3 litres flow out, take the sample, measure the temperature,
let the hot water flow for 5 minutes and measure the temperature again,
then close the hot-water tap. Additionally to the sampling at one shower,
a sample at the flow line and at the return line close to the calorifier can
be useful to get information on whether the whole system or just the
single shower is contaminated.
When evidence is found of stagnating water or otherwise poorly
maintained fixtures in medical areas, testing for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa can be useful. In this case, sampling should refer to a suitable
procedure such as ISO 19458 purpose “C”: “Choose a sampling point, do
not remove aerators or showerheads, do not disinfect or sterilize the
fixture or showerhead, open the tap and take the sample immediately”.
The same sampling procedure should be applied at suspect taps if there
is any outbreak on board that may be associated with a waterborne
organism.
When there is any evidence of malfunction in water rehardening
procedures (e.g. missing pre-acidification, high pH, low conductivity,
low hardness, colour changes in water or at surfaces that are in contact
with water), a chemical analysis of dissolved metals should be arranged
from one tap. Two different methods can be applied:
Method A:    Take one sample directly from the tap without any other
             measures in advance. Usually a polyethylene bottle with a
             volume of 1 litre would be used. This method requires just
             one sample but will not provide further information on the
             contamination source. The disadvantage of this method is
             that there is no information about the stagnation time of
             the water in the piping before the sample has been taken.
Method B:    Advise the officer in charge on board to begin 4 hours before
             sampling with the following procedure: Flush the chosen
             sampling tap (e.g. bridge deck) thoroughly for at least 15–
             20 minutes, and close and secure the tap against accidental
             use until the next sample is required (in 4 hours).




                                                                2 Water   53
                 For sampling, three polyethylene bottles with a volume of 1
                 litre should be used.
                 Bottle 1: Open the tap and fill the bottle immediately.
                 Bottle 2: Let 2–3 litres of water flow through, and fill the
                 second bottle.
                 Bottle 3: Let the water flow for at least 15–20 minutes, and
                 fill the third bottle.
The analysis of bottle 1 will give information about influence of the
fixture; bottle 2 represents the influence of the piping; and bottle 3
provides information about the water source.
If tank coatings or other materials that are in contact with the potable
water appear to render the water unfit for human consumption (e.g.
chemical odour), a specialized chemical analysis should be performed.
Whenever water samples are taken on board or ashore, some on-site
parameters should be measured, as these can change while samples are
transported to the laboratory. These parameters are pH, level of free
chlorine, level of total chlorine, conductivity, temperature and turbidity.
These values should always be documented, together with detailed
information about how and where the samples have been taken.
To obtain reliable and comparable information about the sanitary status
of the potable water installation, it is recommended that samples be
taken at the same places (e.g. always at the tank and from the bridge
deck).
To establish communication between different ports in international
travel, it is recommended that the water quality analysis reports be
issued in English. The sampling points should be clearly indicated,
and all analysis results should be clearly documented. It should be
considered that some port States do not accept potable water analysis
reports when they do not make clear that the laboratory was working
according to a suitable procedure, such as ISO/IEC 17025.

3 Food


3.1    Background
This chapter focuses on foodborne disease, including disease associated
with bottled water and ice. The previous chapter (chapter 2) considered
disease associated with potable water supplied on board.

3.1.1 Food supply and transfer chain
Foodborne outbreaks have been associated with sourcing unsafe food.
Therefore, the first preventive strategy should be to source safe food.
Even if the sourced food is safe, measures need to be put in place to
ensure that it remains safe during the transfer, storage, preparation and
serving activities that follow. An understanding of the ship food supply
and transfer chain will help to illustrate the points at which the food can
become contaminated en route to the point of consumption.
Generally, the ship food supply and transfer chain consists of five major
components that provide multiple opportunities for the introduction, or
proliferation, of contaminants in food:
• the source of food coming into the port;
• transfer of food to storage points on board ship;
• storage and general distribution of food on board ship;
• preparation and serving of food, including cooking and mixing by
   food handlers;
• handling and storage of food for personal consumption by passengers
   or crew, including taking food away and storing it in private areas for
   subsequent consumption.

3.1.2 Health risks associated with food on ships
Significant levels of foodborne disease transmission on ships have been
reported. The Rooney et al. (2004) review of more than 100 outbreaks
associated with ships found that two fifths of the outbreaks reported
were foodborne outbreaks. As more than one third of the reviewed
outbreaks could not be associated with any specific exposure route,
the true contribution from foodborne transmission to the total may be
significantly higher. The Rooney et al. (2004) review provided important
information on examples, and possible causes, of foodborne disease,
and these examples are cited throughout this chapter.



                                                                         55
Importantly, the majority of reported foodborne disease outbreaks
were caused by pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Shigella
spp. and Vibrio spp. The symptoms of bacterial infections can be more
severe and prolonged than are typically observed with more common
viral diseases or Cryptosporidium infection. This implies an enhanced
morbidity burden due to foodborne disease, which further emphasizes
the significance of this exposure route.
Foodborne disease is often referred to generally as “food poisoning”,
which has, in turn, been defined by WHO as “any disease of an infectious
or toxic nature caused by or thought to be caused by the consumption
of food”. This definition includes all illness, regardless of the presenting
symptoms and signs, thought to have been caused by food. The
definition includes acute illnesses characterized by diarrhoea and/or
vomiting and illnesses presenting with manifestations not related to
the gastrointestinal tract, such as scrombotoxin poisoning, paralytic
shellfish poisoning, botulism and listeriosis. In addition, the definition
includes illness caused by toxic chemicals but excludes illness due to
known allergies and food intolerances. Note that “foodborne” refers
to the probable source of the infection, not the nature of the signs and
symptoms. Many of the signs and symptoms of the diseases that can
be foodborne can also be acquired by other routes, such as person-to-
person and waterborne transmission.
Foodborne biological hazardous agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi
and parasites. These organisms are commonly associated with humans,
with raw products entering the food preparation site and with the
occurrence of pests. Many of these microorganisms occur naturally in
the environment where food is grown. Therefore, some contamination
by these pathogens can be expected in raw food.
A range of helminthic and protozoan parasites can contaminate food.
Many are zoonotic (capable of infecting many species of animals and
humans), so meat and poultry can become directly contaminated at
source. Some diseases are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, whereas
others are transmitted via consumption of contaminated flesh. Parasitic
infections are commonly associated with undercooked meat products
or contaminated ready-to-eat food. Some parasites in products that are
intended to be eaten raw, marinated or partially cooked can be killed by
effective freezing techniques (the precise conditions that are appropriate
will depend on the nature of both the food and the parasites).
Chemical contaminants in food may be inadvertently added during
the growing phase, be naturally occurring or be added accidentally


56   Guide to ship sanitation
during processing—for example, by the misuse of cleaning chemicals
or pesticides. Examples of naturally occurring chemicals are mycotoxins
(e.g. aflatoxin), scombrotoxin (histamine), ciguatoxin, mushroom toxins
and shellfish toxins.
Some of the causal hazards associated with foodborne disease outbreaks
associated with ships are listed in Table 3‑1 (Rooney et al., 2004). Note
that in some foodborne outbreaks, the causative agent may not have
been identified.

Factors contributing to foodborne outbreaks on board ship have
included:
• contaminated raw ingredients
• inadequate temperature control
• inadequate heat treatment
• infected food handlers
• use of seawater in the galley.




                                                                      3 Food    57
Bacteria and fungi present significant risks for two reasons:
• Both raw and cooked food can provide a fertile medium and support
   rapid growth of these organisms. Food can become recontaminated
   after it has cooled, such that cooked food is not necessarily safe.
• There are toxins of fungal and bacterial origin that are relatively heat
   stable and can remain at hazardous levels even after cooking.
Therefore, the contamination levels in raw food should be minimized
even when cooking occurs.
Unlike bacteria and fungi, human pathogenic viruses are unable to
reproduce outside a living cell. In general, they cannot replicate in food
and can only be carried by it. Furthermore, most foodborne viruses
affecting humans are limited to human hosts. This makes contamination
by the unclean hands of infected food handlers or from human faecal
contamination the prime risk factors.
The presence of non-potable water on ships can also present additional
risks for food contamination. Only potable water should be supplied
to the galley, and food should not be held at ambient temperature for
extended periods.
Outbreaks have been associated with presymptomatic, symptomatic
and post-symptomatic food handlers, and viral shedding can occur from
asymptomatic infected individuals. Infected food handlers should be
encouraged to report symptoms and be excluded from work until at least
48 hours after symptoms have ceased. Exposed food that will not be cooked,
such as fruit, should be discarded if it may have become contaminated.
The pressure on space and facilities on board ship can lead to a lack of
adequate facilities and equipment, and this can be a contributing factor
in causing disease. For example, in an outbreak of multiple antibiotic–
resistant Shigella flexneri 4a, the spread of infection by a food handler
may have been facilitated by limited availability of toilet facilities for the
galley crew (Lew et al., 1991). Conveniently located hand-washing and
toilet facilities are a prerequisite for hygienic handling of food.

3.1.3 International Health Regulations (2005)
The IHR 2005 contain provisions for the State Party to designate
ports to develop core capacities, such as the capacity to ensure a safe
environment for travellers using port facilities, including potable water
and eating establishments (Annex 1B1(d) of the IHR 2005).
In accordance with Articles 22(b), 22(e) and 24(c) of the IHR 2005,
Member States are required to take all practicable measures to ensure


58   Guide to ship sanitation
that international conveyance operators keep their conveyances free
from sources of contamination and infection, and competent authorities
are responsible for ensuring that the facilities at international ports are
in sanitary condition and for supervising the removal and safe disposal
of any contaminated water and food from a conveyance.
However, it is the responsibility of each ship operator to apply all
practicable measures to ensure that no sources of infection and
contamination are present on board, including in the water system or
food supplies. For this purpose, it is important that these standards are
upheld on board ships and at ports, in terms of the safety of the food
served, from the source of supply ashore to distribution on board ship.

3.1.4 Overview of food safety plans, and hazard analysis and
      critical control points
The Codex Alimentarius Commission implements the Joint Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/WHO Food
Standards Programme, the purpose of which is to protect the health
of consumers and to ensure fair practices in the food trade. The Codex
Alimentarius is a collection of internationally adopted food standards
presented in a uniform manner. It also includes advisory provisions
in the form of codes of practice, guidelines and other recommended
measures to assist in achieving its purposes (FAO/WHO, 1995, 1997a,
1997b, 1999, 2003). Codex Alimentarius guidance provides important
information on basic food safety, which will be referred to throughout
this chapter.
The ILO has developed labour standards that include consideration of
food and catering requirements and competencies for merchant ships.
Food safety plans (FSPs) are required to manage the process of providing
safe food. Typically, the FSP is based around hazard analysis and critical
control point (HACCP) methodology, which is described in detail by
FAO/WHO (2003), ISO (ISO 22000:2005—Food safety management
systems—Requirements for any organization in the food chain) and
the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods
(1997). The base reference in this document for food safety management
is HACCP. There may be other acceptable food safety management
programmes that involve partial application of the full HACCP system.
A modern FSP would generally be based around HACCP principles and
the prerequisite supporting programmes. The FSP is intended to provide
a systematic approach to identifying specific hazards and measures
for their control to ensure the safety of food. The FSP should be used


                                                                3 Food   59
as a tool to assess hazards and establish control systems that focus
on prevention rather than relying mainly on end-product testing. The
FSP should be capable of accommodating change, such as changes to
the ship menus, layout and equipment; advances in equipment design;
changes in processing procedures; or technological developments.
FSP implementation should be guided by scientific evidence of risks
to human health. As well as enhancing food safety, implementation of
an FSP can provide other significant benefits, including a framework
to support inspection and certification by regulatory authorities and
registrars. The successful implementation of an FSP requires the full
commitment and involvement of both management and the workforce.
The prerequisite or supporting programmes that form part of an FSP
typically include:
• good design
• quality construction
• hygienic work practices
• training of chefs and food handlers
• quality assurance of raw material ingredients
• operation in accordance with any appropriate food safety legislation.
The core HACCP steps and principles will be briefly described as they
relate to ships. It is important when applying HACCP to be flexible,
where appropriate, given the context of the application and taking into
account the nature and size of the operation.

Preliminary steps
• Step 1. Assemble the HACCP team. The ship operator should ensure
  that the appropriate knowledge and expertise are available for the
  development of an effective HACCP plan. The scope of the HACCP
  plan should be identified.
• Step 2. Describe the products. Full description should be given,
  including storage conditions.
• Step 3. Identify the intended use of the plan. Vulnerable groups of
  the population (e.g. the elderly or pregnant women) may have to be
  considered, as may allergic groups.
• Step 4. Construct flow diagrams. A flow diagram should cover all
  steps in any given operation.
• Step 5. Conduct on-site confirmation of flow diagrams. The HACCP
  team should confirm the process operation against the flow diagram
  and make amendments where necessary.


60   Guide to ship sanitation
HACCP principles
• Principle 1: Hazard analysis. The team should list all potential
  hazards associated with each step, conduct a hazard analysis
  and consider any measures to control identified hazards. Hazard
  identification includes defining which hazards are of such a nature
  that their elimination or reduction to acceptable levels is essential
  for the preparation of safe food. The HACCP team must then consider
  whether control measures, if any exist, can be applied to each hazard.
  More than one control measure may be required to control a specific
  hazard, and more than one hazard may be controlled by a specified
  control measure. In conducting the hazard analysis, wherever
  possible, the following should be included:
   –– the likely occurrence of hazards and severity of their health
       effects;
   –– the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the presence
       of hazards;
   –– survival or multiplication of microorganisms of concern;
   –– production or persistence in foods of toxins, chemicals or
       physical agents;
   –– conditions leading to the above.
• Principle 2: Determine critical control points (CCPs). CCPs are
  the stages in the preparation and cooking of food that must be
  controlled to ensure the safety of the food. There may be more than
  one CCP at which control is applied to address the same hazard. The
  determination of a CCP in the HACCP system can be facilitated by
  the application of a decision-tree, which indicates a logical reasoning
  approach.
• Principle 3: Establish critical limits for each CCP. Critical limits must
  be specified and technically validated for each CCP. Criteria often
  used include temperature, time and available chlorine.
• Principle 4: Establish a monitoring system for each CCP. Monitoring
  is the scheduled measurement or observation of a CCP relative to
  its critical limits. The monitoring procedures must be able to detect
  loss of control at the CCP. Further, monitoring should ideally provide
  this information in time to make adjustments to ensure control of
  the process to prevent violation of the critical limits. Where possible,
  process adjustments should be made when monitoring results
  indicate a trend towards loss of control at a CCP. If monitoring is
  not continuous, the amount or frequency of monitoring must be
  sufficient to guarantee that the CCP is under control.


                                                                3 Food   61
• Principle 5: Establish corrective actions. Corrective actions must be
  developed for each CCP in the HACCP system to deal with deviations
  when they occur. The actions must ensure that the CCP has been
  brought under control.
• Principle 6: Establish verification procedures. Verification and
  auditing methods, including random sampling and analysis, can be
  used to determine if the HACCP system is working correctly. The
  frequency of verification should be sufficient to confirm that the
  HACCP system is working effectively.
• Principle 7: Establish documentation and record keeping. Efficient
  and accurate record keeping is essential to the application of a HACCP
  system. Documentation and record keeping should be appropriate to
  the nature and size of the ship.
Training programmes should be routinely reviewed and updated where
necessary. Systems should be in place to ensure that food handlers
remain aware of all procedures to maintain the safety and suitability of
food.

3.2     Guidelines
This section provides targeted information and guidance, identifying
responsibilities and providing examples of practices that can control
risks. Thirteen specific guidelines (situations to aim for and maintain) are
presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of indicators (measures
for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance notes (advice on
applying the guidelines and indicators in practice, highlighting the most
important aspects that need to be considered when setting priorities for
action).
The guiding principle for this section is ensuring that food is safe for
intended use at the point of consumption.
Guidelines 3.2–3.13 can be considered components under the umbrella
Guideline 3.1. However, their importance in ensuring safe food on board
ships warrants that they have additional detailed elaboration.

An FSP is designed and implemented for:
1. the food source
2. transfer of food to the ship
3. the ship food storage system
4. the ship food preparation and serving system
5. consumer handling and storage processes on board ship.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.1
Attention should be given to the contemporary use of a preventive,
multiple-barrier risk management approach to food safety, termed the
FSP, and based around the HACCP principles (as per section 3.1.4).
Most of the microorganisms that cause foodborne disease are killed or
inactivated by normal cooking processes. However, there are limitations
to those contaminants that can be removed. Cooking processes are not
always carried out effectively, and some hazardous agents can persist
through cooking processes (e.g. toxins). Furthermore, food can become
recontaminated following cooking, either by passengers and crew or by
vectors such as rodents and insects. Therefore, reliance should not be
placed on the cooking processes alone.
Food poisoning on board ships can be reduced by vendor assurance
and careful selection of suppliers, training of food handlers, optimum
construction of galleys and strict personal hygiene. Control measures
for biological hazards include:
• source control—that is, control of the presence and level of
    microorganisms by obtaining ingredients from suppliers that can
    demonstrate adequate controls over the ingredients and suitable
    transport of the ingredients to ships;
• temperature/time control—that is, proper control of refrigeration
    and storage time; and proper thawing, cooking and cooling of food.
    Passenger ship operators should consider alternatives to packed
    food for takeaway by passengers or eliminate potentially hazardous
    foods for packaged takeaway, to ensure that these temperature/time
    control limits are not exceeded;


                                                            3 Food   63
• cross-contamination control, both direct (e.g. resulting from direct
  contact between raw and cooked food) and indirect (e.g. resulting
  from the use of the same utensils to contact both raw and cooked
  food);
• proper cleaning and disinfection, which can eliminate or reduce levels
  of microbiological contamination. Galleys should be designed so that
  the risk of cross-contamination is reduced. Specific guidelines for
  sanitary conveniences and hand-washing facilities for the shipping
  industry should be considered by those designing and maintaining
  ships. Seawater or non-potable water must not be used in or near
  food or food preparation areas;
• personal and hygienic practices. It is recommended that ships have
  policies for ensuring that staff with infections that can be transmitted
  via food do not perform any task connected with food handling. Food
  handlers with cuts, sores or abrasions on their hands should not
  handle food unless such sores are treated and covered. Staff should
  not be penalized for reporting illness; rather, the reporting of illness
  should be promoted. Preventing outbreaks attributed to infected
  food handlers requires the cooperation of employers, as many food
  handlers may conceal infection to avoid pay loss or penalty.
It is important that first-aid boxes are readily available for use in food
handling areas and that a suitably trained person is appointed to take
charge of first-aid arrangements. There are no specific requirements
covering the contents of a first-aid box, but minimum contents might
reasonably be a plastic-coated leaflet giving general guidance on first
aid, individually wrapped sterile dressings of assorted sizes, sterile eye
pads, individually wrapped triangular bandages, safety pins, medium-
sized (approximately 12 cm × 12 cm) individually wrapped sterile
unmedicated wound dressings and one pair of disposable gloves.

3.2.2 Guideline 3.2: Food receipt

     Guideline 3.2—Food is inspected and confirmed to be in safe
     condition upon receipt.

1. Receiving areas/spaces do not harbour hazards.
2. Received food is inspected and confirmed to be in safe condition
   before acceptance.




64     Guide to ship sanitation
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.2
Ship operators are expected to take all practicable measures to ensure
that they do not receive unsafe or unsuitable food. This means that they
must make sure that the food they receive:
• is protected from contamination;
• is clearly identifiable;
• is at the correct temperature and in the appropriate condition when
   it arrives (e.g. a food that is labelled frozen and shipped frozen by a
   food-processing plant shall be received frozen).
Physical facilities of the food receiving area shall:
• have a smooth, non-absorbent and cleanable covering;
• be maintained sound and in good repair, free of chippings, cracks,
   leakage, seepage, mould, peeling and so forth;
• be free of unused or extraneous materials (cardboard, cloths, papers,
   sanitizing products, plastic bags, pallets, brooms, etc.);
• be provided with natural or artificial lighting that does not
   compromise food hygiene, does not change colour and enables good
   working conditions;
• be provided with electrical wiring installations that are properly
   covered and insulated;
• be provided with a ventilation system that avoids intense heat,
   vapour condensation and accumulation of mould, fumes or smoke.
The food receiving area must be cleaned with disinfectant. The
disinfectant manufacturer’s instructions, including concentration and
contact time, shall be followed precisely. The cleaning should take place
immediately before food entry.
Food cannot enter by the same area from which solid waste is removed.
If it is absolutely impossible to provide different areas, there should be
a different schedule, and the area shall always be cleaned before food is
received.
Integrated pest management actions shall be implemented at this area
according to the provisions established in chapter 7 of this guide.
The Codex Alimentarius provides details of temperatures and conditions
that should be confirmed as items are received. A number of examples
are given in Table 3‑2, although for current requirements, the Codex
Alimentarius should be used as the primary source of information.

3.2.3 Guideline 3.3: Equipment and utensils

  Guideline 3.3—Equipment and utensils are suitable for food
  preparation, food storage and contact with food.

Indicator for Guideline 3.3
Equipment and utensils are suitable for food contact and use.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.3
It is good practice to ensure that the equipment and containers coming
into contact with food are designed and constructed to ensure that
they can be adequately cleaned, disinfected and maintained to avoid
the contamination of food. Equipment and containers must be made of
materials with no toxic effect for their intended use. Where necessary,
equipment should be durable, movable or capable of being disassembled
to allow for maintenance, cleaning and disinfection and to facilitate pest
inspection.
Depending on the nature of food operations undertaken, adequate
facilities need to be available for preparing, heating, cooling, cooking,
refrigerating and freezing food; for monitoring food temperatures; and,
when necessary, for controlling ambient temperatures. Equipment
used to cook, heat, treat, cool, store or freeze food must be designed to
achieve the required food temperatures as rapidly as necessary in the
interests of food safety. Such equipment can include design features to
allow temperatures to be monitored and controlled.
Containers for waste products and inedible or dangerous substances
must be specifically identifiable, suitably constructed and, where
appropriate, made of impervious material. Waste containers used in the
galley must be provided with foot-operable lids, emptied frequently and
easy to clean and disinfect.
All washing facilities, kitchen equipment, storage containers, stoves and
hoods used in the preparation and serving of food and all food contact
surfaces must be so constructed as to be easily cleaned and disinfected
and kept in good repair.
The following is a list of examples of the sort of equipment that might
need to be considered and assessed for its suitability:
• blast chillers incorporated into the design of passenger and crew
   galleys; more than one unit may be necessary depending on the size
   of the ship, the unit’s intended application and the distances between
   the chillers and the storage and service areas;


                                                               3 Food   67
• food preparation sinks in as many areas as necessary (i.e. in all
  meat, fish and vegetable preparation rooms; in cold pantries; and in
  any other areas where personnel wash or soak food); an automatic
  vegetable washing machine may be used in addition to food
  preparation sinks;
• storage cabinets, shelves, racks for food products and equipment in
  food storage, preparation and service areas, including bars, pantries
  and storage associated with waiter trays;
• portable tables, carts or pallets in areas where food is dispensed from
  cooking equipment, such as from soup kettles, steamers, braising
  pans, tilting skillets or ice storage bins;
• a storage cabinet or rack for large items such as ladles, paddles,
  whisks and spatulas;
• knife lockers that are easily cleanable and meet food contact
  standards;
• dish storage and dispensing cabinets;
• food preparation counters that provide sufficient work space;
• drinking fountains;
• cleaning lockers.
Depending on the size of the facilities and the distance to the central pot-
washing facilities, heavy-use areas such as bakeries, butcher shops and
other preparation areas may require a three-compartment sink with a
pre-wash station, or a four-compartment sink with an insert pan and an
overhead spray. All food preparation areas are likely to need easy access
to a three-compartment utensil-washing sink or a dishwashing machine
equipped with a dump sink and a pre-wash hose.
Beverage or condiment dispensing equipment typically requires a
readily removable drain pan or built-in drains in the tabletop. Bulk milk
dispensers should have readily removable drain pans to enable cleaning
of potentially hazardous milk spillages. A utility sink is desirable in
areas such as beverage stations where it is necessary to refill pitchers
or dispensers or discard liquids such as hot or cold drinks, ice-cream or
sherbet. Dipper wells ideally need to be provided with running water
and proper drainage.
Clean storage areas need to be sufficient to house all equipment and
utensils used in food preparation, such as ladles and cutting blades.
The design of all installed equipment needs to direct food and wash-
water drainage into a deck drain scupper or deck sink, and not directly
or indirectly onto a deck.

68   Guide to ship sanitation
For openings to ice bins, food display cases and other such food and ice
holding facilities, tight-fitting doors or similar protective closures are
desirable to prevent contamination of stored products.
Countertop openings and rims of food service areas, bains-marie,
ice wells and other drop-in type food and ice holding units must be
protected with a raised edge or rim of 5 mm or more above the counter
level around the opening.

3.2.4 Guideline 3.4: Materials

  Guideline 3.4—Materials are suitable for contact with food and
  protect food from contamination.

Indicators for Guideline 3.4
1. Materials in contact with food are suitable for this purpose.
2. Materials not in contact with food are suitable to their roles in
   protecting food from contamination.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.4

1. Food contact areas
The materials used for food contact surfaces need to be suitable—for
example, corrosion resistant, non-toxic, non-absorbent, easily cleanable,
smooth and durable. This applies especially to heating units in contact
with food, cooking fats, oils or similar cooking media. Cutting boards
should be of a suitable material, such as one equivalent to or better than
hard maple. If using materials other than those already accepted and
listed for use as food contact surfaces or containers, advice should be
sought from the relevant public health authority before installation. In
general, painted surfaces are not recommended for food contact unless
appropriate paint is used.

2. Non-food contact areas
Materials used for non-food contact surfaces must be durable and readily
cleanable. Welding materials used in joining together non-corrosive
materials must be selected to ensure that the weld area is corrosion
resistant. Surface coatings and paint should be suitable for their intended
use and non-toxic.
All permanent or stationary equipment needs to be installed and
constructed with flashing to exclude openings hidden by adjacent
structures or other equipment, unless adequate clearance for proper


                                                                3 Food   69
cleaning is provided. As an example, a minimum clearance of 15 cm is
recommended under leg-mounted equipment between the lowest
horizontal framing member and the deck.
It is important to ensure that counter-mounted equipment, unless
portable, is either sealed to the tabletop or mounted on legs. Once again,
to facilitate cleaning, counter-mounted equipment should have sufficient
clearance, typically at least 7.5 cm, between the lowest horizontal member
and the countertop. There is also a need to provide cleaning access behind
counter-mounted equipment, including beverage equipment.
The clearance between the back of enclosed equipment, such as
ranges and refrigerators, and the bulkhead should be governed by
the combined length of the items. For example, for equipment up to
61 cm long, a suitable clearance might be 15 cm; for longer equipment,
the clearance might be proportionally greater, up to a maximum of
61 cm for equipment 2.45 m or more in length. If the space between the
equipment and the bulkhead is readily accessible from one end, the above
clearances could be halved, with 15 cm being a suitable minimum.
If two items of equipment, such as ovens or ranges, are located near each
other, the space between them needs to be adequate to enable cleaning.
Alternatively, the space between them could be effectively closed on all
sides by tightly fitting flashing.
When mounting equipment on a foundation or coaming, an adequate
separation distance above the finished deck, at least 10 cm, needs to be
provided. Cement or a continuous weld must be used to seal equipment
to the foundation. The overhang of the equipment from the foundation
must not be excessive, less than 10 cm. To avoid possible vermin habitat,
it is advisable to completely seal any overhang of equipment along the
bottom.
Equipment installed without adequate clearances, such as those
suggested in the previous paragraphs, can have the spaces under, next
to and behind them effectively enclosed and sealed to the deck and/or
bulkhead. Penetrations such as cable, conduit or pipe openings must be
provided with tightly fitting collars made of materials acceptable to the
relevant national health administration.
Electrical wiring from permanently installed equipment must be encased
in durable and easily cleanable material. The use of braided or woven
stainless-steel electrical conduit outside of technical spaces or where it is
subject to splash or soiling is not recommended. The length of electrical
cords to equipment on benches should be adjusted or the cords fastened
in a manner that prevents the cords from lying on countertops.

70   Guide to ship sanitation
Other bulkhead- or deckhead-mounted equipment, such as phones,
speakers, electrical control panels or outlet boxes, must be sealed to the
bulkhead or deckhead panels. Such items must be kept away from areas
exposed to food splash.
Any areas where electrical lines, steam pipelines or water pipelines
penetrate the panels or tiles of the deck, bulkhead or deckhead, including
inside technical spaces or work surfaces, should be tightly sealed. The
number of exposed pipelines should be minimized.

3.2.5 Guideline 3.5: Facilities

     Guideline 3.5—Facilities are suitable for safe food preparation
     and serving.

Indicators for Guideline 3.5
1.    Water and ice are of potable quality.
2.    There are sufficient cleaning and disinfecting facilities.
3.    Ventilation is adequate and designed to avoid food contamination.
4.    Lighting is sufficient to allow hygienic food operations.
5.    Storage facilities are adequate and provide for safe food storage.
6.    Food contact areas are sanitary.
7.    Non-food contact areas are designed to avoid food contamination.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.5

1. Water and ice
An adequate supply of potable water with appropriate facilities for its
storage and distribution is required to be available whenever necessary
to ensure the safety and suitability of food. Non-potable water
(e.g. seawater) must have a separate system and must not be supplied to
the galley unless essential, as discussed in chapter 2.
Ice that will come in contact with food or drink needs to be manufactured
from potable water. Shore sources must be checked with the local health
authority, and delivery of ice from shore to ship must be carried out
in a sanitary manner. Upon delivery to the ship, shore ice needs to be
handled in a sanitary manner, the handler wearing clean clothing, gloves
and boots. Ice must be stored in a clean storage room and raised off the
surface by use of deck-boards or similar devices permitting drainage
and free flow of air. Ice manufactured on board ship needs to be handled
and stored in a sanitary manner.


                                                               3 Food      71
2. Cleaning and disinfecting facilities
To ensure safe food, adequate design criteria must be adopted in
constructing systems for cleaning and disinfecting food, utensils,
equipment and facilities. Such facilities need an adequate supply of hot
and cold potable water.

3. Ventilation
Adequate means of natural or mechanical ventilation help to support safe
food operations. Ventilation systems must be designed and constructed
so that air does not flow from contaminated areas to clean areas and so
that they can be adequately maintained and cleaned. Louvres or vents at
ventilation terminals must be readily removable for cleaning. Particular
attention should be given to:
• minimizing airborne contamination of food—for example, from
    aerosols and condensation droplets;
• controlling ambient temperatures;
• where necessary, controlling humidity.

4. Lighting
Adequate natural or artificial lighting supports hygienic work practices.
The intensity of light should be set according to the nature of the
work. Lighting fixtures should be protected to ensure that food is not
contaminated if breakage occurs.

5. Storage
Improper storage of provisions on board seagoing ships is a hazard, as
provisions are frequently carried for many weeks or even months, and
the ship can be subject to extreme climatic influences. Storage, especially
in cold stores, in an unpacked condition might have an adverse effect on
provisions.
The type of storage facilities required will depend on the nature of the
food on board. Adequate facilities for the storage of food, ingredients and
non-food chemicals (e.g. cleaning materials, lubricants and fuels) must be
provided. Food storage facilities must be designed and constructed to:
• permit adequate maintenance and cleaning;
• avoid pest access and harbourage;
• enable food to be effectively protected from contamination during
   storage;
• provide an environment that minimizes the deterioration of food
   (e.g. by temperature and humidity control).


72   Guide to ship sanitation
6. Food contact areas
Food contact surfaces should be free of open seams, cracks or crevices
and easily cleaned. Exposed construction fittings (e.g. bolts and nuts)
are not generally acceptable. Corners formed by joining the sides of
food contact surfaces must be built with a radius of curvature that helps
cleaning, at least 3 mm. On coved corners of food contact surfaces, the
coved radius must be sufficient to help cleaning, at least 1.6 mm.
Food areas need to be protected against the leakage or seepage of
lubricants or other extraneous or foreign substances. Sound deadening
or undercoating material is not generally applied to the surface of
equipment that is directly above an area where exposed food is kept, as
this material may harbour hazards.
Drawers and bins that come into contact with food must be removable
and easily cleaned. They must be free of open seams or cracks and
finished smooth on all sides. Covers, insets or receptacles for unpackaged
food or beverages must be removable or designed for easy cleaning in
situ.

7. Suitable non-food contact areas
Exposed non-food contact surfaces should be designed to reduce risks
of contaminating food by being free of open seams, cracks or crevices.
Equipment housing or component parts must be made free of openings
into inaccessible areas where food, liquid or dust may enter and insects
may shelter. Mixers, refrigerators, compressors and similar units, if
provided with openings or louvres, should contain readily removable
inspection ports or panels, with routine cleaning in place.
Deck-mounted equipment must be installed with the base flush with
the deck (openings and joints sealed) or with a minimum clearance of
15 cm between the lowest horizontal framing member of the equipment
and the deck. This also applies when equipment is mounted on an island
or curbing. Control mechanisms, couplings and other components
mounted on the housing of the equipment must be designed and
installed to preclude the entrance of dirt and vermin and the formation
of inaccessible areas, which may prevent proper cleaning and inspection.
Bases, curbs or elevated islands for supporting equipment above deck
level, if provided with toe space, must not be indented a distance greater
than the height of the lowest framing member of the equipment above
the deck. Toe space should have a minimum suitable height of 5 cm.
Enclosed spaces, such as columns, vertical supports and legs, must be
sealed against the entrance of vermin.



                                                               3 Food   73
Horizontal openings on top of food storage cabinets must be protected
by a coaming around their periphery. The minimum height of this
coaming needs to be 5 mm, measured from the surface of the cabinet or
from the overflow level. Openings in work tables or dish tables to food
refuse and waste receptacles can have a watertight turned-down edge
extending at least 1.25 cm below the table surface, unless the opening is
provided with a scrap block. Exposed edges on horizontal surfaces, such
as tops of dressers, tables and shelves, can have turned-down or return
flanges with a suitable space of at least 2 cm between the sheared edge
and the frame angles, or they should be totally enclosed.
Hoods over steam kettles, ranges and other cooking units should have
smooth, easily cleanable interiors. Gutters, if provided, must be designed
and dimensioned to facilitate cleaning. Filters, if used, must be installed
to direct condensation into gutters. Baffles, vanes, dampers and other
air-control facilities must be readily accessible or removable. Sea-rails
on cooking ranges must be removable and easily cleaned.
Exposed refrigerant coils located in food compartments must be of a
finless type and arranged to allow thorough cleaning. Blower-type or
fin-type evaporators must be enclosed or shielded to protect them from
spillage of food and to protect the food from condensation. Enclosed-
type refrigeration evaporators must be provided with condensate
drains. Refrigerant and water coils in water-cooling units must be
readily accessible for brush cleaning and have the ability to be flushed
and drained.
Sliding doors on galley and pantry equipment must be removable and
their tracks free of inaccessible openings. The lower tracks must be
slotted at the ends to facilitate removal of dust and debris. Equipment
doors, whether sliding or hinged, should avoid openings into
inaccessible areas. If gaskets are used on insulated doors, they must be
easily cleanable and replaceable and should fit tightly. Door catches and
other fastening devices must be made free of openings that could permit
vermin and debris to enter channels, door panels or other component
parts of the equipment. Catches, hinges and other hardware must be
fabricated of smooth, easily cleanable material.
Cutting boards must be readily removable for cleaning or easily
cleanable without removal. They must be free of open seams or cracks
and finished smooth on all sides. Drawers and bins must be readily
removable and easily cleanable.
Insulation material must be protected against seepage and condensation.
Flashing must be made to exclude food fragments or debris.


74   Guide to ship sanitation
Coaming around equipment such as steam kettles must be sealed
against seepage, infiltration and the entrance of vermin and provided
with drains having removable strainers. The drain must be located at
the lowest point within the area. Drains for galley and sink equipment
should have the following dimensions:
• sinks: 3.75 cm minimum diameter
• steam tables and bains-marie: 2.5 cm minimum diameter.
Exposed horizontal drainpipes, including the traps, must be installed
to permit proper cleaning of the floor area. Drainpipes should not be
located above areas used for storage, preparation or serving of food.
To help avoid contamination, water inlets to steam tables, kettles and
other sink-type equipment must be located a minimum safe distance
of twice the diameter of the water inlet, and in any case not less than
2.5 cm, above the flood-level rim. If the water supply line is required
to be below that, vacuum breakers of an acceptable type should be
properly installed.
Shelves used as false bottoms must be readily removable or sealed in
place to preclude the entrance of food fragments and vermin. Silverware
containers must be removable and designed and fabricated to permit
cleaning followed by disinfection or sterilization. Dipper wells for ice-
cream dippers must be equipped with running water from an above-
the-rim inlet and constructed of smooth, seamless material.

3.2.6 Guideline 3.6: Storage, preparation and service spaces

  Guideline 3.6—Spaces are suitable for the safe storage,
  preparation and service of food.

Indicators for Guideline 3.6
1. Spaces are readily cleaned and disinfected and do not harbour
   hazards.
2. Temperatures used in storage do not support microbial pathogen
   growth.
3. Ready-to-eat food is separated from raw food.
4. All food is separated and protected from sources of contamination.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.6
The decks, or flooring, of all spaces where food or drink is stored,
handled and prepared, or where utensils are cleaned and stored, must
be so constructed as to be easily cleaned, maintained and inspected at
all times. Surfaces must be smooth and kept in good repair.
To comply with good practice, provision rooms, walk-in refrigerators
and freezers and transportation corridors should use hard, durable,
non-absorbent decking (e.g. tiles or diamond-plate corrugated stainless-
steel deck panels in refrigerated provision rooms). Painted steel decking
is acceptable in provision passageways and drystore areas, although
stainless steel is preferred. It is advisable to provide tight-fitting
stainless-steel bulkheads in walk-in refrigerators and freezers, and to
line doors with stainless steel. Painted steel is acceptable for provision
passageways and in drystore areas. Light colours are recommended
to reveal any dirt. If a forklift will be used in these areas, reinforced
stainless-steel panels should be used so that buckling is prevented, and
bumper guards should be fitted on bulkheads to prevent damage. It is
good practice to close deckhead-mounted cable trays, piping or other
difficult-to-clean deckhead-mounted equipment or completely close
the deckhead. All bulkhead and deck junctures should be coved (e.g. a
10 mm radius) and sealed tight.
For galleys, food preparation rooms and pantries, decks should be
constructed from hard, durable, non-absorbent and non-skid material.
Installation can include durable coving with adequate radius, at least
10 mm, or open design, such as greater than 90 degrees, as an integral
part of the deck and bulkhead interface and at the juncture between decks
and equipment foundations. Stainless steel or other coving, if installed,
must be of sufficient thickness to be durable, and stainless-steel deck
plate panels must be sealed with a continuous, non-corroding weld. All
deck tiling must be sealed with a durable, watertight grouting material.
In technical spaces below under-counter cabinets, counters or
refrigerators, the deck must be a durable, non-absorbent, easily cleanable
surface, such as tile or stainless steel. Painted steel or concrete decking is
not recommended. All openings where piping and other items penetrate
through the deck must be sealed. Bulkheads and deckheads, including
doors, door frames and columns, must be constructed with a high-quality,
corrosion-resistant stainless steel. The gauge should be thick enough
that the panels do not warp, flex or separate under normal conditions.
For seams greater than 1 mm but less than 3 mm that must be sealed,
it is common practice to use an appropriate sealant. For bulkhead and
deckhead seams too large to be so sealed (greater than 3 mm), stainless-


76   Guide to ship sanitation
steel profile strips are recommended. All bulkheads to which equipment
is attached need to be of sufficient thickness or reinforcement to allow
for the reception of fasteners or welding without compromising the
quality and construction of the panels. Utility line connections need to be
installed through a stainless steel or other easily cleanable food service–
approved conduit that is mounted away from bulkheads for ease in
cleaning. Backsplash attachments need to be sealed to the bulkhead with
a continuous or tack weld and polish. An appropriate sealant is required to
make the backsplash attachment watertight. All openings must be sealed
where piping and other items penetrate the bulkheads and deckheads,
including inside technical compartments.
For food service areas, it is advisable to ensure that all buffet lines have
hard, durable, non-absorbent decks that are a suitable width, at least
1 m, measured from the edge of the service counter or from the outside
edge of the tray rail. The dining-room service stations can have a hard,
durable, non-absorbent deck (e.g. sealed granite or marble), with a
safe separation distance of at least 61 cm from the edge of the working
sides of the service station. The decks behind service counters, under
equipment and in technical spaces must be constructed of hard, durable,
non-absorbent materials (e.g. tiles, epoxy resin or stainless steel).
Painted steel or concrete decking is not recommended. Durable coving
with radius at least 10 mm or open design greater than 90 degrees must
be used as an integral part of the deck and bulkhead interface and at the
juncture between decks and equipment foundations. Stainless-steel or
other coving, if installed, needs to be of sufficient thickness to be durable
and securely installed. Durable linoleum tile or vinyl deck covering is
recommended only in staff, crew or officers’ dining areas. Bulkheads
and deckheads may be constructed of decorative tiles, pressed metal
panels or other hard, durable, non-corroding materials. Stainless steel
is not required in these areas. However, the materials used need to be
easily cleanable. All openings where piping and other items penetrate
through the deck need to be sealed.
Bulkheads and deckheads of spaces in which food and drink are stored,
prepared or handled, or in which utensils are stored or cleaned, should
have smooth, hard-finished, light-coloured, washable surfaces. Fibrous
insulation or similar materials must be sheathed to prevent particles
of the insulating materials from falling on foods. Cloth or plaster
surfacing is not generally acceptable for satisfactory protection. Fibrous
air filters are not recommended to be installed in the deckheads or
over food processing equipment. Perforated acoustic material is not
recommended in galleys, pantries, sculleries and other food handling or


                                                                 3 Food    77
food storage spaces. It is acceptable for use in dining-rooms, provided
that the particles of material are prevented from falling on food through
holes and seams.
Pipes in unsheathed deckheads over spaces where food is stored,
handled, prepared or served, or where utensils are washed, must be
insulated if condensation forms. Drainage lines carrying sewage or
other liquid waste should be diverted from passing directly over or
horizontally through spaces where food is prepared, served or stored,
or where utensils are washed. Where such drainage lines exist, they
must not contain clean-out plugs and flanges, or these should be welded
closed where they must occur. Exceptions in existing installations may
be made where the lines do not leak, drip or spray non-potable liquids
on food or utensils. Drainpipes passing through insulation surrounding
refrigerated spaces are considered acceptable.

3.2.7 Guideline 3.7: Toilet and personal hygiene facilities

     Guideline 3.7—There are adequate toilet and personal hygiene
     facilities for food handling personnel.

Indicators for Guideline 3.7
1. There are adequate and suitably located toilets for food handling
   personnel.
2. There are adequate and suitably located hand-washing and hand-
   drying facilities for food handling personnel.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.7

1. Toilet facilities
Adequate toilet facilities for food handling personnel must be placed
near food preparation spaces to encourage personal hygiene and
sanitation. On smaller ships, these facilities may be shared by the crew.
Such facilities need to be accessible at all times. To avoid contamination,
toilet rooms should not open directly into spaces where food is prepared,
stored or served. If toilet rooms do open directly into such food areas,
the doors need to be tight-fitting and self-closing. Wherever possible,
there should be a ventilated space between the toilet rooms and food
spaces.




78     Guide to ship sanitation
2. Hand-washing facilities
Adequate hand-washing and hand-drying facilities must be provided
within or adjacent to toilet rooms. Toilet rooms should include hot and
cold running water from a single mixing outlet, single-service paper
or cloth-towel dispenser, suitable soap or detergent and signs over the
basin reading, for example, “WASH HANDS AFTER USING TOILET—
WASH BASIN BEFORE AND AFTER USING”. Signs requiring personnel to
wash hands after using the toilet should also be conspicuously posted
on the bulkhead adjacent to the door of the toilet.
The following areas can also be provided with similar hand-washing
facilities, with appropriate signs located above basins:
• main galley: additional washbasins may be needed, depending on
    distance, partitions, size of spaces, number of employees served and
    other impediments to convenient use of facilities;
• individual galleys, pantries, bakery spaces, butcher spaces, vegetable
    preparation rooms and sculleries: a single washbasin may serve
    more than one such area if easily accessible.
Where a common washbasin serves both a food handling space and
a toilet for food handlers, a sign reading as above must be posted. On
ships where hand-washing facilities exist in a food service employees’
stateroom, easily accessible from the food handling spaces, additional
facilities are not required in the food handling spaces. In such cases,
individual cloth towels for food handlers are acceptable. Scullery sinks,
slop sinks, laundry tubs, dishwashing sinks and similar facilities cannot
be used for hand washing. Wash water may be used at washbasins
provided that the water is heated to a temperature of 77 °C. Only potable
water should be used for the cold-water supply to washbasins.
Facilities need to be readily available to encourage appropriate personal
hygiene and to avoid food contamination. Facilities to be located beside
the galley can include:
• adequate means of hygienically washing and drying hands, including
   washbasins and a supply of hot and cold water;
• toilets of appropriate hygienic design with handbasins, which do not
   open directly into galleys or other food handling areas;
• an adequate supply of soap and hand-drying facilities at handbasins;
• adequate changing facilities for personnel, including suitable storage
   facilities for clothes.

3.2.8 Guideline 3.8: Dishwashing

     Guideline 3.8—There are adequate and effective dishwashing
     facilities.

Indicators for Guideline 3.8
1. Dishwashing facilities are adequate and suitable for safe and effective
   dishwashing.
2. Waste arising from dishwashing does not recontaminate wash water.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.8

1. Dishwashing facilities
Rinse hoses for pre-washing are recommended in some areas. If a sink is
to be used for pre-rinsing, a removable strainer may be needed.
All dishwashing machine components, including encased pulper wiring,
must be elevated at least 15 cm above the deck to provide for drainage.
Removable stainless-steel splash panels must be provided to protect
the pulper and technical areas. Grinder cones, pulper tables and dish
landing tables must be constructed from stainless steel with continuous
welding. Platforms for supporting dishwashing equipment must be
constructed from stainless steel, avoiding the use of painted steel.
Dishwashing machines must be designed and sized for their intended
use and installed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Dishwashing machines using chemical sanitizers must be equipped with
a device that indicates audibly or visually when more chemical sanitizer
needs to be added.
Dishwashing machines can have easily accessible and readable data
plates affixed. The plate can include the machine’s design and operating
specifications:
• temperatures required for washing, rinsing and sanitizing;
• pressure required for the freshwater sanitizing rinse, unless the
   machine is designed to use only a pumped sanitizing rinse;
• conveyor speed for conveyor machines or cycle time for stationary
   rack machines;
• chemical concentration (if chemical sanitizers are used).
Three-compartment dishwashing sinks with a separate pre-wash
station must be provided for the main galley, crew galley, lido galley
and other full-service galleys with pot-washing areas. For meat, fish


80     Guide to ship sanitation
and vegetable preparation areas, there must be at least one three-
compartment sink or an automatic dishwashing machine with a pre-
wash station. Sinks must be large enough to submerge the largest piece
of equipment used in the area. Sinks should have coved, continuously
welded, internal corners. Dishwashing machine wash and rinse tanks
should be equipped with baffles, curtains or other means to minimize
internal cross-contamination of the solutions in wash and rinse tanks.
A pass-through type dishwashing machine is preferable to an under-
counter model.
Hot-water sanitizing sinks (accept those that use halogen for the
sanitization step) must be equipped with accessible and easily
readable thermometers, a long-handled stainless-steel wire basket or
other retrieval system and a jacketed or coiled steam supply with a
temperature-control valve to control water temperature.
Sufficient shelving for storage of soiled and clean ware must be
provided. As an example, the storage available for soiled ware must be
approximately one third the volume provided for clean ware. Either
solid or open tubular shelving or racks must be used. Solid overhead
shelves must be designed so that they drain at each end to the landing
table below.
Adequate ventilation is required to prevent condensation on the
deckhead or adjacent bulkheads. Any filters installed over dishwashing
equipment need to be easily removed for cleaning.

2. Food waste handling
In all food preparation areas, adequate space is needed for trash cans,
garbage grinders or pulping systems. Food waste grinders are optional
in pantries and bars.
For tables that store used and soiled dishes and that are installed with
pulper systems, the pulper trough needs to extend the full length of the
table and slope towards the pulper to help take away waste. The table’s
back edge must be sealed to the bulkhead or have sufficient clearance,
45 cm, between the table and the bulkhead. Such tables must be designed
to drain waste liquids and to prevent contamination of adjacent surfaces.
To prevent water from pooling, clean tables should be equipped with
across-the-counter gutters with drains at the exit from the machine and
sloped to the scupper. A second gutter and drain line must be installed if
the first gutter does not effectively remove pooled water from the entire
table. The length of drain lines must be minimized and, where possible,
drain lines must be placed in straight vertical lines with no angles.


                                                               3 Food   81
One of the following arrangements must be used to prevent excessive
contamination of rinse water with wash-water splash:
• an across-the-counter gutter with a drain dividing the wash
   compartment from the rinse compartment;
• a splash shield of sufficient height, greater than 10 cm, above the
   flood-level rim of the sink between the wash and rinse compartments;
• an overflow drain in the wash compartment sufficiently, at least
   10 cm, below the flood level.

3.2.9 Guideline 3.9: Safe food storage

     Guideline 3.9—There are safe food storage systems.

Indicators for Guideline 3.9
1. Temperatures used in storage do not support microbial pathogen
   growth.
2. Ready-to-eat food is separated from raw food.
3. All food is separated and protected from sources of contamination.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.9

1. Temperature
Inadequate food temperature control is one of the most common causes
of foodborne illness and food spoilage on ships. On passenger ships, the
preparation of a wide variety of foods, at the same time, for a large number
of people increases the risk of food mishandling and unsatisfactory
temperature variations. For example, an outbreak of staphylococcal
food poisoning on a cruise ship occurred after pastry was prepared in
large quantities by several food handlers. This provided opportunities
for the introduction of staphylococci into the pastry. Prolonged time at
warm temperature allowed for production of enterotoxin.
In large-scale catering, it is often necessary to prepare food hours
before it is needed and to hold food under refrigeration, in a hot
holding apparatus or even at ambient temperature. If procedures are
strictly controlled and storage temperatures are at levels that will not
permit bacterial growth, hazards can be adequately controlled. The
ship’s operators must implement systems to ensure that temperature
is controlled effectively where it is critical to the safety and suitability
of food. Where appropriate, temperature-recording devices must be
checked at regular intervals and tested for accuracy by the crew.



82     Guide to ship sanitation
The temperature within refrigerators and freezers should be measured
using an internal thermometer. Sufficient shelving is needed in all
refrigeration units to prevent stacking and to permit adequate ventilation
and cleaning. Examples of suitable food storage temperatures are found
in documents of the Vessel Sanitation Program of the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Codex Alimentarius
Commission that specifically relate to the storage of food on passenger
and cruise ships. These documents are subject to periodic review, and
current versions should be considered by the ship’s operator.
When foods, particularly large joints of meat or poultry, are undercooked
or inadequately thawed, with cooking times too short and temperatures
too low, Salmonella and other bacteria may survive. Subsequent poor
storage will permit multiplication of organisms and the introduction of
a significant risk. It is important that large joints of meat and poultry are
thawed out before cooking. Precautions need to be taken to cool cooked
food quickly and to cold-store those items that will not be cooked
immediately.

2. Separation of raw and ready-to-eat food
Pathogens can be transferred from one food to another, either by direct
contact or by food handlers, contact surfaces or airborne transmission.
Space is sometimes limited in galleys, preventing the clear separation of
raw and cooked foods.
Raw food, especially meat, needs to be effectively separated, either
physically or by time, from ready-to-eat foods, with effective
intermediate cleaning and, where appropriate, disinfection. Surfaces,
utensils, equipment, fixtures and fittings must be thoroughly cleaned
and, where necessary, disinfected after raw food has been handled.

3. Separation of food from contaminant sources
Systems must be in place to prevent contamination of foods by foreign
bodies such as glass or metal shards from machinery, dust, harmful
fumes and unwanted chemicals, particularly after any maintenance
work.




                                                                 3 Food    83

     Guideline 3.10—There is a comprehensive maintenance,
     cleaning and disinfection programme.

Indicator for Guideline 3.10
1. There is a comprehensive maintenance, cleaning and disinfection
   programme.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.10
Maintenance, cleaning and disinfection programmes ensure that all
parts of the establishment are appropriately clean and include the
cleaning of cleaning equipment. Cleaning and disinfection programmes
must be continually and effectively monitored for their suitability and
effectiveness and, where necessary, documented.
Cleaning can remove food residues and dirt, which may be a source of
contamination. The necessary cleaning methods will depend on the
nature of the catering and size of the ship. Disinfection may be necessary
after cleaning. Cleaning chemicals should be handled and used carefully
and in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions. Cleaning chemicals
should be stored, separately from food, in clearly identified containers
to avoid the risk of contamination. Galley and food areas and equipment
need to be kept in an appropriate state of repair and condition to:
• facilitate all cleaning and disinfection procedures
• function as intended, particularly at critical steps
• prevent contamination of food (e.g. from debris and chemicals).
Cleaning must be carried out by physical methods, such as heat,
scrubbing, turbulent flow, vacuum cleaning or other methods that avoid
the use of water; or chemical methods, using detergents, alkalis or
acids; or by a combination of physical and chemical methods. Cleaning
procedures may involve:
• removing gross debris from surfaces
• applying a detergent solution to loosen soil and bacterial film
• rinsing with potable water to remove loosened soil and residues of
   detergent
• disinfecting, where necessary.
Where written cleaning programmes are used, they might specify:
• areas, equipment and utensils to be cleaned
• cleaning materials, equipment and chemicals to be used

84     Guide to ship sanitation
•    who is responsible for particular tasks
•    methods, including the dismantling and reassembly of equipment
•    safety precautions
•    frequency of cleaning and monitoring arrangements
•    the standard(s) to be achieved.
In addition, there may at times be deep cleaning, such as at six-month or
annual intervals, subject to usage and requirements of the specific area
(e.g. ducting and extraction systems). Cleaning programmes might also
be in place for environmental cleaning, with appropriate methods for
cleaning the cleaning materials.
During pesticide spraying, all foodstuffs, utensils, and food preparation
and cleansing equipment should be covered to protect them from
toxic substances. Instructions for the use of sprays should be carefully
followed (refer to chapter 7).

3.2.11 Guideline 3.11: Personal hygiene

    Guideline 3.11—Food handling personnel practise good
    personal hygiene.

Indicators for Guideline 3.11
1. All food handlers should practise good personal hygiene.
2. Food handlers known to be infected with potentially hazardous
   conditions are not permitted to handle food.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.11
Crew, including maintenance personnel, who do not maintain an
appropriate degree of personal cleanliness, or who have certain illnesses
or conditions, can contaminate food and transmit illness to consumers.

1. Food handler hygiene
Food handlers need to maintain a high degree of personal cleanliness and,
where appropriate, wear suitable protective clothing, head coverings
and footwear. Cuts and wounds, where personnel are permitted to
continue working, must be covered by suitable waterproof dressings.
Protective clothing should be light coloured, without external pockets
and not one-piece overalls, as these could become contaminated from
the floor when using the toilet. Disposable gloves might be used in some
food handling situations; however, they can be misused and give food
handlers a false sense of hygiene security.

                                                              3 Food   85
Personnel need to wash their hands to ensure food safety, such as:
• at the start of food handling activities;
• immediately after using the toilet;
• after handling raw food or any contaminated material, where this
   could result in contamination of other food items.
People engaged in food handling activities should avoid handling ready-
to-eat food and refrain from behaviour that could result in contamination
of food, such as:
• handling money
• smoking
• spitting
• chewing or eating
• sneezing or coughing over unprotected food.
Personal effects such as jewellery, watches, pins or other items must not
be worn or brought into food handling areas if they pose a threat to food
safety.

2. Food handler illness
Crew known, or suspected, to be suffering from or carrying a disease or
illness likely to be transmitted through food should not be allowed to enter
any food handling areas if there is a likelihood of them contaminating food.
Any person affected needs to immediately report the illness or symptoms.
In one outbreak of foodborne viral gastroenteritis, six food handlers were
ill, but they were reluctant to report their infections because of concerns
about job security. The outbreak investigation implicated freshly cut
fruit salad at two buffets. This is a difficult issue to resolve, because food
handlers may deny that they are ill for fear of being penalized. Even
when symptoms of illness have abated, people can remain infectious,
or symptoms may reappear. Therefore, food handlers should ideally not
begin working with food for at least 48 hours following the cessation of
symptoms. In practice, this recommendation is purely practical, as people
can remain infectious for weeks, albeit at a reduced level. Therefore,
recently ill food handlers should be encouraged to take extra precautions.
Conditions that should be reported to management so that the need for
medical examination and/or possible exclusion from food handling can
be considered include:
• jaundice
• diarrhoea



86   Guide to ship sanitation
•    vomiting
•    fever
•    sore throat with fever
•    coughing
•    visibly infected skin lesions (boils, cuts, etc.)
•    discharges from the ear, eye or nose.
New food handling staff must be asked questions about their state of
health, and all food handling staff must be asked about their state of
health after a period of leave. Possible questions include those found in
Regulatory guidance and best practice advice for food business operators
(United Kingdom Food Standards Agency, 2009), which provides
questions to ask employees when considering employing new food
handlers or reinstating food handlers after any extended shore leave.

3.2.12 Guideline 3.12: Training

    Guideline 3.12—Food handlers are adequately trained in food
    safety.

Indicator for Guideline 3.12
1. There is a comprehensive food handler training programme.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.12
Those engaged in food preparation or who come directly or indirectly
into contact with food need to be trained and/or instructed in food
hygiene to a level appropriate to the operations they are to perform.
Food hygiene training is fundamentally important. All personnel need
to be aware of their role and responsibilities in protecting food from
contamination or deterioration. Food handlers need to have the necessary
knowledge and skills to enable them to handle food hygienically. Those
who handle strong cleaning chemicals or other potentially hazardous
chemicals must be instructed in safe handling techniques. This includes
maintenance personnel who enter food handling areas in order to
undertake their work. It is not essential that such employees are trained
in all food hygiene matters, but they should have an awareness of the
relevant hygiene aspects appropriate to their work.
Periodic assessments of the effectiveness of training and instruction
programmes must be made, as well as routine supervision and checks
to ensure that procedures are being carried out effectively.

Managers and supervisors of food processes need to have the necessary
knowledge of food hygiene principles and practices to be able to judge
potential risks and take the necessary action to remedy deficiencies.
More advanced training courses should deal with management and
systems, including HACCP.

3.2.13 Guideline 3.13: Food wastes

     Guideline 3.13—Food waste is stored and disposed of in a
     hygienic manner.

Indicator for Guideline 3.13
1. Food waste is managed to prevent contamination of food and to
   prevent vermin proliferation.
Guidance notes for Guideline 3.13
Food wastes and refuse readily attract rodents and vermin, particularly
flies and cockroaches. The proper retention, storage and disposal of
such wastes on board, ashore and overboard where shore areas will
not be affected will prevent the creation of health hazards and public
nuisances.
All ships must be equipped with facilities for safe storage of food refuse.
All food refuse must be received and stored in watertight, non-absorbent
and easily cleaned containers, fitted with tight covers that should be
closed during food preparation and serving and cleaning operations
in food handling spaces. These containers must be placed in waste
storage spaces, specifically constructed and used for this purpose, or
on open decks when necessary. After emptying, each container must be
thoroughly scrubbed, washed and treated with disinfectant, if necessary,
to prevent odours and to minimize the attraction of rodents, flies and
cockroaches. Containers should not be left uncovered except during the
necessary food handling and cleanup procedures.
It is important to characterize the waste stream and the amount of
wastes produced in galleys and related areas to provide a basis for
planning to prevent environmental contamination. People in charge of
waste collection should use personal protection equipment, including
special disposable gloves, face masks and/or protective eyewear, safety
boots and appropriate protective clothing.

4 Recreational water environments


4.1    Background
This chapter focuses on waterborne disease arising from recreational
water environments on cruise ships. A previous chapter (chapter 2)
considered disease associated with potable water supplied on board.
Swimming pools and similar recreational water environments may
be located either outdoors or indoors, or both. They may be supplied
with potable or marine water, supervised or unsupervised and heated
or unheated. For the purposes of this guide, swimming pools, hot tubs,
whirlpools, spa pools and plunge pools are considered together under
the general heading of recreational water environments.

4.1.1 Health risks associated with recreational water
      environments on ships
Recreational water environments can present a number of risks to
health. The most immediate and severe danger arises from accidental
drowning. Another source of harm is injuries, potentially serious or
even fatal, that can arise from slipping and tripping or from becoming
snagged in ropes and fences or fittings such as ladders and drains. There
have even been cases where swimmers have been thrown clear of the
pool onto hard surfaces in heavy seas. In relation to ship sanitation, a
number of infectious diseases can be acquired in swimming and spa
pools that can cause diarrhoea or skin, ear, eye and upper respiratory
infections. Hot tubs and whirlpools and associated equipment can create
an ideal habitat for the proliferation of Legionella and Mycobacterium
spp. In addition, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently present in
whirlpools, and skin infections have been reported when pool design or
management is poor.
Pathogens transmitted by the faecal–oral route have commonly been
associated with swimming and spa pools. Contamination occurs when
pathogens enter with human sewage or animal faecal contamination
or are released directly by infected bathers. One of the most important
such pathogens is Cryptosporidium spp., which have infectious oocysts
that are resistant to even the highest levels of chlorine that are generally
used for maintaining residual disinfection in pools. Thousands of
cases of swimming-associated cryptosporidiosis have been reported
(Lemmon, McAnulty & Bawden-Smith, 1996; United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2001a), and public swimming pools


                                                                          89
can be temporarily shut down as a result. Where water quality and
treatment have been inadequate, bacterial infections from Shigella spp.
(United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001b) and
Escherichia coli O157:H7 (United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 1996) have been associated with swimming and spa pools.
Infections of surfaces such as skin and ears have been associated with
spa pools where disinfection has been inadequate. These infections
arise from opportunistic pathogens that are commonly present in water
and soils. The recreational water environment presents a considerable
risk because it can both amplify the concentration of the hazard and
facilitate exposure of humans. The presence of organic matter and
elevated temperatures associated with many recreational water
environments can provide an environment suitable for the proliferation
of opportunistic pathogens that can infect mucous membranes, lungs,
skin and wounds. The loss of disinfectant residual in these environments
will permit proliferation of such pathogens to unsafe levels.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection has been associated with a number of
skin and ear infections arising from immersion in water with inadequate
disinfection (Gustafson et al., 1983; Ratnam et al., 1986; United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2000). Symptoms include
outer ear and ear canal infections (“swimmer’s ear” or otitis externa)
and skin infections such as dermatitis and folliculitis. Where aerosols
are generated, the elevated temperature found in some recreational
water environments can support Legionella spp., which have caused
outbreaks of legionnaires’ disease associated with hot tubs, including
outbreaks on board ships discussed in the review by Rooney et al.
(2004). More recently, mycobacterial infections have been associated
with pneumonitis linked to exposure to aerosols from swimming and
spa pools (Falkinham, 2003).
In using disinfectants, risk from microbial hazards can arise. For
example, harm can result from excessive disinfectant chemical addition
either directly or potentially through disinfection by-products. The
disinfection by-products arise when chlorine reacts with organic
matter, such as is found in sloughed skin, sweat and urine, and forms
organohalide compounds, such as chloroform. Ozone can also react to
produce a different set of by-products. These by-product compounds
are of uncertain health significance at the low concentrations found,
but might be weakly associated with certain types of cancer or adverse
pregnancy outcomes if consumed or inhaled in large amounts over
extended periods of time (WHO, 2011).



90   Guide to ship sanitation
Usage levels of recreational water environments are directly related to
risk. The more people that recreate, the higher the concentrations of
pathogens released, the greater the demand on the disinfection system
and the higher the number of people in a position to become infected.
Pools are particularly attractive to children and infants, which in turn
gives rise to an increased risk of contamination and an increased risk
to safety. Children and infants are more likely than adults to swallow
pool water and be infected with enteric pathogens, and they are more
likely to release faeces into the water, either through smears or through
accidental faecal release (AFR). Finally, children and infants are more
prone than adults to carelessness and slips, trips and drowning.
Another important risk factor that particularly affects pools on ships is
the movement of the ship itself. This movement increases the likelihood
of accidents in particular.

4.1.2 Recreational water environment guidelines
The Guidelines for safe recreational water environments, volume 2,
Swimming pools and similar environments (WHO, 2006) should be
referred to, as these apply generally to recreational water environments.
Attention should be given to the contemporary use of a preventive,
multiple-barrier risk management approach to recreational water
safety (WHO, 2006).

4.2   Guidelines
This section provides user-targeted information and guidance,
identifying responsibilities and providing examples of practices that
can control risks. Three specific guidelines (situations to aim for and
maintain) are presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of
indicators (measures for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance
notes (advice on applying the guidelines and indicators in practice,
highlighting the most important aspects that need to be considered
when setting priorities for action).

4.2.1 Guideline 4.1: Design and operation

     Guideline 4.1—Pools are designed and operated in ways that
     reduce risks to safe levels.

Indicators for Guideline 4.1
1. Circulation and hydraulics ensure adequate mixing to enable
   disinfection.
2. A realistic bather load is catered for in the design.
3. Filtration is designed to remove oocysts and cysts.
4. Disinfection is designed to inactivate pathogens.
5. Legionella bacteria are controlled through the use of biocides and
   water turnover.
6. Ventilation is designed to maintain air quality within the indoor
   recreational water environment.
Guidance notes for Guideline 4.1
Outbreaks associated with recreational water environments have been
linked to poor system design. Therefore, the first disease prevention
strategy is ensuring the adequate design of recreational water
environments given the extent and nature of use. Another common
cause of outbreaks is improper operation of controls, such as allowing
recreational water environments to be bunkered beyond capacity or
engaging in poor operational practices. Design limits should be adhered
to and systems should be properly operated at all times.
Treatment systems can reduce contamination levels, but these can
become overloaded. Therefore, reliance should not be placed on
treatment alone, and multiple barriers should be actively maintained,
including:
• filling and topping up recreational water environments with the
    safest possible water;
• controlling usage rates to within system design capacity by managing
    bather load;
• maintaining treatment to control forms of contamination;
• taking prompt action to clear the recreational water environment in
    the event of an incident and remove overt contamination, such as
    visible faecal releases.
Pool design needs to be tailored to a realistic understanding of the way
in which the pool will be used. For example, the number and type of


92     Guide to ship sanitation
users, the temperature of use and any special health considerations for
particular user groups will all affect the details of how the pool should
be designed, constructed and managed. Specific considerations might
include:
• the daily opening hours
• the peak periods of use
• the anticipated number of users
• special requirements, such as temperature and equipment.
Swimming-pool and bathing-pool water needs to be safe. These water
quality requirements need to be met through optimal matching of the
following design factors:
• design of the correct pool hydraulics (to ensure optimal distribution
    of disinfectant throughout the pool);
• adequate circulation in recirculating swimming pools, such as
    complete circulation of the water within the pool, with replacement
    of the water every 6 hours or less during pool operation;
• installation of the appropriate treatment system (to remove
    particulate pollutants and disinfectant-resistant microorganisms);
• installation of a disinfection system (to inactivate infectious
    microorganisms so that the water cannot transmit and propagate
    disease-causing microbial agents);
• inclusion of systems to add fresh water at frequent intervals (to dilute
    substances that cannot be removed from the water by treatment).
Control of pathogens is typically achieved by a combination of
recirculation of pool water through treatment (typically involving some
form of filtration plus disinfection) and the application of a residual
disinfectant to inactivate microorganisms introduced to the pool by
bathers.
A dedicated crew member should be assigned to the operation of the
recreational water environment and should be suitably trained.

A. Swimming pools
The pool and its water supply need to be designed, constructed and
operated in view of the health and safety protection of bathers. These
design, construction and operational issues are summarized in the
paragraphs below, and details on specific requirements of various pool
and spa types follow.




                                            4 Recreational water environments   93
1. Circulation and hydraulics
The purpose of paying close attention to circulation and hydraulics is to
ensure that the whole pool is adequately served. Treated water needs
to reach all parts of the pool, and polluted water needs to be removed—
especially from areas most used and most polluted by bathers. If not,
even good water treatment may not result in good water quality. The
design and positioning of inlets, outlets and surface water withdrawal
are crucial.
Pools usually use seawater or a potable water supply passing through
an air gap or backflow preventer. The fill level of the pool is at the skim
gutter level. The pool overflows can either be directed by gravity to the
make-up tank for recirculation through the filter system or disposed of
as waste. Surface skimmers need to be capable of handling sufficient
volume, such as approximately 80%, of the filter flow of the recirculation
system. There should be sufficient skimmers, such as at least one
skimmer for each 47 m2 of pool surface area.
Circulation rate is related to turnover period, which is the time taken
for a volume of water equivalent to the entire pool water volume to
pass through the filters and treatment plant and back to the pool. In
principle, the shorter the turnover period, the more frequent the pool
water treatment. Turnover periods need to suit the particular type of
pool. Ideally, turnover must be designed to vary in different parts of the
pool: longer periods in deep areas, shorter periods where it is shallow.
Disinfection and treatment will not remove all pollutants. The design
of a swimming pool should recognize the need to dilute the pool water
with fresh water. Dilution limits the buildup of pollutants from bathers
(e.g. constituents of sweat and urine), the by-products of disinfection
and various other dissolved chemicals and pollutants.
A drain must be installed at the lowest point in the pool, and drainage
facilities need to be sufficient to ensure quick emptying. The drains from
the pool should be independent; however, when they are connected to
any other drainage system, a backwater valve must be installed in the
recreational water environment to prevent cross-connections. Anti-
vortex and anti-entanglement type drain covers must be provided, which
are constructed of durable, easily visible and readily cleaned material.
Children’s pools can have their own independent recirculation, filtration
and halogenation system, because children are particularly potent sources
of pathogens. The turnover rate of water needs to be sufficient, ideally
higher than in adult pools, such as at least once every 30 minutes. Anti-
vortex and anti-entanglement type drain covers must be provided that
are constructed of durable, easily visible and readily cleaned material.

94   Guide to ship sanitation
2. Bather load
A realistic bather load needs to be catered for during both design and
operation of pools. The circulation and treatment systems and the
hydraulic volume will determine the appropriate safe bather load, but
the practicability of maintaining bather loads within design criteria also
needs to be considered.
3. Filtration
Controlling clarity involves adequate water treatment, usually
involving filtration and coagulation. Filtration is crucial to good water
quality, affecting both aesthetic clarity and disinfection. Disinfection
will be compromised by reduced clarity, as particles associated with
turbidity can surround microorganisms and shield them from the
action of disinfectants. In addition, filtration is important for removing
Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts and some other protozoa
that are relatively resistant to chlorine disinfection.
Filters need to be designed to remove particles at a sufficient rate, such
as removing all particles greater than 10 µm from the entire volume of
the pool in 6 hours or less. Filters can be cartridge or media type (e.g.
rapid-pressure sand filters, high-rate sand filters, diatomaceous earth
filters or gravity sand filters). All media-type filters need to be capable
of being backwashed. Filter accessories, such as pressure gauges, air-
relief valves and rate-of-flow indicators, should be provided as required.
Sufficient access to sand filters should be maintained so that they can
be inspected at a regular frequency, at least on a weekly basis, and the
media must be changed periodically.
Some of the factors that are important to consider in the design of a
granular media (e.g. sand) filtration system include:
• Filtration rate: The higher the filtration rate, the lower the filtration
   efficiency. Some of the higher rate granular filters do not handle
   particles and colloids as effectively as medium-rate filters and cannot
   be used with coagulants.
• Bed depth: The correct sand bed depth is important for efficient
   filtration.
• Number of filters: Pools will benefit greatly from the increased
   flexibility and safeguards of having more than one filter. In particular,
   pools can remain in use with a reduced turnover on one filter while
   the other one is being inspected or repaired. Filtered water from one
   filter can be used to backwash another.




                                             4 Recreational water environments   95
• Backwashing: The cleaning of a filter bed clogged with suspended
  solids is referred to as backwashing. It is accomplished by reversing
  the flow, fluidizing the sand and passing pool water back through the
  filters to waste. It should be initiated as recommended by the filter
  manufacturer, when the allowable turbidity value has been exceeded
  or when a certain length of time without backwashing has passed.
  The filter may take some time to settle once the flow is returned to
  normal, and water should not be returned to the pool until the filter
  has settled.
A hair strainer is required between the pool outlet and the suction side
of the pumps to remove foreign debris such as hair, lint and pins. The
removable portion of the strainer should be corrosion resistant and
have holes that are smaller than 6 mm in diameter.
Coagulants (and flocculants) enhance the removal of dissolved, colloidal
or suspended material by bringing this material out of solution or
suspension as solids (coagulation), then clumping the solids together
(flocculation), producing a floc, which is more easily trapped in the filter.
Coagulants are particularly important in helping to remove the infective
cysts of Giardia and oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp., which otherwise
would pass through the filter. Coagulant efficiency is dependent on
pH, which therefore needs to be controlled. Dosing pumps should be
capable of accurately dosing the small quantities of coagulant required
and adjusting to the requirements of the bather load. Coagulation is
often required as a prerequisite to effective filtration, depending on the
filtration process selected.
4. Chemical dosing, including disinfection
Disinfection is a process whereby pathogenic microorganisms are
removed or inactivated by chemical (e.g. chlorination) or physical
(e.g. filtration, UV radiation) means, such that they represent no
significant risk of infection. Recirculating pool water is disinfected
using the treatment process, and the entire water body is disinfected by
application of a disinfectant residual, which inactivates agents added to
the pool by bathers.
For disinfection to occur with any biocidal chemical, the oxidant demand
of the water being treated must first be satisfied, and sufficient chemical
must remain to effect disinfection.
Issues to be considered in the choice of a disinfectant and application
system include:
• safety;
• comfort (e.g. avoiding skin irritation);

96   Guide to ship sanitation
• compatibility with the source water (hardness and alkalinity);
• type and size of pool (disinfectant may be more readily degraded or
  lost through evaporation in outdoor pools);
• oxidation capacity;
• bather load (sweat and urine from bathers will increase disinfectant
  demand);
• operation of the pool (i.e. supervision and management).
The choice of disinfectant used as part of swimming-pool water
treatment should ideally comply with the following criteria:
• effective, rapid inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms;
• capacity for ongoing oxidation to assist control of contaminants during
   pool use;
• a wide margin between effective biocidal concentration and the
   concentration resulting in adverse effects on human health;
• availability of a quick and easy determination of the disinfectant’s
   concentration in pool water (simple analytical and test methods);
• potential to measure the disinfectant’s concentration electrometrically
   to permit automatic control of disinfectant dosing and continuous
   recording of the values measured.
Commonly used disinfectants include the following:
• Chlorine: Chlorination is the most widely used pool water
  disinfectant, usually in the form of chlorine gas, sodium or calcium
  hypochlorite or chlorinated isocyanurates. Chlorine is inexpensive
  and relatively convenient to produce, store, transport and use.
  Chlorinated isocyanurate compounds, which are somewhat complex
  white crystalline compounds with slight chlorine-type odour that
  provide free chlorine when dissolved in water, are used in most
  small outdoor ship pools. They are an indirect source of chlorine,
  via an organic reserve (cyanuric acid). The relationship between the
  chlorine residual and the level of cyanuric acid is critical and can be
  difficult to maintain. Chlorinated isocyanurates are not suited to the
  variations in bather loads usually found in large pools. However, they
  are particularly useful in outdoor swimming pools exposed to direct
  sunlight, where UV radiation rapidly degrades free chlorine.
• Ozone: Ozone can be viewed as the most powerful oxidizing and
  disinfecting agent that is available for pool and spa water treatment.
  Ozone in combination with chlorine or bromine is a very effective
  disinfection system, but the use of ozone alone cannot ensure a
  residual disinfectant capacity throughout the swimming pool. Ozone


                                           4 Recreational water environments   97
  is most frequently used as a treatment step, followed by deozonation
  and addition of a residual disinfectant, such as chlorine. Excess
  ozone must be destroyed by an activated carbon filter, because this
  toxic gas could settle, to be breathed by pool users and staff. Residual
  disinfectants should also be removed by the activated carbon filter
  and are therefore added after this step.
• UV radiation: Like ozone, UV radiation is a plant-room treatment that
  purifies the circulating water, inactivating microorganisms and, to a
  certain extent, breaking down some pollutants by photo-oxidation.
  This decreases the chlorine demand of the purified water but does
  not leave a disinfectant residual in the pool water, so chlorine
  disinfection is still required. For UV to be most effective, the water
  must be pretreated to remove turbidity-causing particulate matter
  that prevents the penetration of the UV radiation or absorbs the UV
  energy.
Microbial colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is generally
controlled through cleaning and disinfection, such as shock dosing.
The method of introducing disinfectants to the pool water influences
their effectiveness. Individual disinfectants can have their own specific
dosing requirements, but the following principles apply to all:
• Automatic dosing is preferable. Electronic sensors continuously
   monitor pH and residual disinfectant levels and adjust the dosing
   correspondingly to maintain correct levels. Regular verification of
   the system (including manual tests on pool water samples) and good
   management are important.
• Hand dosing (i.e. putting chemicals directly into the pool) is rarely
   justified. Manual systems of dosing must be backed up by good
   management of operation and monitoring. It is important that the
   pool remains empty of bathers until the chemical has dispersed.
• Trying to compensate for inadequacies in treatment by shock
   dosing is bad practice, because it can mask deficiencies in design
   or operation that may produce other problems and can generate
   unwelcome by-products.
• Dosing pumps should be designed to shut themselves off if the
   circulation system fails (although automatic dosing monitors
   should remain in operation) to ensure that chemical dispersion is
   interrupted.
• Residual disinfectants are generally dosed at the very end of the
   treatment process. The treatment methods of flocculation, filtration
   and ozonation serve to clarify the water, reduce the organic load


98   Guide to ship sanitation
  and greatly reduce the microbial count, so that the post-treatment
  disinfectant can be more effective and the amount of disinfectant
  that must be used can be minimized.
• It is important that disinfectants and pH-adjusting chemicals be well
  mixed with the water at the point of dosing.
• Dosing systems, like circulation, should continue 24 hours per day.
Production of disinfection by-products can be controlled by minimizing
the introduction of their organic precursors (compounds that react
with the disinfectant to yield the by-products) through good hygienic
practices (pre-swim showering) and maximizing their removal by
well-managed pool water treatment. Control of disinfection by-
products involves dilution, treatment and disinfection modification or
optimization. Because of the presence of bromide ions in salt water, a
common by-product formed in the water and air of seawater pools on
ships will be bromoform, which can result from either chlorine or ozone
treatment.
It is inevitable that some volatile disinfection by-products will be
produced in the pool water and escape into the air. This hazard can be
managed to some extent through good ventilation.
The use of analysers helps to automate dosing and optimize conditions
for pool safety, such as automatic dosing of chemicals for disinfection
and pH adjustment. Water sample points must be provided throughout
the system for testing halogen levels and routine calibration of the
analyser. Analyser-controlled halogen-based disinfection equipment
should be provided as required. It may be necessary to ensure that pH
is adjusted by using appropriate acids and bases and that a buffering
agent is used to stabilize the pH. This can be added to the functionality
of the analyser.
5. Legionella control
In recreational water environments, it is impractical to maintain
temperatures outside the range 25–50 °C. However, levels of Legionella
spp. can be kept under control using appropriate management measures,
including filtration and maintenance of a continuous disinfectant
residual in recreational water environments and physical cleaning of
all spa-pool equipment, including associated pipes and air-conditioning
units. Rooms housing recreational water environments must be well
ventilated to avoid an accumulation of Legionella spp. in the indoor




                                           4 Recreational water environments   99
air. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement a range of other
management strategies, which may include:
• adding biocides to the spa water, plumbing and filter. Whirlpool
     spas shall typically maintain a free chlorine residual between 3 and
     10 mg/l or a free bromine residual between 4 and 10 mg/l (WHO,
     2006). To ensure that free halogen is effective for disinfection, there
     is a need to maintain or regularly adjust the pH, typically in the range
     7.2–7.8;
• ensuring that staff have appropriate training and skills to operate the
     recreational facility;
• applying a constant circulation of water in the whirlpool and spa
     pool;
• cleaning filter systems (e.g. by backwashing filters);
• cleaning pool surrounds;
• replacing a portion (e.g. 50%) of the water in each whirlpool and spa
     pool daily;
• completely draining whirlpools, spa pools and natural thermal pools
     and thoroughly physically cleaning all surfaces and all pipework
     regularly;
• maintaining and physically cleaning heating, ventilation and air-
     conditioning (HVAC) systems serving the room in which spa pools
     are located;
• installing signs that list standard safety precautions near the
     recreational water environments, which caution people who are
     immunocompromised or who are taking immunosuppressant
     medicines against using the recreational water environments.
Routine cleaning of the whole circulation system, including the spa,
sprays, pumps and pipework, is critical and can require quite intensive
doses of disinfectant, as Legionella spp. can persist in biofilms (scums
on the surfaces of fittings and pipework), making them difficult to
inactivate.
Bathers must be encouraged to shower before entering the water. This
will remove pollutants such as perspiration, cosmetics and organic
debris that can act as a source of nutrients for bacterial growth and
as neutralizing agents for the oxidizing biocides. Bather density and
duration in whirlpools and spa baths can also be controlled. Spa-pool
facilities may require programmed rest periods during the day to allow
recovery of disinfectant concentrations.



100   Guide to ship sanitation
Testing for Legionella bacteria serves as a form of verification that
the controls are working and should be undertaken periodically—for
instance, monthly, quarterly or annually, depending on the type of ship
environment. This testing should not replace or pre-empt the emphasis
on control strategies. Furthermore, the tests are relatively specialized
and need to be undertaken by properly equipped laboratories using
experienced staff; they are therefore not generally performed by
crews or during voyages. Verification sampling should focus on system
extremities and high-risk sites.
6. Air quality
It is important to manage air quality as well as water quality in swimming
pools, spas and similar recreational water environments. Rooms housing
spas should be well ventilated to avoid an accumulation of Legionella
spp. in the indoor air. In addition, ventilation will help reduce exposure
to disinfection by-products in the air. Adequate ventilation should
reduce risks from Legionella spp., but it is important that the system
does not create its own risks. All surfaces of HVAC systems serving the
room in which the spa or pool is located should be physically cleaned
and disinfected to control biofilm.
Other design and construction aspects
The pool mechanical room must be readily accessible and well
ventilated, and a potable water tap must be provided in this room. To
help with ongoing maintenance, it is valuable to mark all piping with
directional-flow arrows and maintain a flow diagram and operational
instructions in a readily available location. The pool mechanical room
and recirculation system need to be designed for easy and safe storage
of chemicals and refilling of chemical feed tanks. Drains need to be
installed in the pool mechanical room to allow for rapid draining of the
entire pump and filter system, with a sufficiently large drain, at least
8 cm, being installed on the lowest point of the system.
To help reduce drowning risks, the depth of the pool and depth markers
must be displayed prominently so that they can be seen from the deck
and in the pool. Depth markers must be in either feet or metres, or both,
and installed for every significant (1 m) change of depth.

B. Recirculating pools
The equipment and the operating procedures need to provide complete
circulation of the water within the pool at a sufficient frequency, such as
replacement of the water every 6 hours or less during pool operation.
Equipment should include filters and other equipment and devices
for disinfection and treatment that may be necessary to meet the

                                            4 Recreational water environments   101
requirements or recommendations of the national health administration
of the country of registration. Self-priming, centrifugal pumps are
suitable to recirculate pool water.

C. Flow-through pools
The flow-through swimming pool is probably the type most practicable
for construction, installation and operation on board ships. The number
of bathers that can use a swimming pool safely at one time and the total
number that can use a pool during one day are governed by the area of
the pool and the rate of replacement of its water. Therefore, the pool
should be designed with special attention to the probable peak bather
load and the maximum space available for the construction of a pool.
The following principles should be applied in the design of flow-through
pools:
• The design capacity of the pool should be judged on the basis of the
   area, such as 2.6 m2 per bather. For the maintenance of satisfactorily
   clean water in the pool, the rate of flow of clean water needs to be
   sufficient to achieve complete replacement every 6 hours or less.
   The water flowing through must be delivered to the pool through
   multiple inlets, located to ensure uniform distribution. These inlets
   can be served by a branch line taking off from the main supply line,
   at the pressure side of the filling valve near the pool. Control of the
   flow must be independent of the filling valve.
• The overflow must be discharged into skim gutters or a similar
   boundary overflow, with multiple outlets spaced not more than 3 m
   apart, and discharging to the waste system.
• The bottom of the pool should slope towards the drain or drains
   in such a manner as to effect complete drainage of the pool. In the
   interest of safety, the slope of any part of the pool bottom in which
   the water is less than a standing depth, 1.8 m deep, should not be
   more than a 1 in 15 gradient. For safety, there should be no sudden
   change of slope within the area where the water depth is shallow,
   less than 1.5 m.
• To help reduce drowning risks, the depth of the pool and depth
   markers must be displayed prominently so that they can be seen
   from the deck and in the pool. Depth markers must be in either feet
   or metres, or both, and installed for every significant (1 m) change
   of depth.
It is preferable to have a separate water supply system, including the
pump, for recreational water environments. The water intake must be
forward of all sewage and drainage outlets. However, if the pool is to be

102   Guide to ship sanitation
filled and operated only when the ship is under way, the fire or sanitary
water pumps, or a combination of these pumps, may be used, noting
that the following can be used to reduce contamination risks:
• The delivery line to the pool should be independent of other lines
     originating at or near the discharge of the pump or the valve manifold
     or at a point where the maximum or near-maximum flushing of the
     fire or sanitary water pump is routinely effected.
• If seawater is drawn into the pool, water should not be drawn when
     the ship is in port or, if under way, in contaminated waters. A readily
     accessible shut-off valve should be located close to the point from
     which the water is drawn and labelled “CLOSE WHILE IN HARBOURS”.
Flow-through seawater supply systems for pools shall be used only
while the ship is under way and at sea beyond 12 nautical miles from
land. The pool (when in flow-through seawater mode) should be drained
before the ship reaches port and should remain empty while in port. If
the pool is not drained before arriving in port, the pool’s seawater filling
system should be shut off 12 nautical miles before reaching land, and
a recirculation system should be used with appropriate filtering and
halogenation.

D. Whirlpool spas
Whirlpools are subject to high bather loads relative to the volume of
water. With high water temperatures and rapid agitation of water, it may
become difficult to maintain satisfactory pH, microbiological quality
and disinfectant residuals; therefore, additional care must be taken in
the operation of whirlpools.
Potable water supplied to whirlpool systems must be supplied through
an air gap or approved backflow preventer. Water filtration equipment
needs to be able to remove all particles greater than 10 µm from the
entire whirlpool water volume in 30 minutes or less. Filters can be
cartridge filters, rapid-pressure sand filters, high-rate sand filters,
diatomaceous earth filters or gravity sand filters. A clear sight glass can
be added on the backwash side of the filters.
The overflow system must be designed so that the water level is
maintained. It is advisable that whirlpool overflows be either directed
by gravity to the make-up tank for recirculation through the filter system
or disposed of as waste. Self-priming, centrifugal pumps must be used to
recirculate whirlpool water.
Sufficient skimmers, one for every 14 m2 or fraction thereof of water
surface area, should be provided. The fill level of the whirlpool needs to
be at the skim gutter level to enable skimming to take effect.

                                             4 Recreational water environments   103
A temperature-control mechanism is required to prevent the
temperature from exceeding 40 °C to avoid scalding and overheating.
A make-up tank may be used to replace water lost by splashing and
evaporation. An overflow line at least twice the diameter of the supply
line and located below the tank supply line should be used.
The system needs to permit regular (e.g. daily) shock treatment
or superhalogenation. Halogenation equipment that is capable of
maintaining the appropriate levels of free halogen throughout the use
period must be included.

E. Spa pools
Spa pools have different operating conditions and present a special set
of problems to operators. The design and operation of these facilities
make it difficult to achieve adequate disinfectant residuals. They may
require higher disinfectant residuals because of higher bather loads and
temperatures, both of which lead to more rapid loss of a disinfectant
residual.
A Pseudomonas aeruginosa concentration of less than 1 cfu/100 ml
should be readily achievable through good management practices. Risk
management measures that can be taken to deal with these non-enteric
bacteria include ventilation, cleaning of equipment and verifying the
adequacy of disinfection.
Spa pools that do not use disinfection require alternative methods of
water treatment to keep the water microbiologically safe. A very high
rate of water exchange is necessary—even if not fully effective—if there
is no other way of preventing microbial contamination.
In spa pools where the use of disinfectants is undesirable or where it
is difficult to maintain an adequate disinfectant residual, superheating
spa water to 70 °C on a daily basis during periods of non-use may help
control microbial proliferation.
To prevent overloading of spa pools, some countries recommend
that clearly identifiable seats be installed for users combined with a
minimum pool volume being defined for every seat, a minimum total
pool volume and a maximum water depth.




104   Guide to ship sanitation
4.2.2 Guideline 4.2: Pool hygiene

  Guideline 4.2—Pool hygiene is continuously maintained.

Indicators for Guideline 4.2
1. Pre-swim showering is promoted.
2. Pre-swim use of toilets is promoted.
3. Effective procedures are in place to respond to vomitus and AFRs.
Guidance notes for Guideline 4.2

1. Pre-swim showering
Pre-swim showers will remove traces of sweat, urine, faecal matter,
cosmetics, suntan oil and other potential water contaminants. The result
will be cleaner pool water, easier disinfection using a smaller amount of
chemicals and water that is more pleasant to swim in.
Pre-swim showers should be located adjacent to the swimming pool and
be provided with water of drinking-water quality, as children and some
adults may ingest the shower water. Shower water must run to waste.

2. Visiting toilets pre-swim
Toilets must be provided where they can be conveniently used before
entering the pool and after leaving the pool. Users should be encouraged
to use the toilets before bathing to minimize urination in the pool and
AFRs. Parents need to encourage children to empty their bladders
before they swim. Children below a certain age, such as below two years
old, may not be permitted to use some pools.

3. Vomitus and accidental faecal releases
It is necessary to minimize AFRs and vomitus and to respond effectively
to them when they occur. AFRs appear to occur relatively frequently, and
it is likely that most go undetected. A pool operator faced with an AFR or
vomitus in the pool water needs to act immediately.
If a faecal release is a solid stool, it can simply be retrieved quickly and
discarded appropriately. The scoop used to retrieve it must be disinfected
so that any bacteria and viruses adhering to it are inactivated and will
not be returned to the pool the next time the scoop is used. As long as
the pool is in other respects operating properly (disinfecting residuals,
etc.), no further action is necessary.




                                             4 Recreational water environments   105
If the stool is runny (diarrhoea) or if there is vomitus, the situation is
potentially hazardous. Even though most disinfectants deal relatively
well with many bacterial and viral agents in AFRs and vomitus, the
possibility exists that the diarrhoea or vomitus is from someone infected
with one of the protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The
infectious stages (oocysts/cysts) are relatively resistant to chlorine
disinfectants in the concentrations that are practical to use. The pool
must therefore be cleared of bathers immediately.
The safest action, if the incident has occurred in a small pool, hot tub
or whirlpool, is to empty and clean it before refilling and reopening.
However, this may not be possible in larger pools.
If draining down is not possible, then the procedure given below—an
imperfect solution that will only reduce, but not remove, risk—can be
followed:
• The pool is cleared of people immediately.
• Disinfectant levels are maintained at the top of the recommended
    range.
• The pool is vacuumed and swept.
• Using a coagulant, the water is filtered for six turnover cycles. This
    could take up to a day and so might mean closing the pool until the
    next day.
• The filter is backwashed (and the water run to waste).
• The pool is reopened.
There are a few practical actions that pool operators can take to help
prevent faecal release into the pools:
• No child (or adult) with a recent history of diarrhoea should swim.
• Parents should be encouraged to make sure that their children use
   the toilet before they swim.
• Thorough pre-swim showering is a good idea, and parents should
   encourage their children to do it.
• Young children should, whenever possible, be confined to pools
   small enough to drain in the event of an accidental release of faeces
   or vomitus.
• Lifeguards or pool attendants, if present, should be made responsible
   for looking out for and acting on AFR or vomitus.

4.2.3 Guideline 4.3: Monitoring

  Guideline 4.3—Key parameters are monitored and maintained
  within target ranges.

Indicators for Guideline 4.3
1. Pool water turbidity is maintained within target ranges.
2. Disinfectant levels and pH are maintained within target ranges.
3. Microbial quality is maintained within target ranges, and there are
   effective procedures in place to respond to adverse detection events.
Guidance notes for Guideline 4.3
Frequent monitoring of control measures will help to provide early
warning of deviations and could include:
• checking and adjusting the disinfectant residual and pH;
• inspection of maintenance and cleaning operations;
• inspection of the physical condition of recreational water
   environments, filters and equipment;
• undertaking surveillance for lower respiratory illness (e.g.
   pneumonia) among passengers and staff by recording all visits to the
   ship’s medical office for confirmed or suspected pneumonia.
Parameters that are easy and inexpensive to measure and of immediate
health relevance—that is, turbidity, disinfectant residual and pH—must
be monitored frequently and in all pool types.

1. Turbidity
The ability to see either a small child at the bottom of the pool or
markings on the pool bottom from the lifeguard’s or pool attendant’s
position while the water surface is in movement is important. A
turbidity limit of 0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), or equivalent
measurement, provides a good target value for well-treated water.
Exceedance of turbidity limits suggests both a significant deterioration
in water quality and a significant health hazard. Such exceedance merits
immediate investigation and may lead to closure of the facility pending
remedial action.

2. Disinfectant levels and pH
For a conventional public swimming pool with good hydraulics and
filtration, operating within its design bather load, adequate routine
disinfection should be achieved with a free chlorine level of 1 mg/l
throughout the pool. In a well-operated pool, it is possible to achieve

                                          4 Recreational water environments   107
such a residual with maximum levels at any single point below 2 mg/l
for pools. Lower residuals (0.5 mg/l) will be acceptable in combination
with the additional use of ozone or UV disinfection, whereas higher
levels (ranging from 2 to 3 mg/l) may be required for hot tubs, because
of higher bather loads and higher temperatures (WHO, 2006).
Disinfectant residuals must be checked by sampling the pool before it opens
and during the opening period (ideally, during a period of high bather load)
(WHO, 2006). The frequency of testing during swimming-pool use depends
on the nature and use of the swimming pool. Samples should be taken at a
depth of 5–30 cm. It is good practice to include as a routine sampling point
the area of the pool where the disinfectant residual is lowest. Occasional
samples should be taken from other parts of the pool and circulation
system. If the routine test results are outside the recommended ranges, the
situation needs to be assessed and action taken.
The pH value of swimming-pool water needs to be maintained within
the recommended range to ensure optimal disinfection and coagulation.
The pH should be maintained between 7.2 and 7.8 for chlorine
disinfectants and between 7.2 and 8.0 for bromine-based and other non-
chlorine disinfection processes (WHO, 2006). In order to do so, regular
pH measurements are essential, and either continuous or intermittent
adjustment is usually necessary. For heavily used pools, the pH value
must be measured continuously and adjusted automatically. For less
frequently used pools, it may be sufficient to measure the pH manually.
To avoid the formation of excessive disinfection by-products or irritation
of mucosal surfaces by disinfectants, disinfectant residuals should be
maintained at levels that are consistent with satisfactory microbiological
quality but that are not unnecessarily excessive. Operators should
attempt to maintain free chlorine residual levels below 5 mg/l at all
points in the pool or spa.

3. Microbial quality
There is limited risk of significant microbial contamination and illness in
a well-managed pool or similar environment with an adequate residual
disinfectant concentration, a pH value maintained at an appropriate
level, well-operated filters and frequent monitoring of non-microbial
parameters. Nevertheless, samples of pool water from public pools
should be monitored at appropriate intervals for microbial parameters,
including HPC, thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Legionella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency
of monitoring and the guideline values vary according to microbial
parameter and the type of pool.


108   Guide to ship sanitation
Where operational guidelines are exceeded, pool operators should
check turbidity, residual disinfectant levels and pH and then resample.
When critical guidelines are exceeded, the pool should be closed while
investigation and remediation are conducted.
The following monitoring of microbial quality is recommended:
• The HPC (37 °C for 24 hours) gives an indication of the overall
   bacterial population within the pool. It is recommended that
   operational levels should be less than 200 cfu/ml.
• Thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli are indicators of faecal
   contamination. Either thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli should be
   measured in pools, hot tubs and spas. Operational levels should be
   less than 1 cfu or 1 most probable number (mpn) per 100 ml.
• Routine monitoring of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recommended in
   hot tubs and spas. It is suggested for swimming pools when there
   is evidence of operational problems (e.g. failure of disinfection
   or problems relating to filters or water pipes), a deterioration
   in the quality of the pool water or known health problems. It is
   recommended that, for continuously disinfected pools, operational
   levels should be below 1 cfu/100 ml. If high counts are found
   (>100 cfu/100 ml), pool operators should check turbidity,
   disinfectant residuals and pH, resample, backwash thoroughly, wait
   one turnover and resample. If high levels of P. aeruginosa remain,
   the pool should be closed, and a thorough cleaning and disinfection
   programme should be initiated. Hot tubs should be shut down,
   drained, cleaned and refilled.
• Periodic testing for Legionella spp. is useful, especially for hot
   tubs, in order to determine whether filters are being colonized.
   It is recommended that operational levels should be below
   1 cfu/100 ml. Where this is exceeded, hot tubs should be shut down,
   drained, cleaned and refilled. Shock chlorination may be appropriate if
   it is suspected that filters have become colonized.
• Routine monitoring of Staphylococcus aureus is not recommended,
   although monitoring may be undertaken as part of a wider
   investigation into the quality of the water when health problems
   associated with the pool are suspected. Where samples are taken,
   levels should be less than 100 cfu/100 ml.
Further advice on testing for Legionella spp. can be found in Bartram
et al. (2007).

5 Ballast water

5.1      Background
This chapter deals with the management of ballast water, including its
storage and safe disposal.

5.1.1 Health risks associated with ballast water on ships
Many ships use water as ballast to maintain stability and navigate
safely, carrying from 30% to 50% of the total cargo in ballast water.
This represents a volume that varies from a few hundred litres up to
more than 10 million litres per ship. Therefore, this water presents an
important risk to human health, with the possibility of introducing new
endemic diseases and spreading disease by transferring pathogens and
harmful organisms. In this context, more than 7000 marine species
travel daily, and approximately 10 billion tonnes of ballast water are
transported annually by ship. Concern regarding transfer of ballast
water and sediments from ships has increased, and there is a theoretical
possibility of transporting hazards such as toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1
and O139, which might then be associated with cholera outbreaks in
port areas.

5.1.2 Standards
The Marine Environment Protection Committee has adopted, since
1993, voluntary guidelines for the prevention of risks from unwanted
organisms through ballast water and sediments from ships. In 1997, the
IMO Assembly adopted, through Resolution A.868(20), the Guidelines
for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water to Minimize the
Transfer of Harmful Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens (IMO, 1998).
The IMO International Convention for the Control and Management of
Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments1 was adopted in February 2004.
The objective of this convention is to prevent, minimize and ultimately
eliminate risks to the environment, human health, property and
resources arising from the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and
pathogens through the control and management of ships’ ballast water
and sediments; to provide guidance to avoid unwanted side-effects
from the control measures put in place; and to encourage development

                                                                                           111
in related knowledge and technology. The measures for inspection
and control of the sanitary risks of ballast water tank sediments
must consider the procedures established in the IMO International
Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water
and Sediments. From 2009, but not later than 2016, the convention
requires the establishment of a ballast water management system on
board ships, which will replace the uncontrolled ballast water uptake
and discharge operations common until then. In future, ballast water
will have to be treated on board before being discharged into the
marine environment, in compliance with the Ballast Water Performance
Standard in Regulation D-2 of the convention.
Parties to the convention are given the right to take, individually or
jointly with other Parties, more stringent measures with respect to the
prevention, reduction or elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic
organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships’
ballast water and sediments, consistent with international law.

5.2    Guidelines
This section provides user-targeted information and guidance,
identifying responsibilities and providing examples of practices that
can control risks. Two specific guidelines (situations to aim for and
maintain) are presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of
indicators (measures for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance
notes (advice on applying the guidelines and indicators in practice,
highlighting the most important aspects that need to be considered
when setting priorities for action).
In some cases, ballast water treatment systems have failed to perform as
required, resulting in unsafe situations. Therefore, reliance should not
be placed on treatment and management systems alone. Multiple ballast
management barriers should be actively maintained, including:
• filling with ballast water from safe environments wherever
    practicable;
• matching ballast treatment facilities to their required capacities;
• maintaining sound practices in discharging ballast water.
Staff at ports and ship crews need to be adequately trained in the
protection of the environment, safe operation (including collection,
handling and disposal of wastes) and relevant legislation.




112   Guide to ship sanitation
5.2.1 Guideline 5.1: Ballast water management

  Guideline 5.1—A ballast water management plan is designed
  and implemented.

Indicators for Guideline 5.1
1. An approved ballast water management plan is in place and reviewed
   regularly.
2. Ballast water management requirements and practices are carried
   out as per the approved plan.
3. A ballast water record book is kept, with accurate records maintained.
4. Audit measures are in place and adhered to.
Guidance notes for Guideline 5.1
Ships are required to implement a ballast water management plan
approved by the administration (Regulation B-1 of the IMO International
Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water
and Sediments). The ballast water management plan is specific to
each ship and includes a detailed description of the actions to be
taken to implement the ballast water management requirements and
supplemental ballast water management practices.
Ballast water management systems must be approved by the
administration in accordance with IMO guidelines for the approval of
ballast water management systems (Resolution MEPC.174(58)). These
include systems that make use of chemicals or biocides, make use of
organisms or biological mechanisms, or alter the chemical or physical
characteristics of the ballast water.
Ships must have a ballast water record book (Regulation B-2) to record
when ballast water is taken on board, circulated or treated for ballast
water management purposes and discharged into the sea. It should
also record when ballast water is discharged to a reception facility and
accidental or other exceptional discharges of ballast water.
Ships are required to be surveyed and certified (Article 7—Survey
and Certification) and may be inspected by port State control officers
(Article 9—Inspection of Ships) who can verify that the ship has a valid
certificate, inspect the ballast water record book and/or sample the ballast
water. If there are concerns, a detailed inspection may be carried out,
and “the Party carrying out the inspection shall take such steps as will
ensure that the ship shall not discharge Ballast Water until it can do so
without presenting a threat of harm to the environment, human health,
property or resources”.

The specific requirements for ballast water management are contained
in Regulation B-3—Ballast Water Management for Ships:
       •    Ships constructed before 2009 with a ballast water capacity
            of between 1500 and 5000 cubic metres must conduct
            ballast water management that at least meets the ballast
            water exchange standards or the ballast water performance
            standards until 2014, after which time it shall at least meet
            the ballast water performance standard.
       •    Ships constructed before 2009 with a ballast water capacity
            of less than 1500 or greater than 5000 cubic metres must
            conduct ballast water management that at least meets
            the ballast water exchange standards or the ballast water
            performance standards until 2016, after which time it shall
            at least meet the ballast water performance standard.
       •    Ships constructed in or after 2009 with a ballast water
            capacity of less than 5000 cubic metres must conduct ballast
            water management that at least meets the ballast water
            performance standard.
       •    Ships constructed in or after 2009 but before 2012, with a
            ballast water capacity of 5000 cubic metres or more shall
            conduct ballast water management that at least meets the
            standard described in regulation D-1 or D-2 until 2016 and
            at least the ballast water performance standard after 2016.
       •    Ships constructed in or after 2012, with a ballast water
            capacity of 5000 cubic metres or more shall conduct ballast
            water management that at least meets the ballast water
            performance standard.

5.2.2 Guideline 5.2: Ballast water treatment and disposal

  Guideline 5.2—Ballast water is safely treated and disposed of.

Indicators for Guideline 5.2
1. Disposal of ballast water is carried out safely.
2. Overboard discharge of ballast water is carried out only within
   permitted bounds.
Guidance notes for Guideline 5.2

1. Disposal of ballast water
Ships are not generally permitted to discharge ballast water, bilge
water or any other liquid containing contaminating or toxic wastes
within an area from which water for a water supply is drawn or in any
area restricted from the discharge of wastes by any national or local


114   Guide to ship sanitation
authority. Overboard discharge in harbours, ports and coastal waters
is subject to the regulations of the governing authorities in these areas.
Sewage, food particles, putrescible matter and toxic substances must
not be discharged to the bilge.
The IMO International Convention for the Control and Management of
Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments has defined a ballast water exchange
standard and a ballast water performance standard.
As per Regulation D-1—Ballast Water Exchange Standard, ships
performing ballast water exchange shall do so with an efficiency of
95% volumetric exchange. For ships exchanging ballast water by the
pumping-through method, pumping through three times the volume
of each ballast water tank shall be considered to meet the standard
described. Pumping through less than three times the volume may be
accepted, provided that the ship can demonstrate that at least 95%
volumetric exchange is met.
As per Regulation D-2—Ballast Water Performance Standard, ships
conducting ballast water management shall discharge fewer than
10 viable organisms per cubic metre greater than or equal to 50 µm in
minimum dimension and fewer than 10 viable organisms per millilitre
less than 50 µm in minimum dimension and greater than or equal to
10 µm in minimum dimension; and discharge of the indicator microbes
shall not exceed the specified concentrations.
The indicator microbes, as a human health standard, include, but are not
limited to:
• toxicogenic Vibrio cholerae (O1 and O139): less than 1 cfu/100 ml or
   less than 1 cfu/g wet weight zooplankton samples;
• Escherichia coli: less than 250 cfu/100 ml;
• intestinal enterococci: less than 100 cfu/100 ml.
Other methods of ballast water management may also be accepted as
alternatives to the ballast water exchange standard and ballast water
performance standard, provided that such methods ensure at least the
same level of protection of the environment, human health, property
or resources and are approved in principle by the IMO’s Marine
Environment Protection Committee.
Under Article 5—Sediment Reception Facilities, Parties undertake to
ensure that ports and terminals where cleaning or repair of ballast tanks
occurs have adequate reception facilities for the intake of sediments.
Barges and/or trucks for the reception of liquid wastes or shore
connections at ports to receive these wastes into a sewer system are


                                                         5 Ballast water   115
typically provided at ports. Where the port servicing area or barge does
not provide a hose and suitable connections to receive liquid wastes, a
ship must provide a special hose and connections large enough to allow
rapid discharge of the wastes to sewer or other suitable point. This
hose needs to be durable and impervious and have a smooth interior
surface. It must be of a fitting different from that of the potable water
hose or other water-filling hose, and it must be labelled “FOR WASTE
DISCHARGE ONLY”. After use, the hose must be cleaned, disinfected and
stored in a convenient place labelled “WASTE DISCHARGE HOSE”.

2. Overboard discharge of ballast water
Under Regulation B-4—Ballast Water Exchange of the IMO International
Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and
Sediments, all ships using ballast water exchange should:
       •    whenever possible, conduct ballast water exchange at least
            200 nautical miles from the nearest land and in water at
            least 200 metres in depth, taking into account Guidelines
            developed by IMO;
       •    in cases where the ship is unable to conduct ballast water
            exchange as above, this should be as far from the nearest land
            as possible, and in all cases at least 50 nautical miles from the
            nearest land and in water at least 200 metres in depth.
When these requirements cannot be met, areas where ships can conduct
ballast water exchange may be designated. All ships shall remove and
dispose of sediments from spaces designated to carry ballast water in
accordance with the provisions of the ships’ ballast water management
plan (Regulation B-4).

6 Waste management and disposal


6.1    Background
This chapter deals with the management of solid waste (e.g. garbage)
and liquid waste (e.g. sewage and greywater) on board ship, including
their storage and safe disposal.

6.1.1 Health risks associated with wastes on ships
Unsafe management and disposal of ship wastes can readily lead to
adverse health consequences. Humans can become exposed directly,
both on ship and at port, as a result of contact with waste that is not
being managed in a safe manner. Exposure can also occur via the
environmental transfer of disease-causing organisms or harmful
substances due to unsafe disposal. However, waste can be managed and
disposed of in ways that prevent harm from occurring.
Waste can contain hazardous microbial, chemical or physical agents.
For example, sharp objects are in themselves dangerous and may
harbour infectious agents. Used syringes are a good example and can
transmit disease-causing agents, such as hepatitis C virus and human
immunodeficiency virus.
Risks of harm arising as a result of improperly managed ship waste are
increasing with the greater number of ships in service and the increase in
habitation in port areas. Waste streams on ships include sewage, greywater
and garbage, as well as effluent from oil/water separators, cooling water,
boiler and steam generator blow-down, medical wastes (e.g. health-
care wastes, laboratory wastes and veterinary-care wastes), industrial
wastewater (e.g. from photo processing) and hazardous waste (radioactive,
chemical and biological wastes and unwanted pharmaceuticals).
Food wastes and refuse readily attract rodents, flies and cockroaches,
for example, which are reservoirs and vectors of etiological agents of
many diseases (see chapter 7).
Restrictions on depositing hazardous wastes into water bodies mean
that ships need to capture and retain those wastes on board for periods
of time. The process of packaging and storing hazardous wastes is in
itself hazardous to the crew, and the storage of hazardous wastes leads
to the risk of harm arising should spills or leaks occur. Waste needs to be
appropriately disposed of in accordance with the rules and regulations
applicable at the point of disposal.


                                                                        117
6.1.2 Standards
Waste management from ships is covered in the IHR 2005 and in more
detail in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
from Ships (MARPOL 73/78, as amended).1 MARPOL was adopted by
the International Conference on Marine Pollution in 1973 and has been
subject to numerous amendments as it is updated, including the 1978
protocol and amendments collated into a consolidated version in 2002.
Regulations covering the various sources of ship-generated pollution
are contained in the six annexes of the Convention:
• Annex I. Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil;
• Annex II. Regulations for the Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid
   Substances in Bulk;
• Annex III. Prevention of Pollution by Harmful Substances Carried by
   Sea in Packaged Form;
• Annex IV. Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships (date of
   entry into force, 27 September 2003);
• Annex V. Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships;
• Annex VI. Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships (adopted September
   1997).
Medical waste requires special management. Specifically, details
of health-care waste management can be found at http://www.
healthcarewaste.org/en/115_overview.html and in the Guidelines for
safe disposal of unwanted pharmaceuticals in and after emergencies
(WHO, 1999).

6.2        Guidelines
This section provides user-targeted information and guidance, identifying
responsibilities and providing examples of practices that can control
risks. Three specific guidelines (situations to aim for and maintain) are
presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of indicators (measures
for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance notes (advice on
applying the guidelines and indicators in practice, highlighting the most
important aspects that need to be considered when setting priorities for
action).
Outbreaks and harm associated with waste have been linked to poor
storage and disposal practices. Once generated, stored waste becomes a
potential source of harm. Therefore, the first disease prevention strategy
should be to minimize the amount of hazardous waste generated as far as
1

118      Guide to ship sanitation
practicable. It is also necessary to ensure that the systems for collecting
and storing waste are adequate given the extent and nature of waste
generated on board ship.
In some cases, waste-management treatment systems have failed to
perform as required, resulting in unsafe situations. Therefore, reliance
should not be placed on treatment and management systems alone.
Multiple waste-management barriers should be actively maintained,
including:
• considering how waste is generated on board, and choosing activities
    and practices that produce the least hazardous waste in the first place;
• matching waste-management treatment facilities to their required
    capacities;
• maintaining sound practices in collecting and storing waste.
Staff at ports and ship crews need to be adequately trained in the
protection of the environment, safe operation and relevant legislation.
People involved in the collection, handling and disposal of wastes need to
be trained in the relevant legislation and the risks posed by wastes.

6.2.1 Guideline 6.1: Sewage and greywater management

  Guideline 6.1—Sewage and greywater are safely treated and
  disposed of.

Indicators for Guideline 6.1
1. The sanitary system adequately contains the liquid waste, and
   sewage and greywater are disposed of safely within permitted
   bounds.
2. Grease traps are used to manage greasy liquid wastes.
3. Appropriate treatment is applied, where required, before storage or
   discharge of sewage and greywater.
Guidance notes for Guideline 6.1

1. Disposal of sewage and liquid wastes
Ships are not generally permitted to discharge sewage or any other
liquid containing contaminating or toxic wastes within an area from
which a water supply is drawn or in any area restricted for the discharge
of wastes by any national or local authority. Overboard discharge in
harbours, ports and coastal waters is subject to the regulations of the
governing authorities in these areas. Sewage, food particles, putrescible
matter and toxic substances must not be discharged to the bilge.


                                             6 Waste management and disposal   119
Any country may provide special barges for the receipt of these wastes
or shore connections that input to the sewer system. Where the shore
servicing area or barge does not provide a hose or connections to receive
these wastes, the ship must provide a special hose and connections large
enough to allow rapid discharge of wastes. This hose must be durable
and impervious, have a smooth interior surface, be of a size different
from that of the potable water hose or other water-filling hoses and be
labelled “FOR WASTE DISCHARGE ONLY”. After use, the hose must be
cleaned by thorough flushing with clear water and stored in a convenient
place labelled “WASTE DISCHARGE HOSE”.
The prohibition against discharge of wastes near a water supply intake
or in any body of water where measures for the prevention and control
of pollution are in force will require the provision of retention tanks or
sewage-treatment equipment on board.
Systems need to be designed and constructed so as not to leak wastes
and need to be amenable to ready inspection to check for leaks or
bursts. Approved backflow preventers (vacuum breakers) or acceptable
air gaps must be installed in the water supply lines to the grinders.
All piping should be colour coded and labelled (e.g. according to ISO
14726:2006) at least every 5 m to avoid confusion and possible cross-
connection to potable water. Drain, soil and waste pipes need to be
maintained frequently to prevent clogging and the backflow of sewage,
greywater or contaminated wastes into the fixtures and spaces served
by the collection system.

2. Grease traps
All galley wastes, exclusive of ground refuse, that may contain grease
must be made to flow through grease interceptors (grease traps) to a
retaining box before discharge or treatment on board ship. The design of
the interceptors may need to be approved by the appropriate authority
of the country of registration. The grease collected may be disposed of by
incineration, by storage for shore disposal or by overboard discharge on
the high seas. Overboard discharge may occur after a suitable separation
distance with the closest line of land, such as 3 nautical miles (12 nautical
miles in territorial sea), in compliance with other national rules.

3. Treatment
All ships must be equipped with facilities for managing wastes from
toilets and urinals, hospital facilities and medical-care areas, and food
refuse grinders. These facilities include treatment systems and/or
safe holding tanks, properly equipped with pumps and piping. Wastes
from safe holding tanks may be discharged to port connections or to

120   Guide to ship sanitation
special barges or trucks. The design of treatment systems and waste-
holding tanks needs to be based on a suitable volume (e.g. 114 litres of
liquid waste per capita per day) and may need to be approved by the
appropriate authority of the country of registration.
For ships where the normal wastewater flow to be treated is quite large,
exceeding 4750 litres per day, treatment must be designed to produce
effluent of a suitable quality, such as biochemical oxygen demand of
50 mg/l or less, a suspended solids content of 150 mg/l or less and a
coliform count of 1000 or less per 100 ml.
Excess sludge must be stored for appropriate disposal to land-
based facilities or when on the high seas. For ships with a daily flow
of wastewater to be treated that is quite small, less than 4750 litres,
treatment may be limited to passing the wastes through grinders,
followed by disinfection to produce an effluent with a coliform count of
1000 or less per 100 ml.
Chlorination, or an equally effective method of disinfection, may need to
be installed, as recommended by the manufacturer, to produce an effluent
meeting the coliform requirements set by the relevant authorities.

6.2.2 Guideline 6.2: Solid waste management

  Guideline 6.2—Solid waste is safely treated and disposed of.

Indicators for Guideline 6.2
1. Garbage is safely stored in appropriately designed facilities.
2. Excess sludge is stored safely prior to appropriate disposal.
Guidance notes for Guideline 6.2

1. Facilities for waste storage
To prevent corrosion, the interiors of food and garbage lifts may need to
be constructed of stainless steel and meet the same standards required
for the storage, preparation and service of food. Decks need to be
constructed of a durable, non-absorbent, non-corroding material and
have a suitable internal cove, at least 10 mm along all sides. Bulkhead-
mounted air vents must be positioned in the upper portion of the panels
or in the deckhead. To help with cleaning and removal of spills, a drain
at the bottom of all lift shafts must be provided, including the provision
of platform lifts and dumbwaiters.




                                           6 Waste management and disposal   121
If used to transport waste, the interiors of dumbwaiters must be readily
cleanable and constructed of stainless steel or similar and meet the same
standards as other food service areas. The bottom of the dumbwaiter
should include a suitable cover.
Garbage chutes, if installed, need to be constructed of stainless steel or
similar and have an automatic cleaning system.
In waste-management equipment wash rooms, bulkheads, deckheads
and decks need to be constructed to meet the same standards required
for the storage, preparation and service of food. A bulkhead-mounted
pressure washing system could be provided with a deck sink and drain.
An enclosed automatic equipment washing machine or room may be
used in place of the pressure washing system and deck sink. Adequate
ventilation is required for extraction of steam and heat.
The garbage storage room should be well ventilated, and the temperature
and humidity controlled. A sealed, refrigerated space must be used for
storing wet garbage. The space needs to meet the same criteria for cold
storage facilities for food. The room must be of adequate size to hold
unprocessed waste for the longest expected period when off-loading of
waste is not possible and must be separated from all food preparation
and storage areas.
In all the garbage holding and processing facilities, there need to be
easily accessible hand-washing stations with potable hot and cold water,
hose connections and a sufficient number of deck drains to prevent any
pooling of water. The sorting tables in garbage processing areas must be
constructed from stainless steel or similar and have coved corners and
rounded edges. Deck coaming, if provided, needs to be adequate, at least
8 cm, and coved. If the tables have drains, they should be directed to the
deck drain, which requires a strainer. A storage locker must be provided
for cleaning materials to keep them away from foods. Adequate lighting,
at least 220 lux, is required at work-surface levels, and light fixtures need
to be recessed or fitted with stainless-steel or similar guards to prevent
breakage.
To facilitate storage, tops and bottoms must be removed from all empty
metal containers or containers with metal ends, and the remaining parts
flattened. Containers of paper, wood, plastic and similar materials should
also be flattened for convenient space-saving storage. Dry refuse must be
stored in tightly covered bins or in closed compartments, protected against
weather, wash and the entry of rodents and vermin. The containers must
be thoroughly cleaned after emptying and treated with insecticides or
pesticides, if necessary, to discourage harbourage of rodents and vermin.


122   Guide to ship sanitation
2. Excess sludge
Excess sludge is typically stored appropriately for appropriate disposal
to land-based facilities or when on the high seas.

6.2.3 Guideline 6.3: Health-care and pharmaceutical waste
      management

  Guideline 6.3—Health-care and pharmaceutical waste is safely
  treated and disposed of.

Indicator for Guideline 6.3
1. Health-care and pharmaceutical waste is safely treated and disposed
   of.
Guidance notes for Guideline 6.3
Pharmaceutical wastes produced on board must be managed
appropriately in order to prevent harm to the environment and human
health. Specific considerations for pharmaceutical wastes include
avoiding disposal of non-biodegradable products or products that might
harm bacteria involved in wastewater treatment into the sewage system
and avoiding burning pharmaceuticals at low temperatures or in open
containers.
Health-care waste is any waste generated during patient diagnosis,
treatment or immunization. Health-care waste is of two categories:
infectious and non-infectious. Infectious health-care waste is liquid
or solid waste that contains pathogens in sufficient numbers and
with sufficient virulence to cause infectious disease in susceptible
hosts exposed to the waste. Non-infectious health-care waste includes
disposable health-care supplies and materials that do not fall into the
category of infectious health-care waste.
All ships should be equipped with facilities for treating and/or safely
storing health-care wastes. Infectious waste must be safely stored or
sterilized (e.g. by steam) and suitably packaged for ultimate disposal
ashore. Health-care waste should be clearly labelled. Ships properly
equipped may incinerate paper- and cloth-based health-care waste,
but not plastic and wet materials. Sharps must be collected in plastic
autoclavable sharps containers and retained on board for ultimate
disposal ashore. Unused sharps must be disposed of ashore in the same
manner as health-care waste.




                                          6 Waste management and disposal   123
Liquid health-care wastes may be disposed of by discharging them into
the sewage system. Non-infectious health-care waste may be disposed
of as garbage if it does not require steam sterilizing or special handling.
Staff dealing with health-care wastes must be immunized against
hepatitis B virus.

note that some country medical guides are also available.

7 Vector and reservoir control


7.1    Background
This chapter deals with the management of disease vectors and their
reservoirs on board ship.
The IHR 2005 state that conveyance operators should “permanently keep
conveyances for which they are responsible free of sources of infection
or contamination, including vectors and reservoirs”. Every conveyance
leaving an area where vector control is recommended by WHO should
be disinfected and kept free from vectors. When there are methods and
materials recommended by WHO, these should be employed. States
should accept disinfection, deratting and other control measures applied
by other States if methods and materials recommended by WHO have
been applied. The presence of vectors on board conveyances and the
control methods used to eradicate them shall be included on the Ship
Sanitation Control Certificate (Articles 22 and 24, and Annexes 3, 4 and 5).
Vector control in and around ports is also part of the IHR 2005. State
Parties should ensure that port facilities are kept in a safe and sanitary
condition and free from sources of infection and contamination,
including vectors and reservoirs. The vector control measures should be
extended to a minimum distance of 400 m from passenger terminals and
operational areas (or more if vectors with a greater range are present, as
documented in specific guidelines).

7.1.1 Health risks associated with vectors on ships
Control of disease vectors such as insects and rodents is necessary
for the maintenance of health on board ships. Mosquitoes, rats, mice,
cockroaches, flies, lice and rat fleas are all capable of transmitting
disease.
Rodents are well established at port areas and are considered vectors
for many diseases. Plague, murine typhus, salmonellosis, trichinosis,
leptospirosis and rat bite fever are known to be spread by rodents.
Malaria is transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors. If not properly
controlled, such vectors could breed and be carried by ships. Ships
affected by malaria infection during a voyage represent a serious risk to
health and life of crew and passengers. On board, the chances for early
diagnosis and proper treatment are limited. Persons and vectors on
board can, in turn, spread disease to ports (e.g. Delmont et al., 1994).


                                                                         125
7.1.2 Standards
Article 20 of the IHR 2005 directs health authorities to ensure that
ports have the “capacity” to inspect ships and then to issue either Ship
Sanitation Control Certificates to direct disinfection or decontamination
of the ship, including the control of vectors, or Ship Sanitation Control
Exemption Certificates if contamination is not found.
Annex 1 of the IHR 2005 describes what constitutes this “capacity” and
notes that this includes the capacity to derat, disinfect, disinsect and
decontaminate ships.
Annex 4 of the IHR 2005 describes the process of issuance of such
“certificates” and states that the presence of vectors, not necessarily
evidence of disease per se, is sufficient basis for the issuance of the Ship
Sanitation Control Certificate to decontaminate the ship of those vectors.
Annex 5 of the IHR 2005 describes the controls for vector-borne disease
and provides health authorities with the right to control vectors found.

7.2    Guidelines
This section provides user-targeted information and guidance,
identifying responsibilities and providing examples of practices that
can control risks. Two specific guidelines (situations to aim for and
maintain) are presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of
indicators (measures for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance
notes (advice on applying the guidelines and indicators in practice,
highlighting the most important aspects that need to be considered
when setting priorities for action).
Ports receive and manage goods and people from all over the world.
Therefore, ports are exposed to the risk of vectors from any part of
their country or any other port in the world. In addition, the activities
undertaken at ports, such as handling foodstuffs, attract many species
of vermin. On board ship, the relative isolation of passengers and crew
from medical facilities makes diagnosis and treatment of disease more
difficult and potentially increases the risk of serious harm. The relatively
crowded nature of ships facilitates the spread of disease and ensures a
concentration of foodstuffs and hosts for vectors.
Outbreaks associated with the presence of vectors on board are usually
linked both to inadequate control and sanitation on board and to
insufficient attention to preventing contamination in the first place.
The failure of initial prevention leads to contamination, which is then
exacerbated by failed ongoing control.


126   Guide to ship sanitation
A preventive approach using good design that minimizes the opportunity
for vector penetration, hiding and proliferation is the foundation of
any good vector control strategy. Multiple barriers should be actively
maintained, including:
• screening out vectors using all reasonable means;
• controlling vectors on board;
• eliminating habitats suitable for vector survival and breeding, where
   practicable;
• reducing the opportunity for exposure of passengers and crew to
   vector-related infectious agents.
One or more of the following control measures may be employed:
• regular inspection of ship spaces, particularly where infestation is
  most likely to occur, such as food storage, food handling and refuse
  disposal spaces;
• elimination of pest hiding places and point of accumulation in which
  trash, food particles or dirt may accumulate;
• frequent cleaning of living quarters and spaces where food is stored,
  prepared or served or in which dishes and utensils are washed and
  stored;
• proper storage and disposal of food refuse and rubbish (see chapter 3);
• elimination of habitat for insect larvae, ideally through design, or, if
  unavoidable, though maintenance, such as preventing the formation
  of standing water in lifeboats;
• use of screens on all structural openings to the outer air during
  seasons when insects are prevalent;
• application of suitable insecticides.
As vectors may have access to ships when in port, control measures
for the suppression of vermin infestation are necessary. These control
measures must be carried out under the direction of a ship’s officer
charged with this responsibility and must be frequently inspected.

7.2.1 Guideline 7.1: Insect vector control

  Guideline 7.1—Insect vectors are controlled.

Indicators for Guideline 7.1
1. Insect-proof screens are used to prevent insect penetration.
2. Insecticides are used to control vector densities in air spaces and on
   surfaces.

                                               7 Vector and reservoir control   127
Guidance notes for Guideline 7.1

1. Screens
Sleeping quarters, mess rooms and dining-rooms, indoor recreational
areas and all food spaces must be effectively screened when ships are in
areas where flies and mosquitoes are prevalent. Screening of sufficient
hole tightness, no more than 1.6 mm spacing, is recommended, with
screens on all outside openings. Screen doors should open outwards
and be self-closing, and the screening must be protected from damage
by heavy wire netting or other means, which may include the use of
metal kick plates.
Ship holding water must be screened from insects and inspected
frequently to check for, and eliminate, mosquito breeding. Refuse stores
must be screened and inspected frequently to check for, and eliminate,
the breeding of flies or other vermin.
Screens need to be kept in good repair. Bed nets, in good repair and
properly placed, need to be used in sleeping quarters not provided with
screens.

2. Insecticides
When leaving an area in which vectors are prevalent, and at regular
intervals, residual and space sprays must be used for the control of
flying insects that have entered the ship. Space sprays are released as
a fog or fine mist and kill on contact. Residual sprays leave a deposit on
surfaces where flying insects rest and where other insects crawl, and
will remain active for a considerable period of time. Crawling insects
and other vermin are best controlled by specific insecticides, properly
applied to crawling, resting and hiding places.
As spray insecticides may contain substances toxic to humans, all
surfaces that come in contact with food, all dishes and utensils and
all food and drink need to be covered or removed during spraying
operations.
Insecticides, rodenticides, any other poisonous substances and all
equipment for their use must not be stored in or immediately adjacent
to spaces used for storage, handling, preparation or serving of food or
drink. Further, such poisonous substances should not be stored near
dishes and utensils or tableware, linen and other equipment used
for handling or serving food and drink. To prevent the accidental use
of these poisons in foodstuffs, such hazards must be kept in coloured
containers clearly marked as “POISON”.

7.2.2 Guideline 7.2: Rodent vector control

     Guideline 7.2—Rodent vectors are controlled.

Indicators for Guideline 7.2
1.    Rodent proofing is installed and maintained.
2.    Traps are used to control vector densities.
3.    Poisoned baits are used to control vector densities.
4.    Regular pest inspections are undertaken.
5.    Hygienic practices are used to minimize rodent attractors.
Guidance notes for Guideline 7.2

1. Rodent proofing
Rats gain access to ships by various means, including direct access by
hawsers (cables for mooring or towing the ship) and gangways. Others
may be concealed in cargo, ships’ stores and other materials taken onto
the ship. However, the prevention of rat harbourage through appropriate
construction and rat proofing will ensure almost complete control of
rodents on board.
Some ships may be difficult to rat proof without major alterations.
However, there are many rat-proofing measures that can be readily
undertaken. These will materially reduce rat harbourage and will
keep rat populations to a minimum after the ship has been deratted,
provided that appropriate operational control measures on board ship
are regularly followed.
Concealed spaces, structural pockets, openings that are too large
(greater than 1.25 cm), leading to voids, food spaces and gaps around
penetrating fixtures (e.g. pipes or ducts passing through bulkheads or
decks), regardless of location, need to be obstructed with rat-proofing
materials. The insulation layer around pipes, where over a certain
thickness, 1.25 cm, needs to be protected against rat gnawing.
Rat-proofing materials should be robust and damage resistant. Such
materials include sheet metal or alloy of suitable hardness and strength,
wire mesh and hardware cloth.
Metal wire or sheet metal gauges must be of adequate strength and
corrosion resistant. For example, aluminium should have a thickness
by the Brown & Sharp gauge greater than the thickness specified by
the United States standard for sheet iron, because aluminium is not



                                                7 Vector and reservoir control   129
as strong. For example, 16-gauge aluminium (Brown & Sharpe) might
replace 18-gauge sheet iron (United States Standard). For grades of wire
and hardware cloth, Washburn & Moen gauges are also used.
Certain non-rat-proof materials are satisfactory in rat-proof areas
provided that the boundaries and various gnawing edges are flashed.
Wood and asbestos composition materials are acceptable under
conditions such as the following:
• Wood must be dry or seasoned and free of warps, splits and knots.
• Inorganic composition sheets and panels must be relatively strong
   and hard, with surfaces that are smooth and resistant to the gnawing
   of rats. A list of acceptable non-rat-proof materials may be obtained
   from national health administrations. If a new material is intended
   for use, the national health administration must be consulted in
   order to initiate approval procedures.
• Certain composition sheets and panels that do not meet the
   requirements in the bullet point above may be made acceptable by
   laminating with metal or facing on one side using suitable materials.
   All materials in this category are likely to be subject to health
   administration approval for inclusion in an acceptable non-rat-proof
   materials list.
Cements, putties, plastic sealing compounds, lead and other soft
materials or materials subject to breaking loose are not advised in place
of rat-proofing materials to close small openings. Firm, hard-setting
materials used to close openings around cables within ferrules might
need to be approved by the ship inspection officer. Fibreboards and
plaster boards are generally not acceptable non-rat-proof materials. For
approval, the relevant health administration should be consulted.
Non-rat-proof sheathing need not be rat proofed when placed flush
against, or within 2 cm of, steel plate or when placed flush against rat-
proofing material over insulation. Overlapping joints are not necessary
for sheathing.
Effective rat-proofing collars at suitable distances from the ship and able
to withstand wind action should be fitted to any hawsers that connect
the ship to the shore.

2. Trapping
The master of the ship can delegate one person to be responsible for
the vector control programme. Traps must be set after leaving any port
where rats might have come on board either directly from the dock or
with cargo or stores. If all traps are still empty after a period of two days,


130   Guide to ship sanitation
they can be taken up. If rats are caught, the traps in that area must be
reset until no more rats are caught. A record of where the traps were set,
the dates and results must be entered in the ship’s log and a copy made
available for the port health inspector.

3. Baiting
Most rodenticides may be very toxic and poisonous to humans. Caution
must be used in their application, with instructions for their use
carefully followed. The containers must be marked “POISON” and stored
away from food preparation and storage areas; they must be coloured to
prevent accidental use in food preparation. It should be checked that the
baits have been correctly placed and whether they have been consumed.

4. Inspections
Rats leave droppings, gnawing damage and grease marks, which provide
a ready indicator of infestation. Regular inspection of the ship to look for
such evidence will show whether rats have gained access to the ship.
Inspection should focus particularly on spaces where food is stored and
prepared and where refuse is collected and disposed of, as well as the
cargo hold while in port.
All rat proofing needs to be kept in good repair, inspected and maintained
regularly. Pest infestations must be dealt with immediately and without
adversely affecting food safety or suitability. Treatment with chemical,
physical or biological agents must be carried out without posing a threat
to the safety or suitability of food.

5. Hygiene
Rats pose a major threat to the safety and suitability of food. Rodent
infestations can occur where there are breeding sites and a supply of
food. Good hygiene practices should be employed to avoid creating
an environment conducive to rodents. Good sanitation, inspection of
incoming materials and good monitoring should minimize the likelihood
of infestation and thereby limit the need for rodenticides.

8 Controlling infectious diseases in the
  environment

8.1 Background
This chapter deals with the management of persistent infectious agents
on board ship.

8.1.1 Health risks associated with persistent infectious agents
      on ships
There have been a number of outbreaks of acute infectious gastrointestinal
illnesses (AGI), such as those caused by norovirus (e.g. United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002), and acute respiratory
illnesses (ARI), such as influenza (e.g. Brotherton et al., 2003), on ships
caused by communicable infectious agents. For example, in 2002, the
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected
21 outbreaks (in this case, defined as “probable Norovirus infections
causing illness in >3% of the ship population”) on board ships arriving
at ports in the United States (United States Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2002). In general, diseases arising from communicable
infectious agents result from infection of the gastrointestinal system
(digestive tract, intestines, stomach) and cause acute symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Respiratory infections can also arise and
can cause acute symptoms such as fever, myalgia, weakness, sore throat,
cold and cough. Although these diseases are often self-limiting or even
asymptomatic, deaths can arise, particularly in sensitive populations. In
the confines of a ship environment, these diseases can spread rapidly to
affect significant proportions of the total ship population. These same
diseases are highly prevalent on land, making it difficult to avoid some
infected persons coming aboard.
The subject of this chapter is the infectious agents that have the ability
to persist in air, water, vomitus and sputum and on surfaces for long
enough that indirect transfer from one person to another can readily
occur and result in an outbreak.
Many infectious agents can be spread via environmental surfaces and
even via the air, including some protozoa, bacteria and viruses. However,
to cause a detectable and significant outbreak on board, the agents need
to be highly infectious and able to rapidly complete their incubation
and begin replicating in their new infected host. For this reason, the
environmentally persistent agents that cause AGI and ARI outbreaks on

                                                                        133
board ships are generally viruses. Our knowledge of these viruses and
their taxonomy is rapidly evolving. However, in general, the risk factors
and control measures to be applied on board are the same, regardless of
the taxonomic classification of the infectious agent.
An infected person might, for example, be shedding an infectious agent
via his or her faeces or vomitus. After bottom-wiping, nappy-changing
or cleaning, the infected person or his or her caregiver might carry some
of this material on their hands, unless thoroughly washed, leaving it
on surfaces or in food or water that they touch around the ship. When
another person touches those surfaces or consumes the food or water,
he or she might pick up the infectious agent, which can then be ingested
when putting fingers in the mouth or through ingestion of contaminated
food or water.
Infectious agents can also be spread via the air, such as via coughing and
sneezing, leading to exhaling of pathogens from the respiratory tract.
Waterborne and foodborne transmission of agents may also occur. This
is considered in chapters 2 and 3, respectively, with particular discussion
of the risks associated with Legionella spp.
This chapter considers two types of pathogens. Those infectious agents
that cause AGI typically spread via environmental surfaces, such as
door handles. Those infectious agents that cause ARI are more typically
spread via the air.

Acute infectious gastrointestinal illnesses
Persistent infectious agents causing AGI are typically viruses belonging
to the Calicivirus, Astrovirus and Reovirus families. These viruses
are commonly associated with diarrhoea, with the Calicivirus family
including the genus most commonly associated with ship-borne
outbreaks: Norovirus (which has also been known as Norwalk-like virus
and small round structured virus).
Because of the similarity between symptoms and control measures, and
to illustrate the risk factors and control measures to be applied on board,
norovirus will be used as a typical cause of AGI and influenza viruses
as a typical cause of ARI. In general, norovirus is the more infectious,
more resistant to disinfection and more difficult to control of these two
types of virus and will form the primary focus of this chapter. For the
most part, the controls in place to prevent norovirus spread on board
will help reduce the spread of other, less robust pathogens among the
persistent infectious agents.



134   Guide to ship sanitation
Norovirus is considered to be the leading cause of adult gastroenteritis
outbreaks worldwide and is thought to be second only to rotavirus in
terms of all causes of gastroenteritis. Recent improvements in diagnostics
and surveillance are likely to reveal more outbreaks on board ships. The
probable role of international travellers as vectors was revealed by the
similarity of strains between outbreaks across the world (White et al.,
2002).
Norovirus can be transmitted by the aerosols liberated by projectile
vomiting and therefore by airborne transmission (Marks et al., 2000)
as well as by ingestion (both directly or indirectly via a surface) of
infected vomit and faeces. Environmental surfaces can readily become
contaminated and remain contaminated for some time (Cheesbrough
et al., 2000).
An outbreak can spread rapidly throughout a ship, because norovirus
has an incubation period of just 12–48 hours, and the proportion of
those exposed that fall ill can be high (often above 50%) in all age groups
(United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002).
Symptoms often start with sudden onset of projectile vomiting and/or
diarrhoea. There may be fever, myalgia, abdominal cramps and malaise.
Recovery occurs in 12–60 hours in most cases, and severe illness or
mortality is rare, particularly if oral rehydration treatment is applied.
Because the infectious agents are persistent, outbreaks may continue
and attack passengers and crew on successive voyages. Cohorts of new
crew and passengers are introduced to the ship on a regular basis, so it is
important to sanitize the ship after an outbreak.
Shedding rates for norovirus have been found to peak at above 106 virions
per gram of faeces, dropping to around 1000 virions per gram of faeces
three weeks from the cessation of symptoms in around 50% of cases and
remaining detectable for up to seven weeks following the peak of infection
(Tu et al., 2008). Therefore, even if ships are disinfected, bridging between
groups may occur via a reservoir within infected persons. Another
important implication of this prolonged shedding period, noting that it is
often asymptomatic, is that some passengers and crew are likely to bring
these persistent infectious agents on board with them regardless of what
the crew does. It should be assumed that there are unrecognized infected
individuals on board even in the absence of a detectable outbreak, and
infection control precautions should be implemented continuously, not
just after the outbreak has taken hold.




                                 8 Controlling infectious diseases in the environment   135
Acute respiratory illnesses
Persistent infectious agents causing ARI are typically viruses belonging
to the Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, influenza virus and Coronavirus families.
These viruses are commonly associated with symptoms such as cold
and cough, and some cause broader symptoms resulting in greater
morbidity, such as fever. Influenza viruses typically cause the most
severe symptoms among the more commonly identified causes of
outbreaks. Influenza viruses are an ongoing and common problem for
ships due to the difficulty in containing their spread, even among partially
vaccinated populations (Brotherton et al., 2003).
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (WHO, 2004) has been noted
as a disease that might be spread by travellers. This disease, caused
by a coronavirus, has symptoms that are typically different from those
of the gastrointestinal viruses described above and is associated with
respiratory tract infection and flu-like symptoms. However, although
initially presenting rather like influenza, complications can include
severe pneumonia and respiratory system failure, which can be fatal.
The risks from the person-to-person spread of SARS appear to be
reduced by the same types of control measures applied for norovirus,
influenza virus and similar agents.
In accordance with Article 37 of the IHR 2005, ships entering port may
be required to report to health authorities on the health conditions on
board during the voyage and the health status of passengers and crew. For
this purpose, a Maritime Declaration of Health must be completed by the
ship’s master and countersigned by the ship’s surgeon, if one is carried,
and delivered to health officials after arrival.

8.2    Guidelines
This section provides user-targeted information and guidance,
identifying responsibilities and providing examples of practices that
should control risks. Three specific guidelines (situations to aim for
and maintain) are presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of
indicators (measures for whether the guidelines are met) and guidance
notes (advice on applying the guidelines and indicators in practice,
highlighting the most important aspects that need to be considered
when setting priorities for action).

generally those that involve being in close proximity to an infected
person, including (based on de Wit, Koopmans & van Duynhoven, 2003):
• having another infected person in the same family or group;
• coming into contact with an infected person;
• poor food and water handling hygiene;
• contact with both faeces and vomitus, which appear to be equally
   important;
• being in close proximity to a person who is infected and coughing or
   sneezing.
The significance of contact with other infected persons increases where
the infected person is a young child.
Ships present a particularly high risk for extensive outbreaks, for several
reasons. Many outbreaks on land have been associated with situations in
which many people are in close proximity to other infected persons for
a period of time, such as at parties, restaurants, schools and dormitories.
These high-risk situations can all be present on a ship. Cabins often include
people living in close proximity, often with children, who might otherwise
be more separated.
The previous chapters in this guide emphasize prevention at source
above all other control strategies. However, persistent infectious agents
are typically so prevalent in the population, often without symptoms
being evident, that it is not realistic to try to exclude infected individuals
from coming on board. The focus of the control strategy for persistent
infectious agents should be on taking all reasonable precautions to
prevent transmission at all times; the working assumption should be
that persons are infected. It is worth noting, however, that symptomatic
individuals are typically far more infectious than those who are
asymptomatic, and there is value in taking extra precautions relating
to such individuals, seeking to minimize the possibility of patients
contaminating others on board. Extended outbreaks may occur when
there is inadequate control of possible infection pathways on board.
Reliance should not be placed on any single control strategy, and
multiple barriers should be actively maintained.

8.2.1 Guideline 8.1: Transmission routes

  Guideline 8.1—Transmission routes on board ship are
  minimized.

Indicators for Guideline 8.1
1. Good personal hygiene practices are promoted on board and
   required by crew and staff.
2. Stringent food and water hygiene is maintained on board.
3. Stringent hygiene practices with regard to cleaning and waste
   management on board are maintained.
Guidance notes for Guideline 8.1

1. Personal hygiene
Promoting and adopting good personal hygiene on board can
significantly reduce the spread of persistent infectious agents. Examples
of activities that should be promoted include:
• providing sufficient and ready access to hand-washing and sanitizing
    facilities at eateries, toilets, child-care facilities, health-care facilities
    and entry points, and keeping these facilities highly visible, including
    through the use of signage;
• providing non-contact facilities for hand washing, drying and
    sanitizing (e.g. taps and soap- and sanitizer-delivery systems that do
    not require hand contact to operate);
• avoiding putting fingers in or near the mouth unless first washed;
• avoiding placing objects that may have been touched into the mouth;
• providing guidance on proper hand washing and sanitizing;
• covering the nose and mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing,
    which are then discarded.

2. Food and water hygiene
Promoting and adopting good food and water hygiene on board can
significantly reduce the spread of persistent infectious agents. Examples
of activities that should be promoted include:
• maintaining stringent food and water handling hygiene, as discussed
    in chapters 2 and 3 of this guide;
• designing self-service facilities to minimize infectious agent
    transmission, supervising these facilities closely and preventing
    children from using them; consider eliminating self-serve eating
    facilities during large outbreaks;

138   Guide to ship sanitation
• limiting the need for indirect contact with others, such as the sharing
  of drink containers and eating utensils;
• providing separate serving utensils if dishes are to be shared, to
  avoid people serving themselves by hand or using utensils that have
  been placed in their mouths;
• providing cutlery and appropriate seating facilities to minimize the
  need to handle food while eating, and serving food of a type and
  packaged to minimize the need for handling;
• if food handling is inevitable as part of food consumption, providing
  hand sanitizers along with the food.

3. Good general hygiene practices
Adopting good hygiene practices should help to reduce the spread of
persistent infectious agents on board. Examples of activities that should
be promoted include:
• cleaning and sanitizing items both between and during voyages; this
   should include any environmental surface that might be touched
   by one infected person and lead to indirect transmission to another
   (toilet and tap operating handles; eating and drinking utensils; door
   handles; remote-control devices; switches on lights, radios and air-
   conditioning units; chair, table and bedding surfaces; and carpets);
• providing good ventilation;
• constructing surfaces from non-absorbent materials that are easily
   cleaned and sanitized;
• providing separate areas for children and adults to reduce the risk of
   cross-transmission;
• requiring the use of underwear or towels in saunas and other
   communal areas where clothing can otherwise be removed;
• rapidly cleaning up and sanitizing any faecal or vomitus spills on ship.

8.2.2 Guideline 8.2: Air quality

  Guideline 8.2—Good air quality is maintained to reduce the
  risk of airborne disease transmission.

Indicator for Guideline 8.2
1. Good air quality is maintained to prevent airborne disease
   transmission.




                                    8 Controlling infectious diseases in the environment   139
Guidance notes for Guideline 8.2
To help protect air quality on board, it is important to keep air circulating
and, as far as practicable, free from hazardous agents. Intake air openings
should be maintained in clean and operational condition. Air filters
should be kept in sanitary condition. Non-disposable (permanent)
filters should be cleaned as recommended by the manufacturer, typically
monthly. Disposable filters should be changed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s specification, typically every three months.
Air-conditioning rooms must be maintained in clean condition. Objects,
chemicals, products and utensils should not be stocked or stored in
these rooms, to avoid dispersion of biological or chemical hazards.
Air-conditioning rooms should not present any leakage on condensing
and cooling systems. Cleaning and disinfection procedures in the air-
conditioning system should be made only with specific chemicals
indicated for the specific system (non-toxic, biodegradable, etc.). Ship
operators should monitor and record the cleaning and maintenance
procedures for air-conditioning systems.

8.2.3 Guideline 8.3: Cases and outbreaks

  Guideline 8.3—Cases and outbreaks are responded to
  effectively.

Indicators for Guideline 8.3
1. Procedures, equipment and facilities are in place to manage
   symptomatic individuals to minimize further disease spread.
2. Procedures, equipment and facilities are in place to respond to
   outbreaks with enhanced control measures.
Guidance notes for Guideline 8.3

1. Manage symptomatic individuals
The scope of this guide is as a “sanitation” guide. Refer to the WHO
International medical guide for ships (WHO, 2007) and seek medical
advice from the next port for case-by-case management for individuals.
Adopting targeted and additional controls around symptomatic
individuals is justified given that they are likely to be highly infectious.
Examples of activities that should be included in procedures include:
• putting in place systems to provide the earliest possible detection of
   disease symptoms;
• advising, or even requiring, symptomatic individuals to minimize
   contact with others;

140   Guide to ship sanitation
• requesting that symptomatic individuals do not board the ship;
• wearing suitable masks and gloves while in close contact with
  symptomatic individuals;
• providing patients with advice on minimizing the risk of spreading their
  infection to others where they cannot be isolated, such as limiting any
  direct contact with others, even during greetings (e.g. shaking hands
  and kissing), remaining in cabins as much as possible to minimize
  contact with others and not taking part in food handling duties or
  other duties that may readily lead to transmission of infection;
• vaccinating crew that may come into contact with infected individuals,
  where practicable;
• using antiviral therapies, where available, to help suppress infection
  and shedding rates.

2. Respond to outbreaks
Enhanced responses to outbreaks should reduce their severity and
duration and help to prevent outbreaks affecting subsequent travellers.
Examples of activities that should be included in procedures include:
• seeking to identify the source of the outbreak. If the characteristic of
   an outbreak suggests a point source, the relevant control measures
   need to be rechecked and rigorously enforced, and epidemiological
   investigations should be undertaken to identify or exclude a food or
   water source. As foodborne and waterborne outbreaks have occurred
   on ships, kitchen hygiene practices and water safety management
   need to be reviewed and monitored;
• advising symptomatic passengers or crew to stay in cabins. Excretion and
   exhalation of viruses can begin shortly before the onset of symptoms and
   can continue for up to several weeks, although the maximum shedding
   typically occurs 24–72 hours after symptoms begin. The appropriate
   duration of confinement should be based on specific medical advice in
   accordance with the probable cause of disease;
• requiring cleaning staff and crew to undertake hand washing after
   contact with affected passengers or crew and objects, before handling
   food or drink and on leaving an affected area or cabin;
• requiring the wearing of suitable masks by crew and caregivers to
   protect those who come into contact with infected individuals;
• prompt cleaning and disinfection in areas contaminated by vomitus
   and faeces. Cleaning staff must wear gloves and aprons. Although
   there is evidence that airborne transmission is possible, the wearing
   of masks is generally not essential unless spattering or aerosolization
   is anticipated;

                                8 Controlling infectious diseases in the environment   141
• separating embarking and disembarking passengers, if possible. If an
  outbreak has occurred on board, embarkation of new passengers should
  be delayed until the ship has been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.
  The appropriate duration of separation should be based on specific
  medical advice in accordance with the specific nature of the disease.
Prolonged outbreaks on ships suggest that some infectious agents, such
as norovirus, can be harboured in the ship environment. During an
outbreak, there is a need for a comprehensive and responsive cleaning
and disinfection programme during and at the end of an outbreak.
Particular attention must be given to cleaning objects that are frequently
handled, such as taps, door handles, toilets or bath rails. For infectious
agents causing AGI, the timing of the terminal cleaning process should be
at least 72 hours after resolution of the last case. This takes into account
the period of maximal infectivity (48 hours) plus the typical incubation
period (24 hours) for the newly infected individuals. Affected areas
should be cleaned and disinfected.
Contaminated linens and bed curtains must be placed carefully into
laundry bags appropriate to guidelines for infected linens (e.g. soluble
alginate bags with a colour-coded outer bag) without generating further
aerosols. Contaminated pillows should be laundered as infected linen
unless they are covered with an impermeable cover, in which case they
must be disinfected.
Carpets and soft furnishings are particularly difficult to disinfect.
Hypochlorite is not generally recommended, as prolonged contact is
required, and many items requiring disinfection are not bleach resistant.
Steam cleaning may be used for carpets and soft furnishings, provided
that they are heat tolerant (some carpets are “bonded” to the underlying
floor with heat-sensitive materials). However, this needs to be undertaken
thoroughly, as a temperature of at least 60 °C is needed to achieve
disinfection, and, in practice, tests have shown that such high temperatures
are often not reached in carpets during steam cleaning. Vacuum cleaning
carpets and buffing floors have the potential to recirculate viruses and are
not recommended.
Contaminated hard surfaces should be washed with detergent and
hot water, using a disposable cloth, then disinfected with a suitable
disinfecting solution. Disposable cloths must be disposed of safely by
handling so as not to contaminate other persons. Non-disposable mop
heads and cleaning cloths must be laundered as contaminated linen using
hot water.

Acceptable non-      A material whose surface is resistant to gnawing by rats when
rat-proof material   exposed edges are flashed, but which can be subject to
                     penetration by rats if the gnawing edges are not so protected.
Accessible           Capable of being exposed for cleaning and inspection with the
                     use of simple tools such as a screwdriver, pliers or an open-end
                     wrench.
Air gap              The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere
                     between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying
                     water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood-
                     level rim of the receptacle or receiving fixture. The air gap must
                     be at least twice the diameter of the supply pipe or faucet or at
                     least 2.5 cm.
Backflow             The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into
                     the distribution pipes of a potable supply of water from any
                     source or sources other than the potable water supply. Back-
                     siphonage is one form of backflow.
Backflow             An approved backflow-prevention plumbing device that must be
preventer            used on potable water distribution lines where there is a direct
                     connection or a potential connection between the potable water
                     distribution system and other liquids, mixtures or substances
                     from any source other than the potable water supply. Some
                     devices are designed for use under continuous water pressure,
                     whereas others are non-pressure types.
Corrosion            Able to resist corrosive deterioration so that the surface
resistant            maintains its original surface characteristics even under
                     prolonged influence of the intended use environment.
Coved                A concave surface, moulding or other design that eliminates
                     the usual angles of 90 degrees or less so as to prevent the
                     accumulation of dirt and debris and facilitate cleaning.
Crew                 Persons on board a conveyance who are not passengers.
Cross-connection     Any unprotected actual or potential connection or structural
                     arrangement between a public or a consumer’s potable water
                     system and any other source or system through which it is
                     possible to introduce into any part of the potable system any
                     used water, industrial fluid, gas or substance other than the
                     intended potable water with which the system is supplied.
                     Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable
                     sections, swivel or change-over devices and other temporary
                     or permanent devices that can allow backflow are considered
                     to be cross-connections.
Deck sink            A sink recessed into the deck, usually located at tilting kettles
                     and pans.
