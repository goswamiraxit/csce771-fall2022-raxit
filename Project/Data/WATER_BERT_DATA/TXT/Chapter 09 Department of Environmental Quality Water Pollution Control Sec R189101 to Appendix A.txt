 Requirements for a New Facility (Arizona Administrative Code
                       (2021 Edition))

§ R18-9-B204. Treatment Performance Requirements for a New
Facility

A. Definition. "Week" means a seven-day period starting on Sunday and
ending on the following Saturday.

B. An owner or operator of a new sewage treatment facility shall ensure that
the facility meets the following performance requirements upon release of
the treated wastewater at the outfall:

1. Secondary treatment levels.

a. Five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) less than 30 mg/l (30-day
average) and 45 mg/l (seven-day average), or carbonaceous biochemical
oxygen demand (CBOD 5 ) less than 25 mg/l (30-day average) or 40 mg/l
(seven-day average);

b. Total suspended solids (TSS) less than 30 mg/l (30-day average) and 45
mg/l (seven-day average);

c. pH maintained between 6.0 and 9.0 standard units; and

d. A removal efficiency of 85 percent for BOD 5, CBOD 5, and TSS;

2. Secondary treatment by waste stabilization ponds is not considered
BADCT unless an applicant demonstrates to the Department that site-
specific hydrologic and geologic characteristics and other environmental
factors are sufficient to justify secondary treatment by waste stabilization
ponds;

3. Total nitrogen in the treated wastewater is less than 10 mg/l (five-month
rolling geometric mean). If an applicant demonstrates, using appropriate
monitoring that soil aquifer treatment will produce a total nitrogen
concentration less than 10 mg/l in wastewater that percolates to
groundwater, the Department may approve soil aquifer treatment for
removal of total nitrogen as an alternative to meeting the performance
requirement of 10 mg/l at the outfall;

4. Pathogen removal.

a. For a sewage treatment facility with a design flow of less than 250, 000
gallons per day at a site where the depth to the seasonally high groundwater
table is greater than 20 feet and there is no karstic or fractured bedrock at
the surface:

 Requirements for a New Facility (Arizona Administrative Code
                       (2021 Edition))

i. The concentration of fecal coliform organisms in four of the wastewater
samples collected during the week is less than 200 cfu/100 ml or the
concentration of E. coli bacteria in four of the wastewater samples collected
during the week is less than 126 cfu/100 ml, based on a sampling frequency
of seven daily samples per week;

ii. The single sample maximum concentration of fecal coliform organisms in
a wastewater sample is not greater than 800 cfu/100 ml or the single sample
maximum concentration of E. coli bacteria in a wastewater sample is not
greater than 504 cfu/100 ml; and

iii. An owner or operator of a facility may request a reduction in the
monitoring frequency required in subsection (B)(4)(a)(i) if equipment is
installed to continuously monitor an alternative indicator parameter and the
owner or operator demonstrates that the continuous monitoring will ensure
reliable production of wastewater that meets the numeric concentration
levels in subsections (B)(4)(a)(i) and (ii) at the discharge point;

b. For any other sewage treatment facility:

i. No fecal coliform organisms or no E. coli bacteria are detected in four of
the wastewater samples collected during the week, based on a sampling
frequency of seven daily samples per week;

ii. The single sample maximum concentration of fecal coliform organisms in
a wastewater sample is not greater than 23 cfu/100 ml or the single sample
maximum concentration of E. coli is not greater than 15 cfu/100 ml;

iii. An owner or operator may request a reduction in the monitoring
frequency required in subsection (B)(4)(b)(i) if equipment is installed to
continuously monitor an alternative indicator parameter and the owner or
operator demonstrates that the continuous monitoring will ensure reliable
production of wastewater that meets the numeric concentration levels in
subsections (B)(4)(b)(i) or (ii) at the discharge point;

c. An owner or operator may use unit treatment processes, such as
chlorination-dechlorination, ultraviolet, and ozone to achieve the pathogen
removal performance requirements specified in subsections (B)(4)(a) and
(b);

d. The Department may approve soil aquifer treatment for the removal of
fecal coliform or E. coli bacteria as an alternative to meeting the
performance requirement in subsection (B)(4)(a) or (b), if the soil aquifer
treatment process will produce a fecal coliform or E. coli bacteria
    Ariz. Admin. Code R18-9-B204 Treatment Performance
 Requirements for a New Facility (Arizona Administrative Code
                       (2021 Edition))

concentration less than that required under subsection (B)(4)(a) or (b), in
wastewater that percolates to groundwater;

5. Unless governed by A.R.S. § 49-243(I), the performance requirement for
each constituent regulated under R18-11-406(B) through (E) is the numeric
Aquifer Water Quality Standard;

6. The performance requirement for a constituent regulated under A.R.S. §
49-243(I) is removal to the greatest extent practical regardless of cost.

a. An operator shall minimize trihalomethane compounds generated as
disinfection byproducts using chlorination, dechlorination, ultraviolet, or
ozone as the disinfection system or using a technology demonstrated to have
equivalent or better performance for removing or preventing trihalomethane
compounds.

b. For other pollutants regulated by A.R.S. § 49-243(I), an operator shall use
one of the following methods to achieve industrial pretreatment:

i. Regulate industrial sources of influent to the sewage treatment facility by
setting limits on pollutant concentrations, monitoring for pollutants, and
enforcing the limits to reduce, eliminate, or alter the nature of a pollutant
before release into a sewage collection system;

ii. Meet the pretreatment requirements of A.R.S. § 49-255.02; or

iii. For sewage treatment facilities without significant industrial input,
conduct periodic monitoring to detect industrial discharge; and

7. A maximum seepage rate less than 550 gallons per day per acre for all
containment structures within the treatment works. A sewage treatment
facility that consists solely of containment structures with no other form of
discharge complies with Article 2 Part B by operating below the maximum
550 gallon per day per acre seepage rate.

C. The Director shall incorporate treated wastewater discharge limitations
and associated monitoring specified in this Section into the individual
permit to ensure compliance with the BADCT requirements.

D. An applicant shall formally request in writing and justify an alternative
that allows less stringent performance than that established in this Section,
based on the criteria specified in A.R.S. § 49-243(B)(1).

E. If the request specified in subsection (D) involves treatment or disposal
works that are a demonstration, experimental, or pilot project, the Director

D. Soil absorption rate (SAR) and disposal works sizing.

1. An applicant shall determine the soil absorption area by dividing the
design flow by the applicable soil absorption rate. If soil characterization
and percolation test methods yield different SAR values or if multiple
applications of the same approach yield different values, the designer of the
disposal works shall use the lowest SAR value unless a higher SAR value is
proposed and justified to the Department's satisfaction in the Notice of
Intent to Discharge.

2. The SAR used to calculate disposal works size for systems described in
R18-9-E302 is as follows:

3. For an on-site wastewater treatment facility described in a general permit
other than R18-9-E302, the SAR is dependent on the ability of the facility to
reduce the level of TSS and BOD 5 and is calculated using the following
formula:

a. "SAR a " is the adjusted soil absorption rate for disposal works design in
gallons per day per square foot,

b. "TSS" is the total suspended solids in wastewater delivered to the disposal
works in milligrams per liter,

 Wastewater Treatment Facilities (Arizona Administrative Code
                        (2021 Edition))

c. "BOD 5 " is the five-day biochemical oxygen demand of wastewater
delivered to the disposal works in milligrams per liter, and

d. "SAR" is the soil absorption rate for septic tank effluent determined by the
subsurface characterization method described in R18-9-A310.

4. An applicant shall ensure that the facility is designed so that the area of
the intended installation is large enough to allow for construction of the
facility and for future replacement or repair and is at least as large as the
following:

a. For a dwelling, a primary area for the disposal works sized according to
subsection (D)(1) and a reserve area of 100 percent of the primary area,
excluding the footprint of the treatment works. A reserve area is not
required for a lot in a subdivision approved before 1974 if the lot conforms
to its original approved configuration;

b. For other than a dwelling, a primary area for the disposal works sized
according to subsection (D)(1) and a reserve area of 100 percent of the
primary area, excluding the footprint of the treatment works.

5. An applicant shall ensure that the subsurface disposal works is designed
to achieve the design flow established in R18-9-A309(B)(3) through proper
hydraulic function, including conditions of seasonally cold and wet weather.

E. Vertical separation distances.

1. Minimum vertical separation to the seasonal high water table for a
disposal works described in R18-9-E302 receiving septic tank effluent. For a

i. Any point in a sewer main when flowing full can accommodate a peak wet
weather flow calculated by multiplying the sum of the upstream sources of
flow from Table 1, Unit Design Flows by a dry weather peaking factor based
on upstream population, as tabulated below, and adding a wet weather
infiltration and inflow rate based on either a percentage of peak dry weather
flow or a gallons per acre rate of flow;

B. Article 9 of this Chapter applies to any "discharge of a pollutant."
Examples of categories that result in a "discharge of a pollutant" and may
require an AZPDES permit include:

1. CAFOs;

2. Concentrated aquatic animal production facilities;

3. Case-by-case designation of concentrated aquatic animal production
facilities;

a. The Director may designate any warm- or cold-water aquatic animal
production facility as a concentrated aquatic animal production facility upon
determining that it is a significant contributor of pollution to navigable
waters. The Director shall consider the following factors when making this
determination:

i. The location and quality of the receiving waters of the United States;

ii. The holding, feeding, and production capacities of the facility;

iii. The quantity and nature of the pollutants reaching navigable waters; and

iv. Any other relevant factor;

b. A permit application is not required from a concentrated aquatic animal
production facility designated under subsection (B)(3)(a) until the Director
conducts an onsite inspection of the facility and determines that the facility
should and could be regulated under the AZPDES permit program;

4. Aquaculture projects;

5. Manufacturing, commercial, mining, and silviculture point sources;

6. POTWs;

7. New sources and new dischargers;

Applicability, and Exclusions (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                            Edition))

a. Associated with industrial activity as defined under 40 CFR 122.26(b)(14),
incorporated by reference in R18-9-A905(A)(1)(d). The Department shall
not consider a discharge to be a discharge associated with industrial activity
if the discharge is composed entirely of stormwater and meets the conditions
of no exposure as defined under 40 CFR 122.26(g), incorporated by
reference in R18-9-A905(A)(1)(d);

b. From a large, medium, or small MS4;

c. From a construction activity, including clearing, grading, and excavation,
that results in the disturbance of:

i. Equal to or greater than one acre or;

ii. Less than one acre of total land area that is part of a larger common plan
of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb
equal to or greater than one acre; but

iii. Not including routine maintenance that is performed to maintain the
original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of the facility;

d. Any discharge that the Director determines contributes to a violation of a
water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to a
navigable water, which may include a discharge from a conveyance or
system of conveyances (including roads with drainage systems and
municipal streets) used for collecting and conveying stormwater runoff or a
system of discharges from municipal separate storm sewers.

C. Articles 9 and 10 of this Chapter apply to the following biosolids
categories and may require an AZPDES permit:

1. Treatment works treating domestic sewage that would not otherwise
require an AZPDES permit; and

2. Using, applying, generating, marketing, transporting, and disposing of
biosolids.

D. Director designation of MS4s.

1. The Director may designate and require any small MS4 located outside of
an urbanized area to obtain an AZPDES stormwater permit. The Director
shall base this designation on whether a stormwater discharge results in or
has the potential to result in an exceedance of a water quality standard,
including impairment of a designated use, or another significant water
quality impact, including a habitat or biological impact.
   Ariz. Admin. Code R18-9-A902 Azpdes Permit Transition,
Applicability, and Exclusions (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                            Edition))

a. When deciding whether to designate a small MS4, the Director shall
consider the following criteria:

i. Discharges to sensitive waters,

ii. Areas with high growth or growth potential,

iii. Areas with a high population density,

iv. Areas that are contiguous to an urbanized area,

v. Small MS4s that cause a significant contribution of pollutants to a
navigable water,

vi. Small MS4s that do not have effective programs to protect water quality,
and

vii. Any other relevant criteria.

b. The same requirements for small MS4s designated under 40 CFR
122.32(a)(1) apply to permits for designated MS4s not waived under R18-9-
B901(A)(3).

2. The Director may designate an MS4 as part of a large or medium system
due to the interrelationship between the discharges from a designated storm
sewer and the discharges from a municipal separate storm sewer described
under R18-9-A901(16)(a) and (b), or R18-9-A901(20)(a) or (b), as
applicable. In making this determination, the Director shall consider the
following factors:

a. Physical interconnections between the municipal separate storm sewers;

b. The location of discharges from the designated municipal separate storm
sewer relative to discharges from municipal separate storm sewers described
in R18-9-A901(16)(a) and R18-9-A901(20)(a);

c. The quantity and nature of pollutants discharged to a navigable water;

d. The nature of the receiving waters; and

e. Any other relevant factor.

3. The Director shall designate a small MS4 that is physically interconnected
with a MS4 that is regulated by the AZPDES program if the small MS4
substantially contributes to the pollutant loading of the regulated MS4.

Applicability, and Exclusions (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                            Edition))

E. Petitions. The Director may, upon a petition, designate as a large,
medium or small MS4, a municipal separate storm sewer located within the
boundaries of a region defined by a stormwater management regional
authority based on a jurisdictional, watershed, or other appropriate basis
that includes one or more of the systems described in R18-9-A901(16), R18-
9-A901(20) or R18-9-A901(35), as applicable.

F. Phase-ins.

1. The Director may phase-in permit coverage for a small MS4 serving a
jurisdiction with a population of less than 10, 000 if a phasing schedule is
developed and implemented for approximately 20 percent annually of all
small MS4s that qualify for the phased-in coverage.

a. If the phasing schedule is not yet approved for permit coverage, the
Director shall, by December 9, 2002, determine whether to issue an
AZPDES permit or allow a waiver under R18-9-B901(A)(3) for each eligible
MS4.

b. All regulated MS4s shall have coverage under an AZPDES permit no later
than March 8, 2007.

2. The Director may provide a waiver under R18-9-B901(A)(3) for any
municipal separate storm sewage system operating under a phase-in plan.

G. Exclusions. The following discharges do not require an AZPDES permit:

1. Discharge of dredged or fill material into a navigable water that is
regulated under section 404 of the Clean Water Act ( 33 U.S.C. 1344);

2. The introduction of sewage, industrial wastes, or other pollutants into
POTWs by indirect dischargers. Plans or agreements to switch to this
method of disposal in the future do not relieve dischargers of the obligation
to have and comply with a permit until all discharges of pollutants to a
navigable water are eliminated. This exclusion does not apply to the
introduction of pollutants to privately owned treatment works or to other
discharges through a pipe, sewer, or other conveyance owned by the state, a
municipality, or other party not leading to treatment works;

3. Any discharge in compliance with the instructions of an on-scene
coordinator under 40 CFR 300, The National Oil and Hazardous Substances
Pollution Contingency Plan; or 33 CFR 153.10(e), Control of Pollution by Oil
and Hazardous Substances, Discharge Removal;

4. Any introduction of pollutants from a nonpoint source agricultural or
silvicultural activity, including stormwater runoff from an orchard,
   Ariz. Admin. Code R18-9-A902 Azpdes Permit Transition,
Applicability, and Exclusions (Arizona Administrative Code (2021
                            Edition))

cultivated crop, pasture, rangeland, and forest land, but not discharges from
a concentrated animal feeding operation, concentrated aquatic animal
production facility, silvicultural point source, or to an aquaculture project;

5. Return flows from irrigated agriculture;

6. Discharges into a privately owned treatment works, except as the Director
requires under 40 CFR 122.44(m), which is incorporated by reference in
R18-9-A905(A)(3)(d);

7. Discharges from conveyances for stormwater runoff from mining
operations or oil and gas exploration, production, processing or treatment
operations, or transmission facilities, composed entirely of flows from
conveyances or systems of conveyances, including pipes, conduits, ditches,
and channels, used for collecting and conveying precipitation runoff and
that are not contaminated by contact with or that has not come into contact
with, any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished
product, byproduct, or waste product located on the site of the operations.

H. Conditional no exposure exclusion.

1. Discharges composed entirely of stormwater are not considered
stormwater discharges associated with an industrial activity if there is no
exposure, and the discharger satisfies the conditions under 40 CFR
122.26(g), which is incorporated by reference in R18-9-A905(A)(1)(d).

2. For purposes of this subsection:

a. "No exposure" means that all industrial materials and activities are
protected by a storm resistant shelter to prevent exposure to rain, snow,
snowmelt, and runoff.

b. "Industrial materials or activities" include material handling equipment
or activities, industrial machinery, raw materials, intermediate products, by-
products, final products, or waste products.

c. "Material-handling activities" include storage, loading and unloading,
transportation, or conveyance of any raw material, intermediate product,
final product, or waste product.

§ R18-9-A906. General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and
New Sources of Pollution

A. The reduction or alteration of a pollutant may be obtained by physical,
chemical, or biological processes, process changes, or by other means,
except as prohibited under 40 CFR 403.6(d), which is incorporated by
reference in R18-9-A905(A)(8)(b). Appropriate pretreatment technology
includes control equipment, such as equalization tanks or facilities, for
protection against surges or slug loading that might interfere with or
otherwise be incompatible with the POTW. However, if wastewater from a
regulated process is mixed in an equalization facility with unregulated
wastewater or with wastewater from another regulated process, the effluent
from the equalization facility shall meet an adjusted pretreatment limit
calculated under 40 CFR 403.6(e), which is incorporated by reference in
R18-9-A905(A)(8)(b).

B. Pretreatment applies to:

1. Pollutants from non-domestic sources covered by pretreatment standards
that are indirectly discharged, transported by truck or rail, or otherwise
introduced into POTWs;

2. POTWs that receive wastewater from sources subject to national
pretreatment standards; and

3. Any new or existing source subject to national pretreatment standards.

C. National pretreatment standards do not apply to sources that discharge to
a sewer that is not connected to a POTW.

D. For purposes of this Section the terms "National Pretreatment Standard"
and "Pretreatment Standard" mean any regulation containing pollutant
discharge limits promulgated by EPA under section 307(b) and (c) of the
Clean Water Act ( 33 U.S.C. 1317), which applies to Industrial Users. This
term includes prohibitive discharge limits established under 40 CFR 403.5.

A. Two or more animal feeding operations under common ownership are
considered a single animal feeding operation if they adjoin each other or if
they use a common area or system for the disposal of wastes.

B. The Director shall designate an animal feeding operation as a CAFO if the
animal feeding operation significantly contributes a pollutant to a navigable
water. The Director shall consider the following factors when making this
determination:

1. The size of the animal feeding operation and the amount of wastes
reaching a navigable water;

2. The location of the animal feeding operation relative to a navigable water;

3. The means of conveyance of animal wastes and process wastewaters into a
navigable water;

   Requirements (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


§ R18-9-D902. Azpdes Permit Coverage Requirements

A. Any person who owns or operates a CAFO, except as provided in
subsections (B) and (C), shall submit an application for an individual permit
under R18-9-B901(B) or seek coverage under a general permit under R18-9-
C901(B) within the applicable deadline specified in R18-9-D904(A).

B. If a person who owns or operates a large CAFO receives a no potential to
discharge determination under R18-9-D903, coverage under an AZPDES
permit described in this Part is not required.

C. The discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater to a navigable
water from a CAFO as a result of the application of manure, litter, or process
wastewater by the CAFO to land areas under its control is subject to
AZPDES permit requirements, except where it is an agricultural stormwater
discharge as provided in section 502(14) of the Clean Water Act ( 33 U.S.C.
1362(14)). For purposes of this Section, an "agricultural stormwater
discharge" means a precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or
process wastewater from land areas under the control of a CAFO when the
person who owns or operates the CAFO has applied the manure, litter, or
process wastewater according to site-specific nutrient management practices
to ensure appropriate agricultural use of the nutrients in the manure, litter,
or process wastewater, as specified under 40 CFR 122.42(e)(1)(vi) through

§ R18-9-D903. No Potential to Discharge Determinations for
Large Cafos

A. For purposes of this Section, "no potential to discharge" means that there
is no potential for any CAFO manure, litter, or process wastewater to enter
into a navigable water under any circumstance or climatic condition.

B. Any person who owns or operates a large CAFO and has not had a
discharge within the previous five years may request a no potential to
discharge determination by submitting to the Department:

1. The information specified in 40 CFR 122.21(f) and 40 CFR 122.21(i)(1)(i)
through (ix) on a form obtained from the Department, by the applicable date
specified in R18-9-D904(A); and

2. Any additional information requested by the Director to supplement the
request or requested through an onsite inspection of the CAFO.

C. Process for making a no potential to discharge determination.

1. Upon receiving a request under subsection (B), the Director shall
consider:

a. The potential for discharges from both the production area and any land
application area, and

b. Any record of prior discharges by the CAFO.

2. The Director shall issue a public notice that includes:

a. A statement that a no potential to discharge request has been received;

b. A fact sheet, when applicable;

c. A brief description of the type of facility or activity that is the subject of
the no potential to discharge determination;

d. A brief summary of the factual basis, upon which the request is based, for
granting the no potential to discharge determination; and

e. A description of the procedures for reaching a final decision on the no
potential to discharge determination.

3. The Director shall base the decision to grant a no potential to discharge
determination on the administrative record, which includes all information
submitted in support of a no potential to discharge determination and any
other supporting data gathered by the Director.

4. The Director shall notify the owner or operator of the large CAFO of the
final determination within 90 days of receiving the request.

D. If the Director determines that the operation has the potential to
discharge, the person who owns or operates the CAFO shall seek coverage
under an AZPDES permit within 30 days after the determination of
potential to discharge.

E. A no potential to discharge determination does not relieve the CAFO from
the consequences of a discharge. An unpermitted CAFO discharging a
pollutant into a navigable water is in violation of the Clean Water Act even if
the Director issues a no potential to discharge determination for the facility.
If the Director issues a determination of no potential to discharge to a CAFO
facility but the owner or operator anticipates a change in circumstances that
could create the potential for a discharge, the owner or operator shall
contact the Director and apply for and obtain permit authorization before
the change of circumstances.

F. When the Director issues a determination of no potential to discharge, the
Director retains the authority to subsequently require AZPDES permit
coverage if:

1. Circumstances at the facility change;

2. New information becomes available; or

3. The Director determines, through other means, that the CAFO has a
potential to discharge.

    Ariz. Admin. Code R18-9-1010 Vector Attraction Reduction
           (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


§ R18-9-1010. Vector Attraction Reduction

A. Except as provided in subsection (B), an applicator or person who
prepares biosolids shall use one of the following vector attraction reduction
procedures if biosolids are land-applied:

1. Reducing the mass of volatile solids by a minimum of 38% using the
calculation procedures established in "Environmental Regulations and
Technology -- Control of Pathogens and Vector Attraction in Sewage Sludge,
" EPA/625/R-92-013, published by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268, 1999 edition. This material is incorporated
by reference, does not include any later amendments or editions of the
incorporated matter, and is on file with the Department and the Office of the
Secretary of State;

2. If the 38% volatile solids reduction cannot be met for anaerobically
digested biosolids the reduction can be met by digesting a portion of the
previously digested material anaerobically in a laboratory in a bench-scale
unit for 40 additional days at a temperature between 30° C and 37° C.
Vector attraction reduction is achieved if, at the end of the 40 days, the
volatile solids in the material at the beginning of the period are reduced by
less than 17%;

3. If the 38% volatile solids reduction cannot be met for aerobically digested
biosolids, the reduction can be met by digesting a portion of the previously
digested material, which has a percent solids of 2% or less, aerobically in a
laboratory in a bench-scale unit for 30 additional days at 20° C. Vector
attraction reduction is achieved if, at the end of the 30 days, the volatile
solids in the material at the beginning of the period are reduced by less than
15%;

4. Treat the biosolids in an aerobic process during which the specific oxygen
uptake rate (SOUR) is equal to or less than 1.5 milligrams of oxygen per
hour per gram of total solids (dry-weight basis) at 20° C;

5. Treat the biosolids in an aerobic process for 14 days or longer, during
which the temperature of the biosolids is higher than 40° C and the average
temperature of the biosolids is higher than 45° C;

6. Raising the pH of the biosolids to 12 or higher by alkali addition and,
without the addition of more alkali, remain at 12 or higher for two hours and
at 11.5 or higher for an additional 22 hours;

7. The percent solids of the biosolids that do not contain unstabilized solids
generated in a primary wastewater treatment process is equal to or greater
    Ariz. Admin. Code R18-9-1010 Vector Attraction Reduction
           (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


than 75% based on the moisture content and total solids before mixing with
other materials;

8. The percent solids of the biosolids containing unstabilized solids
generated in a primary wastewater treatment process are equal to or greater
than 90% based on the moisture content and total solids before mixing with
other materials;

9. Injecting the biosolids below the surface of the land so that no significant
amount of biosolids is present on the land surface one hour after injection. If
the biosolids meet Class A pathogen reduction, injection shall occur within
eight hours after being discharged from a Class A pathogen treatment
process; or

10. Incorporating the biosolids into the soil within six hours after
application. If the biosolids meet Class A pathogen reduction, application
shall occur within eight hours after being discharged from a Class A
pathogen treatment process.

B. Biosolids that are sold or given away in a bag or other container, or are
applied to a lawn or home garden, shall meet one of the vector attraction
reduction alternatives established in subsections (A)(1) through (A)(8).

C. For domestic septage, vector attraction reduction is met by one of the
following methods:

1. By injecting as specified in subsection (A)(9);

2. By incorporating as specified in subsection (A)(10); or

3. By raising the pH of the domestic septage to 12 or higher through the
addition of alkali and, without the addition of more alkali, holding the pH at
12 or higher for at least 30 minutes.

people or more, that are applied to land, shall, by letter or on a form
provided by the Department, report to the Department all the following
applicable information regarding their activities during the previous
calendar year:

1. The amount of biosolids received if the preparer purchased or received the
biosolids from another preparer or source;

2. The amount of biosolids produced (tons or kilograms);

3. The amount of biosolids distributed;

4. The concentrations of the pollutants listed in R18-9-1005 (in milligrams
per kilogram of biosolids on a dry-weight basis);

including the results.

G. All annual self-monitoring reports shall contain the following certification
statement signed by a responsible official:

"I certify, under penalty of law, that the information and descriptions, have
been made under my direction and supervision and under a system designed
to ensure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information used to determine whether the applicable biosolids
requirements have been met. I am aware that there are significant penalties
for false certification including the possibility of fine and imprisonment."

 Application Rates (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


APPENDIX A. Procedures to Determine Annual Biosolids
Application Rates

The following procedure determines the annual biosolids application rate
(ABAR) that ensures that the annual pollutant loading rates in Table 3 of
R18-9-1005 are not exceeded.

1. The relationship between the annual pollutant loading rate (APLR) for a
pollutant and the ABAR is shown in the following equation.

APLR = C x ABAR x 0.001

APLR = Annual pollutant loading rate in kilograms of biosolids, per hectare,
per 365-day period;

C = Pollutant concentration in milligrams, per kilogram of total solids (dry-
weight basis);

ABAR = Annual biosolids application rate in metric tons, per hectare, per
365-day period (dry-weight basis); and

0.001 = A conversion factor.

metric ton = 1.102 short tons

hectare = 2.471 acres

2. The ABAR is calculated using the following procedure:

a. Analyze a biosolids sample to determine a concentration for each of the
pollutants listed in Table 3 of R18-9-1005; and

b. Using each of the pollutant concentrations from subsection (2)(a) and the
APLRs from Table 3 of R18-9-1005, calculate a separate ABAR for each
pollutant using the following equation:

c. The ABAR for biosolids is the lowest value calculated in under subsection
(2)(b) for any pollutant.
