§ R18-11-104. Designated Uses

A. The Director shall adopt or remove a designated use or subcategory of a
designated use by rule.

B. Designated uses of a surface water may include full-body contact, partial-
body contact, domestic water source, fish consumption, aquatic and wildlife
(cold water), aquatic and wildlife (warm water), aquatic and wildlife
(ephemeral), aquatic and wildlife (effluent-dependent water), agricultural
irrigation, and agricultural livestock watering. The designated uses for
specific surface waters are listed in Appendix B of this Article.

C. Numeric water quality criteria to maintain and protect water quality for
the designated uses are prescribed in Appendix A, R18-11-109, R18-11-110,
and R18-11-112. Narrative water quality standards to protect all surface
waters are prescribed in R18-11-108.

D. If a surface water has more than one designated use listed in Appendix B,
the most stringent water quality criterion applies.

E. The Director shall revise the designated uses of a surface water if water
quality improvements result in a level of water quality that permits a use
that is not currently listed as a designated use in Appendix B.

F. In designating uses of a surface water and in establishing water quality
criteria to protect the designated uses, the Director shall take into
consideration the applicable water quality standards for downstream surface
waters and shall ensure that the water quality standards that are established
for an upstream surface water also provide for the attainment and
maintenance of the water quality standards of downstream surface waters.

G. A use attainability analysis shall be conducted prior to removal of a
designated use or adoption of a subcategory of a designated use that
requires less stringent water quality criteria.

H. The Director may remove a designated use or adopt a subcategory of a
designated use that requires less stringent water quality criteria, provided
the designated use is not an existing use and it is demonstrated through a
use attainability analysis that attaining the designated use is not feasible for
any of the following reasons:

1. A naturally-occurring pollutant concentration prevents the attainment of
the use;

2. A natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low-flow condition or water level
prevents the attainment of the use;
      Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-104 Designated Uses (Arizona
               Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


3. A human-caused condition or source of pollution prevents the attainment
of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental
damage to correct than to leave in place;

4. A dam, diversion, or other type of hydrologic modification precludes the
attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the surface water to its
original condition or to operate the modification in a way that would result
in attainment of the use;

5. A physical condition related to the natural features of the surface water,
such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and
the like, unrelated to water quality, precludes attainment of an aquatic life
designated use; or

6. Controls more stringent than those required by § 301 (b) and § 306 of the
Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. § 1311 and § 1316] are necessary to attain the use
and implementation of the controls would result in substantial and
widespread economic and social impact.

              Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


§ R18-11-106. Net Ecological Benefit

A. The Director may, by rule, modify a water quality standard on the ground
that there is a net ecological benefit associated with the discharge of effluent
to support or create a riparian and aquatic habitat in an area where water
resources are limited. The Director may modify a water quality standard for
a pollutant if it is demonstrated that:

1. The discharge of effluent creates or supports an ecologically valuable
aquatic, wetland, or riparian ecosystem in an area where these resources are
limited;

2. The ecological benefits associated with the discharge of effluent under a
modified water quality standard exceed the environmental costs associated
with the elimination of the discharge of effluent;

3. The cost of treatment to achieve compliance with a water quality standard
is so high that it is more cost effective to eliminate the discharge of effluent
to the surface water. The discharger shall demonstrate that it is feasible to
eliminate the discharge of effluent that creates or supports the ecologically
valuable aquatic, wetland, or riparian ecosystem;

4. The discharge of effluent to the surface water will not cause or contribute
to a violation of a water quality standard that has been established for a
downstream surface water;

5. All practicable point source discharge control programs, including local
pretreatment, waste minimization, and source reduction programs are
implemented; and

6. The discharge of effluent does not produce or contribute to the
concentration of a pollutant in the tissues of aquatic organisms or wildlife
that is likely to be harmful to humans or wildlife through food chain
concentration.

B. The Director shall not modify a water quality criterion for a pollutant to
be less stringent than a technology-based effluent limitation that applies to
the discharge of that effluent. The discharge of effluent shall, at a minimum,
comply with applicable technology-based effluent limitations.

§ R18-11-107. Antidegradation

A. The Director shall, using R18-11-107.01 and this Section, determine
whether there is degradation of water quality in a surface water on a
pollutant-by-pollutant basis.

B. Tier 1: The level of water quality necessary to support an existing use shall
be maintained and protected. No degradation of existing water quality is
permitted in a surface water where the existing water quality does not meet
the applicable water quality standards.

C. Tier 2: Where existing water quality in a surface water is better than the
applicable water quality standard the existing water quality shall be
maintained and protected. The Director may allow degradation of existing
water quality in the surface water, if the Director makes all of the following
findings:

1. The water quality necessary for existing uses is fully protected and water
quality is not lowered to a level that does not comply with applicable water
quality standards,

2. The highest statutory and regulatory requirements for new and existing
point sources are achieved,

3. All cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint
source pollution control are implemented, and

4. Allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important
economic or social development in the area where the surface water is
located.

D. Tier 3: Existing water quality shall be maintained and protected in a
surface water that is classified as an OAW under R18-11-112. Degradation of
an OAW under subsection (C) is prohibited.

E. The Director shall implement this Section in a manner consistent with §
316 of the Clean Water Act [ 33 U.S.C. 1326 ] if a potential water quality
impairment associated with a thermal discharge is involved.

           (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


§ R18-11-107.01. Antidegradation Criteria

A. Tier 1 antidegradation protection.

1. Tier 1 antidegradation protection applies to the following surface waters:

a. A surface water listed on the 303(d) list for the pollutant that resulted in
the listing,

b. An effluent dependent water,

c. An ephemeral water,

d. An intermittent water, and

e. A canal listed in Appendix B.

2. A regulated discharge shall not cause a violation of a surface water quality
standard or a wasteload allocation in a total maximum daily load approved
by EPA.

3. Except as provided in subsections (E) and (F), Tier 1 antidegradation
review requirements are satisfied for a point-source discharge regulated
under an individual AZPDES permit to an ephemeral water, effluent
dependent water, intermittent water, or a canal listed in Appendix B, if
water quality-based effluent limitations designed to achieve compliance with
applicable surface water quality standards are established in the permit and
technology-based requirements of the Clean Water Act for the point source
discharge are met.

B. Tier 2 antidegradation protection.

1. Tier 2 antidegradation protection applies to a perennial water with
existing water quality that is better than applicable water quality standards.
A perennial water that is not listed in subsection (A)(1) nor classified as an
OAW under A.A.C. R18-9-112(G) has Tier 2 antidegradation protection for
all pollutants of concern.

2. A regulated discharge that meets the following criteria, at critical flow
conditions, does not cause significant degradation:

a. The regulated discharge consumes less than 20 percent of the available
assimilative capacity for each pollutant of concern, and

b. At least 50 percent of the assimilative capacity for each pollutant of
concern remains available in the surface water for each pollutant of concern.
     Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-107.01 Antidegradation Criteria
           (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


3. Antidegradation review. Any person proposing a new or expanded
regulated discharge under an individual AZPDES permit that may cause
significant degradation shall provide ADEQ with the following information:

a. Baseline characterization. A person seeking authorization to discharge
under an individual AZPDES permit to a perennial water shall provide
baseline water quality data on pollutants of concern where no data exists or
there are insufficient data to characterize baseline water quality and to
determine available assimilative capacity. A discharger shall characterize
baseline water quality at a location upstream of the proposed discharge
location;

b. Alternative analysis.

i. The person seeking authorization for the discharge shall prepare and
submit a written analysis of alternatives to the discharge. The analysis shall
provide information on all reasonable, cost-effective, less-degrading or non-
degrading discharge alternatives. Alternatives may include wastewater
treatment process changes or upgrades, pollution prevention measures,
source reduction, water reclamation, alternative discharge locations,
groundwater recharge, land application or treatment, local pretreatment
programs, improved operation and maintenance of existing systems,
seasonal or controlled discharge to avoid critical flow conditions, and zero
discharge;

ii. The alternatives analysis shall include cost information on base pollution
control measures associated with the regulated discharge and cost
information for each alternative;

iii. The person shall implement the alternative that is cost-effective and
reasonable, results in the least degradation, and is approved by the Director.
An alternative is cost-effective and reasonable if treatment costs associated
with the alternative are less than a 10 percent increase above the cost of base
pollution control measures;

iv. For purposes of this subsection, "base pollution control measures" are
water pollution control measures required to meet technology-based
requirements of the Clean Water Act and water quality-based effluent limits
designed to achieve compliance with applicable water quality standards; and

c. Social and economic justification. The person shall demonstrate to the
Director that significant degradation is necessary to accommodate
important economic or social development in the local area. The person
seeking authorization for the discharge shall prepare a written social and
economic justification that includes a description of the following:
    Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-107.01 Antidegradation Criteria
          (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


i. The geographic area where significant degradation of existing water
quality will occur;

ii. The current baseline social and economic conditions in the local area;

iii. The net positive social and economic effects of development associated
with the regulated discharge and allowing significant degradation;

iv. The negative social, environmental, and economic effects of allowing
significant degradation of existing water quality; and

v. Alternatives to the regulated discharge that do not significantly degrade
water quality yet may yield comparable social and economic benefits.

4. For purposes of this Section, the term "pollutant of concern" means a
pollutant with either a numeric or narrative water quality standard.

5. Public participation. The Director shall provide public notice and an
opportunity to comment on an antidegradation review under subsection
(B)(3) and shall provide an opportunity for a public hearing under A.A.C.
R18-9-A908(B).

C. Tier 3 antidegradation protection.

1. Tier 3 antidegradation protection applies only to an OAW listed in R18-11-
112(G).

2. A new or expanded point-source discharge directly to an OAW is
prohibited.

3. A person seeking authorization for a regulated discharge to a tributary to,
or upstream of, an OAW shall demonstrate in a permit application or in
other documentation submitted to ADEQ that the regulated discharge will
not degrade existing water quality in the downstream OAW

4. A discharge regulated under a § 404 permit that may affect existing water
quality of an OAW requires a determination by the Director to ensure that
existmg water quality is maintained and protected and any water quality
impacts are temporary. Temporary water quality impacts are those impacts
that occur for a period of six months or less and are not regularly occurring
The form of such a determination shall be as follows:

a. For Corps-issued § 404 permits, an individual § 401 water quality
certification.
    Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-107.01 Antidegradation Criteria
          (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


b. For Director-issued § 404 permits, a § 404 permit action, wherein the
Director shall conduct a water quality evaluation as a part of the state's
requirements for issuing § 404 permits and in accordance with this section.

D. Antidegradation review of a § 404 permit shall be conducted as follows:

1. For a Corps-issued § 404 pemit. The Director shall conduct the
antidegradation review of any discharge authorized under a nationwide or
regional § 404 permit as part of the § 401 water quality certification prior to
issuance of the nationwide or regional permit. The Director shall conduct
the antidegradation review of an individual § 404 permit if the discharge
may degrade existing water quality in an OAW or a water listed on the
303(d) List of impaired waters. For regulated discharges that may degrade
water quality in an OAW or a water that is on the 303(d) List of impaired
waters, the Director shall conduct the antidegradation review as part of the §
401 water quality certification process.

2. For a Director-issued § 404 permit. The Director shall conduct the
antidegradation review of any discharge authorized under a general § 404
permit as a part of its determination whether to issue a general permit in
accordance with state requirements for issuing a § 404 general pemit and
with this section. The Director shall conduct the antidegradation review of
an individual § 404 permit as part of the § 404 permit action in accordance
with state requirements for issuing a § 404 permit and in accordance with
this section.

E. Antidegradation review of an AZPDES stormwater permit. An individual
stormwater permit for a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4)
meets antidegradation requirements if the permittee complies with the
pemit, including developing a stormwater management plan containing
controls that reduce the level of pollutants in stormwater discharges to the
maximum extent practicable.

F. Antidegradation review of a general permit. The Director shall conduct
the antidegradation review of a regulated discharge authorized by a general
permit at the time the general permit is issued or renewed. A person seeking
authorization to discharge under a general permit is not required to undergo
an individual antidegradation review at the time the Notice of Intent is
submitted unless the discharge may degrade existing water quality in an
OAW or a water listed on the 303(d) List of impaired waters.

§ R18-11-108. Narrative Water Quality Standards

A. A surface water shall not contain pollutants in amounts or combinations
that:

1. Settle to form bottom deposits that inhibit or prohibit the habitation,
growth, or propagation of aquatic life;

2. Cause objectionable odor in the area in which the surface water is located;

3. Cause off-taste or odor in drinking water;

4. Cause off-flavor in aquatic organisms;

5. Are toxic to humans, animals, plants, or other organisms;

6. Cause the growth of algae or aquatic plants that inhibit or prohibit the
habitation, growth, or propagation of other aquatic life or that impair
recreational uses;

floats as debris, foam, or scum; or that causes a film or iridescent
appearance on the surface of the water; or that causes a deposit on a
shoreline, bank, or aquatic vegetation. The discharge of lubricating oil or
gasoline associated with the normal operation of a recreational watercraft is
not a violation of this narrative standard.

C. A surface water shall not contain a discharge of suspended solids in
quantities or concentrations that interfere with the treatment processes at
the nearest downstream potable water treatment plant or substantially
increase the cost of handling solids produced at the nearest downstream
potable water treatment plant.

D. A surface water shall not contain solid waste such as refuse, rubbish,
demolition or construction debris, trash, garbage, motor vehicles,
appliances, or tires.

E. A wadeable, perennial stream shall support and maintain a community of
organisms having a taxa richness, species composition, tolerance, and

meter.

F. Nutrient criteria. The following are water quality standards for total
phosphorus and total nitrogen (expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L))
that apply to the surface waters listed below. A minimum of 10 samples,
each taken at least 10 days apart in a consecutive 12-month period, are
required to determine a 90th percentile. Not more than 10 percent of the
samples may exceed the 90th percentile value listed below. The Director will
apply these water quality standards for total phosphorus and total nitrogen
to the surface waters listed below, and to their perennial tributaries, if listed.
The Director may also apply these total phosphorus and total nitrogen
standards to any source discharging to any tributary (ephemeral,
intermittent, effluent dependent water, or perennial) of the surface waters
listed below, if necessary to protect nutrient water quality in the listed
surface water, based on the volume, frequency, magnitude and duration of
the discharge, and distance to the downstream surface water listed below:

§ R18-11-112. Outstanding Arizona Waters

A. The Director shall classify a surface water as an outstanding Arizona
water (OAW) by rule.

B. The Director may adopt, under R18-11-115, a site-specific standard to
maintain and protect existing water quality in an OAW.

C. Any person may nominate a surface water for classification as an OAW by
filing a nomination with the Director. The nomination shall include:

1. A map and a description of the surface water;

2. A written statement in support of the nomination, including specific
reference to the applicable criteria for an OAW classification prescribed in
subsection (D);

3. Supporting evidence demonstrating that the criteria prescribed in
subsection (D) are met; and

4. Available water quality data relevant to establishing the baseline water
quality of the proposed OAW.

D. The Director may classify a surface water as an OAW based upon the
following criteria:

1. The surface water is a perennial or intermittent water;

2. The surface water is in a free-flowing condition. For purposes of this
subsection, "in a free-flowing condition" means that a surface water does not
have an impoundment, diversion, channelization, rip-rapping or other bank
armor, or another hydrological modification within the reach nominated for
an OAW classification;

3. The surface water has good water quality. For purposes of this subsection,
"good water quality" means that the surface water has water quality that
meets or is better than applicable surface water quality standards. A surface
water that is listed as impaired under R18-11-604(E) is ineligible for OAW
classification; and

4. The surface water meets one or both of the following conditions:

a. The surface water is of exceptional recreational or ecological significance
because of its unique attributes, such as the geology, flora and fauna, water
quality, aesthetic value, or the wilderness characteristic of the surface water;
    Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-112 Outstanding Arizona Waters
           (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


b. An endangered or threatened species is associated with the surface water
and the existing water quality is essential to the species' maintenance and
propagation or the surface water provides critical habitat for the threatened
or endangered species. An endangered or threatened species is identified in
"Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, " 50 CFR 17.11 (revised 2005), and
"Endangered and Threatened Plants, " 50 CFR 17.12 (revised 2005). This

search.html#page1.

E. The Director shall hold at least one public meeting in the local area of a
surface water that is nominated for classification as an OAW to solicit public
comment on the nomination.

F. The Director shall consider the following factors when deciding whether
to classify a surface water as an OAW:

1. Whether there is the ability to manage the surface water and its watershed
to maintain and protect existing water quality;

2. The social and economic impact of Tier 3 antidegradation protection;

3. The public comments in support of, or in opposition to, an OAW
classification;

4. The timing of the nomination relative to the triennial review of surface
water quality standards;

5. The consistency of an OAW classification with applicable water quality
management plans; and

of an application for an AZPDES permit. The request shall include:

1. An identification of the pollutant for which the mixing zone is requested;

2. A proposed outfall design;

3. A definition of the boundary of the proposed mixing zone. For purposes of
this subsection, the boundary of a mixing zone is where complete mixing
occurs; and

4. A complete and detailed description of the existing physical, biological,
and chemical conditions of the receiving water and the predicted impact of
the proposed mixing zone on those conditions. The description shall also
address the factors listed in subsection (D) of this section that the Director
must consider when deciding to grant or deny a request and shall address
the mixing zone requirements in subsection (H) of this section.

C. The Director shall consider the following factors when deciding whether
to grant or deny a request for a mixing zone:

1. The assimilative capacity of the receiving water;

2. The likelihood of adverse human health effects;

3. The location of drinking water plant intakes and public swimming areas;

4. The predicted exposure of biota and the likelihood that resident biota will
be adversely affected;

5. Bioaccumulation;

6. Whether there will be acute toxicity in the mixing zone, and, if so, the size
of the zone of initial dilution;

7. The known or predicted safe exposure levels for the pollutant for which
the mixing zone is requested;
        Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-114 Mixing Zones (Arizona
                Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


8. The size of the mixing zone;

9. The location of the mixing zone relative to biologically sensitive areas in
the surface water;

10. The concentration gradient of the pollutant within the mixing zone;

11. Sediment deposition;

12. The potential for attracting aquatic life to the mixing zone; and

13. The cumulative impacts of other mixing zones and other discharges to
the surface water.

D. Director determination.

1. The Director shall deny a request to establish a mixing zone if a water
quality standard will be violated outside the boundaries of the proposed
mixing zone.

2. If the Director approves the request to establish a mixing zone, the
Director shall establish the mixing zone as a condition of an AZPDES
permit. The Director shall include any mixing zone condition in the AZPDES
permit that is necessary to protect human health and the designated uses of
the surface water.

E. Any person who is adversely affected by the Director's decision to grant or
deny a request for a mixing zone may appeal the decision under A.R.S. § 49-
321 et seq. and A.R.S. § 41-1092 et seq.

F. The Director shall reevaluate a mixing zone upon issuance, reissuance, or
modification of the AZPDES permit for the point source or a modification of
the outfall structure.

G. Mixing zone requirements.

1. A mixing zone shall be as small as practicable in that it shall not extend
beyond the point in the waterbody at which complete mixing occurs under
the critical flow conditions of the discharge and of the receiving water.

2. The total horizontal area allocated to all mixing zones on a lake shall not
exceed 10 percent of the surface area of the lake.

3. Adjacent mixing zones in a lake shall not overlap or be located closer
together than the greatest horizontal dimension of the largest mixing zone.

§ R18-11-115. Site-Specific Standards

A. The Director shall adopt a site-specific standard by rule.

B. The Director may adopt a site-specific standard based upon a request or
upon the Director's initiative for any of the following reasons:

1. Local physical, chemical, or hydrological conditions of a surface water
such as pH, hardness, fate and transport, or temperature alters the
biological availability or toxicity of a pollutant;

2. The sensitivity of resident aquatic organisms that occur in a surface water
to a pollutant differs from the sensitivity of the species used to derive the
numeric water quality standards to protect aquatic life in Appendix A;

3. Resident aquatic organisms that occur in a surface water represent a
narrower mix of species than those in the dataset used by ADEQ to derive
numeric water quality standards to protect aquatic life in Appendix A;

4. The natural background concentration of a pollutant is greater than the
numeric water quality standard to protect aquatic life prescribed in
Appendix A. "Natural background" means the concentration of a pollutant in
a surface water due only to non-anthropogenic sources; or

5. Other factors or combination of factors that upon review by the Director
warrant changing a numeric water quality standard for a surface water.

C. Site-specific standard by request. To request that the Director adopt a
site-specific standard, a person must conduct a study to support the
development of a site-specific standard using a scientifically-defensible
procedure.

1. Before conducting the study, a person shall submit a study outline to the
Director for approval that contains the following elements:

a. Identifies the pollutant;

b. Describes the reach's boundaries;

c. Uses one of the following procedures, as defined by the most recent EPA
guidance documents:

iv. The Biotic ligand model.

d. Demonstrates that all designated uses are protected.

2. Alternatively, a study outline submitted for the Director's approval must
contain the following elements:

a. Identifies the pollutant;

b. Describes the reach's boundaries;

c. Describes the hydrologic regime of the waterbody;

d. Describes the scientifically-defensible procedure, which can include
relevant aquatic life studies, ecological studies, laboratory tests, biological
translators, fate and transport models, and risk analyses;

e. Describes and compares the taxonomic composition, distribution and
density of the aquatic biota within the reach to a reference reach and
describes the basis of any major taxonomic differences;

f. Describes the pollutant's effect on the affected species or appropriate
surrogate species and on the other designated uses listed for the reach;

g. Demonstrates that all designated uses are protected; and

h. A person seeking to develop a site-specific standard based on natural
background may use statistical or modeling approaches to determine
natural background concentration. Modeling approaches include Better
Assessment Science Integrating Source and Nonpoint Sources (Basins),
Hydrologic Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF), and Hydrologic

§ R18-11-119. Natural Background

Where the concentration of a pollutant exceeds a water quality standard and
the exceedance is not caused by human activity but is due solely to naturally-
occurring conditions, the exceedance shall not be considered a violation of
the water quality standard.

   Discharges (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))


§ R18-11-120. Enforcement of Non-permitted Discharges

A. The Department may establish a numeric water quality standard at a
concentration that is below the practical quantitation limit. Therefore, in
enforcement actions pursuant to subsection (B) of this section, the water
quality standard is enforceable at the practical quantitation limit.

B. Except for chronic aquatic and wildlife criteria, for non-permitted
discharge violations, the Department shall determine compliance with
numeric water quality standard criteria from the analytical result of a single
sample, unless additional samples are required under this article. For
chronic aquatic and wildlife criteria, compliance for non-permitted
discharge violations shall be determined from the geometric mean of the
analytical results of the last four samples taken at least 24 hours apart. For
the purposes of this section, a "non-permitted discharge violation" does not
include a discharge regulated under an AZPDES permit.

§ R18-11-121. Schedules of Compliance

A compliance schedule in an AZPDES permit shall require the permittee to
comply with a discharge limitation based upon a new or revised water
quality standard as soon as possible to achieve compliance. The permittee
shall demonstrate that all requirements under § 301(b) and § 306 of the
Clean Water Act [ 33 U.S.C. 1311(b) and 1316 ] are achieved and that the
point source cannot comply with a discharge limitation based upon the new
or revised water quality standard through the application of existing water
pollution control technology, operational changes, or source reduction. In
establishing a compliance schedule, the Director shall consider:

1. How much time the permittee has already had to meet any effluent
limitations under a prior permit;

2. The extent to which the permittee has made good faith efforts to comply
with the effluent limitations and other requirements in a prior permit;

3. Whether treatment facilities, operations, or measures must be modified to
meet the effluent limitations;

4. How long any necessary modifications would take to implement; and

5. Whether the permittee would be expected to use the same treatment
facilities, operations or other measures to meet the effluent limitations as it
would have used to meet the effluent limitations in a prior permit.

                     Code (2021 Edition))


§ R18-11-122. Variances

A. Upon request, the Director may establish, by rule, a discharger-specific or
water segment(s)-specific variance from a water quality standard if
requirements pursuant to this section are met.

B. A person who requests a variance must demonstrate all of the following
information:

1. Identification of the specific pollutant and water quality standard for
which a variance is sought.

2. Identification of the receiving surface water segment or segments to which
the variance would apply.

3. A detailed discussion of the need for the variance, including the reasons
why compliance with the water quality standard cannot be achieved over the
term of the proposed variance, and any other useful information or analysis
to evaluate attainability.

4. A detailed discussion of the discharge control technologies that are
available for achieving compliance with the water quality standard for which
a variance is sought.

5. Documentation that more advanced treatment technology than applicable
technology-based effluent limitations is necessary to achieve compliance
with the water quality standard for which a variance is sought.

6. A detailed description of proposed interim discharge limitations and
pollutant control activities that represent the highest level of treatment
achievable by a point source discharger or dischargers during the term of the
variance.

7. Documentation that the proposed term is only as long as necessary to
achieve the highest attainable condition.

8. Documentation that is appropriate to the type of use to which the variance
would apply as follows:

a. For a water quality standard variance to a use specified in Clean Water Act
§ 101(a)(2), documentation must include demonstration of at least one of
the following factors that preclude attainment of the use during the term of
the variance:

i. Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent attainment of the
use;
Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-122 Variances (Arizona Administrative
                     Code (2021 Edition))


ii. Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels
prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be
compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges
without violating state water conservation requirements to enable uses to be
met;

iii. That human-caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the
attainment of the water quality standard for which the variance is sought
and either (1) it is not possible to remedy the conditions or sources of
pollution or (2) remedying the human-caused conditions would cause more
environmental damage to correct than to leave in place;

iv. Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the
attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the water body to its
original condition or to operate such modification n a way that would result
in the attainment of the use;

v. Physical conditions related to the natural features of the water body, such
as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the
like, unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life
protection uses;

vi. That installation and operation of each of the available discharge
technologies more advanced than those required to comply with technology-
based effluent limitations to achieve compliance with the water quality
standard would result in substantial and widespread economic and social
impact; or

vii. Actions necessary to facilitate lake, wetland, or stream restoration
through dam removal or other significant reconfiguration activities preclude
attainment of the designated use and criterion while the actions are being
implemented.

b. For a water quality standard variance to a use other than those uses
specified in Clean Water Act § 101(a)(2), documentation must justify how
consideration and value of the water subject to the use appropriately
supports the variance and term. A demonstration consistent with (B)(8)(a)
of this section may be used to satisfy this requirement.

9. For a waterbody segment(s)-specific variance, the following information
is required before the Director may issue a variance, in addition to all other
required documentation pursuant to this section:

a. Identification and documentation of any cost-effective and reasonable
best management practices for nonpoint source controls related to the
Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-122 Variances (Arizona Administrative
                     Code (2021 Edition))


pollutant(s) or water quality parameter(s) and water body or waterbody
segment(s) specified in the variance that could be implemented to make
progress towards attaining the underlying designated use and criterion; and

b. If any variance pursuant to (B)(9)(a) of this section previously applied to
the water body or waterbody segment(s), documentation must also
demonstrate whether and to what extent best management practices for
nonpoint source controls were implemented to address the pollutant(s) or
water quality parameter(s) subject to the water quality variance and the
water quality progress achieved.

10. For a discharger-specific variance, the following information is required
before the Director may issue a variance, in addition to all other required
documentation pursuant to this section:

a. Identification of the permittee subject to the variance;

b. For an existing point source discharge, a detailed description of the
existing discharge control technologies that are used to achieve compliance
with applicable water quality standards. For a new point source discharge, a
detailed description of the proposed discharge control technologies that will
be used to achieve compliance with applicable water quality standards; and

c. Documentation that the existing or proposed discharge control
technologies will comply with applicable technology-based effluent
limitations.

C. The Director shall consider the following factors when deciding whether
to grant or deny a variance request:

1. Bioaccumulation,

2. The predicted exposure of biota and the likelihood that resident biota will
be adversely affected,

3. The known or predicted safe exposure levels for the pollutant for which
the variance is requested, and

4. The likelihood of adverse human health effects.

D. The variance shall represent the highest attainable condition of the water
body or water body segment applicable throughout the term of the variance.

E. A variance shall not result in any lowering of the currently attained
ambient water quality, unless the variance is necessary for restoration
activities, consistent with (B)(8)(a)(vii) of this section. The Director must
Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-122 Variances (Arizona Administrative
                     Code (2021 Edition))


specify the highest attainable condition of the water body or waterbody
segment as a quantifiable expression of one of the following:

1. The highest attainable interim criterion,

2. The interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest pollutant
reduction achievable; or

3. If no additional feasible pollutant control technology can be identified, the
interim criterion or interim effluent condition that reflects the greatest
pollutant reduction achievable with the pollutant control technologies
installed at the time of the issuance of the variance, and the adoption and
implementation of a Pollutant Minimization Program.

F. A variance shall not modify the underlying designated use and criterion. A
variance is only a time limited exception to the underlying standard. For
discharge-specific variances, other point source dischargers to the surface
water that are not granted a variance shall still meet all applicable water
quality standards.

G. Point source discharges shall meet all other applicable water quality
standards for which a variance is not granted.

H. The Director may not grant a variance for a point source discharge to an
OAW listed in R18-11-112(G).

I. Each variance established by the Director is subject to review and approval
by the Regional Administrator.

J. The term of the water quality variance may only be as long as necessary to
achieve the highest attainable condition and must be consistent with the
supporting documentation in subsection (E) of this section. The variance
term runs from the approval of the variance by the Regional Administrator.

K. The Director shall reevaluate, in its triennial review, whether each
variance continues to represent the highest attainable condition. Comment
on the variance shall be considered regarding whether the variance
continues to represent the highest attainable condition. If the Director
determines that the requirements of the variance do not represent the
highest attainable condition, then the Director shall modify or repeal the
variance in its triennial review rulemaking.

L. If the variance is modified by rulemaking, the requirements of the
variance shall represent the highest attainable condition at the time of initial
adoption of the variance, or the highest attainable condition identified
during the current reevaluation, whichever is more stringent.
Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-122 Variances (Arizona Administrative
                     Code (2021 Edition))


M. Upon expiration of a variance, point source dischargers shall comply with
the water quality standard.

N. The following are discharger-specific variances adopted by the Director:

O. The following are water body and waterbody segment-specific variances
adopted by the Director:

Footnotes

a. The asbestos standard is 7 million fibers (longer than 10 micrometers) per
liter.

b. The aldrin/dieldrin standard is exceeded when the sum of the two
compounds exceeds 0.003 µg/L.

c. In lakes, the acute criteria for hydrogen sulfide apply only to water
samples taken from the epilimnion, or the upper layer of a lake or reservoir.

d. Hardness, expressed as mg/L CaCO 3 is determined according to the
following criteria:

i. If the receiving water body has an A&Wc or A&Ww designated use, then
hardness is based on the hardness of the receiving water body from a sample
taken at the same time that the sample for the metal is taken, except that the
hardness may not exceed 400 mg/L CaCO 3 .

ii. If the receiving water has an A&Wedw or A&We designated use, then the
hardness is based on the hardness of the effluent from a sample taken at the
same time that the sample for the metal is taken, except that the hardness
may not exceed 400 mg/L CaCO 3 .

iii. The mathematical equations for the hardness-dependent parameter
represent the water quality standards. Examples of criteria for the hardness-
dependent parameters have been calculated and are presented in separate
tables at the end of Appendix A for the convenience of the user.

e. pH is determined according to the following criteria:

i. If the receiving water has an A&Wc or A&Ww designated use, then pH is
based on the pH of the receiving water body from a sample taken at the
same time that the sample for pentachlorophenol or ammonia is taken.

iii. pCi/L = picocuries per liter,

iv. D = dissolved,

v. T = total recoverable,

vi. TTHM indicates that the chemical is a trihalomethane.

g. The total trihalomethane (TTHM) standard is exceeded when the sum of
these four compounds exceeds 80 µg/L, as a rolling annual average.

h. The concentration of gross alpha particle activity includes radium-226,
but excludes radon and uranium.

i. The average annual concentration of beta particle activity and photon
emitters from manmade radionuclides shall not produce an annual dose
equivalent to the total body or any internal organ greater than four
millirems per year.

j. The mathematical equations for the pH-dependent parameters represent
the water quality standards. Examples of criteria for the pH-dependent
parameters have been calculated and are presented in separate tables at the
end of Appendix A for the convenience of the user.

k. Abbreviations for the mathematical equations are as follows:

Table 17. Chronic Criteria for Total Ammonia (in mg/L, as N) for
Aquatic and Wildlife coldwater, Unionid Mussels Absent

For the aquatic and wildlife coldwater uses, unionids will be assumed to be
present unless a study is performed demonstrating that they are absent and
there is no historic evidence of their presence, or hydrologic modification
has altered the flow regime in a way that would prevent their
reestablishment.

E. The following are the aquifer water quality standards for radionuclides:

1. The maximum concentration for gross alpha particle activity, including
Radium-226 but excluding radon and uranium, shall not exceed 15 pCi/l.

2. The maximum concentration for combined Radium-226 and Radium-228
shall not exceed 5 pCi/l.

3. The average annual concentration of beta particle and photon
radioactivity from man-made radionuclides shall not produce an annual
dose equivalent to the total body or any internal organ greater than 4
millirem/year.

4. Except for the radionuclides listed in this subsection, the concentration of
man-made radionuclides causing 4 millirem total body or organ dose
equivalents shall be calculated on the basis of a 2-liter-per-day drinking
water intake using the 168-hour data listed in "Maximum Permissible Body
Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentration of Radionuclides in Air
or Water for Occupational Exposure, " National Bureau of Standards
Handbook 69, National Bureau of Commerce, as amended August 1963 (and
no future editions), incorporated herein by reference and on file with the
Office of the Secretary of State and with the Department. If two or more
radionuclides are present, the sum of their annual dose equivalent to the
total body or to any organ shall not exceed 4 millirem/year. The following
average annual concentrations are assumed to produce a total body or organ
dose of 4 millirem/year:

Radionuclide Critical Organ pCi/l
Tritium      Total body     20, 000
Strontium-90 Bone Marrow 8

F. The aquifer water quality standard for microbiological contaminants is
based upon the presence or absence of total coliforms in a 100-milliliter
sample. If a sample is total coliform-positive, a 100-milliliter repeat sample
  Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-406 Numeric Aquifer Water Quality
        Standards: Drinking Water Protected Use (Arizona
              Administrative Code (2021 Edition))

shall be taken within two weeks of the time the sample results are reported.
Any total coliform-positive repeat sample following a total coliform-positive
sample constitutes a violation of the aquifer water quality standard for
microbiological contaminants.

G. The following are the aquifer water quality standards for turbidity:

1. One nephelometric turbidity unit as determined by a monthly average
except that five or fewer nephelometric turbidity units may be allowed if it
can be determined that the higher turbidity does not interfere with
disinfection, prevent maintenance of effective disinfectant agents in water
supply distribution systems, or interfere with microbiological
determinations.

2. Five nephelometric turbidity units based on an average of two consecutive
days.

 Segment for Listing and Delisting (Arizona Administrative Code
                         (2021 Edition))

§ R18-11-605. Evaluating a Surface Water or Segment for Listing
and Delisting

A. The Department shall compile and evaluate all reasonably current,
credible, and scientifically defensible data to determine whether a surface
water or segment is impaired or not attaining.

B. Weight-of-evidence approach.

1. The Department shall consider the following concepts when evaluating
data:

a. Data or information collected during critical conditions may be
considered separately from the complete dataset, when the data show that
the surface water or segment is impaired or not attaining its designated use
during those critical conditions, but attaining its uses during other periods.
Critical conditions may include stream flow, seasonal periods, weather
conditions, or anthropogenic activities;

b. Whether the data indicate that the impairment is due to persistent,
seasonal, or recurring conditions. If the data do not represent persistent,
recurring, or seasonal conditions, the Department may place the surface
water or segment on the Planning List;

c. Higher quality data over lower quality data when making a listing
decision. Data quality is established by the reliability, precision, accuracy,
and representativeness of the data, based on factors identified in R18-11-
602(A) and (B), including monitoring methods, analytical methods, quality
control procedures, and the documented field and laboratory quality control
information submitted with the data. The Department shall consider the
following factors when determining higher quality data:

i. The age of the measurements. Newer measurements are weighted heavier
than older measurements, unless the older measurements are more
representative of critical flow conditions;

ii. Whether the data provide a direct measure of an impact on a designated
use. Direct measurements are weighted heavier than measurements of an
indicator or surrogate parameter; or

iii. The amount or frequency of the measurements. More frequent data
collection are weighted heavier than nominal datasets.

2. The Department shall evaluate the following factors to determine if the
water quality evidence supports a finding that the surface water or segment
is impaired or not attaining:
  Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-605 Evaluating a Surface Water or
 Segment for Listing and Delisting (Arizona Administrative Code
                         (2021 Edition))

a. An exceedance of a numeric surface water quality standard based on the
criteria in subsections (C)(1), (C)(2), (D)(1), and (D)(2);

b. An exceedance of a narrative surface water quality standard based on the
criteria in subsections (C)(3) and (D)(3);

c. Additional information that determines whether a water quality standard
is exceeded due to a pollutant, suspected pollutant, or naturally occurring
condition:

i. Soil type, geology, hydrology, flow regime, biological community,
geomorphology, climate, natural process, and anthropogenic influence in
the watershed;

ii. The characteristics of the pollutant, such as its solubility in water,
bioaccumulation potential, sediment sorption potential, or degradation
characteristics, to assist in determining which data more accurately indicate
the pollutant's presence and potential for causing impairment; and

iii. Available evidence of direct or toxic impacts on aquatic life, wildlife, or
human health, such as fish kills and beach closures, where there is sufficient
evidence that these impacts occurred due to water quality conditions in the
surface water.

d. Other available water quality information, such as NPDES or AZPDES
water quality discharge data, as applicable.

e. If the Department determines that a surface water or segment does not
merit listing under numeric water quality standards based on criteria in
subsections (C)(1), (C)(2), (D)(1), or (D)(2) for a pollutant, but there is
evidence of a narrative standard exceedance in that surface water or
segment under subsection (D)(3) as a result of the presence of the same
pollutant, the Department shall list the surface water or segment as
impaired only when the evidence indicates that the numeric water quality
standard is insufficient to protect the designated use of the surface water or
segment and the Department justifies the listing based on any of the
following:

i. The narrative standard data provide a more direct indication of
impairment as supported by professionally prepared and peer-reviewed
publications;

ii. Sufficient evidence of impairment exists due to synergistic effects of
pollutant combinations or site-specific environmental factors; or
  Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-605 Evaluating a Surface Water or
 Segment for Listing and Delisting (Arizona Administrative Code
                         (2021 Edition))

iii. The pollutant is bioaccumulative, relatively insoluble in water, or has
other characteristics that indicate it is occurring in the specific surface water
or segment at levels below the laboratory detection limits, but at levels
sufficient to result in an impairment.

3. The Department may consider a single line of water quality evidence
when the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the surface water or
segment is impaired or not attaining.

C. Planning List.

1. When evaluating a surface water or segment for placement on the
Planning List.

a. Consider at least ten spatially or temporally independent samples
collected over three or more temporally independent sampling events; and

b. Determine numeric water quality standards exceedances. The
Department shall:

i. Place a surface water or segment on the Planning List following subsection
(B), if the number of exceedances of a surface water quality standard is
greater than or equal to the number listed in Table 1, which provides the
number of exceedances that indicate a minimum of a 10 percent exceedance
frequency with a minimum of a 80 percent confidence level using a binomial
distribution for a given sample size; or

ii. For sample datasets exceeding those shown in Table 1, calculate the
number of exceedances using the following equation: (X[GREATOR THAN
EQUAL TO] x| n, p) where n = number of samples; p = exceedance
probability of 0.1; x = smallest number of exceedances required for listing
with "n" samples; and confidence level [GREATOR THAN EQUAL TO] 80
percent.

surface water or segment on the Planning List following subsection (B), if
three or more temporally independent samples exceed the following surface
water quality standards:

a. The surface water quality standard for a pollutant listed in 18 A.A.C. 11,
Article 1, Appendix A, Table 1, except for nitrate or nitrate/nitrite;

b. The surface water quality standard for temperature or the single sample
maximum water quality standard for suspended sediment concentration,

requirements are met under A.R.S. § 49-232(F).

E. Removing a surface water, segment, or pollutant from the Planning List
or the 303(d) List.

1. Planning List. The Department shall remove a surface water, segment, or
pollutant from the Planning List when:

a. Monitoring activities indicate that:

i. There is sufficient credible data to determine that the surface water or
segment is impaired under subsection (D), in which case the Department
shall place the surface water or segment on the 303(d) List. This includes
surface waters with an EPA approved TMDL when the Department
determines that the TMDL strategy is insufficient for the surface water or
segment to attain water quality standards; or

ii. There is sufficient credible data to determine that the surface water or
segment is attaining all designated uses and standards.

b. All pollutants for the surface water or segment are delisted.

2. 303(d) List. The Department shall:

a. Remove a pollutant from a surface water or segment from the 303(d) List
based on one or more of the following criteria:

i. The Department developed, and EPA approved, a TMDL for the pollutant;

ii. The data used for previously listing the surface water or segment under
R18-11-605(D) is superseded by more recent credible and scientifically
defensible data meeting the requirements of R18-11-602, showing that the
surface water or segment meets the applicable numeric or narrative surface
       Table 2 (Arizona Administrative Code (2021 Edition))



water quality standard. When evaluating data to remove a pollutant from
the 303(d) List, the monitoring entity shall collect the more recent data
under similar hydrologic or climatic conditions as occurred when the
samples were taken that indicated impairment, if those conditions still exist;

iii. The surface water or segment no longer meets the criteria for impairment
based on a change in the applicable surface water quality standard or a
designated use approved by EPA under section 303(c)(1) of the Clean Water
Act;

iv. The surface water or segment no longer meets the criteria for impairment
for the specific narrative water quality standard based on a change in
narrative water quality standard implementation procedures;

v. A re-evaluation of the data indicate that the surface water or segment does
not meet the criteria for impairment because of a deficiency in the original
analysis; or

vi. Pollutant loadings from naturally occurring conditions alone are
sufficient to cause a violation of applicable water quality standards;

b. Remove a surface water, segment, or pollutant from the 303(d) List,
based on criteria that are no more stringent than the listing criteria under
subsection (D);

c. Remove a surface water or segment from the 303(d) List if all pollutants
for the surface water or segment are removed from the list;

d. Remove a surface water, segment, or pollutant, from the 303(d) List and
place it on the Planning List, if:

i. The surface water, segment or pollutant was on the 1998 303(d) List and
the dataset used in the original listing does not meet the credible data
requirements under R18-11-602, or contains insufficient samples to meet
the data requirements under subsection (D); or

ii. The monitoring data indicate that the impairment is due to pollution, but
not a pollutant.

§ R18-11-606. Tmdl Priority Criteria for 303(d) Listed Surface
Waters or Segments

A. In addition to the factors specified in A.R.S. § 49-233(C), the Department
shall consider the following when prioritizing an impaired water for
development of TMDLs:

1. A change in a water quality standard;

2. The date the surface water or segment was added to the 303(d) List;

3. The presence in a surface water or segment of species listed as threatened
or endangered under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act;

4. The complexity of the TMDL;

5. State, federal, and tribal policies and priorities; and

6. The efficiencies of coordinating TMDL development with the
Department's surface water monitoring program, the watershed monitoring
rotation, or with remedial programs.

B. The Department shall prioritize an impaired surface water or segment for
TMDL development based on the factors specified in A.R.S. § 49-233(C) and
subsection (A) as follows:

1. Consider an impaired surface water or segment a high priority if:

a. The listed pollutant poses a substantial threat to the health and safety of
humans, aquatic life, or wildlife based on:

i. The number and type of designated uses impaired;

ii. The type and extent of risk from the impairment to human health, aquatic
life, or wildlife;

iii. The pollutant causing the impairment, or

iv. The severity, magnitude, and duration the surface water quality standard
was exceeded;

b. A new or modified individual NPDES or AZPDES permit is sought for a
new or modified discharge to the impaired water;

c. The listed surface water or segment is listed as a unique water in A.A.C.

resource;

d. The listed surface water or segment contains a species listed as threatened
or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act and the presence
of the pollutant in the surface water or segment is likely to jeopardize the
listed species;

e. A delay in conducting the TMDL could jeopardize the Department's ability
to gather sufficient credible data necessary to develop the TMDL;

f. There is significant public interest and support for the development of a
TMDL;

g. The surface water or segment has important recreational and economic
significance to the public; or

h. The pollutant is listed for eight years or more.

2. Consider an impaired surface water or segment a medium priority if:

a. The surface water or segment fails to meet more than one designated use;

b. The pollutant exceeds more than one surface water quality standard;

c. A surface water quality standard exceedance is correlated to seasonal
conditions caused by natural events, such as storms, weather patterns, or
lake turnover;

d. It will take more than two years for proposed actions in the watershed to
result in the surface water attaining applicable water quality standards;

e. The type of pollutant and other factors relating to the surface water or
segment make the TMDL complex; or

f. The administrative needs of the Department, including TMDL schedule
commitments with EPA, permitting requirements, or basin priorities that
require completion of the TMDL.

3. Consider an impaired surface water or segment a low priority if:

a. The Department has formally submitted a proposal to delist the surface
water, segment, or pollutant to EPA based on R18-11-605 (E)(2). If the
Department makes the submission outside the listing process cycle, the
change in priority ranking will not be effective until EPA approves the
submittal;

Listed Surface Waters or Segments (Arizona Administrative Code
                        (2021 Edition))

b. The Department has modified, or formally proposed for modification, the
designated use or applicable surface water quality standard, resulting in an
impaired water no longer being impaired, but the modification has not been
approved by EPA;

c. The surface water or segment is expected to attain surface water quality
standards due to any of the following:

i. Recently instituted treatment levels or best management practices in the
drainage area,

ii. Discharges or activities related to the impairment have ceased, or

iii. Actions have been taken and controls are in place or scheduled for
implementation that will likely to bring the surface water back into
compliance;

d. The surface water or segment is ephemeral or intermittent. The
Department shall re-prioritize the surface water or segment if the presence
of the pollutant in the listed water poses a threat to the health and safety of
humans, aquatic life, or wildlife using the water, or the pollutant is
contributing to the impairment of a downstream perennial surface water or
segment;

e. The pollutant poses a low ecological and human health risk;

f. Insufficient data exist to determine the source of the pollutant load;

g. The uncertainty of timely coordination with national and international
entities concerning international waters;

h. Naturally occurring conditions are a major contributor to the impairment;
and

i. No documentation or effective analytical tools exist to develop a TMDL for
the surface water or segment with reasonable accuracy.

C. The Department will target surface waters with high priority factors in
subsections (B)(1)(a) through (B)(1)(d) for initiation of TMDLs within two
years following EPA approval of the 303(d) List.

D. The Department may shift priority ranking of a surface water or segment
for any of the following reasons:

1. A change in federal, state, or tribal policies or priorities that affect
resources to complete a TMDL;
 Ariz. Admin. Code R18-11-606 Tmdl Priority Criteria for 303(d)
Listed Surface Waters or Segments (Arizona Administrative Code
                        (2021 Edition))

2. Resource efficiencies for coordinating TMDL development with other
monitoring activities, including the Department's ambient monitoring
program that monitors watersheds on a five-year rotational basis;

3. Resource efficiencies for coordinating TMDL development with
Department remedial or compliance programs;

4. New information is obtained that will revise whether the surface water or
segment is a high priority based on factors in subsection (B); and

5. Reduction or increase in staff or budget involved in the TMDL
development.

E. The Department may complete a TMDL initiated before July 12, 2002 for
a surface water or segment that was listed as impaired on the 1998 303(d)
List but does not qualify for listing under the criteria in R18-11-605, if:

1. The TMDL investigation establishes that the water quality standard is not
being met and the allocation of loads is expected to bring the surface water
into compliance with standards,

2. The Department estimates that more than 50 percent of the cost of
completing the TMDL has been spent,

3. There is community involvement and interest in completing the TMDL, or

4. The TMDL is included within an EPA-approved state workplan initiated
before July 12, 2002.
