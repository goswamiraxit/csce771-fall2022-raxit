                     Preface




                            T   he World Health Organization (WHO) has been concerned with health aspects of the
                                management of water resources for many years and publishes various documents
                            concerning the safety of the water environment and its importance for health. These
                            include a number of normative “guidelines” documents, such as the Guidelines for
                            Drinking-water Quality and the Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and
                            Greywater. Documents of this type are intended to provide a basis for standard setting.
                            They represent a consensus view among experts on the risk to health represented by
                            various media and activities and on the effectiveness of control measures in protecting
                            health. They are based on critical review of the available evidence. Wherever possible
                            and appropriate, such guideline documents also describe the principal characteristics
                            of the monitoring and assessment of the safety of the medium under consideration as
                            well as the principal factors affecting decisions to be made in developing strategies for
                            the control of the health hazards concerned.
                               The Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments are published in two volumes:
                               • Volume 1: Coastal and Fresh Waters provides an authoritative referenced review and
                                 assessment of the various health hazards encountered during recreational use
                                 of coastal and freshwater environments. It includes the derivation of guideline
                                 values or conditions and explains the basis for the decision to derive or not to
                                 derive them. It addresses a wide range of types of hazard, including hazards
                                 leading to drowning and injury, water quality, exposure to heat, cold and sun-
                                 light, and dangerous aquatic organisms; and provides background information
                                 on the different types of recreational water activity (swimming, surfing, etc.)
                                 to enable informed readers to interpret the Guidelines in light of local and
                                 regional circumstances. With regard to water quality, separate chapters address
                                 microbial hazards, freshwater algae, marine algae and chemical aspects. The vol-
                                 ume describes prevention and management options for responding to identified
                                 hazards.
                               • Volume 2: Swimming Pools and Similar Recreational Water Environments provides
                                 an authoritative referenced review and assessment of the health hazards associ-
                                 ated with recreational waters of this type; their monitoring and assessment; and
                                 activities available for their control through education of users, good design and
                                 construction, and good operation and management. The Guidelines include
                                 both specific guideline values and good practices. They address a wide range of
                                 types of hazard, including hazards leading to drowning and injury, water qual-
                                 ity, contamination of associated facilities and air quality.

                     Executive summary




                            T   his volume of the Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments describes the
                                present state of knowledge regarding the impact of the recreational use of swim-
                            ming pools and similar environments upon the health of users – specifically drowning
                            and injury, microbial contamination and exposure to chemicals. Control and moni-
                            toring of the hazards associated with these environments are discussed.
                                The primary aim of the Guidelines is the protection of public health. The purpose
                            of the Guidelines is to ensure that swimming pools and similar recreational water
                            facilities are operated as safely as possible in order that the largest possible population
                            gets the maximum possible benefit and not to deter the use of these recreational water
                            environments.
                                The Guidelines are intended to be used as the basis for the development of ap-
                            proaches to controlling the hazards that may be encountered in recreational water
                            environments. The information provided is generally applicable to pools supplied
                            with fresh, marine or thermal water, whether they are indoors or outdoors; public,
                            semi-public or domestic; supervised or unsupervised. Information also relates to pub-
                            lic, semi-public and domestic hot tubs (which, for the purposes of these Guidelines, is
                            the term used to encompass a variety of facilities that are designed for sitting in, con-
                            tain treated water usually above 32 °C, are often aerated and are not drained, cleaned
                            and refilled for each user) and natural spas (facilities using thermal and/or mineral
                            water). Although bathing houses, such as hammams, are not specifically covered, the
                            principles outlined in the Guidelines should also be generally applicable to these envi-
                            ronments. The preferred approaches adopted by national or local authorities towards
                            implementation of guideline values and conditions may vary between these types of
                            environment.
                                A guideline can be:
                               • a level of management;
                               • a concentration of a constituent that does not represent a significant risk to the
                                 health of members of significant user groups;
                               • a condition under which exposures with a significant risk are unlikely to occur;
                                 or
                               • a combination of the last two.
                               When a guideline is exceeded, this should be a signal to investigate the cause of
                            the failure and identify the likelihood of future failure, to liaise with the authority
                            responsible for public health to determine whether immediate action should be taken
                            to reduce exposure to the hazard, and to determine whether measures should be put

                            Drowning and injury prevention
                            Drowning, which is defined in these Guidelines as death arising from impairment
                            of respiratory function as a result of immersion in liquid, is a major cause of death
                            worldwide. Near-drowning is also a serious problem, as it may have lifelong effects.
                            The recovery rate from near-drowning may be lower among young children than
                            among teenagers and adults. Studies show that the prognosis for survival depends
                            more on the effectiveness of the initial rescue and resuscitation than on the quality
                            of subsequent hospital care. Most studies of accidental drowning have focused on
                            children, and in some countries drowning is the leading cause of injury deaths among
                            younger age groups. It has been suggested that in terms of swimming pools and simi-
                            lar environments most drownings occur in domestic pools and hot tubs, many while
                            the child’s supervisor assumed the child was safely indoors.
                                In swimming pools and similar environments, alcohol consumption is one of the
                            most frequently reported contributory factors associated with drownings and near-
                            drownings for adults, whereas lapses in parental supervision are most frequently cited
                            for incidents involving children. Also of concern is the danger of drownings and
                            near-drownings due to inlets and outlets where the suction is strong enough to cause
                            entrapment of body parts or hair, causing the victim’s head to be held under water.
                                Few preventive measures for drowning and near-drowning have been evaluated,
                            although installation of isolation fencing around outdoor pools has been shown by
                            some studies to decrease the number of pool immersion injuries by more than 50%.
                            Pool fences around domestic pools should have a self-closing and self-latching gate
                            and should isolate the pool. Barrier fencing should be at least 1.2 m high and have no
                            hand- or footholds that could enable a young child to climb it. Fence slats should be
                            no more than 10 cm apart. Above-ground pools should have steps or ladders leading
                            to the pool that can be secured and locked to prevent access when the pool is not in
                            use. For domestic or outdoor hot tubs, it is recommended that locked safety covers be
                            used when the hot tub is not in use.
                                Preventive measures for hair and body entrapment in pools and similar environ-
                            ments include the use of grilles on drain gates that prevent hair entrapment, dual
                            drains, an accessible and/or pressure-activated emergency shut-off for the pump and
                            the wearing of bathing caps. Warnings displayed in the form of clear and simple signs
                            as well as water safety instruction and adult supervision all may have value as preven-
                            tive actions.
                                Of sports-related spinal cord injuries, the majority appear to be associated with
                            diving. Injuries in diving incidents are almost exclusively located in the cervical ver-
                            tebrae, resulting in quadriplegia (paralysis affecting all four limbs) or paraplegia (pa-
                            ralysis of both legs). Data suggest that diving into the upslope of a pool bottom or
                            into the shallow portion of the pool is the most common cause of spinal injuries in
                            pools. Alcohol consumption may contribute significantly to the frequency of injury.
                            Education and raising awareness appear to offer the most potential for diving injury
                            prevention.
                                Other injuries associated with the use of swimming pools and similar environments
                            include brain and head injuries and arm, hand, leg and foot/toe injuries. Expert opin-
                            ion suggests that the latter are common and generally go unreported. Causes include
                            slippery decks, uncovered drains, reckless water entry, running on decks, tripping
                            on swimming aids left on the poolside and stepping on glass (from broken bottles).

                               Maintenance of surfaces (including appropriate waste disposal), supervision of pool
                               users, providing appropriate warnings, ensuring good underwater visibility and pool
                               safety education are among the actions that can reduce these incidents.
                                  High temperatures in hot tubs, for example, can cause drowsiness, which may
                               lead to loss of consciousness or to heat stroke and death, and it is recommended that
                               water temperatures in hot tubs be kept below 40 °C. Exposure to low temperatures in
                               plunge pools, which are used in conjunction with saunas or steam baths, may result in
                               slowed heart beat, hypothermia, impaired coordination, loss of control of breathing,
                               muscle cramps and loss of consciousness. Temperature extremes should be avoided
                               by users with medical problems, pregnant women and young children. Educational
                               displays and warning signs, warnings from pool staff and regulations on time limits
                               for use can reduce these adverse outcomes.

                               Microbial hazards
                               The risk of illness or infection associated with swimming pools and similar recreation-
                               al water environments is primarily associated with faecal contamination of the water.
                               This may be due to faeces released by the bathers or contaminated source water or, in
                               the case of outdoor pools, may be the result of direct animal contamination (e.g. from
                               birds and rodents). Many of the outbreaks related to pools and similar environments
                               have occurred because disinfection was not applied or was inadequate. Non-faecal
                               human shedding into the pool water or surrounding area is also a potential source of
                               pathogenic organisms.
                                  Swimming pool-related outbreaks of illness are relatively infrequent, but have been
                               linked to viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi. Viral outbreaks are most often at-
                               tributed to adenovirus, although hepatitis A, norovirus and echovirus have also been
                               implicated in pool-related disease outbreaks. It should be borne in mind that the
                               evidence linking viral outbreaks to a pool is generally circumstantial, and the causative
                               viruses have rarely been isolated from the water.
                                  Shigella and Escherichia coli O157 are two related bacteria that have been linked
                               to outbreaks of illness associated with swimming in pools. Symptoms of E. coli O157
                               infection include bloody diarrhoea (haemorrhagic colitis) and haemolytic uraemic
                               syndrome (HUS), as well as vomiting and fever in more severe cases. HUS, character-
                               ized by haemolytic anaemia and acute renal failure, occurs most frequently in infants,
                               young children and elderly people. Symptoms associated with shigellosis include diar-
                               rhoea, fever and nausea.
                                  The risk of illness in swimming pools associated with faecally-derived protozoa
                               mainly involves two parasites: Giardia and Cryptosporidium. These two organisms
                               have a cyst or oocyst form that is highly resistant to both environmental stress and
                               disinfectants. They also both have high infectivity and are shed in high densities by
                               infected individuals. Giardiasis is characterized by diarrhoea, cramps, foul-smelling
                               stools, loss of appetite, fatigue and vomiting, whereas symptoms of cryptosporidiosis
                               include diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal cramps.
                                  The control of viruses and bacteria in swimming pool water is usually accom-
                               plished by appropriate treatment, including filtration and the proper application of
                               chlorine or other disinfectants. Episodes of gross contamination of pool water due to
                               an accidental faecal release, however, cannot all be effectively controlled by normal
                               treatment and disinfectant levels. Where pools or spas are not disinfected, accidental

                            faecal releases present an even greater problem. The only approach to maintaining
                            public health protection under conditions of an accidental faecal release is to prohibit
                            the use of the pool until the potential contaminants are inactivated.
                                Pool operators can help prevent faecal contamination of pools by encouraging pre-
                            swim showering and toilet use and, where possible, confining young children to pools
                            small enough to drain in the event of an accidental faecal release. It is recommended
                            that people with gastroenteritis not use public or semi-public facilities while ill or for
                            at least a week after their illness.
                                As well as pathogenic enteric organisms, a number of infectious non-enteric organ-
                            isms may be transferred through pool water and the surrounding environment via
                            human shedding. Infected users can directly contaminate pool waters and the surfaces
                            of objects or materials at a facility with primary pathogens (notably viruses or fungi)
                            in sufficient numbers to lead to skin and other infections in users who subsequently
                            come in contact with the contaminated water or surfaces. Opportunistic pathogens
                            (notably bacteria) can also be shed from users and be transmitted via both surfaces
                            and contaminated water. In addition, certain free-living aquatic bacteria and amoebae
                            can grow in pool, hot tub or natural spa waters, in pool or hot tub components or
                            facilities (including heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems) or on other wet
                            surfaces within the facility to a point at which they may cause a variety of respiratory,
                            dermal or central nervous system infections or diseases.
                                Most of the legionellosis, an often serious infection caused by Legionella species,
                            associated with recreational water use has been associated with public and semi-public
                            hot tubs and natural spas. Natural spas (especially thermal water) and hot tub water
                            and the associated equipment create an ideal habitat (warm, nutrient-containing aer-
                            obic water) for the selection and proliferation of Legionella. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
                            is also frequently present in hot tubs, as it is able to withstand high temperatures and
                            disinfectants and to grow rapidly in waters supplied with nutrients from users. In hot
                            tubs, the primary health effect associated with the presence of P. aeruginosa is follicu-
                            litis, an infection of the hair follicles that may result in a pustular rash.
                                It is less easy to control the growth of Legionella spp. and P. aeruginosa in hot tubs
                            than in pools, as the design and operation of hot tubs can make it difficult to achieve
                            adequate residual disinfection levels in these facilities. Thus, in public and semi-public
                            facilities, frequent monitoring and adjustment of pH and disinfectant levels are es-
                            sential, as are programmed ‘rest periods’ to allow disinfectant levels to ‘recover’. In ad-
                            dition, facility operators should require users to shower before entering the water and
                            control the number of users and the duration of their exposure. Thorough cleaning of
                            the area surrounding the hot tub on a frequent basis (e.g. daily), complete draining and
                            cleaning of the hot tub and pipework on at least a weekly basis, frequent backwashing
                            and filter inspection and good ventilation are all recommended control measures.
                                Molluscipoxvirus (which causes molluscum contagiosum), papillomavirus (which
                            causes benign cutaneous tumours – verrucae), Epidermophyton floccosum and various
                            species of fungi in the genus Trichophyton (which cause superficial fungal infections
                            of the hair, fingernails or skin) are spread by direct person-to-person contact or indi-
                            rectly, through physical contact with contaminated surfaces. As the primary source of
                            these viruses and fungi in swimming pools and similar environments is infected bath-
                            ers, the most important means of controlling the spread of the infections is educating
                            the public about the diseases, including the importance of limiting contact between

                               ing and disinfection of surfaces in facilities that are prone to contamination can also
                               reduce the spread of the diseases.

                               Chemical hazards
                               Chemicals found in swimming pool water can be derived from a number of sources,
                               namely the source water, deliberate additions such as disinfectants and pool users
                               themselves (these include sweat, urine, soap residues, cosmetics and suntan oil).
                                   There are three main routes of exposure to chemicals in swimming pools and simi-
                               lar environments: direct ingestion of the water, inhalation of volatile or aerosolized
                               solutes and dermal contact and absorption through the skin. The amount of water
                               ingested by swimmers and bathers will depend upon a range of factors, including
                               experience, age, skill and type of activity. Experimental evidence suggests that water
                               intake varies according to age and sex, with adult women ingesting the least and male
                               children ingesting the most. Swimmers inhale from the atmosphere just above the
                               water’s surface, and the volume of air inhaled is a function of the intensity of effort
                               and time. Inhalation exposure will be largely associated with volatile substances that
                               are lost from the water surface, but will also include some inhalation of aerosols,
                               within a hot tub (for example) or where there is significant splashing. Dermal expo-
                               sure depends upon the period of contact with the water, water temperature and the
                               concentration of the chemical.
                                   The principal management-derived chemicals are disinfectants, added to minimize
                               the risk to pool users from microbial contaminants. Coagulants may be added as part
                               of the water treatment process to enhance the removal of dissolved, colloidal or sus-
                               pended material. Acids and alkalis may also be added to the water in order to main-
                               tain an appropriate pH for optimal water treatment and also the comfort of bathers.
                                   The chemical disinfectants that are used most frequently include chlorine (as a
                               gas, hypochlorite or, generally for outdoor pools, chlorinated isocyanurates), chlorine
                               dioxide, bromochlorodimethylhydantoin (BCDMH), ozone and ultraviolet (UV)
                               radiation (with ozone and UV usually being used in combination with a chlorine-
                               or bromine-based disinfectant). Practice varies widely around the world, as do the
                               levels of chemicals that are currently considered to be acceptable in order to achieve
                               adequate disinfection while minimizing user discomfort. It is recommended that ac-
                               ceptable levels of free chlorine continue to be set at the local level, but in public and
                               semi-public pools these should not exceed 3 mg/l and in public and semi-public hot
                               tubs should not exceed 5 mg/l. It is recommended that total bromine does not exceed
                               4 mg/l in public and semi-public pools and 5 mg/l in hot tubs. Where chlorinated
                               isocyanurates are used, levels of cyanuric acid in pool water should not exceed 100
                               mg/l. Where ozone is used, an air quality guideline of 0.12 mg/m3 is recommended
                               in order to protect bathers and staff working in the pool building.
                                   A number of disinfectants can react with other chemicals in the water to give rise
                               to unwanted by-products, known as disinfection by-products. Most is known about
                               the by-products that result from the reaction of chlorine with humic and fulvic acids,
                               but there is evidence from model studies with amino acids that other organic sub-
                               stances will also give rise to a similar range of by-products. Although there is poten-
                               tially a large number of by-products, the substances produced in the greatest quan-
                               tities are trihalomethanes, of which chloroform is generally present in the greatest

                             concentrations, and the haloacetic acids, of which di- and trichloroacetic acid are
                             generally present in the greatest concentrations. Both chlorine and bromine will react
                             with ammonia in the water (resulting from the presence of urine) to form chloramines
                             (monochloramine, dichloramine and nitrogen trichloride) and bromamines.
                                 Trihalomethanes have been considered more than other chlorination by-products,
                             reflecting the level of available information. Concentrations vary as a consequence
                             of the concentration of precursor compounds, chlorine dose, temperature and pH.
                             Trihalomethanes are volatile in nature and can be lost from the surface of the water,
                             so they are also found in the air above the pool.
                                 The guideline values in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality can be
                             used to screen for potential risks arising from swimming pools and similar environ-
                             ments, while making appropriate allowance for the much lower quantities of water
                             ingested, shorter exposure periods and non-ingestion exposure. Although there are
                             data to indicate that the concentrations of chlorination by-products in swimming
                             pools and similar environments may exceed the concentrations proposed by WHO
                             for drinking-water, the evidence indicates that for reasonably well managed pools,
                             concentrations less than the drinking-water guideline values can be consistently
                             achieved. The risks from exposure to chlorination by-products in reasonably well
                             managed swimming pools would be considered to be small and must be set against
                             the benefits of aerobic exercise and the risks of microbial disease in the absence of
                             disinfection. Nevertheless, competitive swimmers and pool attendants can experience
                             substantial exposure to volatile disinfection by-products via inhalation and dermal
                             absorption. The chloramines and bromamines, particularly nitrogen trichloride and
                             nitrogen tribromide, which are both volatile, can give rise to significant eye and
                             respiratory irritation in swimmers and pool attendants. The provisional guideline
                             value for chlorine species, expressed as nitrogen trichloride, in the atmosphere of
                             swimming pools and similar environments is 0.5 mg/m3.

                             Managing water and air quality
                             The primary water and air quality health challenges are, in typical order of public
                             health priority, controlling clarity to minimize injury hazard, controlling water qual-
                             ity to prevent the transmission of infectious disease and controlling potential hazards
                             from disinfection by-products. All of these challenges can be met through the com-
                             bination of the following factors: treatment (to remove particulates, pollutants and
                             microorganisms), including disinfection and filtration; pool hydraulics (to ensure ef-
                             fective distribution of disinfectant throughout the pool and removal of contaminated
                             water); addition of fresh water at frequent intervals (to dilute substances that cannot
                             be removed from the water by treatment); cleaning (to remove biofilms from surfaces,
                             sediments from the pool floor and particulates adsorbed to filter materials); and ad-
                             equate ventilation of indoor facilities.
                                 Pre-swim showering will help to remove traces of sweat, urine, faecal matter, cos-
                             metics, suntan oil and other potential water contaminants. Where pool users nor-
                             mally shower before swimming, pool water is cleaner, easier to disinfect with smaller
                             amounts of chemicals and thus more pleasant to swim in. All users should also be
                             encouraged to use the toilets before bathing to minimize urination in the pool and
                             accidental faecal releases.

                                   Disinfection is part of the treatment process whereby pathogenic microorganisms
                               are inactivated by chemical (e.g. chlorination) or physical (e.g. UV radiation) means
                               such that they represent no significant risk of infection. Circulating pool water is
                               disinfected during the treatment process, and the entire water body is disinfected by
                               the application of a residual disinfectant (chlorine- or bromine-based), which partially
                               inactivates agents added to the pool by bathers. The choice of disinfectant depends
                               upon a number of factors, including safety, compatibility with the source water, type,
                               size and location of the pool, bathing load and the operation of the pool.
                                   The concentration of disinfection by-products can be controlled to a significant
                               extent by minimizing the introduction of precursors though source water selection,
                               good bather hygienic practices (e.g. pre-swim showering), maximizing their removal
                               by well managed pool water treatment and replacement of water by the addition of
                               fresh supplies (i.e. dilution of chemicals that cannot be removed). It is inevitable,
                               however, that some volatile disinfection by-products (such as chloroform and nitrogen
                               trichloride) may be produced in the pool water and escape into the air. This hazard
                               can be managed to some extent through good ventilation of indoor pool buildings.
                                   Filtration is important in ensuring a safe pool. If filtration is poor, water clar-
                               ity will decline and drowning risks increase. Disinfection will also be compromised,
                               as particles associated with turbidity can surround microorganisms and shield them
                               from the action of disinfectants. Particulate removal through coagulation and filtra-
                               tion is important for removing Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts and some
                               other protozoa that are resistant to chemical disinfection. For identifying bodies at
                               the bottom of the pool, a universal turbidity value is not considered appropriate, as
                               much depends on the characteristics of the specific pool. Individual standards should
                               be developed, based on risk assessment at each pool, but it is recommended that,
                               as a minimum, it should be possible to see a small child at the bottom of the pool
                               from the lifeguard position while the water surface is in movement. In terms of effec-
                               tive disinfection, a useful, but not absolute, upper-limit guideline for turbidity is 0.5
                               nephelometric turbidity units.
                                   Coagulation, filtration and disinfection will not remove all pollutants. Swimming
                               pool design should enable the dilution of pool water with fresh water. Dilution limits
                               the build-up of pollutants from bathers (e.g. constituents of sweat and urine), disinfec-
                               tion by-products and various other dissolved chemicals. Pool operators should replace
                               pool water as a regular part of their water treatment regime. As a general rule, the addi-
                               tion of fresh water to disinfected pools should not be less than 30 litres per bather.
                                   Good circulation and hydraulics in the pool ensure that the whole pool is ad-
                               equately served by filtered, disinfected water. Treated water must get to all parts of
                               the pool, and polluted water must be removed – especially from areas most used and
                               most polluted by bathers. It is recommended that 75–80% be taken from the surface
                               (where the pollution is greatest), with the remainder taken from the bottom of the
                               pool.
                                   Accidental faecal releases may occur relatively frequently, although it is likely that
                               most go undetected. A pool operator faced with an accidental faecal release or vomit
                               in the pool water must act immediately. If the faecal release is solid, it should be
                               retrieved quickly and discarded appropriately. The scoop used to retrieve the faeces
                               should be washed carefully and disinfected after use. If residual disinfectant levels are
                               satisfactory, no further action is necessary. Where the stool is runny (diarrhoea) or if

                            there is vomit, the situation is likely to be more hazardous. The safest course of action
                            in small pools or hot tubs is to evacuate users, drain, clean and refill. Where draining
                            is not possible, the pool should be cleared of people immediately; as much of the ma-
                            terial as possible should be collected, removed and disposed of to waste; disinfectant
                            levels should be maintained at the top of the recommended range or shock dosing
                            used; using a coagulant (if appropriate), the water should be filtered for six turnover
                            cycles; and the filter should be backwashed.
                                In indoor facilities, it is important to manage air quality as well as water quality in
                            swimming pools and similar recreational water environments. This is important not
                            only for staff and user health, but also for their comfort and to avoid negative impacts
                            on the building fabric, and building code ventilation rates should be adhered to.
                                Parameters that are easy and inexpensive to measure and of immediate operational
                            health relevance (such as turbidity, disinfectant residual and pH) should be monitored
                            most frequently and in all pool types.
                                For a conventional public or semi-public swimming pool with good hydraulics
                            and filtration, operating within its design bathing load, experience has shown that
                            adequate routine disinfection should be achieved with a free chlorine level of 1 mg/l
                            throughout the pool. Lower free chlorine concentrations (0.5 mg/l or less) will be
                            adequate when chlorine is used in combination with ozone or UV disinfection. Higher
                            concentrations (up to 2–3 mg/l) may be required for hot tubs, because of higher bath-
                            ing loads and higher temperatures. Total bromine concentrations should not exceed
                            4 mg/l in public and semi-public pools and 5 mg/l in hot tubs.
                                In public and semi-public pools, residual disinfectant concentrations should be
                            checked by sampling the pool before it opens and during the opening period (ideally
                            during a period of high bathing load). It is suggested that the residual disinfectant
                            concentration in domestic pools be determined before use. If the routine test results
                            are outside the recommended ranges, the situation should be assessed and action
                            taken.
                                The pH value of swimming pool water (and similar environments) must be con-
                            trolled to ensure efficient disinfection and coagulation, to avoid damage to the pool
                            fabric and to ensure user comfort. The pH should be maintained between 7.2 and
                            7.8 for chlorine disinfectants and between 7.2 and 8.0 for bromine-based and other
                            non-chlorine processes.
                                There is limited risk of significant microbial contamination and illness in a well
                            managed pool or similar environment with an adequate residual disinfectant concen-
                            tration, a pH value maintained at an appropriate level, well operated filters and fre-
                            quent monitoring of non-microbial parameters. Nevertheless, samples of pool water
                            from public and semi-public pools should be monitored at appropriate intervals for
                            microbial parameters, including heterotrophic plate count, thermotolerant coliforms
                            or E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella. The frequency of monitoring and
                            the guideline values vary according to microbial parameter and the type of pool.

                            Recreational water activities can bring health benefits to users, including exercise and
                            relaxation. Effective management can control potential adverse health consequences
                            that can be associated with the use of unsafe recreational water environments.

                                  Different stakeholders play different roles in the management of the recreational
                               water environment for safety. The typical areas of responsibility may be grouped into
                               four major categories, although there may be overlap between these and stakeholders
                               with responsibilities falling within more than one category:
                                  • Design and construction. People responsible for commissioning pools and similar
                                    environments, along with designers and contractors, should be aware of the re-
                                    quirements to ensure safe and enjoyable use of facilities. Many decisions taken
                                    at the design and construction phase will have repercussions on the ease with
                                    which safe operation can be ensured once the pool is in use.
                                  • Operation and management. Facility operators play a key role and are responsible
                                    for the good operation and management of the recreational water environment.
                                    This should include the preparation of and compliance with a pool safety plan,
                                    which consists of a description of the system, its monitoring and maintenance,
                                    normal operating procedures, procedures for specified incidents, a generic
                                    emergency plan and an emergency evacuation procedure.
                                  • Public education and information. Facility operators, local authorities, public
                                    health bodies, pool-based clubs and sports bodies can play an important role in
                                    ensuring pool safety through public education and providing appropriate and
                                    targeted information to pool users.
                                  • Regulatory requirements (including compliance). National legislation may include
                                    different sets of regulations that will apply to swimming pools and similar rec-
                                    reational environments. Regulation may control, for example, the design and
                                    construction of pools, their operation and management and control of sub-
                                    stances hazardous to health. Within regulations it is likely that there will be
                                    a requirement for the use of certified material and, possibly, staff registered to
                                    certain bodies. Local regulatory oversight can support the work of pool man-
                                    agement and provide greater public health protection and public confidence.
                                    Inspections by the regulatory officials to verify compliance with the regulations
                                    are an important component of this oversight.
                                  Successful implementation of the Guidelines will also require development of suit-
                               able capacities and expertise and the elaboration of a coherent policy and legislative
                               framework.

                     Introduction




                                T   his volume of the Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments describes the
                                    present state of knowledge regarding the possible detrimental impacts of the recre-
                                ational use of swimming pools and similar recreational water environments upon the
                                health of users, as well as the monitoring and control of the hazards associated with
                                these environments.

                            1.1 General considerations
                                The hazards that are encountered in swimming pools and similar environments vary
                                from site to site, as does exposure to the hazards. In general, most available informa-
                                tion relates to health outcomes arising from exposure through swimming and inges-
                                tion of water. In the development of these Guidelines, all available information on the
                                different uses of water and routes of exposure was taken into consideration.
                                    This chapter covers the structure of this volume of the Guidelines for Safe Recre-
                                ational Water Environments and introduces definitions of pool types, pool users and
                                so on. The hazards from drowning and injury are probably the most obvious hazards
                                relating to pools and similar environments, although there are also less visible hazards,
                                including those posed by microbes and chemicals. These are covered in Chapters 2, 3
                                and 4, respectively. Most pools and similar environments apply treatment in manag-
                                ing water quality to ensure that the water is of an acceptable clarity and microbial and
                                chemical quality. This can encompass filtration, pH control and disinfection with
                                a range of disinfectants. Managing water and air quality to minimize health risks is
                                covered in Chapter 5, while the roles of various stakeholders, regulatory measures and
                                guideline implementation are dealt with in Chapter 6. This volume of the Guidelines
                                for Safe Recreational Water Environments is structured as shown in Figure 1.1.
                                    The primary aim of the Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments is the
                                protection of public health. The use of swimming pools and similar recreational water
                                environments – and the resulting social interaction, relaxation and exercise – is associ-
                                ated with benefits to health and well-being. The purpose of the Guidelines is to ensure
                                that the pools and similar environments are operated as safely as possible in order that
                                the largest possible population gets the maximum possible benefit.
                                    The Guidelines are intended to be used as the basis for the development of ap-
                                proaches to controlling the hazards that may be encountered in swimming pools and
                                similar recreational water environments, as well as providing a framework for policy-
                                making and local decision-taking. The Guidelines may also be used as reference mate-
                                rial for industries and operators preparing to develop facilities containing swimming

                                 pools and similar environments, as well as a checklist for understanding and assessing
                                 the potential health impacts of projects involving the development of such facilities.
                                     The information provided in this volume of the Guidelines is intended to be gen-
                                 erally applicable to public, semi-public (as encountered in clubs, hotels and schools,
                                 for example) and domestic (private) facilities (see Section 1.2). Although medical
                                 facilities (such as hydrotherapy pools) and bathing houses, such as hammams, are not
                                 specifically covered, the approaches outlined in these Guidelines should also be gener-
                                 ally applicable to these environments. The preferred approaches adopted by national
                                 or local authorities towards implementation of guideline values and conditions may
                                 vary between these types of environment.
                                     Because hazards may give rise to health effects after short- as well as long-term
                                 exposures, it is important that standards, monitoring and implementation enable pre-
                                 ventive and remedial actions within real time frames. For this reason, emphasis in the
                                 Guidelines is placed upon identifying circumstances and procedures that are likely
                                 to lead to a continuously safe environment for recreation. This approach emphasizes
                                 monitoring of both conditions and practices and the use of threshold values for key
                                 indicators assessed through programmes of monitoring and assessment.
                                     Concerned bodies – including national and local agencies, facility owners and op-
                                 erators, and nongovernmental organizations – have diverse management interventions.
                                 These range from proper facility planning to good operation and management prac-
                                 tices, provision of appropriate levels of supervision (i.e. lifeguards), general educational
                                 activities to enhance awareness of health hazards and inform users on ways to avoid and
                                 respond to the hazards, and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

layout Safe Water.indd 24                                                                                                       24.2.2006 9:56:50
                                      Where possible, numerical guideline values are presented as indicators of safety or good
                                  management (as described in Section 1.6). These guidelines use a risk–benefit approach. In
                                  the case of swimming pools and similar environments, development of such an approach
                                  concerns not only health risks, but also the health benefits and well-being derived from the
                                  recreational use of these environments. In developing strategies for the protection of pub-
                                  lic health, competent government authorities should take into account social, economic
                                  and environmental factors, including the general education of adults and children as well
                                  as the efforts and initiatives of nongovernmental organizations and industry operators in
                                  this area. This approach can often lead to the adoption of standards that are measurable
                                  and can be implemented and enforced. These would deal with, for example, water quality,
                                  safety of associated facilities and dissemination of information. A broad-based policy ap-
                                  proach is required that will include legislation enabling positive and negative incentives to
                                  alter behaviour and monitor and improve situations. Such a broad base will require signifi-
                                  cant efforts in intersectoral coordination and cooperation at national and local levels, and
                                  successful implementation will require development of suitable capacities and expertise as
                                  well as the elaboration of a coherent policy and legislative framework.

                            1.2 Types of pools
                                  Swimming pools may be supplied with fresh (surface or ground), marine or thermal
                                  water (i.e. from natural hot springs). They may be domestic (private), semi-public (e.g.
                                  hotel, school, health club, housing complex, cruise ship) or public (e.g. municipal),
                                  and they may be supervised or unsupervised. Swimming pools may be located indoors,
                                  outdoors (i.e. open air) or both; they may be heated or unheated. In terms of structure,
                                  the conventional pool is often referred to as the main, public or municipal pool. It is
                                  by tradition rectangular, with no extra water features (other than possible provision for
                                  diving), and it is used by people of all ages and abilities. There are also temporary or
                                  portable pools, which are often used in the domestic setting. In addition, there are many
                                  specialist pools for a particular user type – for example, paddling pools, learner or teach-
                                  ing pools, diving pools and pools with special features such as ‘flumes’ or water slides.
                                  Although termed swimming pools, they are often used for a variety of recreational
                                  activities, such as aqua-aerobics, scuba diving and so on (see Section 1.3).
                                     Hot tubs, for the purposes of these Guidelines, is the term used to encompass a
                                  variety of facilities that are designed for sitting in (rather than swimming), contain
                                  water usually above 32 °C, are generally aerated, contain treated water and are not
                                  drained, cleaned or refilled for each user. They may be domestic, semi-public or public
                                  and located indoors or outdoors. A wide range of names is used for them, including spa
                                  pools, whirlpools, whirlpool spas, heated spas, bubble baths and Jacuzzi (a term that is
                                  used generically but is in fact a trade name).
                                     Plunge pools are usually used in association with saunas, steam rooms or hot tubs
                                  and are designed to cool users by immersion in unheated water. They are usually only

                                orthopaedic, cardiac or other diseases; these are termed ‘hydrotherapy pools’ and are
                                defined as pools used for special medical or medicinal purposes. These are not specifi-
                                cally covered by the Guidelines, although many of the same principles that apply to
                                swimming pools and hot tubs will also apply to hydrotherapy pools. There are also
                                therapy pools containing small fish (Garra ruffa) that feed on the scaly skin lesions
                                caused by psoriasis. These types of therapy pools are not covered by the Guidelines.
                                    In many countries, there are public hygiene facilities to enable individuals and
                                families to bathe. These are operated as drain and fill pools or baths and are not cov-
                                ered by these Guidelines.
                                    Each type of pool has potentially different management problems, which must be
                                anticipated and dealt with by pool managers. Of importance to the type of pool and
                                its management is identification of how the pool will be used:
                                   •   the daily opening hours;
                                   •   the peak periods of use;
                                   •   the anticipated number and types of users; and
                                   •   special requirements, such as temperature, lanes and equipment.
                                   The type, design and use of a pool may present certain hazards (e.g. pools may in-
                                clude sudden changes in depth, which may result in wading non-swimmers suddenly
                                finding themselves out of their depth). Hot tubs, for example, may be subject to high
                                bather loads relative to the volume of water. Where there are high water temperatures
                                and rapid agitation of water, it may become difficult to maintain satisfactory pH,
                                microbial quality and disinfectant concentrations.
                                   In certain circumstances, in some natural spas utilizing thermal and mineral waters
                                it may not be possible to treat the water in the usual way (i.e. by recycling or disinfec-
                                tion) because the agents believed to be of benefit, such as sulfides, would be eliminat-
                                ed or impaired. Also, chemical substances of geological origin in some types of deep
                                thermal springs and artesian wells (such as humic substances and ammonium) may
                                hamper the effect of disinfectants when these waters are used to fill pools without any
                                pretreatment. These natural spas, therefore, require non-oxidative methods of water
                                treatment (see Chapter 5). A very high rate of water exchange is necessary (even if not
                                completely effective) if there is no other way of preventing microbial contamination,
                                where complete drain-down between users is not possible.
                                   Pools and hot tubs on ships are also a special case, as the source water may be either
                                seawater or from the potable water supply for the ship. The hydraulic, circulation and
                                treatment systems of the pool will necessitate a unique design in order to be able to
                                deal with movement of the ship and the variable source water quality (outlined in
                                more detail in WHO, 2005). They may also pose an increased risk of injury com-
                                pared with land-based pools, especially when used in heavy seas.

                                Users may include:
                                   •   the general public;
                                   •   children/babies;
                                   •   hotel guests;

                                     •   health club members;
                                     •   exercise class members (e.g. aqua-aerobics);
                                     •   competitive swimmers;
                                     •   non-swimmers;
                                     •   clients of outdoor camping parks;
                                     •   leisure bathers, including clients of theme parks; and
                                     •   specialist sporting users, including scuba divers, canoeists and water polo par-
                                         ticipants.
                                     Certain groups of users may be more predisposed to hazards than others. For example:
                                     • Children may spend long periods in recreational waters and are more likely than
                                       adults to intentionally or accidentally swallow water.
                                     • The elderly and handicapped may have strength, agility and stamina limitations.
                                     • Immunocompromised individuals may be at higher risk from microbial or
                                       chemical hazards.

                            1.4 Hazard and risk
                                  Popularly, the terms hazard and risk are used interchangeably. Correctly, a hazard is a set
                                  of circumstances that could lead to harm – harm being injury, illness or loss of life. The
                                  risk of such an event is defined as the probability that it will occur as a result of exposure
                                  to a defined quantum of hazard. In simpler terms, hazard is the potential for harm,
                                  while risk is the chance that harm will actually occur. The rate of incidence or attack rate
                                  is the number of events expected to occur for this defined quantum of hazard. Strictly
                                  speaking, probabilities and rates obey different laws; however, if the probabilities are
                                  small and the events are independent, the two values will be approximately equal.

                        1.4.1 Types of hazard encountered
                                  The most frequent hazards associated with the use of swimming pools and similar
                                  recreational water environments are:
                                     •   physical hazards (leading to, for example, drowning, near-drowning or injury);
                                     •   heat, cold and sunlight (see also WHO, 2003);
                                     •   water quality; and
                                     •   air quality.
                                     Specific examples of the hazards and the associated adverse health outcomes are
                                  given in Table 1.1.
                                     Drowning, near-drowning and spinal injury are severe health outcomes of great
                                  concern to public health. Human behaviour, especially alcohol consumption, is a
                                  prime factor that increases the likelihood of injuries. Other injuries, such as cuts and
                                  those arising from slip, trip and fall accidents, while less severe, cause distress and
                                  decrease the benefits to well-being arising from recreation. Preventive and remedial
                                  actions take diverse forms and include general education, posting of warnings where
                                  appropriate, the presence of lifeguards, use of non-slip surfaces, preventing the use
                                  of glass near the pool, preventing rough play or running poolside, the availability of
                                  health services such as first aid, the availability of communication with health and
                                  rescue services, and the cleaning of pools and associated facilities.

                                     Much attention has focused in recent years upon microbial hazards. In particular,
                                 the health risks associated with contamination by excreta and associated gastroenteric
                                 outcomes have been the topic of both scientific and general public interest. Adverse
                                 health outcomes associated with microbial hazards also include skin, eye and ear in-
                                 fections arising from pollution of water by excreta from source waters and from bath-
                                 ers as well as non-enteric organisms arising from bathers or those naturally present in
                                 the aquatic environment.
                                     Hazards to human health exist even in unpolluted environments. For example, eye
                                 irritation and some additional eye infections probably occur as a result of reduction
                                 in the eye’s natural defences through limited contact with water and do not relate to
                                 water quality or pollution per se.

                                 Assessments of hazard and risk inform the development of policies for controlling and
                                 managing risks to health and well-being in water recreation. Both draw upon experi-
                                 ence and the application of common sense, as well as the interpretation of data.

                     water use


                                  death, as a result of diving into shallow water, may affect only a small number of pool
                                  users annually but will warrant a high management priority. Minor skin irritations,
                                  encountered at the other end of the scale, may affect a higher number of users per year,
                                  but do not result in any significant incapacity, and thus require lower management pri-
                                  ority. Figure 1.2 can be applied throughout the Guidelines. For each hazard discussed,
                                  the severity of the hazard can be related to the relative risk in the figure and can serve
                                  as a tool to initiate further research or investigation into the reduction of risk as well as
                                  to highlight or emphasize priority protective or remedial management measures.
                                     Data on risk related to the use of swimming pools and similar recreational water
                                  environments take four main forms:
                                     •   national and regional statistics of illness and deaths;
                                     •   clinical surveillance of the incidence of illness and outbreaks;
                                     •   epidemiological studies and surveys; and
                                     •   accident and injury records held by facility owners/managers and local authorities.
                                  Although ‘incident records’ held by local pools and authoritative bodies may be com-
                                  prehensive, published statistics are seldom sufficiently detailed for risk assessment.
                                     Systems for surveillance of public health operate in some countries. They serve
                                  the broad purpose of alerting either regulator or supplier to changes in incidence of

                               disease and to the need for initiating immediate investigation of the causes and reme-
                               dial action. Such investigation will involve epidemiology (the study of the occurrence
                               and causes of disease in populations). Galbraith & Palmer (1990) give details of the
                               use of epidemiology in surveillance. Epidemiology may also be used as a research tool
                               to investigate hypotheses concerning the causes of illness.
                                  There are other reasons why it is difficult to estimate risk directly, such as the
                               following:
                                 • In most active water sports, enjoyment arises from the use of skill to avoid and
                                   overcome perceived hazards. The degree of competence of participants and the
                                   use of properly designed equipment, accompanied by appropriate supervision
                                   and training, will considerably modify the risk.
                                 • Risks of acquiring infectious disease will be influenced by innate and acquired
                                   immunity (for examples, see Gerba et al., 1996). The former comprises a wide
                                   range of biological and environmental factors (age, sex, nutrition, socioeco-
                                   nomic and geographic), as well as body defences (impregnability of the skin,
                                   lysozyme secretion in tears, mucus and sweat, the digestive tract and phagocy-
                                   tosis). Previous challenge by pathogens often results in transient or long-lasting
                                   immunity. Immunocompromised individuals will be at greater risk of acquiring
                                   infectious diseases (see Pond, 2005).
                                 • Assessment of harm itself and the degree of harm suffered depends upon judge-
                                   ment at the time. Medical certification of injury and of physiological illness and
                                   infection, accompanied by clinical diagnosis, is the most reliable information.
                                   Information obtained by survey or questionnaire will contain a variable degree
                                   of uncertainty caused by the subjects’ understanding of the questions, their
                                   memory of the events and any personal bias of the subject and interviewer.
                                   Survey information is only as good as the care that has gone into the design and
                                   conduct of the survey.
                                 • The causes of harm must be ascertained as far as possible at the time. There are
                                   considerable difficulties in determining causes in the cases of low-level exposures
                                   to chemical and physical agents that have a cumulative or threshold effect and of
                                   infectious diseases caused by those pathogens that have more than one route of
                                   infection or have a long period of incubation. For example, gastroenteric infections
                                   at swimming pool facilities may result from person-to-person contact or faulty
                                   food hygiene in catering, as well as from ingesting pathogen-contaminated water.
                                 • Where data are in the form of published regional or national statistics giving at-
                                   tack rates, the exact basis on which the data are collected and classified must be
                                   ascertained. For example, national statistics on deaths by drowning will usually
                                   include suicides, occupational accidents (e.g. lifeguards), natural disasters (e.g.
                                   flooding due to storm events) and misadventure in recreation.
                                 • It cannot be assumed that risk is directly proportional to exposure or that risks from
                                   multiple exposures or a combination of different factors will combine additively.

                         1.4.3 Degree of water contact
                               For hazards where contact with water and ingestion of water are important, an un-
                               derstanding of the different degrees of contact associated with different pool types
                               and uses is helpful. For example, the degree of water contact directly influences the


                     8                                            GUIDELINES FOR SAFE RECREATIONAL WATER ENVIRONMENTS




layout Safe Water.indd 30                                                                                                   24.2.2006 9:56:52
                                  amount of exposure to pathogens and toxic agents found in contaminated water and
                                  aerosols and therefore the likelihood of illness.
                                     The degrees of water contact encountered in the many different types of swim-
                                  ming pools and similar recreational water environments may be classified as follows:
                                     • No contact – for example, use of outdoor pools just for sunbathing and not
                                       swimming.
                                     • Meaningful direct contact – involves a negligible risk of swallowing water, such
                                       as the use of a wading pool by adults.
                                     • Extensive direct contact – with full body immersion and a significant risk of swal-
                                       lowing water, e.g. swimming, diving.

                            1.5 Measures to reduce risks
                                  Reduction of most, if not all, of the health risks associated with the hazards described in
                                  Table 1.1 can be obtained by avoiding the circumstances giving rise to the hazard or by
                                  mitigating their effect. For example, glass left on the poolside may cause cuts to walkers
                                  with bare feet, which may be overcome by regular cleaning of the pool, excluding glass
                                  from the pool area, provision of litter bins and educational awareness campaigns. Ac-
                                  cidents caused by misuse of water slides may be overcome by increased supervision by
                                  lifeguards and education of users regarding proper behaviour. Each type of recreational
                                  activity should be subject to a hazard assessment to determine what type of control mea-
                                  sures will be most effective. Assessment should include modifying factors, such as local
                                  features, seasonal effects (for outdoor pools) and competence of the participants.
                                      Controls for reducing risks in swimming pools and similar environments are dis-
                                  cussed in Chapters 5 and 6. Different uses and types of pools involve different degrees
                                  of water contact and exposure to the various hazards. Measures for risk reduction will
                                  therefore be tailor-made to each pool type and to particular circumstances.
                                      Management of swimming pools and similar recreational waters can be classified
                                  into four major categories (as described in Chapter 6):
                                     • design and construction of facilities (including licensing and authorization, as
                                       appropriate);
                                     • operation and management (including pool safety plan and lifeguard training);
                                     • public education and information; and
                                     • regulatory requirements (including licensing of equipment, chemicals, etc.,
                                       available for use in swimming pools and similar environments).

                            1.6 Nature of the guidelines
                                  A guideline can be a level of management, a concentration of a constituent that does
                                  not represent a significant risk to the health of members of significant user groups,
                                  a condition under which exposures associated with a significant risk are unlikely to
                                  occur, or a combination of the last two. In deriving guidelines including guideline
                                  values, account is taken of both the severity and frequency of associated health out-
                                  comes. Recreational water use areas conforming to the guidelines may, however, pres-
                                  ent a health risk to especially susceptible individuals or to certain user groups.
                                     When a guideline is exceeded, this should be a signal to investigate the cause of
                                  the failure and identify the likelihood of future failure, to liaise with the authority
                                  responsible for public health to determine whether immediate action should be taken

                                to reduce exposure to the hazard, and to determine whether measures should be put
                                in place to prevent or reduce exposure under similar conditions in the future.
                                   For most parameters, there is no clear cut-off value at which health effects are
                                excluded, and the derivation of guidelines and their conversion to standards therefore
                                include an element of valuation addressing the frequency and nature of associated
                                health effects. This valuation process is one in which societal values play an impor-
                                tant role. The conversion of guidelines into national policy, legislation and stan-
                                dards should therefore take account of environmental, social, cultural and economic
                                factors.
                                   Many of the hazards associated with swimming pools and similar recreational water
                                environments may give rise to health effects after short-term exposures: accidents and
                                exposures to microbial infective doses may occur in very short periods of time. Short-
                                term deviations above guideline values or conditions are therefore of importance to
                                health, and measures should be in place to ensure and demonstrate that recreational
                                water environments are continuously safe during periods of actual or potential use.
                                   This volume of the Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments does not

                     Drowning and injury prevention




                               A   number of injuries may result from the use of swimming pools and similar recre-
                                   ational water environments. Prominent among them are:
                                  •   drowning and non-fatal or near-drowning;
                                  •   major impact injuries (spinal, brain and head injuries);
                                  •   slip, trip and fall injuries; and
                                  •   disembowelment.
                                  This chapter addresses these adverse health outcomes, their causation and con-
                               tributory factors, along with evidence concerning preventive measures.

                            2.1 Drowning
                               Drowning has been defined as death arising from impairment of respiratory function
                               as a result of immersion in liquid, and this is the definition employed in these Guide-
                               lines. A wider definition of drowning includes outcomes ranging from no morbidity
                               to morbidity to death (World Congress on Drowning, 2002). Drowning is a major
                               cause of death, and it has been estimated that, in 2002, 382 million people drowned
                               worldwide, with 97% of drownings occurring in low- and middle-income countries
                               (Peden & McGee, 2003; WHO, 2004), although the majority of available data relate
                               to developed countries. It is the third leading cause of death in children aged 1–5 and
                               the leading cause of mortality due to injury, with the mortality rates in male children
                               being almost twice as high as those in female children (Peden & McGee, 2003). Not
                               all drownings are related to recreational water use, and the percentage that is attribut-
                               able to swimming pools and similar environments is likely to vary from country to
                               country.
                                   Overall drowning statistics (i.e. not confined to swimming pools) for the USA,
                               shown in Table 2.1, support the observation from numerous studies that children
                               less than 5 years of age and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24 years have
                               the highest drowning rates (e.g. Blum & Shield, 2000; Browne et al., 2003; Smith,
                               2005).
                                   In the USA, an investigation into drownings in New York State residents (with a
                               population of almost 18 million) between 1988 and 1994 found that there were on
                               average 173 drownings a year (1210 over the seven-year period). A total of 883 non-
                               bathtub drownings that took place in-state were included in the study. Of these, 156
                               (18%) took place in pools or hot tubs (Browne et al., 2003), with domestic pools
                               predominating (123 cases). Almost 60% of drownings in children aged 0–4 years,
                               however, occurred in swimming pools or hot tubs. Analysis of figures from the whole

                         Adapted from National Center for Health Statistics, 1998




                                       of the USA for 2001 reveals similar results, with 18% of fatal drownings occurring
                                       in swimming pools (CDC, 2004). In the State of Arizona, USA, 85% of emergency
                                       calls relating to drownings and near-drownings in children aged four or less were
                                       associated with swimming pools (CDC, 1990). In the United Kingdom, children
                                       are more likely to drown in natural water bodies (sea, lakes, etc.) than in swimming
                                       pools, although pools still account for a substantial proportion of drowning, with
                                       19% of drowning deaths in children aged 0–14 years being attributable to pools
                                       in 1988–1989, and 11% in 1998–1999 (Sibert et al., 2002). These authors note,
                                       however, that at least 14 British children drowned while abroad, with most of these
                                       drownings occurring in hotel or apartment pools.
                                           During a period of over 20 years (since 1980), the USA Consumer Product Safe-
                                       ty Commission (CPSC) has received reports of more than 700 deaths in hot tubs.
                                       Approximately one third of these were drownings of children under five years of age
                                       (CPSC, undated).
                                           Death by drowning is not the sole outcome of distress in the water. Near-drowning is
                                       also a serious problem. One study (Wintemute et al., 1987) found that for every 10 chil-
                                       dren who die by drowning, 140 are treated in emergency rooms and 36 are admitted to
                                       hospitals for further treatment (see also Spyker, 1985; Liller et al., 1993), although some
                                       never recover. In the Netherlands, it has been reported that on average there are about 300
                                       drowning fatalities a year and an additional 450 cases who survive the drowning incident;
                                       of these, 390 are admitted to hospital for further treatment (Bierens, 1996). Browne et
                                       al. (2003) reported that there are on average 173 drownings among New York State resi-
                                       dents every year, and it is estimated that there are 177 non-fatal hospitalizations. Analysis
                                       of data from the USA for 2001–2002 led to the estimation that about 4174 people on
                                       average each year are treated in hospital emergency departments for non-fatal drowning
                                       injuries in recreational water settings, over 65% of these cases occurred in swimming
                                       pools and over 52% were in children under the age of 5 (CDC, 2004).
                                           The recovery rate from near-drowning may be lower among young children than
                                       among teenagers and adults. Some survivors suffer subsequent anoxic encephalopathy
                                       (Pearn et al., 1976; Pearn & Nixon, 1977) leading to long-term neurological deficits
                                       (Quan et al., 1989). Studies show that the prognosis depends more on the effective-
                                       ness of the initial rescue and resuscitation than on the quality of subsequent hospital
                                       care (Cummings & Quan, 1999).

                          2.1.1 Contributory factors
                                Males are more likely to drown than females (Browne et al., 2003; Peden & McGee,
                                2003). This is generally attributed to higher exposure to the aquatic environment and
                                a higher consumption of alcohol (leading to decreased ability to cope and impaired
                                judgement) and their inclination towards higher risk-taking activity (Dietz & Baker,
                                1974; Mackie, 1978; Plueckhahn, 1979; Nichter & Everett, 1989; Quan et al., 1989;
                                Howland et al., 1996).
                                   Alcohol consumption is one of the most frequently reported contributory fac-
                                tors associated with adolescent and adult drownings in many countries (Howland &
                                Hingson, 1988; Levin et al., 1993; Browne et al., 2003; Petridou, 2005). Although
                                the proportion of alcohol-related drownings is often not presented according to body
                                of water (and swimming pools and hot tubs are the site of relatively few adult and
                                adolescent drownings), in one study a blood alcohol screen was positive for approxi-
                                mately 50% of drowning victims over 14 years of age (M. Browne, pers. comm.).
                                Among children, lapses in parental supervision are the most frequently cited con-
                                tributory factor (Quan et al., 1989), although alcohol consumption by the parent or
                                guardian may also play a role in the lapse of supervision (Petridou, 2005).
                                   Browne et al. (2003) examined the means of access of young children involved in do-
                                mestic swimming pool drownings. The following were found to be the most common:
                                   • open or unlocked gate or ineffective latch;
                                   • no fence, no separate fence (completely enclosing the pool area) or fence in
                                     disrepair;
                                   • access directly from the house; and
                                   • ladder to above-ground pool left in accessible ‘down’ position.
                                In this study, 43 of 77 (56%) of the drownings in children aged 0–4 occurred in the
                                child’s family pool, 17 (22%) occurred in the domestic pool of a relative and 8 (10%)
                                occurred in a neighbour’s domestic pool (M. Browne, pers. comm.).
                                   In Australia, a similar study found that more than half of the children studied
                                drowned in unfenced or unsecured pools and hot tubs. Where children gained access
                                to fenced pools, most did so through faulty or inadequate gates or through gates that
                                were propped open (Blum & Shield, 2000). Access has also infrequently been as a
                                result of climbing onto objects next to the pool fence (e.g. pool filters).
                                   While a high proportion of persons drowning are non-swimmers or poor swim-
                                mers (Spyker, 1985), there are conflicting opinions as to the role of swimming skills
                                in preventing drowning and near-drowning (Patetta & Biddinger, 1988; Asher et al.,
                                1995; Brenner, 2005). Hyperventilation before breath-hold swimming and diving has
                                been associated with a number of drownings among individuals, almost exclusively
                                males, with excellent swimming skills. Although hyperventilation makes it possible
                                for a person to extend his or her time under water, it may result in a loss of conscious-
                                ness by lowering the carbon dioxide level in the blood and decreasing the partial oxy-
                                gen pressure in the arterial blood on surfacing (Craig, 1976; Spyker, 1985).
                                   Inlets and outlets where the suction is extremely strong can trap body parts or hair,
                                causing the victim’s head to be held under water. Most accidents involve people with
                                shoulder-length or longer hair. Hair entrapment occurs when the water flow into the
                                inlet takes the bather’s hair into and around the outlet cover, and the hair is pulled
                                into the drain as a result of the suction created. In the USA, during a six and a half

                                  year period, between 1990 and 1996, the CPSC received reports of 49 incidents of
                                  hair entrapment/entanglement in hot tubs, 13 of which resulted in drowning (CPSC,
                                  undated). This suction problem may also occur in the main pool drains of swimming
                                  pools, but to a much lesser extent than with hot tubs.
                                      A number of drowning deaths have also occurred after the body or a limb has
                                  been held against a drain by the suction of the circulation pump. In the USA, CPSC
                                  reported 18 cases of body entrapment over a 20-year period. Ten of these resulted in
                                  disembowelment (see Section 2.5), and five other cases were fatal (CPSC, undated).
                                  Young children, typically between the ages of 8 and 16 years, are particularly likely
                                  to play with open drains, inserting hands or feet into the pipe and then becoming
                                  trapped with the resulting suction. Any open drain or flat grating that the body can
                                  cover completely, combined with a plumbing layout that allows a build-up of suction
                                  if the drain is blocked, presents this hazard.
                                      High temperatures (above 40 °C) in spas or hot tubs, especially in combination
                                  with alcohol consumption, may cause drowsiness, which may lead to unconsciousness
                                  and, consequently, drowning (Press, 1991).
                                      Further contributory factors in drowning and near-drowning include:
                                     • those related to the bather, such as a pre-existing health condition (e.g. seizure
                                       disorder – Ryan & Dowling, 1993);
                                     • those related to the staff, such as lack of proper training for emergency response; and
                                     • those related to the pool facility, such as water depth, water clarity, pool con-
                                       figuration and pool size.
                                     Water clarity is particularly critical to water safety. If it is not possible to see the
                                  bottom of the pool at its deepest point, pool users and lifeguards may not be able to
                                  identify people in distress. In addition, a person entering the pool may not be able to
                                  see someone under the water or may not be able to judge the pool bottom configura-
                                  tion. Natural and artificial reflected light from the water surface may also affect vision
                                  in a similar way to poor water clarity. Swimming pool designers need to consider this
                                  when locating windows and designing lighting systems.

                        2.1.2 Preventive and management actions
                                  It has been estimated that over 80% of all drownings can be prevented, and prevention
                                  is the key management intervention (World Congress on Drowning, 2002; Mackie,
                                  2005). Surprisingly, there is no clear evidence that drowning rates are greater in poor
                                  swimmers (Brenner, 2005), and the value of swimming lessons and water safety in-
                                  struction as drowning preventive measures has not been demonstrated (Patetta & Bid-
                                  dinger, 1988; Mackie, 2005). There is a significant debate regarding the age at which
                                  swimming skills may be safely acquired. The need for adult supervision is not decreased
                                  when young children acquire increased skills, and the possibility that training decreases
                                  parental vigilance has not been assessed (Asher et al., 1995). Lapses in supervision may
                                  make this an insufficient preventive measure alone (Quan et al., 1989).
                                      Children should be taught to stay away from water and pools when unsupervised,
                                  but for outdoor pools, care must also be taken to prevent unauthorized entry (especial-
                                  ly by young children). For domestic pools, barriers such as fences or walls will prevent
                                  some drownings by preventing a child from entering a swimming pool area unsuper-
                                  vised or may delay their entry long enough for the carer to realize they are missing.

                                Installation of isolation fencing around outdoor pools, which separates the pool from
                                the remaining yard and house, has been shown in some studies to decrease the number
                                of drownings and near-drownings by more than 50% (Pearn & Nixon, 1977; Milliner
                                et al., 1980; Present, 1987). In Australia, Blum & Shield (2000) found that in the
                                childhood drowning that they studied, no child had gained unaided access to a pool
                                fitted with a fully functional gate and fence that met the Australian standard. A system-
                                atic review of studies (Thompson & Rivara, 2000) examining the effectiveness of pool
                                fencing indicated that pool fencing significantly reduced the risk of drowning, with
                                isolation fencing (enclosing the pool only) being superior to perimeter fencing (enclos-
                                ing the pool and the property). The results of the review are supported by Stevenson et
                                al. (2003). This study, conducted in Australia, found that during a 12-year period 50
                                children under the age of five drowned in domestic swimming pools and 68% of the
                                drownings occurred in pools that did not have isolation fencing. Pool fences around
                                domestic pools should have a self-closing and self-latching gate and should isolate the
                                pool. Barrier fencing should be at least 1.2 m high and have no hand- or footholds
                                that could enable a young child to climb it. Fence slats should be no more than 10 cm
                                apart to prevent a child squeezing through, thus ensuring that the safety barrier itself is
                                not a hazard. Above-ground pools should have steps or ladders leading to the pool that
                                can be secured and locked to prevent access when the pool is not in use. Care should
                                also be taken to ensure that poolside equipment is not positioned such that it may be
                                used to climb the fence and access the pool. For domestic or outdoor hot tubs, it is
                                recommended that locked safety covers be used when the hot tub is not in use.
                                    Pool alarms and pool covers have not been shown to be reliable preventive measures
                                for very young children. In fact, pool covers may themselves contribute to drowning – if
                                they are not strong enough to hold the child’s weight, the child could slip under the cover
                                and be trapped by it, or the child could drown in small puddles of water formed on their
                                surface. In addition, covers may delay the discovery of a drowning victim.
                                    To prevent entrapment, it is recommended that the velocity of water flowing from
                                the pool through outlets should not exceed 0.5 m/s and there should be a minimum
                                of two outlets to each suction line. Also, they should be sized and located such that
                                they cannot be blocked by the body of a single bather. Grilles in outlets should have
                                gaps of less than 8 mm. In addition, pools and hot tubs should not be used if any of
                                the covers are missing, unsecured or damaged.
                                    The availability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (including infant and
                                child CPR) skills (Patetta & Biddinger, 1988; Orlowski, 1989; Liller et al., 1993;
                                Kyriacou et al., 1994; Pepe & Bierens, 2005) has been reported to be important in
                                determining the outcome of potential drownings.
                                    The principal contributory factors and preventive actions (some of which have
                                received scientific evaluation) concerned with drowning and near-drowning are sum-

                                Data concerning the number of spinal injuries sustained as a result of pool use are not
                                widely available. Stover & Fine (1987) estimated the total prevalence of spinal cord
                                injury in the USA to be around 906 per million, with an annual rate of incidence of
                                around 30 new spinal cord injuries per million persons at risk, and according to the
                                Think First Foundation (2004), USA, 10% of all spinal cord injuries are related to

                     • Locked doors for indoor pools
                     • Locked safety covers for domestic and outdoor hot tubs
                     • Continuous parental/caregiver supervision of children
                     • Provision of properly trained and equipped lifeguards
                     • Teaching children to stay away from water when unsupervised
                     • Education/public awareness that drowning can happen quickly and quietly
                     • Restriction of alcohol provision or supervision where alcohol is likely to be consumed
                     • Suction outlets cannot be sealed by single person, and at least two suction outlets per pump
                     • Accessible emergency shut-off for pump
                     • Grilles/pipes on drain gates preclude hair entrapment
                     • Wearing bathing caps
                     • Maintaining water temperature in hot tubs below 40 °C
                     • Access to emergency services

                                  diving into water. In Ontario, Canada, Tator & Edmonds (1986) report that between
                                  1948 and 1983, diving accounted for 58.9% of all recreational-related spinal cord
                                  injury – 60 major spinal injuries each year.
                                     Blanksby et al. (1997) tabulated data from a series of studies concerning diving
                                  accidents as the cause of acute spinal injury in various regions of the world. In one
                                  study (Steinbruck & Paeslack, 1980), 212 of 2587 spinal cord injuries were sports
                                  related, 139 of which were associated with water sports, the majority (62%) with div-
                                  ing. Diving-related injuries were found to be responsible for between 3.8% and 14%
                                  of traumatic spinal cord injuries in a comparison of French, Australian, English and
                                  American studies (Minaire et al., 1983), for 2.3% in a South African study and for
                                  21% in a Polish study (Blanksby et al., 1997).
                                     In diving incidents of all types, spinal injuries are almost exclusively located in the
                                  cervical vertebrae (Minaire et al., 1983; Blanksby et al., 1997). Statistics such as those
                                  cited above therefore underestimate the importance of these injuries, which typically
                                  cause quadriplegia (paralysis affecting all four limbs) or, less commonly, paraplegia
                                  (paralysis of both legs). In Australia, for example, diving incidents account for ap-
                                  proximately 20% of all cases of quadriplegia (Hill, 1984). The financial cost of these
                                  injuries to society is high, because persons affected are frequently healthy young peo-
                                  ple, typically males under 25 years of age (DeVivo & Sekar, 1997).

                          2.2.1 Contributory factors
                                Data from the USA suggest that diving into the upslope of a pool bottom or shallow
                                water is the most common cause of spinal injuries in pools. Diving or jumping from
                                trees, balconies and other structures is particularly dangerous, as are special dives such
                                as the swan or swallow dive, because the arms are not outstretched above the head but
                                are to the side of the body (Steinbruck & Paeslack, 1980). Familiarity with the pool may
                                not necessarily be protective; in one study from South Africa (Mennen, 1981), it was
                                noted that the typical injurious dive is into a water body known to the individual.
                                    Minimum depths for safe diving are greater than is frequently perceived, but the
                                role played by water depth has been debated. Inexperienced or unskilled divers re-
                                quire greater depths for safe diving. The velocities reached from ordinary dives are
                                such that the sight of the bottom, even in clear water, may provide an inadequate time
                                for deceleration response (Yanai et al., 1996).
                                    Most diving injuries occur in relatively shallow water (1.5 m or less) and few in
                                very shallow water (i.e. less than 0.6 m), where the hazard may be more obvious (Ga-
                                brielsen, 1988; Branche et al., 1991). In a sample of 341 persons with spinal injuries
                                resulting from swimming pool incidents, over half of the injuries occurred when the
                                individuals dived into less than 1.2 m of water (DeVivo & Sekar, 1997).
                                    Alcohol consumption may contribute significantly to the frequency of injury, through
                                diminished mental faculties and poor judgement (Howland et al., 1996; Blanksby et
                                al., 1997). Young males appear to be more likely to experience spinal injury; in the
                                study by DeVivo & Sekar (1997), 86% of the 341 persons with spinal injuries result-
                                ing from swimming pool incidents were men, with an average age of 24 years. A lack
                                of signage may also be a contributory factor. In the same study, almost all the injuries
                                (87%) occurred in private/domestic pools; depth indicators were not present in 75% of
                                cases, and there were no warning signs in 87% of cases (DeVivo & Sekar, 1997).
                                    A proportion of spinal injuries will lead to death by drowning. While data on this
                                are scarce, it does not appear to be common (see, for example, EEA/WHO, 1999).
                                The act of rescue from drowning may also exacerbate spinal cord trauma after the
                                initial impact (Mennen, 1981; Blanksby et al., 1997) because of the movements of
                                the spine during the rescue technique.

                          2.2.2 Preventive and management actions
                                The principal contributory factors and preventive actions for spinal cord injuries are
                                summarized in Table 2.3. Evidence suggests that diving technique and education are im-
                                portant in injury prevention (Perrine et al., 1994; Blanksby et al., 1997), and preventive
                                programmes can be effective. In Ontario, for example, the establishment of preventive
                                programmes by Sportsmart Canada and widespread education decreased the incidence
                                of water-related injuries substantially between 1989 and 1992 (Tator et al., 1993).
                                   Because of the young age of many injured persons, awareness raising and educa-
                                tion regarding safe behaviours are required early in life. Many countries have school-
                                age swimming instruction that may inadequately stress safe diving, but which may
                                provide a forum for increased public safety (Damjan & Turk, 1995). Education and
                                awareness raising appear to offer the most potential for diving injury prevention, in
                                part because some people have been found to take little notice of posted signs and
                                regulations (Hill, 1984) in isolation.

                     Contributory factors
                     • Diving into a shallow pool or the shallow end of a pool
                     • Diving into a pool of unknown depth

                     • General public (user) awareness of depth hazards and safe behaviours
                     • Early education in diving hazards and safe behaviours/diving instruction
                     • Restriction of alcohol provision or supervision where alcohol is likely to be consumed
                     • Poolside wall markings
                     • Access to emergency services




                            2.3 Brain and head injuries
                                  Impact on the skull and injuries to the head, including scalp and facial abrasions and
                                  breaks, have been associated with swimming pools and similar environments and may
                                  result in permanent neurological disability, as well as disfigurement. The contributory
                                  factors and preventive and management actions are similar to those for spinal injuries and
                                  for limb and minor impact injuries and are summarized in Table 2.3 and Table 2.4.

                            2.4 Fractures, dislocations, other impact injuries, cuts and lesions
                                  Arm, hand, leg and foot/toe injuries have occurred from a variety of activities in pools
                                  and their immediate surroundings. Expert opinion suggests that these incidents are
                                  common and generally go unreported. Slippery decks, uneven pavements, uncovered
                                  drains and exposed pool spouts may cause injuries to pool users. Reckless water en-
                                  tries, such as jumping onto others in the pool from poolside or from dive boards on
                                  the pool deck, jumping into shallow water, running on decks and water slide-related
                                  incidents (see Section 2.7), may also result in injury. Slip, trip and fall accidents may
                                  be the result of swimming aids, such as rings, floats, etc., left around the pool area.
                                  There are reports of injuries sustained as a result of stepping on glass, broken bottles
                                  and cans. Banning of glass containers and use of alternative materials for drinks in the
                                  pool and hot tub area will minimize these types of injuries.
                                      Maintenance of surfaces, supervision of pool users, providing appropriate warn-
                                  ings, improved pool design and construction, ensuring good underwater visibility and
                                  pool safety education are among the actions that can reduce these incidents. Table 2.4
                                  provides examples of some of the factors that contribute to impact injuries and associ-
                                  ated preventive and management actions.

                            2.5 Disembowelment
                                In addition to hair and body entrapment resulting in drowning (Section 2.1.1), there
                                have been reports of incidents in which the suction from the pool or spa drain has
                                pulled intestines out of the body (Hultman & Morgan, 1994; Porter et al., 1997;
                                Gomez-Juarez et al., 2001). In the USA, for example, 18 incidents of evisceration/dis-
                                embowelment were reported to the CPSC during a 20-year period (CPSC, undated).
                                In the UK, a six-year-old girl suffered a rectal prolapse after being sucked onto a
                                swimming pool drain from which the cover had been removed (Davison & Puntis,
                                2003). The drain, which was located on the second of the steps giving access to the
                                water, had not been recovered after cleaning.
                                    The drain covers in pools and hot tubs can become brittle and crack, or they may
                                become loose or go missing. If a person sits on a broken cover or uncovered drain,
                                the resulting suction force can cause disembowelment. This is a particular hazard for
                                young children in shallow pools.
                                    Preventive measures are similar to those against entrapment leading to drowning
                                (see Table 2.2). It is uncertain if reduced vacuum (e.g. through multiple outlets and a
                                maximum velocity – see Section 2.1.2) is as effective against disembowelment injuries
                                as it is against drowning, since these occur almost immediately at a small pressure dif-
                                ferential. It is recommended that drain covers be designed to avoid the possibility of
                                disembowelment by, for example, having no openings on the top, with the water enter-
                                ing the drain through a series of openings on the side.

                            2.6 Hazards associated with temperature extremes
                                Water ranging in temperature from 26 to 30 °C is comfortable for most swimmers
                                throughout prolonged periods of moderate physical exertion. The comfortable upper
                                limit of water temperature for recreational immersion varies from individual to indi-
                                vidual and seems to depend on psychological rather than physiological considerations.

                                      Body overheating can occur in natural spas and hot tubs, where water tempera-
                                  tures may be above 40 °C. High temperatures can cause drowsiness, which may lead
                                  to unconsciousness (especially when associated with alcohol consumption), resulting
                                  in drowning (Press, 1991; see Section 2.1). In addition, high temperatures can lead
                                  to heat stroke and death (CPSC, undated). The CPSC has received reports of several
                                  deaths from extremely hot water (approximately 43 °C) in hot tubs (CPSC, undated).
                                  It is recommended that water temperatures in hot tubs be kept below 40 °C.
                                      Plunge pools present similar problems, but at the other temperature extreme.
                                  These small, deep pools generally contain water at a temperature of 8–10 °C and are
                                  used in conjunction with saunas or steam baths. Adverse health outcomes that may
                                  result from the intense and sudden changes in temperature associated with the use
                                  of these pools include immediate impaired coordination, loss of control of breathing
                                  and, after some time when the core body temperature has fallen, slowed heart beat,
                                  hypothermia, muscle cramps and loss of consciousness.
                                      In general, exposure to temperature extremes should be avoided by pregnant
                                  women, users with medical problems and young children, and prolonged immersion
                                  in hot tubs or other pools with high or low temperatures should be avoided or ap-
                                  proached with caution.
                                      Educational displays and warning signs, warnings from lifeguards and pool staff,
                                  regulations on time limits for exposure and limiting use by people with medical con-
                                  ditions are some examples of preventive actions for hazards associated with tempera-
                                  ture extremes (see Table 2.5). Further information on this subject is given in Volume
                                  1 of the Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments (WHO, 2003).

                     preventive and management actions
                     Contributory factors
                     • Cold plunge when not conditioned
                     • Prolonged immersion in hot water
                     Preventive and management actions
                     • Supervision
                     • Signage, including time limits for exposure
                     • A maximum temperature of 40 °C for hot tubs
                     • Gradual immersion
                     • Medical recommendations for pregnant women, people with medical conditions
                     • Limitation of alcohol intake prior to use of hot tubs




                            2.7 Injuries associated with ‘feature pools’
                                  Pools may contain features that present their own particular requirements to ensure
                                  safe use. Water slides add excitement but may present physical hazards, particularly
                                  where riders go down in pairs, too close to each other or headfirst; or where riders
                                  stop, slow down or stand up on the slide. Failure to leave the area immediately after
                                  arriving from the slide may also present physical hazards. In the USA, CDC reported

                                injuries relating to the use of a water slide (CDC, 1984). The slide consisted of two
                                fibreglass tubes, 1.2 m wide and over 100 m in length. In a six-week period, 65
                                people were injured while using the slide and sought medical care. Injuries included
                                fractures, concussions, bruises and abrasions and sprains and strains. This included
                                nine spinal fractures.
                                   Wave machines may provide a higher level of excitement and also often increased
                                bather load. Extra vigilance is needed by lifeguards and bathers alike. The possibility
                                exists for entrapment of limbs in wave machine chambers; therefore, all parts of the
                                wave machine should be enclosed by a guard. As grilles must be large enough to allow
                                water flow, adequate supervision to prevent users holding onto the grilles, when the
                                waves are in action, may also be necessary.
                                   In-water features may also present a physical hazard, as they may be slippery or
                                encourage climbing, falls from which could injure the climber or other user. Design
                                issues, user awareness and education are important considerations in feature pools.

                     CHAPTER 3
                     Microbial hazards




                            A    variety of microorganisms can be found in swimming pools and similar recre-
                                 ational water environments, which may be introduced in a number of ways.
                                In many cases, the risk of illness or infection has been linked to faecal contamina-
                            tion of the water. The faecal contamination may be due to faeces released by bathers or
                            a contaminated source water or, in outdoor pools, may be the result of direct animal
                            contamination (e.g. from birds and rodents). Faecal matter is introduced into the water
                            when a person has an accidental faecal release – AFR (through the release of formed
                            stool or diarrhoea into the water) or residual faecal material on swimmers’ bodies is
                            washed into the pool (CDC, 2001a). Many of the outbreaks related to swimming
                            pools would have been prevented or reduced if the pool had been well managed.
                                Non-faecal human shedding (e.g. from vomit, mucus, saliva or skin) in the swim-
                            ming pool or similar recreational water environments is a potential source of patho-
                            genic organisms. Infected users can directly contaminate pool or hot tub waters and
                            the surfaces of objects or materials at a facility with pathogens (notably viruses or
                            fungi), which may lead to skin infections in other patrons who come in contact with
                            the contaminated water or surfaces. ‘Opportunistic pathogens’ (notably bacteria) can
                            also be shed from users and transmitted via surfaces and contaminated water.
                                Some bacteria, most notably non-faecally-derived bacteria (see Section 3.4), may
                            accumulate in biofilms and present an infection hazard. In addition, certain free-
                            living aquatic bacteria and amoebae can grow in pool, natural spa or hot tub waters,
                            in pool or hot tub components or facilities (including heating, ventilation and air-
                            conditioning [HVAC] systems) or on other wet surfaces within the facility to a point
                            at which some of them may cause a variety of respiratory, dermal or central nervous
                            system infections or diseases. Outdoor pools may also be subject to microorganisms
                            derived directly from pets and wildlife.
                                This chapter describes illness and infection associated with microbial contamina-
                            tion of swimming pools, natural spas and hot tubs. The sections reflect the origin of
                            the microbial contaminant, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. In each case, a short subsec-
                            tion on risk assessment and risk management is given, although general management
                            strategies for managing air and water quality are described in detail in Chapter 5.
                                In most cases, monitoring for potential microbial hazards is done using indicator
                            microorganisms (rather than specific microbial pathogens), which are easy to enu-
                            merate and would be expected to be present in greater numbers than pathogens. The
                            traditional role of indicator parameters was to show the presence or absence of faecal
                            pollution in water supplies. The criteria associated with microbial indicators of pollu-
                            tion are outlined in Box 3.1 and further discussed in WHO (2004). The use of these
                            microorganisms in monitoring water quality is covered in Chapter 5.

                              SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS
                     • The indicator should be absent in unpolluted environments and present when the source of patho-
                       genic microorganisms of concern is present (e.g. faecal material).
                     • The indicator should not multiply in the environment.
                     • The indicator should be present in greater numbers than the pathogenic microorganisms.
                     • The indicator should respond to natural environmental conditions and water treatment processes
                       in a manner similar to the pathogens of concern.
                     • The indicator should be easy to isolate, identify and enumerate.
                     • Indicator tests should be inexpensive, thereby permitting numerous samples to be taken (if ap-
                       propriate).

                     Microorganisms that are used to assess the microbial quality of swimming pool and similar environ-
                     ments include heterotrophic plate count – HPC (a general measure of non-specific microbial levels),
                     faecal indicators (such as thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
                     aureus and Legionella spp. HPC, thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli are indicators in the strict sense
                     of the definition.

                     As health risks in pools and similar environments may be faecal or non-faecal in origin, both fae-
                     cal indicators and non-faecally-derived microorganisms (e.g. P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Legionella
                     spp.) should be examined. Faecal indicators are used to monitor for the possible presence of faecal
                     contamination; HPC, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella spp. can be used to examine growth, and
                     Staphylococcus aureus can be used to determine non-faecal shedding. The absence of these organ-
                     isms, however, does not guarantee safety, as some pathogens are more resistant to treatment than the
                     indicators, and there is no perfect indicator organism.

                            3.1 Faecally-derived viruses
                          3.1.1 Hazard identification
                                The viruses that have been linked to swimming pool outbreaks are shown in
                                Table 3.1. Viruses cannot multiply in water, and therefore their presence must be a
                                consequence of pollution. Some adenoviruses may also be shed from eyes and the
                                throat and are responsible for swimming pool conjunctivitis.
                                   Viruses of six types (rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus and
                                hepatitis A virus) are all shed following infection. Clinical data show that rotaviruses
                                are by far the most prevalent cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, and noroviruses
                                cause the most cases of viral diarrhoea in adults. However, few waterborne pool out-
                                breaks have been associated with these agents. Although outbreaks are highlighted, it
                                should be kept in mind that non-outbreak disease is likely to occur and that virus-as-
                                sociated pool or hot tub outbreaks are very uncommon. Even when outbreaks are
                                detected, the evidence linking the outbreak to the pool is generally circumstantial. In
                                the outbreaks summarized in Table 3.1, the etiological agents were detected in the
                                water in only two cases (D’Angelo et al., 1979; Papapetropoulou & Vantarakis, 1998).

                          3.1.2 Outbreaks of viral illness associated with pools
                             1. Adenovirus-related outbreaks
                                There are over 50 types of adenoviruses (Hunter, 1997), and while some may cause
                                enteric infections and are therefore shed in faeces, they are also associated with respi-
                                ratory and ocular symptoms and non-faecally-derived transmission. Types 40 and 41
                                cause gastroenteritis in young children, but there is no documented association with
                                waterborne transmission.
                                   Foy et al. (1968) reported an outbreak of pharyngo-conjunctival fever caused by
                                adenovirus type 3. The infection occurred in two children’s swimming teams after
                                exposure to unchlorinated swimming pool water. The attack rates in the two teams
                                were 65% and 67%, respectively. The main symptoms were fever, pharyngitis and
                                conjunctivitis. The virus could not be isolated from the pool water. The authors spec-
                                ulated that faecal contamination of the unchlorinated swimming pool water could
                                have been the source of the contamination.
                                   Caldwell et al. (1974) reported an outbreak of conjunctivitis associated with ad-
                                enovirus type 7 in seven members of a community swimming team. The main symp-
                                toms were associated with the eyes. An investigation of the pool-related facilities sug-
                                gested that the school swimming pool was the source of the infection, as both the
                                pool chlorinator and pool filter had failed. The outbreak was brought under control
                                by raising the pool’s free residual chlorine level above 0.3 mg/l.
                                   Adenovirus type 4 was the causative agent of a swimming pool-related outbreak of
                                pharyngo-conjunctivitis reported by D’Angelo et al. (1979). A total of 72 cases were
                                identified. Adenovirus type 4 was isolated from 20 of 26 swab specimens. The virus
                                was also detected in samples of pool water. An investigation showed that inadequate
                                levels of chlorine had been added to the pool water, resulting in no free chlorine
                                in pool water samples. Adequate chlorination and closing the pool for the summer
                                stopped the outbreak of illness.

                                       A second outbreak in the same locality and year was linked to adenovirus type 3
                                   and swimming activity (Martone et al., 1980). Based on surveys, at least 105 cases
                                   were identified. The illness was characterized by sore throat, fever, headache and an-
                                   orexia. Conjunctivitis affected only 34 of the individuals. Use of a swimming pool
                                   was linked to the illness. The outbreak coincided with a temporary defect in the pool
                                   filter system and probably improper maintenance of chlorine levels. The authors sus-
                                   pected that the level of free chlorine in the pool water was less than 0.4 mg/l. They
                                   also pointed out that while the virus was probably transmitted through water, person-
                                   to-person transmission could not be ruled out.
                                       In 1987, an outbreak of adenovirus type 7a infection was associated with a swim-
                                   ming pool (Turner et al., 1987). Seventy-seven individuals were identified with the
                                   symptoms of pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx). A telephone survey indi-
                                   cated that persons who swam at the community swimming pool were more likely to
                                   be ill than those who did not. Swimmers who reported swallowing water were more

                               likely to be ill than those who did not. Further investigation showed that the pool
                               chlorinator had reportedly malfunctioned during the period when the outbreak oc-
                               curred. The outbreak ceased when proper chlorination was reinstated.
                                  An outbreak of pharyngo-conjunctivitis caused by adenoviruses occurred among
                               swimmers participating in a competition. Over 80 people were found to be suffering
                               from symptoms. Adenoviruses were identified in swimming pool samples using nested
                               polymerase chain reaction, and poor chlorination (residual chlorine levels <0.2 mg/l) was
                               considered to have contributed to the outbreak (Papapetropoulou & Vantarakis, 1998).
                                  In 2000, an outbreak of illness related to adenovirus type 3 was detected. It was
                               found that there was a strong association between the presence of symptoms and
                               swimming at a school camp. Although adenoviruses were not isolated from the pool
                               water, inspection of the pool revealed that it was poorly maintained and inadequately
                               chlorinated (Harley et al., 2001).

                            2. Hepatitis A-related outbreaks
                                   Solt et al. (1994) reported an outbreak in Hungary in which 31 children were hos-
                               pitalized following hepatitis A infection. Investigation of potential common sources
                               eliminated food, drink and person-to-person transmission. All of the patients had
                               reported swimming at a summer camp swimming pool. Further investigation dis-
                               covered 25 additional cases. All of the cases were males between the ages of 5 and
                               17 years. The pool, which was not chlorinated, was half full of water for a period and
                               was used by younger children. The pool was generally overcrowded during the month
                               of August. It was concluded that the crowded conditions and generally poor hygienic
                               conditions contributed to the outbreak.
                                   An outbreak of hepatitis A in several states in the USA during 1989, which may
                               have been associated with a public swimming pool, was reported by Mahoney et al.
                               (1992). Twenty of 822 campers developed hepatitis A infections. Case–control stud-
                               ies indicated that swimmers or those who used a specific hot tub were more likely than
                               controls to become ill. It was hypothesized that a cross-connection between a sewage
                               line and the pool water intake line may have been responsible for the outbreak or that
                               one of the swimmers may have contaminated the water. The disinfectant levels in the
                               pools met local standards.

                            3. Norovirus-related outbreaks
                                   Few outbreaks of norovirus-related disease (previously known as Norwalk virus or
                               Norwalk-like viruses) associated with swimming pools have been reported. Kappus et
                               al. (1982) reported an outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis associated with a swimming
                               pool that affected 103 individuals. The illness typically lasted 24 h and was characterized
                               by vomiting and cramping. Serological studies suggested that norovirus was the cause
                               of the gastroenteritis among the swimmers. Case–control studies indicated that swim-
                               mers were more likely than non-swimmers to become ill. Similarly, the attack rate was
                               significantly higher in swimmers who had swallowed water than in those who had not.
                               The pool chlorinator had not been reconnected before the outbreak, which occurred at
                               the beginning of the swimming season. The source of the virus was not found.
                                   Maunula et al. (2004) reported an outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with no-
                               rovirus contracted from a wading pool in Helsinki, Finland. Norovirus and astrovirus
                               were isolated from water samples taken from the pool. The pool was heavily used

                     30                                            GUIDELINES FOR SAFE RECREATIONAL WATER ENVIRONMENTS

                                  during the summer months (with as many as 500 bathers a day) and was manually
                                  chlorinated three times a week. There was no routine monitoring of free chlorine. It
                                  is believed that the pool had been heavily contaminated with human faecal material,
                                  with the contamination apparently being carried from the public toilets, situated very
                                  close to the pool, which were found to be grossly contaminated (although a number
                                  of nappies were also found at the bottom of the pool during the cleaning operation).
                                  The pool was emptied and cleaned and subsequently fitted with continuous filtration
                                  and chlorination.
                                      Yoder et al. (2004) reported two outbreaks of norovirus infection that were associ-
                                  ated with swimming pools in the USA between 2000 and 2002, one of which was
                                  associated with a hotel pool and hot tub, but gave no other details.
                                      CDC (2004) reported an outbreak of gastroenteritis in children, whose only com-
                                  mon exposure was attendance at a swimming club the previous weekend. Fifty-three
                                  people reported illness, and norovirus was isolated from a number of cases. An unde-
                                  tected accidental faecal release was suspected, and poor pool water quality monitoring
                                  and maintenance contributed to the outbreak.

                            4. Enterovirus-related outbreaks
                                     Enteroviruses include polioviruses, echoviruses and coxsackieviruses types A and
                                  B. The only documented case of enterovirus infection following pool exposure was
                                  associated with echovirus, as reported by Kee et al. (1994). Thirty-three bathers had
                                  symptoms of vomiting, diarrhoea and headache shortly after swimming in an outdoor
                                  swimming pool. The outbreak is believed to have been caused by a bather who swam
                                  while ill and vomited into the pool. Individuals who had swallowed water were more
                                  likely to become ill than those who had not. Echovirus 30 was isolated from the
                                  case who had vomited and from six other cases. Proper disinfectant levels had been
                                  maintained at the pool, but they were inadequate to contain the risk of infection from
                                  vomit in the pool water.

                        3.1.3 Risk assessment
                                  Determination of polluted pool water as the unequivocal cause of a viral disease
                                  outbreak requires the detection of the virus in a water sample. This is clearly not a
                                  routine procedure, but is something that is done in response to a suspected disease
                                  outbreak. Concentration techniques for viruses in water are available (e.g. SCA, 1995
                                  and reviewed by Wyn-Jones & Sellwood, 2001), which may be adapted to pool water
                                  samples. Some agents (e.g. enteroviruses) may be detected in cell culture, but most
                                  (e.g. adenoviruses 40 and 41 and noroviruses) require molecular detection methods.
                                  If the virus has remained in contact with water containing free disinfectant for some
                                  time, then detection of infectious virus may not be possible.
                                      Enteric viruses occur in high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals. Hepa-
                                  titis A virus has been found at densities of 1010 per gram (Coulepis et al., 1980), and
                                  noroviruses have been estimated at 1011 per gram, although echoviruses may reach
                                  only 106 per gram. Given the high densities at which some viruses can be shed by
                                  infected individuals, it is not surprising that accidental faecal releases into swimming
                                  pools and hot tubs can lead to high attack rates in pools where outbreaks occur, espe-
                                  cially if the faecal release is undetected or detected but not responded to adequately.

                             1. Adenoviruses
                                Most adenoviruses can be grown in commonly available cell cultures, with the excep-
                                tion of types 40 and 41, which may be detected by molecular biological techniques,
                                principally by the polymerase chain reaction – PCR (Kidd et al., 1996). Types 40 and
                                41 are those usually associated with gastroenteritis. Other types, though more usually
                                associated with infections of the eyelids and/or throat (pharyngo-conjunctival fever),
                                may also be shed in the faeces for extended periods (Fox et al., 1969). The attack rate
                                for swimming pool outbreaks linked to adenovirus serotypes is moderately high, rang-
                                ing from 18% to 52% (Martone et al., 1980; Turner et al., 1987).

                             2. Hepatitis A virus
                                Culture of hepatitis A virus is generally impractical, and detection relies on molecular
                                methods (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction – RT-PCR). The virus is
                                transmitted by the faecal–oral route, with water and sewage being a frequent source of
                                infection. The disease has an incubation period of 15–50 days, anorexia, nausea, vom-
                                iting and often jaundice being the common symptoms. Virus is shed before the onset
                                of symptoms. The attack rate in one outbreak of illness associated with a swimming
                                pool ranged from 1.2% to 6.1% in swimmers less than 18 years of age (Mahoney et
                                al., 1992).

                             3. Noroviruses
                                Environmental detection of these agents is restricted to RT-PCR since there is no
                                cell culture system available. Symptoms occur within 48 h of exposure and include
                                diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and fever. Virus shedding, as detected by electron micros-
                                copy, stops soon after onset of symptoms, but is detectable by RT-PCR for up to five
                                days. Attack rates are generally very high; Kappus et al. (1982), for example, reported
                                an attack rate of 71% for those swimmers who had swallowed water.

                             4. Enteroviruses
                                Coxsackieviruses are frequently found in polluted waters, and vaccine poliovirus is
                                also found where there is a high percentage of individuals immunized (although no
                                investigations have been reported where this has been found in pool water). Echovi-
                                ruses are found less often. None of the enteroviruses commonly cause gastroenteritis
                                in the absence of other disease, and, although they are associated with a wide variety
                                of symptoms, most infections are asymptomatic.

                          3.1.4 Risk management
                                The control of viruses in swimming pool water and similar environments is usually
                                accomplished by proper treatment, including the application of disinfectants. Epi-
                                sodes of gross contamination of a swimming pool due to an accidental faecal release or
                                vomit from an infected person cannot be effectively controlled by normal disinfectant
                                levels. The only approach to maintaining public health protection under conditions
                                of an accidental faecal release or vomit is to prevent the use of the pool until the
                                contaminants are inactivated (see Chapter 5). The education of parents/caregivers
                                of small children and other water users about good hygienic behaviour at swimming
                                pools is another approach that may prove to be useful for improving health safety at

                                  swimming pools and the reduction of accidental faecal releases. It is recommended
                                  that people with gastroenteritis should not use public or semi-public pools and hot
                                  tubs while ill or for at least a week after their illness, in order to avoid transmitting the
                                  illness to other pool or hot tub users.

                            3.2 Faecally-derived bacteria
                        3.2.1 Hazard identification
                                  Shigella species and Escherichia coli O157 are two related bacteria that have been
                                  linked to outbreaks of illness associated with swimming in pools or similar environ-
                                  ments. Shigella has been responsible for outbreaks related to artificial ponds and other
                                  small bodies of water where water movement has been very limited. The lack of water
                                  movement means that these water bodies behave very much as if they were swimming
                                  pools, except that chlorination or other forms of disinfection are not being used.
                                  Similar non-pool outbreaks have been described for E. coli O157, although there have
                                  also been two outbreaks reported where the source was a children’s paddling pool.
                                  These outbreaks are summarized in Table 3.2, as they illustrate the potential risk that
                                  might be experienced in swimming pools under similar conditions, although only the
                                  pool specific outbreaks are covered in detail.

                        3.2.2 Outbreaks of bacterial illness associated with pools
                             1. Shigella-related outbreaks
                                  An outbreak of shigellosis associated with a fill-and-drain wading pool (filled on a
                                  daily basis with potable water) was reported from Iowa, USA (CDC, 2001b). The
                                  pool, which had a maximum depth of 35 cm, was frequented by very young and non-
                                  toilet-trained children. The pool had neither recirculation nor disinfection. One pool
                                  sample was found to contain thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli. Sixty-nine people
                                  were considered to be infected with shigellosis, of which 26 cases were laboratory
                                  confirmed as S. sonnei. It is thought that the transmission of shigellosis over several
                                  days may have been a result of residual contaminated water present after draining and
                                  people with diarrhoea visiting the pool on subsequent days.

                             2. E. coli O157-related outbreaks
                                  In 1992, an outbreak of E. coli O157 infection was epidemiologically and clinically
                                  linked to a collapsible children’s paddling pool (Brewster et al., 1994). Six cases of
                                  diarrhoea, including one case of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and one asymptom-
                                  atic case were identified. E. coli O157 phage type 59 was isolated from the six cases.
                                  The pool had not been drained or disinfected over the three-day period surrounding
                                  the outbreak. It was believed that the pool had been initially contaminated by a child
                                  known to have diarrhoea.
                                      In 1993, six children with haemorrhagic colitis, three of whom developed haemo-
                                  lytic uraemic syndrome, were epidemiologically linked to a disinfected public pad-
                                  dling pool (Hildebrand et al., 1996). E. coli O157 phage type 2 was isolated from
                                  faecal specimens of five cases. E. coli (but not E. coli O157) was detected in the pool
                                  during the investigation. Free chlorine levels in the pool were less than 1 mg/l at the
                                  time of sampling.

                          3.2.3 Risk assessment
                                    Shigella species are small, non-motile, Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods. They
                                    ferment glucose but not lactose, with the production of acid but not gas. Symptoms as-
                                    sociated with shigellosis include diarrhoea, fever and nausea. The incubation period for
                                    shigellosis is 1–3 days. The infection usually lasts for 4–7 days and is self-limiting.
                                        E. coli O157 are small, motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, facultatively
                                    anaerobic rods. They ferment glucose and lactose. Unlike most E. coli, E. coli O157
                                    does not produce glucuronidase, nor does it grow well at 44.5 °C. E. coli O157 causes
                                    non-bloody diarrhoea, which can progress to bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic urae-
                                    mic syndrome. Other symptoms include vomiting and fever in more severe cases. The
                                    usual incubation period is 3–4 days, but longer periods are not uncommon. In most
                                    instances, the illness typically resolves itself in about a week. About 5–10% of indi-
                                    viduals develop haemolytic uraemic syndrome following an E. coli O157 infection.
                                    Haemolytic uraemic syndrome, characterized by haemolytic anaemia and acute renal
                                    failure, occurs most frequently in infants, young children and elderly people.
                                        Individuals infected with E. coli O157 shed these bacteria at similar or slightly
                                    higher densities than the non-enterohaemorrhagic Shigella. Literature reports indicate
                                    that E. coli O157 is known to be shed at densities as high as 108 per gram. Shigella spe-
                                    cies are shed at similar but somewhat lower levels by individuals who have contracted
                                    shigellosis (Table 3.3).

                                     The infective dose for Shigella species is usually between 10 and 100 organisms
                                  (Table 3.3). Lower doses, however, may cause illness in infants, the elderly or immu-
                                  nocompromised individuals. The infective dose for E. coli O157 is unknown but is
                                  likely to be similar to that for Shigella species. Keene et al. (1994) suggested that the
                                  infective dose is very low, based on experience in an outbreak.

                        3.2.4 Risk management
                                  One of the primary risk management interventions is to reduce accidental faecal
                                  release occurrence in the first place – for example, by educating pool users. E. coli O157
                                  and Shigella species are readily controlled by chlorine and other disinfectants under
                                  ideal conditions. However, if an accidental faecal release has occurred in a swimming
                                  pool or hot tub, it is likely that these organisms will not be instantly eliminated, and
                                  other steps will have to be taken to provide time for disinfectant effect, such as evacu-
                                  ation of the pool (see Chapter 5).

                            3.3 Faecally-derived protozoa
                        3.3.1 Hazard identification
                                  Giardia and particularly Cryptosporidium spp. are faecally-derived protozoa that have
                                  been linked to outbreaks of illness in swimming pools and similar environments.
                                  These two organisms are similar in a number of respects. They have a cyst or oocyst
                                  form that is highly resistant to both environmental stress and disinfectants, they have
                                  a low infective dose and they are shed in high densities by infected individuals. There
                                  have been a number of outbreaks of disease attributed to these pathogens, as sum-
                                  marized in Table 3.4.

                        3.3.2 Outbreaks of protozoan illness associated with pools
                             1. Giardia-related outbreaks
                                  Giardiasis has been associated with swimming pools and water slides. In 1994, a case–
                                  control study was conducted in the United Kingdom to determine the risk factors
                                  for giardiasis. Giardiasis cases were identified from disease surveillance reports over
                                  a one-year period (Gray et al., 1994). Seventy-four cases and 108 matched controls
                                  were identified. Analysis of the data indicated that swimming appeared to be an in-
                                  dependent risk factor for giardiasis. Other recreational exposures and ingestion of po-
                                  tentially contaminated water were found to be not significantly related to giardiasis.
                                     In 1984, a case of giardiasis was reported in a child who had participated in an
                                  infant and toddler swim class in Washington State, USA (Harter et al., 1984). The
                                  identification of this case of giardiasis led to a stool survey of 70 of the class partici-
                                  pants. The stool survey revealed a 61% prevalence of Giardia infection. None of the
                                  non-swimming playmates was positive. Eight of 23 children (35%) exposed only at
                                  a better maintained pool to which the classes had been moved four weeks prior to
                                  the survey were positive. The investigators did not find any evidence of transmission
                                  to non-swim-class pool users. Adequate chlorine levels were maintained in the pool.
                                  Contamination of the pool was thought to be due to an undetected accidental faecal
                                  release.

                     Adequate treatment – in terms of indicator bacteria monitoring results



                                        In the autumn of 1985, an outbreak of giardiasis occurred among several swim-
                                    ming groups at an indoor pool in north-east New Jersey, USA (Porter et al., 1988).
                                    Nine clinical cases were identified, eight of whom had Giardia-positive stool speci-
                                    mens. All were female, seven were adults (>18 years), and two were children. A 39%
                                    attack rate was observed for the group of women who had exposure on one day. These
                                    cases had no direct contact with children or other risk factors for acquiring Giardia.
                                    Infection most likely occurred following ingestion of swimming pool water contami-
                                    nated with Giardia cysts. The source of Giardia contamination was a child who had a
                                    faecal accident in the pool, who was a member of the group that swam the same day
                                    as the women’s swimming group. A stool survey of the child’s group showed that of 20
                                    people tested, 8 others were positive for Giardia. Pool records showed that no chlorine
                                    measurements had been taken on the day of the accidental faecal release and that no
                                    free chlorine level was detectable on the following day.
                                        In 1988, an outbreak of giardiasis was associated with a hotel’s new water slide pool
                                    (Greensmith et al., 1988). Among 107 hotel guests and visitors surveyed, 29 probable
                                    and 30 laboratory-confirmed cases of Giardia infection were found. Cases ranged

                                  from 3 to 58 years of age. Symptoms in the 59 cases included diarrhoea, cramps,
                                  foul-smelling stools, loss of appetite, fatigue, vomiting and weight loss. Significant
                                  associations were found between illness and staying at the hotel, using the water slide
                                  pool and swallowing pool water. A possible contributing factor was the proximity of
                                  a toddlers’ pool, a potential source of faecal material, to the water slide pool. Water in
                                  the slide pool was treated by sand filtration and bromine disinfection.

                            2. Cryptosporidium-related outbreaks
                                  A number of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been linked to swimming pools. The
                                  sources of Cryptosporidium contaminating the pools were believed to be either sewage
                                  or the swimmers themselves. A number of outbreaks are reviewed below.
                                     In 1988, an outbreak of 60 cases of cryptosporidiosis was reported in Los Angeles
                                  County, USA (CDC, 1990). Swimmers were exposed to pool water in which there
                                  had been a single accidental faecal release. The attack rate was about 73%. The com-
                                  mon factor linking infected individuals was use of the swimming pool.
                                     In August 1988, the first outbreak of cryptosporidiosis associated with a swimming
                                  pool in the United Kingdom was recognized following an increase in the number of
                                  cases of cryptosporidiosis that had been identified by the Doncaster Royal Infirmary
                                  microbiology laboratory (Joce et al., 1991). By October of that year, 67 cases had
                                  been reported. An investigation implicated one of two pools at a local sports centre.
                                  Oocysts were identified in the pool water. Inspection of the pool pipework revealed
                                  significant plumbing defects, which had allowed ingress of sewage from the main
                                  sewer into the circulating pool water. The epidemiological investigation confirmed
                                  an association between head immersion and illness. The concentration of oocysts
                                  detected in the pool water samples that were tested was 50 oocysts per litre. Difficulty
                                  had been experienced in controlling the level of free chlorine residual, which implied
                                  that disinfection was probably not maintained at an appropriate level.
                                     An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in British Columbia, Canada, in 1990
                                  (Bell et al., 1993). A case–control study and illness survey indicated that the transmis-
                                  sion occurred in a public children’s pool at the local recreation centre. Analysis using
                                  laboratory-confirmed cases showed that the illnesses were associated with swimming in
                                  the children’s pool within two weeks before onset of illness. Attack rates ranged from
                                  8% to 78% for various groups of children’s pool users. Several accidental faecal releases,
                                  including diarrhoea, had occurred in the pool before and during the outbreak.
                                     In 1992, public health officials in Oregon, USA, noted a large increase in the number
                                  of stool specimens submitted for parasitic examination that were positive for Crypto-
                                  sporidium (McAnulty et al., 1994). They identified 55 patients with cryptosporidiosis,
                                  including 37 who were the first individuals ill in their households. A case–control study
                                  involving the first 18 case patients showed no association between illness and day-care
                                  attendance, drinking municipal drinking-water or drinking untreated surface waters.
                                  However, 9 of 18 case patients reported swimming at the local wave pool, whereas none
                                  of the controls indicated this activity. Seventeen case patients were finally identified as
                                  swimming in the same pool. The investigators concluded that the outbreak of crypto-
                                  sporidiosis was probably caused by exposure to faecally contaminated pool water.
                                     In August 1993, a parent informed the Department of Public Health of Madison,
                                  Wisconsin, USA, that her daughter was ill with a laboratory-confirmed Cryptospo-
                                  ridium infection and that members of her daughter’s swim team had severe diarrhoea

                                (CDC, 1994). Fifty-five per cent of 31 pool users interviewed reported having had
                                watery diarrhoea for two or more days. Forty-seven per cent of the 17 cases had had
                                watery diarrhoea for more than five days. A second cluster of nine cases was identified
                                later in the month. Seven of the nine reported swimming at a large outdoor pool.
                                Public health authorities cleaned the pool, shock dosed with chlorine and prohibited
                                people with diarrhoea from swimming in the pool.
                                   In the UK, 18 outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis were associated with pools between
                                1989 and 1999. Recognized accidental faecal releases at the pool occurred in four of
                                the outbreaks, although faecal contamination was known or suspected in a further
                                five outbreaks. Outbreaks were associated with pools disinfected with chlorine and
                                with ozone and with both well and poorly managed pools (PHLS, 2000).
                                   Two protracted outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with swimming pools
                                were reported from Ohio and Nebraska, USA (CDC, 2001c). In both cases, acci-
                                dental faecal releases (on more than one occasion) were observed. In the Nebraska
                                outbreak, 32% of cases reported swimming during their illness or shortly afterwards.
                                   In Australia, a statewide outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in New South Wales was
                                associated with swimming at public pools (Puech et al., 2001). The association was
                                reported to be stronger for cases from urban areas. The authors noted that Cryptospo-
                                ridium oocysts were more commonly detected from pools where at least two notified
                                cases had swum, and that outbreaks could involve multiple pools.
                                   A large outbreak of cryptosporidiosis has been associated with a hotel in Majorca,
                                Spain, used by British tourists. The outbreak was detected in Scotland, following the
                                detection of cryptosporidiosis in tourists returning from Majorca. Almost 400 cases
                                were identified, and the outbreak was thought to be associated with the hotel swim-
                                ming pool, with oocysts being detected in samples of the pool water (Galmes et al.,
                                2003). This outbreak resulted in guidelines on cryptosporidiosis prevention being
                                produced for the Spanish hoteliers association (Confederation Española de Hoteles
                                y Apartamentos Turisticos) and the UK Federation of Tour Operators (R. Cartwright,
                                pers. comm.).
                                   In the USA, an analysis of recreationally-associated waterborne outbreaks of illness
                                between 2001 and 2002 was conducted (Yoder et al., 2004). Cryptosporidium species
                                were the most common cause of gastrointestinal outbreaks of illness associated with
                                treated swimming pool water.

                          3.3.3 Risk assessment
                                Giardia cysts are 4–12 µm in diameter. Viable cysts that are ingested by humans have
                                an incubation period of about 7–12 days. The resulting gastroenteritis is characterized
                                by diarrhoea with accompanying abdominal cramps. The illness lasts for about 7–10
                                days. Cryptosporidium oocysts are 4–6 µm in diameter and are much more resistant
                                to chlorine than Giardia cysts. If viable oocysts are ingested, there is an incubation
                                period of 4–9 days before symptoms appear. The illness lasts about 10–14 days, with
                                symptoms typically including diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In patients
                                with severely weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV infection and cancer
                                and transplant patients taking certain immune system-suppressing drugs, cryptospo-
                                ridiosis is generally chronic and more severe than in immunocompetent people and
                                causes diarrhoea that can last long enough to be life threatening (Petersen, 1992).

                                        The Cryptosporidium infective dose that affects 50% of the challenged population
                                     of humans is about 132 oocysts (DuPont et al., 1995), although this does depend
                                     upon the strain (Okhuysen et al., 1999), and for some strains fewer than 100 oocysts
                                     can lead to infection. The duration of shedding of these oocysts after infection is 1–2
                                     weeks. The infection is self-limiting in most individuals, lasting 1–3 weeks. Crypto-
                                     sporidium oocysts discharged by ill individuals are usually observed at densities of
                                     106–107 per gram. The infective dose of Giardia that will cause gastroenteritis in 25%
                                     of an exposed population is 25 cysts. Giardia cysts discharged in the faeces of infected
                                     individuals are usually at densities of 3 × 106 per gram. The shedding of cysts can
                                     persist for up to six months (Table 3.5).

                         3.3.4 Risk management
                                     Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts are very resistant to many disinfectants, includ-
                                     ing chlorine (Lykins et al., 1990). Cryptosporidium, for example (the more chlorine resis-
                                     tant of the two protozoa), requires chlorine concentrations of 30 mg/l for 240 min (at
                                     pH 7 and a temperature of 25 °C) for a 99% reduction to be achieved (i.e. an impractical
                                     level). Inactivation of oocysts with chlorine is greater when ozone, chlorine dioxide or UV
                                     irradiation is also used (Gregory, 2002). Ozone is a more effective disinfectant (compared
                                     with chlorine) for the inactivation of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. Cryptospo-
                                     ridium oocysts are sensitive to 5 mg of ozone per litre. Almost all (99.9%) of the oocysts
                                     are killed after 1 min (at pH 7 and a temperature of 25 °C). Giardia cysts are sensitive to
                                     0.6 mg of ozone per litre. Ninety per cent of the cysts are inactivated after 1 min (at pH 7
                                     and a temperature of 5 °C). As ozone is not a residual disinfectant (i.e. it is not applied so
                                     as to persist in pool water in use), sufficient concentration and time for inactivation must
                                     be ensured during treatment before residual ozone removal and return to the pool.
                                         It should be noted, however, that the figures above represent removal under labora-
                                     tory (i.e. ideal) conditions. Additionally, studies have generally used oxidant demand-
                                     free water (i.e. they were not performed in simulated recreational water where addi-
                                     tional organic material is present). Carpenter et al. (1999) found that the presence of
                                     faecal material increased the Ct value (disinfectant concentration in mg/l multiplied
                                     by time in minutes) needed to disinfect swimming pools.
                                         UV is also effective at inactivating Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. A near
                                     complete inactivation (99.9%) of Cryptosporidium occurs at UV exposures of 10 mJ/cm2

                                (WHO, 2004). Inactivation of Giardia cysts (99%) occurs at lower UV intensities of
                                5 mJ/cm2 (WHO, 2004). The efficacy of UV is impacted by particulate matter and the
                                growth of biofilms. Thus, turbidity should be low, and UV lamps need to be cleaned pe-
                                riodically to remove biofilms or other substances that interfere with UV light emission.
                                Like ozone, UV leaves no disinfectant residual and thus should be combined with chlo-
                                rine or another disinfectant that remains in the water after treatment (WHO, 2004).
                                    At present, the most practical approach to eliminating cysts and oocysts is through the
                                use of filtration. Cryptosporidium oocysts are removed by filtration where the porosity of
                                the filter is less than 4 µm. Giardia cysts are somewhat larger and are removed by filters
                                with a porosity of 7 µm or less, although statistics on removal efficiency during filtration
                                should be interpreted with caution. Removal and inactivation of cysts and oocysts occur
                                only in the fraction of water passing through treatment. Since a pool is a mixed and not a
                                plug flow system, the rate of reduction in concentration in the pool volume is slow.
                                    Most outbreaks of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis among pool swimmers have been
                                linked to pools contaminated by sewage, accidental faecal releases or suspected accidental
                                faecal releases. A study conducted in six pools in France, in the absence of detected fae-
                                cal releases, found only a single instance when Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected
                                (Fournier et al., 2002). An Italian investigation of 10 chlorinated swimming pools found
                                Cryptosporidium and Giardia in 3% of pool water samples despite otherwise good water
                                quality (according to microbial monitoring results) and free chlorine levels of approxi-
                                mately 1 mg/l. In addition, both Cryptosporidium and Giardia were always detected in the
                                filter backwash water (Bonadonna et al., 2004). Pool maintenance and appropriate dis-
                                infection levels are easily overwhelmed by accidental faecal releases or sewage intrusion;
                                therefore, the only possible response to this condition, once it has occurred, is to prevent
                                use of the pool and physically remove the oocysts by draining or by applying a long pe-
                                riod of filtration, as inactivation in the water volume (i.e. disinfection) is impossible (see
                                Chapter 5). However, the best intervention is to prevent accidental faecal releases from
                                occurring in the first place, through education of pool users about appropriate hygienic
                                behaviour. Immunocompromised individuals should be aware that they are at increased
                                risk of illness from exposure to pathogenic protozoa.

                            3.4 Non-faecally-derived bacteria
                                Infections and diseases associated with non-enteric pathogenic bacteria found in
                                swimming pools and similar recreational water environments are summarized in Table
                                3.6. A number of these bacteria may be shed by bathers or may be present in biofilms

                                – Donlan, 2002). Biofilms may form on the lining of pipes (for example) in contact
                                with water and may serve to protect the bacteria from disinfectants.

                             1. Risk assessment
                                Legionella are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile, aerobic bacilli, which may
                                be free-living or living within amoebae and other protozoa or within biofilms. Legio-
                                nella spp. are heterotrophic bacteria found in a wide range of water environments and
                                can proliferate at temperatures above 25 °C. They may be present in high numbers
                                in natural spas using thermal spring water, and they can also grow in poorly main-

                                    multiply on filter materials, namely granular activated carbon. However, exposure to
                                    Legionella is preventable through the implementation of basic management measures,
                                    including filtration, maintaining a continuous disinfectant residual in hot tubs (where
                                    disinfectants are not used, there must be a high dilution rate with fresh water) and the
                                    maintenance and physical cleaning of all natural spa, hot tub and pool equipment,
                                    including associated pipes and air-conditioning units.
                                       The risk of infection following exposure to Legionella is difficult to assess and
                                    remains a matter of some debate (Atlas, 1999). Due to its prevalence in both natural
                                    and artificial environments, it must be considered that people are frequently exposed
                                    (at least to low numbers). Generally, there is no reaction to such exposure, asymptom-
                                    atic production of antibodies or development of a mild flu-like illness, which may not
                                    be attributed to Legionella infection.
                                       Legionella spp. can cause legionellosis, a range of pneumonic and non-pneumonic
                                    disease (WHO, 2005). Ninety per cent of cases of legionellosis are caused by L. pneu-
                                    mophila. Legionnaires’ disease is characterized as a form of pneumonia. General risk
                                    factors for the illness include gender (males are roughly three times more likely than
                                    females to contract Legionnaires’ disease), age (50 or older), chronic lung disease,
                                    cigarette smoking and excess consumption of alcohol. Specific risk factors, in relation
                                    to pools and hot tubs, include frequency of hot tub use and length of time spent in
                                    or around hot tubs. Although the attack rate is often less than 1%, mortality among
                                    hospitalized cases ranges widely up to 50%. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic, non-
                                    transmissible, non-fatal, influenza-like illness. The attack rate can be as high as 95%
                                    in the total exposed population. Patients with no underlying illness or condition re-
                                    cover in 2–5 days without treatment.

                                   Risk of legionellosis from pools and similar environments is associated with pro-
                               liferation of Legionella in spas or hot tubs, associated equipment and HVAC systems.
                               The inference to be drawn from reported outbreaks and documented single cases is
                               that inhalation of bacteria, or aspiration following ingestion, during natural spa or
                               hot tub use may lead to disease, although Leoni et al. (2001) concluded that showers
                               may present a greater risk of legionellosis than pool water. Thermal spring waters,
                               especially, may be a source of high numbers of Legionella spp. (Bornstein et al., 1989;
                               Martinelli et al., 2001), and they have been implicated in cases of legionnaires’ disease
                               (Bornstein et al., 1989; Mashiba et al., 1993).
                                   Piped drinking-water distribution systems, household hot and cold water main-
                               tained between 25 °C and 50 °C, cooling towers, evaporative condensers of air-con-
                               ditioning devices, water fountains and mist-generating machines are also potential
                               sources of exposure to Legionella.

                            2. Risk management
                               Control of Legionella follows similar general principles to water safety plans applied to
                               drinking-water supplies (WHO, 2004), although, in this instance, the principal respon-
                               sibility will not lie with the water supplier. Authorities responsible for regulation of recre-
                               ational facilities should ensure the implementation of safety plans, and such plans should
                               address not only pools and hot tubs but also other water systems, including cooling tow-
                               ers and evaporative condensers operating at these facilities. As safety plans are limited to
                               the recreational facility and the dose response is not easily described, adequate control
                               measures should be defined in terms of practices that have been shown to be effective.
                               Important control measures include appropriate design, to minimize the available surface
                               area within the pool and hot tub system and associated pipework to reduce the area for
                               possible bacterial colonization, ensuring an adequate disinfection residual in pools and
                               hot tubs, proper maintenance and cleaning of equipment, and adequate ventilation.
                                   Most of the reported legionellosis associated with recreational water use has been as-
                               sociated with hot tubs and natural spas (Groothuis et al., 1985; Althaus, 1986; Bornstein
                               et al., 1989; Mashiba et al., 1993). Natural spa waters (especially thermal water) and as-
                               sociated equipment create an ideal habitat (warm, nutrient-containing aerobic water) for
                               the selection and proliferation of Legionella. Hot tubs used for display in retail/wholesale
                               outlets are also potential sources of infection (McEvoy et al., 2000). Outbreaks as a result
                               of using swimming pools have not been reported (Marston et al., 1994), although Legio-
                               nella spp. have been isolated from pool water and filter samples (Jeppesen et al., 2000;
                               Leoni et al., 2001). Hot tubs integrated into larger swimming pool complexes appear to
                               be less of a source of Legionella infection where shared water treatment facilities exist due
                               to dilution of hot tub water into larger volumes of water for treatment.
                                   Increased risk of Legionella in drinking-water has been associated with systems
                               operating within the temperature range 25–50 °C. In hot tub facilities it is impracti-
                               cal to maintain a water temperature outside this range. Therefore, it is necessary to
                               implement a range of other management strategies, which may include:
                                  • ensuring a constant circulation of water in the hot tub;
                                  • programming ‘rest periods’ during hot tub operation, in order to discourage
                                    excessive use and also to allow disinfectant levels to ‘recover’;
                                  • frequent inspection and cleaning of all filters, including backwash filters (e.g. at
                                    least daily and when triggered by a pressure drop);

                                     • cleaning pool surroundings, inspection of the physical conditions of the hot tub
                                         (e.g. daily);
                                     • replacing at least half the water in each hot tub (e.g. daily);
                                     • completely draining hot tubs and thoroughly cleaning all surfaces and all pipe-
                                         work (e.g. weekly);
                                     • maintaining and physically cleaning heating, ventilation and air-conditioning sys-
                                         tems serving the room in which hot tubs are located (e.g. weekly to monthly);
                                     • inspection of the sand filter (e.g. quarterly); and
                                     • ensuring staff are appropriately qualified and competent to operate the recre-
                                         ational facility.
                                     In order to control the growth of Legionella in hot tubs and natural spas, physical
                                  cleaning of surfaces is critical, and high residual disinfectant concentrations may be
                                  required – e.g. free chlorine, where used, must be at least 1 mg/l at all times. Features
                                  such as water sprays, etc., in pool facilities should be periodically cleaned and flushed
                                  with a level of disinfectant adequate to eliminate Legionella spp. (e.g. by use of a solu-
                                  tion of at least 5 mg of hypochlorite per litre).
                                     Bathers should be encouraged to shower before entering the water. This will re-
                                  move pollutants such as perspiration, cosmetics and organic debris that can act as
                                  a source of nutrients for bacterial growth and neutralize oxidizing biocides. Bather
                                  density and duration spent in hot tubs should also be controlled. Public and semi-
                                  public spa facilities should have programmed rest periods during the day. High-risk
                                  individuals (such as those with chronic lung disease) should be cautioned about the
                                  risks of exposure to Legionella in or around pools and hot tubs.
                                     Operators of hot tub facilities should undertake a programme of verification of
                                  control measures, including:
                                     • checking and adjusting residual disinfectant levels and pH (several times a day);
                                     • inspection and maintenance of cleaning operations (daily to weekly); and
                                     • where microbial testing for Legionella is undertaken, ensuring that Legionella
                                       levels are <1/100 ml.

                        3.4.2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa
                            1. Risk assessment
                                  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile, Gram-negative, straight
                                  or slightly curved rod with dimensions 0.5–1 µm × 1.5–4 µm. It can metabolize a variety
                                  of organic compounds and is resistant to a wide range of antibiotics and disinfectants.
                                     P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in water, vegetation and soil. Although shedding from
                                  infected humans is the predominant source of P. aeruginosa in pools and hot tubs (Ja-
                                  cobson, 1985), the surrounding environment can be a source of contamination. The
                                  warm, moist environment on decks, drains, benches and floors provided by pools and
                                  similar environments is ideal for the growth of Pseudomonas, and it can grow well up
                                  to temperatures of 41 °C (Price & Ahearn, 1988). Pseudomonas tends to accumulate
                                  in biofilms in filters that are poorly maintained and in areas where pool hydraulics
                                  are poor (under moveable floors, for example). It is also likely that bathers pick up

                            organisms from exposure to disinfectants and contribute to the organic load, which,
                            in turn, reduces the residual disinfectant level; they also act as a source of nutrients
                            for the growth of P. aeruginosa (Kush & Hoadley, 1980; Ratnam et al., 1986; Price
                            & Ahearn, 1988).
                                In one study, P. aeruginosa was isolated from all nine hot tubs examined (seven of
                            which were commercial facilities and two domestic – Price & Ahearn, 1988). In the
                            majority of hot tubs, concentrations ranged from 102 to 105 per ml. Locally recom-
                            mended disinfection levels (of between 3 and 5 mg/l chlorine or bromine) were not
                            maintained in any of the commercial hot tubs examined. In the same study, the two
                            domestic hot tubs developed P. aeruginosa densities of 104–106 per ml within 24–48 h
                            following stoppage of disinfection. In Northern Ireland, UK, Moore et al. (2002)
                            found P. aeruginosa in 72% of hot tubs and 38% of swimming pools examined.
                                In hot tubs, the primary health effect associated with the presence of P. aerugi-
                            nosa is folliculitis. Otitis externa and infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract,
                            wounds and cornea caused by P. aeruginosa have also been linked to hot tub use. In-
                            fection of hair follicles in the skin with P. aeruginosa produces a pustular rash, which
                            may appear under surfaces covered with swimwear or may be more intense in these
                            areas (Ratnam et al., 1986). The rash appears 48 h (range 8 h to 5 days) after exposure
                            and usually resolves spontaneously within 5 days. It has been suggested that warm
                            water supersaturates the epidermis, dilates dermal pores and facilitates their invasion
                            by P. aeruginosa (Ratnam et al., 1986). There are some indications that extracellular
                            enzymes produced by P. aeruginosa may damage skin and contribute to the bacteria’s
                            colonization (Highsmith et al., 1985). Other symptoms, such as headache, muscular
                            aches, burning eyes and fever, have been reported. Some of these secondary symp-
                            toms resemble humidifier fever (Weissman & Schuyler, 1991) and therefore could
                            be caused by the inhalation of P. aeruginosa endotoxins. Investigations have indicated
                            that duration or frequency of exposure, bather loads, bather age and using the facility
                            later in the day can be significant risk factors for folliculitis (Hudson et al., 1985; Rat-
                            nam et al., 1986; CDC, 2000). The sex of bathers does not appear to be a significant
                            risk factor, but Hudson et al. (1985) suggest that women wearing one-piece bathing
                            suits may be more susceptible to infection, presumably because one-piece suits trap
                            more P. aeruginosa-contaminated water next to the skin. It has been suggested that the
                            infective dose for healthy individuals is greater than 1000 organisms per ml (Price &
                            Ahearn, 1988; Dadswell, 1997).
                                In swimming pools, the primary health effect associated with P. aeruginosa is otitis
                            externa or swimmer’s ear, although folliculitis has also been reported (Ratnam et al.,
                            1986). Otitis externa is characterized by inflammation, swelling, redness and pain in
                            the external auditory canal. Risk factors reported to increase the occurrence of otitis
                            externa related to water exposure include amount of time spent in the water prior
                            to the infection, less than 19 years of age and a history of previous ear infections
                            (Seyfried & Cook, 1984; van Asperen et al., 1995). Repeated exposure to water is
                            thought to remove the protective wax coating of the external ear canal, predisposing
                            it to infection.
                                An indoor swimming pool with a system of water sprays has been implicated as
                            the source of two sequential outbreaks of granulomatous pneumonitis among life-
                            guards (Rose et al., 1998). Inadequate chlorination led to the colonization of the
                            spray circuits and pumps with Gram-negative bacteria, predominantly P. aeruginosa.

                                  The bacteria and associated endotoxins were aerosolized and respired by the lifeguards
                                  when the sprays were activated. When the water spray circuits were replaced and sup-
                                  plied with an ozonation and chlorination system, there were no further occurrences
                                  of disease among personnel.
                                      An outbreak of pseudomonas hot-foot syndrome, erythematous plantar nodules,
                                  has been reported as a result of exposure to a community wading pool. The floor of
                                  the pool was coated in abrasive grit, and the water contained high concentrations of P.
                                  aeruginosa (Fiorillo et al., 2001). Another outbreak occurred in Germany due to high
                                  concentrations of P. aeruginosa on the stairs to a water slide and resulted in some of
                                  the children being admitted to hospital (A. Wiedenmann, pers. comm.).
                                      The true incidence of illnesses associated with P. aeruginosa in pools and similar
                                  environments is difficult to determine. Since the symptoms are primarily mild and
                                  self-limiting, most patients do not seek medical attention. In the USA, Yoder et al.
                                  (2004) reported 20 outbreaks of dermatitis between 2000 and 2001 associated with
                                  pools and hot tubs. In eight of these outbreaks P. aeruginosa was identified from water
                                  or filter samples; in the other 12 outbreaks Pseudomonas was suspected to be the cause.
                                  It was noted that contributing factors to these outbreaks included inadequate pool
                                  and hot tub maintenance and exceeding the bather load limit.

                            2. Risk management
                                  Maintaining adequate residual disinfectant levels and routine cleaning are the key ele-
                                  ments to controlling P. aeruginosa in swimming pools and similar recreational environ-
                                  ments (see Chapter 5). While maintaining residual disinfectant levels in pools is relative-
                                  ly easy, the design and operation of some hot tubs make it difficult to achieve adequate
                                  disinfectant levels in these facilities. Under normal operating conditions, disinfectants
                                  can quickly dissipate (Highsmith et al., 1985; Price & Ahearn, 1988). In all facilities,
                                  frequent monitoring and adjustment of pH and disinfectant levels are essential. Most
                                  hot tubs use either chlorine- or bromine-based disinfectants. Shaw (1984) showed that
                                  chlorination was superior to bromine in controlling P. aeruginosa. He reported that dur-
                                  ing an outbreak investigation, P. aeruginosa could be isolated from water despite having
                                  a total bromine level of 5 mg/l and a pH of 7.5. Even in hot tubs with heterotrophic
                                  plate counts of <1 cfu/ml, P. aeruginosa was isolated from 5% of bromine-disinfected
                                  pools compared with only 0.8% of chlorine-disinfected pools (Shaw, 1984).
                                      Routine, thorough cleaning of surrounding surfaces will help to reduce infections
                                  with P. aeruginosa. In addition, swimming pool, hot tub and natural spa operators
                                  should strongly encourage users to shower before entering the water and, where pos-
                                  sible, control the number of bathers and their duration of hot tub exposure (Public
                                  Health Laboratory Service Spa Pools Working Group, 1994).

                        3.4.3 Mycobacterium spp.
                            1. Risk assessment
                                  Mycobacterium spp. are rod-shaped bacteria that are 0.2–0.6 µm × 1.0–10 µm in size
                                  and have cell walls with a high lipid content. This feature means that they retain dyes
                                  in staining procedures that employ an acid wash; hence, they are often referred to as
                                  acid-fast bacteria. Atypical mycobacteria (i.e. other than strictly pathogenic species,
                                  such as M. tuberculosis) are ubiquitous in the aqueous environment and proliferate in
                                  and around swimming pools and similar environments (Leoni et al., 1999).

                                    In pool environments, M. marinum is responsible for skin and soft tissue infections
                                in normally healthy people. Infections frequently occur on abraded elbows and knees
                                and result in localized lesions, often referred to as swimming pool granuloma. The
                                organism is probably picked up from the pool edge by bathers as they climb in and
                                out of the pool (Collins et al., 1984).
                                    Respiratory illnesses associated with hot tub use in normally healthy individuals
                                have been linked to other atypical mycobacteria (Embil et al., 1997; Kahana et al.,
                                1997; Grimes et al., 2001; Khoor et al., 2001; Mangione et al., 2001; Cappelluti
                                et al., 2003; Lumb et al., 2004). For example, M. avium in hot tub water has been
                                linked to hypersensitivity pneumonitis and possibly pneumonia (Embil et al., 1997).
                                Symptoms were flu-like and included cough, fever, chills, malaise and headaches. The
                                illness followed the inhalation of heavily contaminated aerosols generated by the hot
                                tub. The reported cases relate to domestic hot tubs, many of which were located out-
                                doors. In most instances the frequency of hot tub use was high, as was the duration
                                of exposure (an extreme example being use for 1–2 h each day), and maintenance of
                                disinfection and cleaning were not ideal. It is likely that detected cases are only a small
                                fraction of the total number of cases. Amoebae may also play a role in the transmis-
                                sion of Mycobacterium spp. (Cirillo et al., 1997).

                             2. Risk management
                                Mycobacteria are more resistant to disinfection than most bacteria due to the high lip-
                                id content of their cell wall (Engelbrecht et al., 1977). Therefore, thorough cleaning
                                of surfaces and materials around pools and hot tubs where the organism may persist
                                is necessary, supplemented by the maintenance of disinfection at appropriate levels.
                                In addition, occasional shock dosing of chlorine (see Chapter 5) may be required to
                                eradicate mycobacteria accumulated in biofilms within pool or hot tub components
                                (Aubuchon et al., 1986). In natural spas where the use of disinfectants is undesirable
                                or where it is difficult to maintain adequate disinfectant levels, superheating the water
                                to 70 °C on a daily basis during periods of non-use may help to control M. marinum
                                (Embil et al., 1997). Immunocompromised individuals should be cautioned about
                                the risks of exposure to atypical mycobacteria in and around pools and hot tubs.

                          3.4.4 Staphylococcus aureus
                             1. Risk assessment
                                The genus Staphylococcus comprises non-motile, non-spore-forming and non-encap-
                                sulated Gram-positive cocci (0.5–1.5 µm in diameter) that ferment glucose and grow
                                aerobically and anaerobically. They are usually catalase positive and occur singly and
                                in pairs, tetrads, short chains and irregular grape-like clusters. In humans, there are
                                three clinically important species – Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and S. sap-
                                rophyticus. S. aureus is the only coagulase-positive species and is clinically the most
                                important (Duerden et al., 1990).
                                   Humans are the only known reservoir of S. aureus, and it is found on the anterior
                                nasal mucosa and skin as well as in the faeces of a substantial portion of healthy indi-
                                viduals. Robinton & Mood (1966) found that S. aureus was shed by bathers under all
                                conditions of swimming, and the bacteria can be found in surface films in pool water.
                                Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus strains of normal human flora have been found in
                                chlorinated swimming pools (Rocheleau et al., 1986).

                                     The presence of S. aureus in swimming pools is believed to have resulted in skin
                                  rashes, wound infections, urinary tract infections, eye infections, otitis externa, impe-
                                  tigo and other infections (Calvert & Storey, 1988; Rivera & Adera, 1991). Infections
                                  of S. aureus acquired from recreational waters may not become apparent until 48 h
                                  after contact. De Araujo et al. (1990) have suggested that recreational waters with a
                                  high density of bathers present a risk of staphylococcal infection that is comparable to
                                  the risk of gastrointestinal illness involved in bathing in water considered unsafe be-
                                  cause of faecal pollution. According to Favero et al. (1964) and Crone & Tee (1974),
                                  50% or more of the total staphylococci isolated from swimming pool water samples
                                  are S. aureus. In Italy, however, in a study on chlorinated pools where the free chlorine
                                  level varied between 0.8 and 1.2 mg/l, S. aureus was not recovered from water samples
                                  (Bonadonna et al., 2004).

                            2. Risk management
                                  Adequate inactivation of potentially pathogenic S. aureus in swimming pools can be
                                  attained by maintaining free chlorine levels greater than 1 mg/l (Keirn & Putnam,
                                  1968; Rivera & Adera, 1991) or equivalent disinfection efficiency. There is evidence
                                  that showering before pool entry can reduce the shedding of staphylococci from the
                                  skin into the pool (Robinton & Mood, 1966). Continuous circulation of surface wa-
                                  ter through the treatment process helps to control the build-up of S. aureus. Pool con-
                                  tamination can also be reduced if the floors surrounding the pool and in the changing
                                  areas are kept at a high standard of cleanliness. Although it is not recommended that
                                  water samples be routinely monitored for S. aureus, where samples are taken, levels
                                  should be less than 100/100 ml.

                        3.4.5 Leptospira interrogans sensu lato
                            1. Risk assessment
                                  Leptospires are motile spirochaete (helically coiled) bacteria. Traditionally, the genus
                                  Leptospira consists of two species, the pathogenic L. interrogans sensu lato and the
                                  saprophytic L. biflexa sensu lato. Serological tests within each species revealed many
                                  antigenic variations, and, on this basis, leptospires are classified as serovars. In addi-
                                  tion, a classification system based on DNA relatedness is used (Brenner et al., 1999).
                                  The current species determination is based on this principle. The serological and
                                  genetic taxonomies are two different systems with only little correlation (Brenner et
                                  al., 1999). Free-living strains (L. biflexa sensu lato) are ubiquitous in the environment
                                  (Faine et al., 1999); the pathogenic strains (L. interrogans sensu lato), however, live in
                                  the kidneys of animal hosts.
                                      Pathogenic leptospires live in the proximal renal tubules of the kidneys of carrier
                                  animals (including rats, cows and pigs) and are excreted in the urine, which can then
                                  contaminate surface waters. Humans and animals (humans are always incidental hosts)
                                  become infected either directly through contact with infected urine or indirectly via con-
                                  tact with contaminated water. Leptospires gain entry to the body through cuts and abra-
                                  sions of the skin and through the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose and conjunctiva.
                                      Diseases caused by Leptospira interrogans sensu lato have been given a variety of
                                  names, including swineherd’s disease, Stuttgart disease and Weil’s syndrome, but col-
                                  lectively all of these infections are termed leptospirosis. The clinical manifestations
                                  of leptospirosis vary considerably in form and intensity, ranging from a mild flu-like

                                      illness to a severe and potentially fatal form of the disease, characterized by liver and
                                      kidney failure and haemorrhages (Weil’s syndrome). Severity is related to the infecting
                                      serovar as well as host characteristics, such as age and underlying health and nutri-
                                      tional status. Specific serovars are often associated with certain hosts.
                                          Compared with many other pathogens, leptospires have a comparatively low resis-
                                      tance to adverse chemical and physical conditions, including disinfectants. They are
                                      seldom found in water of below pH 6.8, and they cannot tolerate drying or exposure
                                      to direct sunlight (Noguchi, 1918; Alston & Broom, 1958; Weyant et al., 1999).
                                          The majority of reported outbreaks of waterborne leptospirosis have involved fresh
                                      recreational waters, but two outbreaks have been associated with non-chlorinated
                                      swimming pools (Cockburn et al., 1954; de Lima et al., 1990). Domestic or wild
                                      animals with access to the implicated waters were the probable sources of Leptospira.

                                 2. Risk management
                                      The risk of leptospirosis can be reduced by preventing direct animal access to swim-
                                      ming pools and maintaining adequate disinfectant concentrations. Informing users
                                      about the hazards of swimming in water that is accessible to domestic and wild ani-
                                      mals may also help to prevent infections. Outbreaks are not common; thus, it appears
                                      that the risk of leptospirosis associated with swimming pools and hot tubs is low.
                                      Normal disinfection of pools is sufficient to inactivate Leptospira spp.

                                 1. Risk assessment
                                      Molluscipoxvirus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the Poxviridae family. Virions
                                      are brick-shaped, about 320 nm × 250 nm × 200 nm. The virus causes molluscum
                                      contagiosum, an innocuous cutaneous disease limited to humans. It is spread by direct
                                      person-to-person contact or indirectly through physical contact with contaminated

layout Safe Water.indd 70                                                                                                         24.2.2006 9:57:02
                                  surfaces. The infection appears as small, round, firm papules or lesions, which grow
                                  to about 3–5 mm in diameter. The incubation period is 2–6 weeks or longer. Indi-
                                  vidual lesions persist for 2–4 months, and cases resolve spontaneously in 0.5–2 years.
                                  Swimming pool-related cases occur more frequently in children than in adults. The
                                  total number of annual cases is unknown. Since the infection is relatively innocuous,
                                  the reported number of cases is likely to be much less than the total number. Lesions
                                  are most often found on the arms, back of the legs and back, suggesting transmis-
                                  sion through physical contact with the edge of the pool, benches around the pool,
                                  swimming aids carried into the pool or shared towels (Castilla et al., 1995). Indirect
                                  transmission via water in swimming pools is not likely. Although cases associated with
                                  hot tubs have not been reported, they should not be ruled out as a route of exposure.

                             2. Risk management
                                  The only source of molluscipoxvirus in swimming pool and similar facilities is infect-
                                  ed bathers (Oren & Wende, 1991). Hence, the most important means of controlling
                                  the spread of the infection is to educate the public about the disease, the importance
                                  of limiting contact between infected and non-infected people and medical treatment.
                                  Thorough frequent cleaning of surfaces in facilities that are prone to contamination
                                  can reduce the spread of the disease.

                        3.5.2 Papillomavirus
                             1. Risk assessment
                                  Papillomavirus is a double-stranded DNA virus in the family Papovaviridae. The virions
                                  are spherical and approximately 55 nm in diameter. The virus causes benign cutaneous
                                  tumours in humans. An infection that occurs on the sole (or plantar surface) of the
                                  foot is referred to as a verruca plantaris or plantar wart. Papillomaviruses are extremely
                                  resistant to desiccation and thus can remain infectious for many years. The incubation
                                  period of the virus remains unknown, but it is estimated to be 1–20 weeks. The infec-
                                  tion is extremely common among children and young adults between the ages of 12
                                  and 16 who frequent public pools and hot tubs. It is less common among adults, sug-
                                  gesting that they acquire immunity to the infection. At facilities such as public swim-
                                  ming pools, plantar warts are usually acquired via direct physical contact with shower
                                  and changing room floors contaminated with infected skin fragments (Conklin, 1990;
                                  Johnson, 1995). Papillomavirus is not transmitted via pool or hot tub waters.

                             2. Risk management
                                  The primary source of papillomavirus in swimming pool facilities is infected bathers.
                                  Hence, the most important means of controlling the spread of the virus is to educate
                                  the public about the disease, the importance of limiting contact between infected and
                                  non-infected people and medical treatment. The use of pre-swim showering, wearing
                                  of sandals in showers and changing rooms and regular cleaning of surfaces in swimming
                                  pool facilities that are prone to contamination can reduce the spread of the virus.

                              1. Risk assessment
                                    Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba (i.e. it does not require the infection of a
                                    host organism to complete its life cycle) present in fresh water and soil. The life cycle
                                    includes an environmentally resistant encysted form. Cysts are spherical, 8–12 µm in
                                    diameter, with smooth, single-layered walls containing one or two mucus-plugged
                                    pores through which the trophozoites (infectious stages) emerge. N. fowleri is ther-
                                    mophilic, preferring warm water and reproducing successfully at temperatures up to
                                    46 °C.
                                        N. fowleri causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Infection is usu-
                                    ally acquired by exposure to water in ponds, natural spas and artificial lakes (Martinez
                                    & Visvesvara, 1997; Szenasi et al., 1998). Victims are usually healthy children and
                                    young adults who have had contact with water about 7–10 days before the onset of
                                    symptoms (Visvesvara, 1999). Infection occurs when water containing the organisms
                                    is forcefully inhaled or splashed onto the olfactory epithelium, usually from diving,
                                    jumping or underwater swimming. The amoebae in the water then make their way
                                    into the brain and central nervous system. Symptoms of the infection include severe
                                    headache, high fever, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, seizures and hallucinations. The
                                    infection is not contagious. For those infected, death occurs usually 3–10 days after
                                    onset of symptoms. Respiratory symptoms occur in some patients and may be the
                                    result of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions or may represent a subclinical infection
                                    (Martinez & Visvesvara, 1997).
                                        Although PAM is an extremely rare disease, cases have been associated with pools
                                    and natural spas. In Usti, Czech Republic, 16 cases of PAM were associated with a
                                    public swimming pool (Cerva & Novak, 1968). The source of the contamination was
                                    traced to a cavity behind a false wall used to shorten the pool length. The pool took
                                    water from a local river, which was the likely source of the organism. One confirmed
                                    case of PAM occurred in Bath Spa, in the UK, in 1978. The victim was a young girl
                                    who swam in a public swimming pool fed with water from the historic thermal springs
                                    that rise naturally in the city (Cain et al., 1981). Subsequent analysis confirmed the
                                    thermal springs to be the source of the infection (Kilvington et al., 1991). N. fowleri
                                    has also been isolated from air-conditioning units (Martinez, 1993).

                                  Risk of infection can be reduced by minimizing the occurrence of the causative agent
                                  through appropriate choice of source water, proper cleaning, maintenance, coagulation–
                                  filtration and disinfection.

                        3.6.2 Acanthamoeba spp.
                            1. Risk assessment
                                  Several species of free-living Acanthamoeba are human pathogens (A. castellanii, A.
                                  culbertsoni, A. polyphaga). They can be found in all aquatic environments, including
                                  disinfected swimming pools. Under adverse conditions, they form a dormant en-
                                  cysted stage. Cysts measure 15–28 µm, depending on the species. Acanthamoeba cysts
                                  are highly resistant to extremes of temperature, disinfection and desiccation. The cysts
                                  will retain viability from –20 °C to 56 °C. When favourable conditions occur, such as
                                  a ready supply of bacteria and a suitable temperature, the cysts hatch (excyst) and the
                                  trophozoites emerge to feed and replicate. All pathogenic species will grow at 36–37 °C,
                                  with an optimum of about 30 °C. Although Acanthamoeba is common in most envi-
                                  ronments, human contact with the organism rarely leads to infection.
                                      Human pathogenic species of Acanthamoeba cause two clinically distinct diseases:
                                  granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) and inflammation of the cornea (kerati-
                                  tis) (Ma et al., 1990; Martinez, 1991; Kilvington & White, 1994).
                                      GAE is a chronic disease of the immunosuppressed; GAE is either subacute or
                                  chronic but is invariably fatal. Symptoms include fever, headaches, seizures, meningitis
                                  and visual abnormalities. GAE is extremely rare, with only 60 cases reported world-
                                  wide. The route of infection in GAE is unclear, although invasion of the brain may
                                  result from the blood following a primary infection elsewhere in the body, possibly the
                                  skin or lungs (Martinez, 1985, 1991). The precise source of such infections is unknown
                                  because of the almost ubiquitous presence of Acanthamoeba in the environment.
                                      Acanthamoeba keratitis affects previously healthy people and is a severe and po-
                                  tentially blinding infection of the cornea (Ma et al., 1990; Kilvington & White,
                                  1994). In the untreated state, acanthamoeba keratitis can lead to permanent blind-
                                  ness. Although only one eye is usually affected, cases of bilateral infection have been
                                  reported. The disease is characterized by intense pain and ring-shaped infiltrates in
                                  the corneal stroma. Contact lens wearers are most at risk from the infection and ac-
                                  count for approximately 90% of reported cases (Kilvington & White, 1994). Poor
                                  contact lens hygiene practices (notably ignoring recommended cleaning and disin-
                                  fection procedures and rinsing or storing of lenses in tap water or non-sterile saline
                                  solutions) are recognized risk factors, although the wearing of contact lenses while
                                  swimming or participating in other water sports may also be a risk factor. In non-
                                  contact lens related keratitis, infection arises from trauma to the eye and contamina-
                                  tion with environmental matter such as soil and water (Sharma et al., 1990). Samples
                                  et al. (1984) report a case of keratitis that may have been acquired from domestic
                                  hot tub use.

                            2. Risk management
                                  Although Acanthamoeba cysts are resistant to chlorine- and bromine-based disinfec-
                                  tants, they can be removed by filtration. Thus, it is unlikely that properly operated

                                swimming pools and similar environments would contain sufficient numbers of cysts
                                to cause infection in normally healthy individuals. Immunosuppressed individuals
                                who use swimming pools, natural spas or hot tubs should be aware of the increased
                                risk of GAE. A number of precautionary measures are available to contact lens wear-
                                ers, including removal before entering the water, wearing goggles, post-swim contact
                                lens wash using appropriate lens fluid and use of daily disposable lenses.

                          3.6.3 Plasmodium spp.
                             1. Risk assessment
                                Swimming pools are associated not with Plasmodium spp. but with anopheline mos-
                                quito larvae, the insect vectors of Plasmodium. Mbogo et al. (submitted) found that
                                over 70% of swimming pools sampled in urban Malindi in Kenya were positive for
                                mosquito larvae. The problem relates to the seasonal use of the pools. Before people
                                leave their summer houses, it is common to drain the pool; however, rainwater ac-
                                cumulated during the rainy season provides a suitable habitat for mosquito breeding,
                                with the attendant risks of malaria as a result.

                             2. Risk management
                                During the rains, when the pools fill with water, they should be drained every
                                5–7 days to avoid mosquito larvae developing into adults. The swimming pools may
                                also be treated with appropriate larvicides when not in use for long periods.

                            3.7 Non-faecally-derived fungi
                                Infections associated with fungi found in swimming pools and similar environments
                                are summarized in Table 3.9.

                          3.7.1 Trichophyton spp. and Epidermophyton floccosum
                             1. Risk assessment
                                Epidermophyton floccosum and various species of fungi in the genus Trichophyton cause
                                superficial fungal infections of the hair, fingernails or skin. Infection of the skin of
                                the foot (usually between the toes) is described as tinea pedis or, more commonly,
                                as ‘athlete’s foot’ (Aho & Hirn, 1981). Symptoms include maceration, cracking and
                                scaling of the skin, with intense itching. Tinea pedis may be transmitted by direct
                                person-to-person contact; in swimming pools, however, it may be transmitted by
                                physical contact with surfaces, such as floors in public showers, changing rooms, etc.,
                                contaminated with infected skin fragments. In Japan, a study comparing students at-
                                tending a regular swimming class with those who did not found a significantly greater
                                level of infection in the swimmers (odds ratio of 8.5), and Trichophyton spp. were

                                  isolated from the floor of a hot tub and the floor of one of the changing rooms (Kami-
                                  hama et al., 1997). The fungus colonizes the stratum corneum when environmental
                                  conditions, particularly humidity, are optimal. From in vitro experiments, it has been
                                  calculated that it takes approximately 3–4 h for the fungus to initiate infection. The
                                  infection is common among lifeguards and competitive swimmers, but relatively be-
                                  nign; thus, the true number of cases is unknown.

                             2. Risk management
                                  The sole source of these fungi in swimming pool and similar facilities is infected bathers.
                                  Hence, the most important means of controlling the spread of the fungus is to educate
                                  the public about the disease, the importance of limiting contact between infected and
                                  non-infected bathers and medical treatment. The use of pre-swim showers, wearing of
                                  sandals in showers and changing rooms and frequent cleaning of surfaces in swimming
                                  pool facilities that are prone to contamination can reduce the spread of the fungi (Al-
                                  Doory & Ramsey, 1987). People with severe athlete’s foot or similar dermal infections
                                  should not frequent public swimming pools, natural spas or hot tubs. Routine disinfec-
                                  tion appears to control the spread of these fungi in swimming pools and similar environ-

                     Chemical hazards




                                C   hemicals found in pool water can be derived from a number of sources: the source
                                    water, deliberate additions such as disinfectants and the pool users themselves (see
                                Figure 4.1). This chapter describes the routes of exposure to swimming pool chemi-
                                cals, the chemicals typically found in pool water and their possible health effects.
                                   While there is clearly a need to ensure proper consideration of health and safety
                                issues for operators and pool users in relation to the use and storage of swimming pool
                                chemicals, this aspect is not covered in this volume.

                                There are three main routes of exposure to chemicals in swimming pools and similar
                                environments:
                                   • direct ingestion of water;
                                   • inhalation of volatile or aerosolized solutes; and
                                   • dermal contact and absorption through the skin.

                        4.1.1 Ingestion
                                  The amount of water ingested by swimmers and pool users will depend upon a range
                                  of factors, including experience, age, skill and type of activity. The duration of ex-
                                  posure will vary significantly in different circumstances, but for adults, extended ex-
                                  posure would be expected to be associated with greater skill (e.g. competitive swim-
                                  mers), and so there would be a lower rate of ingestion in a comparable time than for
                                  less skilled users. The situation with children is much less clear. There appear to be
                                  no data with which to make a more detailed assessment. A number of estimates have
                                  been made of possible intakes while participating in activities in swimming pools and
                                  similar environments, with the most convincing being a pilot study by Evans et al.
                                  (2001). This used urine sample analysis, with 24-h urine samples taken from swim-
                                  mers who had used a pool disinfected with dichloroisocyanurate and analysed for
                                  cyanurate concentrations. All the participants swam, but there is no information on
                                  the participant swimming duration. This study found that the average water intake
                                  by children (37 ml) was higher than the intake by adults (16 ml). In addition, the
                                  intake by adult men (22 ml) was higher than that by women (12 ml); the intake by
                                  boys (45 ml) was higher than the intake by girls (30 ml). The upper 95th percentile
                                  intake was for children and was approximately 90 ml. This was a small study, but
                                  the data are of high quality compared with most other estimates, and the estimates,
                                  are based upon empirical data rather than assumptions. In this volume, a ‘worst case’
                                  intake of 100 ml for a child is assumed in calculating ingestion exposure to chemicals
                                  in pool water.

                        4.1.2 Inhalation
                                  Swimmers and pool users inhale from the atmosphere just above the water’s
                                  surface, and the volume of air inhaled is a function of the intensity of effort and time.
                                  Individuals using an indoor pool also breathe air in the wider area of the building
                                  housing the pool. However, the concentration of pool-derived chemical in the pool
                                  environment will be considerably diluted in open air pools. Inhalation exposure will
                                  be largely associated with volatile substances that are lost from the water surface, but
                                  will also include some inhalation of aerosols, within a hot tub (for example) or where
                                  there is significant splashing. The normal assumption is that an adult will inhale ap-
                                  proximately 10 m3 of air during an 8-h working day (WHO, 1999). However, this
                                  will also depend on the physical effort involved. There will, therefore, be significant
                                  individual variation depending upon the type of activity and level of effort.

                        4.1.3 Dermal contact
                                  The skin will be extensively exposed to chemicals in pool water. Some may have a
                                  direct impact on the skin, eyes and mucous membranes, but chemicals present in pool
                                  water may also cross the skin of the pool, hot tub or spa user and be absorbed into the
                                  body. Two pathways have been suggested for transport across the stratum corneum
                                  (outermost layer of skin): one for lipophilic chemicals and the other for hydrophilic
                                  chemicals (Raykar et al., 1988). The extent of uptake through the skin will depend
                                  on a range of factors, including the period of contact with the water, the temperature
                                  of the water and the concentration of the chemical.

                              4.2 Source water-derived chemicals
                                     All source waters contain chemicals, some of which may be important with respect
                                     to pool, hot tub and spa safety. Water from a municipal drinking-water supply may
                                     contain organic materials (such as humic acid, which is a precursor of disinfection
                                     by-products), disinfection by-products (see Section 4.5) from previous treatment/
                                     disinfection processes, lime and alkalis, phosphates and, for chloraminated systems,
                                     monochloramines. Seawater contains high bromide concentrations. In some circum-
                                     stances, radon may also be present in water that is derived from groundwater. Under
                                     such circumstances, adequate ventilation in indoor pools and hot tubs will be an
                                     important consideration. WHO is considering radon in relation to drinking-water
                                     quality guidelines and other guidance.

                              4.3 Bather-derived chemicals
                                     Nitrogen compounds, particularly ammonia, that are excreted by bathers (in a num-
                                     ber of ways) react with free disinfectant to produce several by-products. A number of
                                     nitrogen compounds can be eluted from the skin (Table 4.1). The nitrogen content
                                     in sweat is around 1 g/l, primarily in the form of urea, ammonia, amino acids and
                                     creatinine. Depending on the circumstances, the composition of sweat varies widely.
                                     Significant amounts of nitrogen compounds can also be discharged into pool water
                                     via urine (Table 4.1). The urine release into swimming pools has been variously esti-
                                     mated to average between 25 and 30 ml per bather (Gunkel & Jessen, 1988) and be
                                     as high as 77.5 ml per bather (Erdinger et al., 1997a), although this area has not been
                                     well researched.
                                        The distribution of total nitrogen in urine among relevant nitrogen compounds
                                     (Table 4.1) has been calculated from statistically determined means of values based on
                                     24-h urine samples. Although more than 80% of the total nitrogen content in urine
                                     is present in the form of urea and the ammonia content (at approximately 5%) is
                                     low, swimming pool water exhibits considerable concentrations of ammonia-derived
                                     compounds in the form of combined chlorine and nitrate. It therefore appears that
                                     there is degradation of urea following chemical reactions with chlorine.

                                           In a study on the fate of chlorine and organic materials in swimming pools using
                                       analogues of body fluids and soiling in a model pool, the results showed that organic
                                       carbon, chloramines and trihalomethanes all reached a steady state after 200–500 h
                                       of operation. Only insignificant amounts of the volatile by-products were found to
                                       be lost to the atmosphere, and only nitrate was found to accumulate, accounting for
                                       4–28% of the dosed amino nitrogen (Judd & Bullock, 2003). No information is
                                       available on concentrations of chemicals in actual swimming pool water from cosmet-
                                       ics, suntan oil, soap residues, etc.

                              4.4 Management-derived chemicals
                                       A number of management-derived chemicals are added to pool water in order to
                                       achieve the required water quality. A proportion of pool water is constantly undergo-
                                       ing treatment, which generally includes filtration (often in conjunction with coagula-
                                       tion), pH correction and disinfection (see Chapter 5).

                           4.4.1 Disinfectants
                                       A range of disinfectants are used in swimming pools and similar environments. The
                                       most common are outlined in Table 4.2 (and covered in more detail in Chapter 5).
                                       They are added in order to inactivate pathogens and other nuisance microorganisms.
                                       Chlorine, in one of its various forms, is the most widely used disinfectant.
                                          Some disinfectants, such as ozone and UV, kill or inactivate microorganisms as
                                       the water undergoes treatment, but there is no lasting disinfectant effect or ‘residual’
                                       that reaches the pool and continues to act upon chemicals and microorganisms in the
                                       water. Thus, where these types of disinfection are used, a chlorine- or bromine-type
                                       disinfectant is also employed to provide continued disinfection. The active available
                                       disinfectant in the water is referred to as ‘residual’ or, in the case of chlorine, ‘free’ to
                                       distinguish it from combined chlorine (which is not a disinfectant). In the case of

                               bromine, as the combined form is also a disinfectant, there is no need to distinguish
                               between the two, so ‘total’ bromine is measured.
                                  The type and form of disinfectant need to be chosen with respect to the specific require-
                               ments of the pool. In the case of small and domestic pools, important requirements are
                               easy handling and ease of use as well as effectiveness. In all cases, the choice of disinfectant
                               must be made after consideration of the efficacy of a disinfectant under the circumstances
                               of use (more details are given in Chapter 5) and the ability to monitor disinfectant levels.

                            1. Chlorine-based disinfectants
                               Chlorination is the most widely used pool water disinfection method, usually in the
                               form of chlorine gas, sodium, calcium or lithium hypochlorite but also with chlori-
                               nated isocyanurates. These are all loosely referred to as ‘chlorine’.
                                   Practice varies widely around the world, as do the levels of free chlorine that are
                               currently considered to be acceptable in order to achieve adequate disinfection while
                               minimizing user discomfort. For example, free chlorine levels of less than 1 mg/l are
                               considered acceptable in some countries, while in other countries allowable levels may
                               be considerably higher. Due to the nature of hot tubs (warmer water, often accompa-
                               nied by aeration and a greater user to water volume ratio), acceptable free chlorine lev-
                               els tend to be higher than in swimming pools. It is recommended that acceptable lev-
                               els of free chlorine continue to be set at the local level, but in public and semi-public
                               pools these should not exceed 3 mg/l and in public/semi-public hot tubs these should
                               not exceed 5 mg/l. Lower free chlorine concentrations may be health protective when
                               combined with other good management practices (e.g. pre-swim showering, effective
                               coagulation and filtration, etc.) or when ozone or UV is also used.
                                   Using high levels of chlorine (up to 20 mg/l) as a shock dose (see Chapter 5) as a
                               preventive measure or to correct specific problems may be part of a strategy of proper
                               pool management. While it should not be used to compensate for inadequacies of
                               other management practices, periodic shock dosing can be an effective tool to main-
                               tain microbial quality of water and to minimize build-up of biofilms and chloramines
                               (see Sections 4.5 and 5.3.4).
                                   Chlorine in solution at the concentrations recommended is considered to be
                               toxicologically acceptable even for drinking-water; the WHO health-based guideline
                               value for chlorine in drinking-water is 5 mg/l (WHO, 2004). Concentrations signifi-
                               cantly in excess of this may not be of health significance with regard to ingestion (as
                               no adverse effect level was identified in the study used), even though there might be
                               some problems regarding eye and mucous membrane irritation. The primary issues
                               would then become acceptability to swimmers.
                                   The chlorinated isocyanurates are stabilized chlorine compounds, which are widely
                               used in the disinfection of outdoor or lightly loaded swimming pools. They dissociate
                               in water to release free chlorine in equilibrium with cyanuric acid. A residual of cy-
                               anuric acid and a number of chlorine/cyanuric acid products will be present in the wa-
                               ter. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants
                               (JECFA) has considered the chlorinated isocyanurates with regard to drinking-water
                               disinfection and proposed a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for anhydrous sodium dichlo-
                               roisocyanurate (NaDCC) of 0–2 mg/kg of body weight (JECFA, 2004). This would
                               translate into an intake of 20 mg of NaDCC per day (or 11.7 mg of cyanuric acid per
                               day) for a 10-kg child. To avoid consuming the TDI, assuming 100 ml of pool water is

layout Safe Water.indd 86                                                                                                         24.2.2006 9:57:06
                                  swallowed in a session would mean that the concentration of cyanuric acid/chlorinated
                                  isocyanurates should be kept below 117 mg/l. Levels of cyanuric acid should be kept
                                  between 50 and 100 mg/l in order not to interfere with the release of free chlorine,
                                  and it is recommended that levels should not exceed 100 mg/l. However, although no
                                  comprehensive surveys are available, there are a number of reported measurements of
                                  high levels of cyanuric acid in pools and hot tubs in the USA. Sandel (1990) found
                                  an average concentration of 75.9 mg/l with a median of 57.5 mg/l and a maximum of
                                  406 mg/l. Other studies have reported that 25% of pools (122 of 486) had cyanuric
                                  acid concentrations greater than 100 mg/l (Rakestraw, 1994) and as high as 140 mg/l
                                  (Latta, 1995). Unpublished data from the Olin Corporation suggest that levels up to
                                  500 mg/l may be found. Regular dilution with fresh water (see Chapter 5) is required
                                  in order to keep cyanuric acid at an acceptable concentration.

                            2. Chlorine dioxide
                                  Chlorine dioxide is not classed as a chlorine-based disinfectant, as it acts in a different
                                  way and does not produce free chlorine. Chlorine dioxide breaks down to chlorite and
                                  chlorate, which will remain in solution; the WHO health-based drinking-water provi-
                                  sional guideline value for chlorite is 0.7 mg/l (based on a TDI of 0.03 mg/kg of body
                                  weight) (WHO, 2004), and this is also the provisional guideline for chlorate. There is
                                  potential for a build-up of chlorite/chlorate in recirculating pool water with time. In or-
                                  der to remain within the TDI levels of chlorate and chlorite, they should be maintained
                                  below 3 mg/l (assuming a 10-kg child and an intake of 100 ml).

                            3. Bromine-based disinfectants
                                  Liquid bromine is not commonly used in pool disinfection. Bromine-based disinfec-
                                  tants for pools are available in two forms, bromochlorodimethylhydantoin (BCDMH)
                                  and a two-part system that consists of sodium bromide and an oxidizer (usually hy-
                                  pochlorite). As with chlorine-based disinfectants, local practice varies, and acceptable
                                  total bromine may be as high as 10 mg/l. Although there is limited evidence about
                                  bromine toxicity, it is recommended that total bromine does not exceed 2.0–2.5 mg/l.
                                  The use of bromine-based disinfectants is generally not practical for outdoor pools and
                                  spas because the bromine residual is depleted rapidly in sunlight (MDHSS, undated).
                                     There are reports that a number of swimmers in brominated pools develop eye
                                  and skin irritation (Rycroft & Penny, 1983). However, Kelsall & Sim (2001) in a
                                  study examining three different pool disinfection systems (chlorine, chlorine/ozone
                                  and bromine/ozone) did not find that the bromine disinfection system was associated
                                  with a greater risk of skin rashes, although the number of bathers studied was small.

                            4. Ozone and ultraviolet
                                  Ozone and UV radiation purify the pool water as it passes through the plant room,
                                  and neither leaves residual disinfectant in the water. They are, therefore, used in con-
                                  junction with conventional chlorine- and bromine-based disinfectants. The primary
                                  health issue in ozone use in swimming pool disinfection is the leakage of ozone into
                                  the atmosphere from ozone generators and contact tanks, which need to be properly
                                  ventilated to the outside atmosphere. It is also appropriate to include a deozonation
                                  step in the treatment process, to prevent carry-over in the treated water. Ozone is a
                                  severe respiratory irritant, and it is, therefore, important that ozone concentrations in
                                  the atmosphere of the pool building are controlled. The air quality guideline value

                                of 0.12 mg/m3 (WHO, 2000) is an appropriate concentration to protect bathers and
                                staff working in the pool building.

                             5. Other disinfectants
                                Other disinfectant systems may be used, especially in small pools. Hydrogen peroxide
                                used with silver and copper ions will normally provide low levels of the silver and cop-
                                per ions in the water. However, it is most important that proper consideration is given
                                to replacement of water to prevent excessive build-up of the ions. A similar situation
                                would apply to biguanide, which is also used as a disinfectant in outdoor pools.

                          4.4.2 pH correction
                                The chemical required for pH value adjustment will generally depend on whether
                                the disinfectant used is itself alkaline or acidic. Alkaline disinfectants (e.g. sodium
                                hypochlorite) normally require only the addition of an acid for pH correction, usually
                                a solution of sodium hydrogen sulfate, carbon dioxide or hydrochloric acid. Acidic
                                disinfectants (e.g. chlorine gas) normally require the addition of an alkali, usually a
                                solution of sodium carbonate (soda ash). There should be no adverse health effects
                                associated with the use of these chemicals provided that they are dosed correctly and
                                the pH range is maintained between 7.2 and 8.0 (see Section 5.10.3).

                          4.4.3 Coagulants
                                Coagulants (e.g. polyaluminium chloride) may be used to enhance the removal of
                                dissolved, colloidal or suspended material. These work by bringing the material out
                                of solution or suspension as solids and then clumping the solids together to produce
                                a floc. The floc is then trapped during filtration.

                            4.5 Disinfection by-products (DBP)
                                Disinfectants can react with other chemicals in the water to give rise to by-products (Table
                                4.3). Most information available relates to the reactions of chlorine, as will be seen from
                                Tables 4.4–4.11. Although there is potentially a large number of chlorine-derived disinfec-
                                tion by-products, the substances produced in the greatest quantities are the trihalometh-
                                anes (THMs), of which chloroform is generally present in the greatest concentration, and
                                the haloacetic acids (HAAs), of which di- and trichloroacetic acid are generally present in
                                the greatest concentrations (WHO, 2000). It is probable that a range of organic chlora-
                                mines could be formed, depending on the nature of the precursors and pool conditions.
                                Data on their occurrence in swimming pool waters are relatively limited, although they
                                are important in terms of atmospheric contamination in enclosed pools and hot tubs.
                                   When inorganic bromide is present in the water, this can be oxidized to form
                                bromine, which will also take part in the reaction to produce brominated by-products
                                such as the brominated THMs. This means that the bromide/hypochlorite system of
                                disinfection would be expected to give much higher proportions of the brominated
                                by-products. Seawater pools disinfected with chlorine would also be expected to show
                                a high proportion of brominated by-products since seawater contains significant levels
                                of bromide. Seawater pools might also be expected to show a proportion of iodinated
                                by-products in view of the presence of iodide in the water. In all pools in which free
                                halogen (i.e. chlorine, bromine or iodine) is the primary disinfectant, no matter what
                                form the halogen donor takes, there will be a range of by-products, but these will be

                                      UV is a physical system and is generally not considered to produce by-products



                                  found at significantly lower concentrations than the THMs and HAAs. The use of
                                  ozone in the presence of bromide can lead to the formation of bromate, which can
                                  build up over time without adequate dilution with fresh water (see Chapter 5).
                                      While chlorination has been relatively well studied, it must be emphasized that
                                  data on ozonation by-products and other disinfectants are very limited. Although
                                  those by-products found commonly in ozonated drinking-water would be expected,
                                  there appear to be few data on the concentrations found in swimming pools and
                                  similar environments.
                                      Both chlorine and bromine will react, extremely rapidly, with ammonia in the wa-
                                  ter, to form chloramines (monochloramine, dichloramine and nitrogen trichloride)
                                  and bromamines (collectively known as haloamines). The mean content of urea and
                                  ammonia in urine is 10 240 mg/l and 560 mg/l, respectively (Table 4.1), but hydro-
                                  lysis of urea will give rise to more ammonia in the water (Jandik, 1977). Nitrogen-
                                  containing organic compounds, such as amino acids, may react with hypochlorite to
                                  form organic chloramines (Taras, 1953; Isaak & Morris, 1980).
                                      During storage, chlorate can build up within sodium hypochlorite solution, and this
                                  can contribute to chlorate levels in disinfected water. However, it is unlikely to be of con-

                                cern to health unless the concentrations are allowed to reach excessive levels (i.e. >3 mg/l),
                                in which case the efficacy of the hypochlorite is likely to be compromised.
                                   Ozone can react with residual bromide to produce bromate, which is quite stable
                                and can build up over time (Grguric et al., 1994). This is of concern in drinking-water
                                systems but will be of lower concern in swimming pools. However, if ozone were
                                used to disinfect seawater pools, the concentration of bromate would be expected to
                                be potentially much higher. In addition, bromate is a by-product of the electrolytic
                                generation of hypochlorite if the brine used is high in bromide. Ozone also reacts
                                with organic matter to produce a range of oxygenated substances, including aldehydes
                                and carboxylic acids. Where bromide is present, it can also result in the formation of
                                brominated products similar to liquid bromine.
                                   More data are required on the impact of UV on disinfection by-products when
                                used in conjunction with residual disinfectants. UV disinfection is not considered to
                                produce by-products, and it seems to significantly reduce the levels of chloramines.

                          4.5.1 Exposure to disinfection by-products
                                While swimming pools have not been studied to the same extent as drinking-water,
                                there are some data on the occurrence and concentrations of a number of disinfec-
                                tion by-products in pool water, although the data are limited to a small number of
                                the major substances. A summary of the concentrations of various prominent organic
                                by-products of chlorination (THMs, HAAs, haloacetonitriles and others) measured
                                in different pools is provided in Table 4.4 and Tables 4.9–4.11 below. Many of these
                                data are relatively old and may reflect past management practices. Concentrations
                                will vary as a consequence of the concentration of precursor compounds, disinfectant
                                dose, residual disinfectant level, temperature and pH. The THM found in the greatest
                                concentrations in freshwater pools is chloroform, while in seawater pools, it is usually
                                bromoform (Baudisch et al., 1997; Gundermann et al., 1997).

                             1. Trihalomethanes
                                Sandel (1990) examined data from 114 residential pools in the USA and reported aver-
                                age concentrations of chloroform of 67.1 µg/l with a maximum value of 313 µg/l. In hot
                                spring pools, the median concentration of chloroform was 3.8 µg/l and the maximum
                                was 6.4 µg/l (Erdinger et al., 1997b). Fantuzzi et al. (2001) reported total THM con-
                                centrations of 17.8–70.8 µg/l in swimming pools in Italy. In a study of eight swimming
                                pools in London, Chu & Nieuwenhuijsen (2002) collected and analysed pool water
                                samples for total organic carbon (TOC) and THMs. They reported a geometric mean1
                                for all swimming pools of 5.8 mg/l for TOC, 125.2 µg/l for total THMs and 113.3 µg/l
                                for chloroform; there was a linear correlation between the number of people in the pool
                                and the concentration of THMs. The pool concentrations of disinfection by-products
                                will also be influenced by the concentration of THMs and the potential precursor com-
                                pounds in the source and make-up water.
                                   THMs are volatile in nature and can be lost from the surface of the water, so they
                                will also be found in the air above indoor pools (Table 4.5). Transport from swim-
                                ming pool water to the air will depend on a number of factors, including the concen-
                                tration in the pool water, the temperature and the amount of splashing and surface

                                  disturbance. The concentrations at different levels in the air above the pool will also
                                  depend on factors such as ventilation, the size of the building and the air circulation.
                                  Fantuzzi et al. (2001) examined THM levels in five indoor pools in Italy and found
                                  mean concentrations of total THMs in poolside air of 58.0 µg/m3 ± 22.1 µg/m3 and
                                  concentrations of 26.1 µg/m3 ± 24.3 µg/m3 in the reception area.
                                     Strähle et al. (2000) studied the THM concentrations in the blood of swimmers
                                  compared with the concentrations of THMs in pool water and ambient air (Table
                                  4.6). They showed that intake via inhalation was probably the major route of uptake
                                  of volatile components, since the concentration of THMs in the outdoor pool water
                                  was higher than the concentration in the indoor pool water, but the concentrations in
                                  air above the pool and in blood were higher in the indoor pool than in the outdoor
                                  pool. This would imply that good ventilation at pool level would be a significant
                                  contributor to minimizing exposure to THMs. Erdinger et al. (2004) found that in
                                  a study in which subjects swam with and without scuba tanks, THMs were mainly
                                  taken up by the respiratory pathway and only about one third of the total burden was
                                  taken up through the skin.
                                     Studies by Aggazzotti et al. (1990, 1993, 1995, 1998) showed that exposure to
                                  chlorinated swimming pool water and the air above swimming pools can lead to an
                                  increase in detectable THMs in both plasma and alveolar air, but the concentration in
                                  alveolar air rapidly falls after exiting the pool area (Tables 4.7 and 4.8).

                            2. Chloramines, chlorite and chlorate
                                  Exposure to chloramines in the atmosphere of indoor pools was studied in France by
                                  Hery et al. (1995) in response to complaints of eye and respiratory tract irritation by
                                  pool attendants. They found concentrations of up to 0.84 mg/m3 and that levels were
                                  generally higher in pools with recreational activities such as slides and fountains.
                                     Erdinger et al. (1999) examined the concentrations of chlorite and chlorate in
                                  swimming pools and found that while chlorite was not detectable, chlorate concen-
                                  trations varied from 1 mg/l to, in one extreme case, 40 mg/l. Strähle et al. (2000)
                                  found chlorate concentrations of up to 142 mg/l. The concentrations of chlorate
                                  in chlorine-disinfected pools were close to the limit of detection of 1 mg/l, but the
                                  mean concentration of chlorate in sodium hypochlorite-disinfected pools was about
                                  17 mg/l. Chlorate concentrations were much lower in pools disinfected with hypo-
                                  chlorite and ozone, and the chlorate levels were related to the levels in hypochlorite
                                  stock solutions.

                            3. Other disinfection by-products
                                  A number of other disinfection by-products have been examined in swimming pool
                                  water; these are summarized in Tables 4.9–4.11. Dichloroacetic acid has also been
                                  detected in swimming pool water. In a German study of 15 indoor and 3 outdoor
                                  swimming pools (Clemens & Scholer, 1992), dichloroacetic acid concentrations
                                  averaged 5.6 µg/l and 119.9 µg/l in indoor and outdoor pools, respectively. The mean
                                  concentration of dichloroacetic acid in three indoor pools in the USA was 419 µg/l
                                  (Kim & Weisel, 1998). The difference between the results of these two studies may
                                  be due to differences in the amounts of chlorine used to disinfect swimming pools,
                                  sample collection time relative to chlorination of the water, or addition or exchanges
                                  of water in the pools.

                        4.5.2 Risks associated with disinfection by-products
                                  The guideline values in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality can be used to
                                  screen for potential risks arising from disinfection by-products from swimming pools
                                  and similar environments, while making appropriate allowance for the much lower
                                  quantities of water ingested, shorter exposure periods and non-ingestion exposure. Al-
                                  though there are data to indicate that the concentrations of chlorination by-products
                                  in swimming pools and similar environments may exceed the WHO guideline values
                                  for drinking-water (WHO, 2004), available evidence indicates that for reasonably
                                  well managed pools, concentrations less than the drinking-water guideline values can
                                  be consistently achieved. Since the drinking-water guidelines are intended to reflect
                                  tolerable risks over a lifetime, this provides an additional level of reassurance. Drink-
                                  ing-water guidelines assume an intake of 2 litres per day, but as considered above,
                                  ingestion of swimming pool water is considerably less than this; recent measured data
                                  (Section 4.1.1) indicate an extreme of about 100 ml (Evans et al., 2001). Uptake via
                                  skin absorption and inhalation (in the case of THMs) is proportionally greater than
                                  from drinking-water and is significant, but the low oral intake allows a margin that
                                  can, to an extent, account for this. Under such circumstances, the risks from exposure
                                  to chlorination by-products in reasonably well managed swimming pools would be
                                  considered to be small and must be set against the benefits of aerobic exercise and the
                                  risks of infectious disease in the absence of disinfection.
                                      Levels of chlorate and chlorite in swimming pool water have not been extensively
                                  studied; however, in some cases, high chlorate concentrations have been reported,
                                  which greatly exceeded the WHO provisional drinking-water guideline (0.7 mg/l)
                                  and which would, for a child ingesting 100 ml of water, result in possible toxic effects.
                                  Exposure, therefore, needs to be minimized, with frequent dilution of pool water with
                                  fresh water, and care taken to ensure that chlorate levels do not build up in stored
                                  hypochlorite disinfectants.
                                      The chloramines and bromamines, particularly nitrogen trichloride and nitrogen
                                  tribromide, which are both volatile (Holzwarth et al., 1984), can give rise to sig-
                                  nificant eye and respiratory irritation in swimmers and pool attendants (Massin et
                                  al., 1998). In addition, nitrogen trichloride has an intense and unpleasant odour at
                                  concentrations in water as low as 0.02 mg/l (Kirk & Othmer, 1993). Studies of sub-
                                  jects using swimming pools and non-swimming attendants have shown a number of
                                  changes and symptoms that appear to be associated with exposure to the atmosphere
                                  in swimming pools. Various authors have suggested that these were associated with
                                  nitrogen trichloride exposure in particular (Carbonnelle et al., 2002; Thickett et al.,
                                  2002; Bernard et al., 2003), although the studies were unable to confirm the specific
                                  chemicals that were the cause of the symptoms experienced. Symptoms are likely to be
                                  particularly pronounced in those suffering from asthma. Yoder et al. (2004) reported
                                  two incidents, between 2001 and 2002, where a total of 52 people were adversely af-
                                  fected by a build-up of chloramines in indoor pool water. One of the incidents related
                                  to a hotel pool, and 32 guests reported coughs, eye and throat irritation and difficulty
                                  in breathing. Both incidents were attributed to chloramines on the basis of the clinical
                                  syndrome and setting. Hery et al. (1995) found that complaints from non-swimmers
                                  were initiated at a concentration of 0.5 mg/m3 chlorine species (expressed in units
                                  of nitrogen trichloride) in the atmosphere of indoor pools and hot tubs. It is recom-
                                  mended that 0.5 mg/m3 would be suitable as a provisional value for chlorine species,

                                expressed as nitrogen trichloride, in the atmosphere of indoor swimming pools and
                                similar environments. However, more specific data are needed on the potential for
                                exacerbation of asthma in affected individuals, since this is a significant proportion of
                                the population in some countries. There is also a potential issue regarding those that
                                are very frequent pool users and who may be exposed for longer periods per session,
                                such as competitive swimmers. It is particularly important that the management of
                                pools used for such purposes is optimized in order to reduce the potential for exposure
                                (Section 5.9).

                            4.6 Risks associated with plant and equipment malfunction
                                Chemical hazards can arise from malfunction of plant and associated equipment. This
                                hazard can be reduced, if not eliminated, through proper installation and effective
                                routine maintenance programmes. The use of gas detection systems and automatic
                                shutdown can also be an effective advance warning of plant malfunction. The use of
                                remote monitoring is becoming more commonplace in after-hours response to plant
                                and equipment malfunction or shutdown.

                    CHAPTER 5
                    Managing water and air quality




                             T  his chapter builds upon the background provided in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 and
                                provides guidance relating to water and air quality management (risk management
                             specific to certain microbial hazards is covered in greater detail in Chapter 3). The
                             primary water and air quality health challenges to be dealt with are, in typical order
                             of public health priority:
                                • controlling clarity to minimize injury hazard;
                                • controlling water quality to prevent the transmission of infectious disease; and
                                • controlling potential hazards from disinfection by-products.
                                All of these challenges can be met through a combination of the following factors:
                                • treatment (to remove particulates, pollutants and microorganisms), including
                                  filtration and disinfection (to remove/inactivate infectious microorganisms);
                                • pool hydraulics (to ensure effective distribution of disinfectant throughout the
                                  pool, good mixing and removal of contaminated water);
                                • addition of fresh water at frequent intervals (to dilute substances that cannot be
                                  removed from the water by treatment);
                                • cleaning (to remove biofilms from surfaces, sediments from the pool floor and
                                  particulates adsorbed to filter materials); and
                                • ventilation of indoor pools (to remove volatile disinfection by-products and radon).
                                Controlling clarity, the most important water quality criterion, involves adequate
                             water treatment, including filtration. The control of pathogens is typically achieved
                             by a combination of circulation of pool water through treatment (normally requiring
                             some form of filtration plus disinfection) and the application of a chemical residual
                             disinfectant to inactivate microorganisms introduced to the pool itself by, for instance,
                             bathers. As not all infectious agents are killed by the most frequently used residual
                             disinfectants, and as circulation through the physical treatment processes is slow, it is
                             necessary to minimize accidental faecal releases and vomit (and to respond effectively
                             to them when they occur) and to minimize the introduction of bather-shed organ-
                             isms by pre-swim hygiene. Microbial colonization of surfaces can be a problem and is
                             generally controlled through adequate levels of cleaning and disinfection. The control
                             of disinfection by-products requires dilution, selection of source waters without DBP
                             precursors (may include water pretreatment if necessary), pre-swim showering, treat-
                             ment, disinfection modification or optimization and bather education.

                             5.1 Pre-swim hygiene
                                   In some countries, it is common to shower before a swim. Showering will help to
                                   remove traces of sweat, urine, faecal matter, cosmetics, suntan oil and other potential
                                   water contaminants. Where pool users normally shower before swimming, pool water
                                   is cleaner, easier to disinfect with smaller amounts of chemicals and thus more pleas-
                                   ant to swim in. Money is saved on chemicals (offset to some extent by the extra cost
                                   of heating shower water, where necessary). The most appropriate setup for showers
                                   (e.g. private to encourage nude showering, a continuously run or automatic ‘tunnel’
                                   arrangement) will vary according to country, but pool owners and managers should
                                   actively encourage showering. Showers must run to waste and should be managed to
                                   control Legionella growth (see Chapter 3).
                                       The role of footbaths and showers in dealing with papillomavirus and foot infec-
                                   tions is under question. However, it is generally accepted that there must be some
                                   barrier between outdoor dirt and the pool in order to minimize the transfer of dirt
                                   into the pool. A foot spray is probably the best of the alternatives to footbaths. Where
                                   outdoor footwear is allowed poolside (e.g. some outdoor pools), separate poolside
                                   drainage systems can minimize the transfer of pollutants to the pool water.

                                    Toilets should be provided and located where they can be conveniently used before
                                 entering and after leaving the pool. All users should be encouraged to use the toilets
                                 before bathing to minimize urination in the pool and accidental faecal releases. If
                                 babies and toddlers (that are not toilet trained) are allowed in the pool facilities, they
                                 should, wherever possible, wear leak-proof swimwear (that will contain any urine or
                                 faecal release) and, ideally, they should have access only to small pools that can be
                                 completely drained if an accidental faecal release occurs.

                             5.2 Coagulation
                                 Coagulants (or flocculants) enhance the removal of dissolved, colloidal or suspend-
                                 ed material by bringing it out of solution or suspension as solids (coagulation), then
                                 clumping the solids together (flocculation), producing a floc, which is more easily
                                 trapped during filtration. Coagulants are particularly important in helping to remove
                                 the oocysts and cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia (Pool Water Treatment Advisorz
                                 Group, pers. comm.; Gregory, 2002), which otherwise may pass through the filter.
                                 Coagulant efficiency is dependent upon pH, which, therefore, needs to be controlled.

                             5.3 Disinfection
                                 Disinfection is part of the treatment process whereby pathogenic microorganisms
                                 are inactivated by chemical (e.g. chlorination) or physical (e.g. UV radiation) means
                                 such that they represent no significant risk of infection. Circulating pool water is
                                 disinfected during the treatment process, and the entire water body is disinfected by
                                 the application of a residual disinfectant (chlorine- or bromine-based), which partially
                                 inactivates agents added to the pool by bathers. Facilities that are difficult or impos-
                                 sible to disinfect pose a special set of problems and generally require very high rates of
                                 dilution to maintain water quality. For disinfection to occur with any biocidal chemi-
                                 cal, the oxidant demand of the water being treated must be satisfied and sufficient
                                 chemical must remain to effect disinfection.

                         5.3.1 Choosing a disinfectant
                                 Issues to be considered in the choice of a disinfectant and application system include:
                                    • safety (while occupational health and safety are not specifically covered in this
                                      volume, operator safety is an important factor to consider);
                                    • compatibility with the source water (it is necessary to either match the disinfec-
                                      tant to the pH of the source water or adjust the source water pH);
                                    • type and size of pool (e.g. disinfectant may be more readily degraded or lost
                                      through evaporation in outdoor pools);
                                    • ability to remain in water as residual after application;
                                    • bathing load; and
                                    • operation of the pool (i.e. capacity and skills for supervision and management).
                                   The disinfectant used as part of swimming pool water treatment should ideally
                                 meet the following criteria:
                                    • effective and rapid inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms;
                                    • capacity for ongoing oxidation to assist in the control of all contaminants dur-
                                      ing pool use;

                                      tants and disinfection by-products are reviewed in Chapter 4);
                                    • availability of a quick and easy measurement of the disinfectant concentration
                                      in pool water (simple analytical test methods and equipment); and
                                    • potential to measure the disinfectant concentration online to permit automatic
                                      control of disinfectant dosing and continuous recording of the values measured.

                        5.3.2 Characteristics of various disinfectants
                             1. Chlorine-based disinfectants
                                 Chlorination is the most widely used pool water disinfection method, usually in the
                                 form of chlorine gas, a hypochlorite salt (sodium, calcium, lithium) or chlorinated
                                 isocyanurates. While chlorine gas can be safely and effectively used, it does have the
                                 potential to cause serious health impacts, and care must be taken to ensure that health
                                 concerns do not arise.
                                     When chlorine gas or hypochlorite is added to water, hypochlorous acid (HOCl)
                                 is formed. Hypochlorous acid dissociates in water into its constituents H+ and OCl–
                                 (hypochlorite ion), as follows:

                                                     HOCl           ↔        H+       +       OCl–
                                                  hypochlorous            hydrogen         hypochlorite
                                                      acid                  ion                ion

                                     The degree of dissociation depends on pH and (much less) on temperature. Disso-
                                 ciation is minimal at pH levels below 6. At pH levels of 6.5–8.5, a change occurs from
                                 undissociated hypochlorous acid to nearly complete dissociation. Hypochlorous acid
                                 is a much stronger disinfectant than hypochlorite ion. At a pH of 8.0, 21% of the free
                                 chlorine exists in the hypochlorous acid form (acting as a strong, fast, oxidizing disin-
                                 fectant), while at a pH of 8.5, only 12% of that chlorine exists as hypochlorous acid.
                                 For this reason, the pH value should be kept relatively low and within defined limits
                                 (7.2–7.8 – see Section 5.10.3). Together, hypochlorous acid and OCl– are referred
                                 to as free chlorine. The usual test for chlorine detects both free and total chlorine; to
                                 determine the effectiveness of disinfection, the pH value must also be known.
                                     The chlorinated isocyanurate compounds are white crystalline compounds with a
                                 slight chlorine-type odour that provide free chlorine (as hypochlorous acid) when dis-
                                 solved in water but which serve to provide a source of chlorine that is more resistant to
                                 the effects of UV light. They are widely used in outdoor or lightly loaded pools. They
                                 are an indirect source of chlorine, and the reaction is represented by the equation:

                                              ClxH3–xCy        +      H2O      ↔      C3H3N3O        +      HOCl

                                   Free chlorine, cyanuric acid and chlorinated isocyanurate exist in equilibrium.
                                 The relative amounts of each compound are determined by the pH and free chlorine

                                concentration. As the disinfectant (HOCl) is used up, more chlorine atoms are released
                                from the chloroisocyanurates to form hypochlorous acid. This results in an enrichment
                                of cyanuric acid in the pool that cannot be removed by the water treatment process.
                                Dilution with fresh water is necessary to keep the cyanuric acid concentration at a
                                satisfactory level.
                                    The balance between free chlorine and the level of cyanuric acid is critical and can
                                be difficult to maintain. If the balance is lost because cyanuric acid levels become too
                                high, unsatisfactory microbial conditions can result. Cyanuric acid in chlorinated
                                water (whether introduced separately or present through the use of chlorinated isocy-
                                anurates) will reduce the amount of free chlorine. At low levels of cyanuric acid, there
                                is very little effect; as the cyanuric acid level increases, however, the disinfecting and
                                oxidizing properties of the free chlorine become progressively reduced. High levels of
                                cyanuric acid cause a situation known as ‘chlorine lock’, when even very high levels
                                of chlorine become totally locked with the cyanuric acid (stabilizer) and unavailable
                                as disinfectant; however, this does not occur below cyanuric acid levels of 200 mg/l.
                                It means, however, that the cyanuric acid level must be monitored and controlled
                                relative to chlorine residual, and it is recommended that cyanurate levels should not
                                exceed 100 mg/l. A simple turbidity test, where the degree of turbidity, following
                                addition of the test chemical, is proportional to the cyanuric acid concentration, can
                                be used to monitor levels. For effective disinfection, the pH value must also be moni-
                                tored, because the influence of pH on disinfection efficiency is the same as described
                                for chlorine as a disinfectant.

                             2. Bromine-based disinfectants
                                Elemental bromine is a heavy, dark red-brown, volatile liquid with fumes that are
                                toxic and irritating to eyes and respiratory tract, and it is not considered suitable for
                                swimming pool disinfection.
                                    Bromine combines with some water impurities to form combined bromine, in-
                                cluding bromamines. However, combined bromine acts as a disinfectant and produc-
                                es less sharp and offensive odours than corresponding chloramines. Bromine does not
                                oxidize ammonia and nitrogen compounds. Because of this, bromine cannot be used
                                for shock dosing. When bromine disinfectants are used, shock dosing with chlorine
                                is often necessary to oxidize ammonia and nitrogen compounds that eventually build
                                up in the water (MDHSS, undated). Hypobromous acid reacts with sunlight and
                                cannot be protected from the effects of UV light by cyanuric acid or other chemicals,
                                and thus it is more practical to use bromine disinfectants for indoor pools.
                                    For pool disinfection, bromine compounds are usually available in two forms, both
                                of which are solids:
                                   • a one-part system that is a compound (bromochlorodimethylhydantoin –
                                     BCDMH) of both bromine and chlorine, each attached to a nitrogen atom of
                                     dimethylhydantoin (DMH) as organic support for the halogens; and
                                   • a two-part system that uses a bromide salt dissolved in water, activated by addi-
                                     tion of a separate oxidizer.
                                   BCDMH is an organic compound that dissolves in water to release hypobromous
                                acid (HOBr) and hypochlorous acid. The latter reacts with bromide (Br–) (formed by a
                                reduction of hypobromous acid) to form more hypobromous acid:

                                     It can, therefore, be used both for treatment (oxidation) and to provide a residual
                                 disinfectant. Like the chlorinated isocyanurates, failure to maintain the correct re-
                                 lationship between the disinfectant residual and the organic component can result
                                 in unsatisfactory microbial conditions. The level of dimethylhydantoin in the water
                                 must be limited and should not exceed 200 mg/l. There is no poolside test kit avail-
                                 able, and the need to regularly monitor dimethylhydantoin by a qualified laboratory
                                 is a disadvantage of the use of BCDMH. On the other hand, BCDMH is relatively
                                 innocuous in storage, is easy to dose and often does not need pH correction (as it is
                                 nearly neutral and has little effect on the pH values of most water). It is mostly avail-
                                 able as tablets, cartridges or packets. BCDMH has a long shelf life and dissolves very
                                 slowly, so it may be used in floating and erosion-type feeders.
                                     The two-part bromine system consists of a bromide salt (sodium bromide) and an
                                 oxidizer (hypochlorite, ozone). The sodium bromide is dosed to the water, passing
                                 through the treatment processes, upstream of the oxidizer, which is added to activate
                                 the bromide into hypobromous acid:
                                 Br– + oxidizer              HOBr
                                    Disinfectant action returns hypobromous acid to bromide ions, which can again
                                 be reactivated. The pH value should be between 7.8 and 8.0 using this disinfection
                                 system (see also Section 5.10.3).

                             3. Ozone
                                 Ozone can be viewed as the most powerful oxidizing and disinfecting agent that is
                                 available for pool water treatment (Rice, 1995; Saunus, 1998); it is generated on site
                                 and is potentially hazardous, particularly to the plant room operators. It is unsuitable
                                 for use as a residual disinfectant, as it readily vaporizes, is toxic and is heavier than air,
                                 leading to discomfort and adverse health effects (Locher, 1996). Ozonation is, there-
                                 fore, followed by deozonation and addition of a residual disinfectant (i.e. chlorine- or
                                 bromine-based disinfectants).
                                    All of the circulating water is treated with sufficient amounts of ozone (between
                                 0.8 and 1.5 g/m3, depending on the water temperature) to satisfy the oxidant demand
                                 of the water and attain a residual of dissolved ozone for several minutes. Under these
                                 conditions, ozone oxidizes many impurities (e.g. trihalomethane [THM] precursors)
                                 and microorganisms (disinfection), thereby reducing subsequent residual disinfectant
                                 requirements within the pool water. Lower disinfectant demand allows the pool opera-
                                 tor to achieve the desired residual with a lower applied chlorine (or bromine) dose. As
                                 ozone can be inhaled by pool users and staff, excess ozone must be destroyed (forming
                                 oxygen and carbon dioxide) by deozonation (using granular activated carbon, activated


                    CHAPTER 5.    MANAGING WATER AND AIR QUALITY                                                            85

                                heat-treated anthracite or thermal destruction), and an ozone leakage detector should
                                be installed in the plant room. As residual disinfectants would also be removed by the
                                deozonation process, they are, therefore, added after this. Microbial colonization of the
                                deozonation media (especially granular activated carbon) can occur; this can be avoided
                                by ensuring that there is residual disinfectant in the incoming water stream from the
                                pool, maintaining the correct filter bed depth and an appropriate filter velocity.
                                    Chloramines are oxidized by ozone into chloride and nitrate (Eichelsdörfer &
                                Jandik, 1979, 1984), and precursors of disinfection by-products are also destroyed,
                                resulting in very low levels of THMs (<0.02 mg/l) (Eichelsdörfer et al., 1981; Eichels-
                                dörfer, 1987) and other chlorinated organics. The use of ozone in conjunction with
                                chlorine (to ensure a residual disinfectant throughout the pool or similar environ-
                                ment) is, however, considerably more expensive than that of chlorine alone.
                                    An ozone system in combination with BCDMH is also in use. However, the practice
                                is to add only small amounts of ozone to this system to oxidize only the bromide (re-
                                sulting from the spent hypobromous acid) back to hypobromous acid. Therefore, this
                                BCDMH/ozone combination allows less BCDMH to be added. Ozone can also be used
                                in combination with sodium bromide, as described above, as an oxidizer.

                             4. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                                Like ozone, the UV radiation process purifies the circulating water, without leaving a re-
                                sidual disinfectant. It inactivates microorganisms and breaks down some pollutants (e.g.
                                chloramines) by photo-oxidation, decreasing the oxidant demand of the purified water.
                                   UV disinfection can be achieved by UV irradiation at wavelengths between 200
                                and 300 nm. The following criteria are important in the selection of an appropriate
                                UV system:
                                   •   type of microorganisms to be destroyed;
                                   •   water flow rate to be treated;
                                   •   type of lamps (low or medium pressure);
                                   •   UV dose;
                                   •   water temperature; and
                                   •   rate of disinfection.
                                    For UV to be most effective, the water must be pretreated to remove turbidity-causing
                                particulate matter that prevents the penetration of the UV radiation or
                                absorbs the UV energy (Saunus, 1998). The UV lamps need to be cleaned periodi-
                                cally, as substances that build up on the lamps will reduce their pathogen inactivation
                                efficiency over time. As with ozone, it is also necessary to use a chlorine- or bromine-
                                based disinfectant to provide a residual disinfectant in the pool.

                             5. Algicides
                                Algicides are used to control algal growths, especially in outdoor pools. Algal growth
                                is possible only if the nutrients phosphate, nitrogen and potassium are present in the
                                pool water. Phosphate can be removed from the pool water by good coagulation and
                                filtration during water treatment. Algal growth is best controlled by ensuring effective

                                 be used. Quaternary ammonium and polyoximino compounds and copper salts can
                                 be used, but any based on mercury (a cumulative toxic heavy metal) should not be
                                 added to swimming pools. All should be used in strict accordance with the suppliers’
                                 instructions and should be intended for swimming pool use.

                        5.3.3 Disinfection by-products (DBP)
                                 The production of disinfection by-products (see Chapter 4) can be controlled to a
                                 significant extent by minimizing the introduction of precursors though source water
                                 selection, good bather hygienic practices (e.g. pre-swim showering – see Section 5.1),
                                 maximizing their removal by well managed pool water treatment and replacement
                                 of water by the addition of fresh supplies (i.e. dilution of chemicals that cannot be
                                 removed). It is inevitable, however, that some volatile disinfection by-products, such
                                 as chloroform and nitrogen trichloride (a chloramine), may be produced in the pool
                                 water (depending upon the disinfection system used) and escape into the air. While
                                 levels of production should be minimized, this hazard can also be managed to some
                                 extent through good ventilation (see also Section 5.9).

                        5.3.4 Disinfectant dosing
                                 The method of introducing disinfectants to the pool water influences their effectiveness,
                                 and, as illustrated in Figure 5.1, disinfectant dosing may occur pre- or post-filtration.
                                 Individual disinfectants have their own specific dosing requirements, but the following
                                 principles apply to all:
                                    • Automatic dosing is preferable: electronic sensors monitor pH and residual dis-
                                      infectant levels continuously and adjust the dosing correspondingly to maintain
                                      correct levels. Regular verification of the system (including manual tests on pool
                                      water samples) and good management are important. Section 5.10 describes the
                                      monitoring procedures.
                                    • Hand-dosing (i.e. putting chemicals directly into the pool) is rarely justified.
                                      Manual systems of dosing must be backed up by good management of opera-
                                      tion and monitoring. If manual dosing is employed, it is important that the
                                      pool is empty of bathers until the chemical has dispersed.
                                    • Dosing pumps should be designed to shut themselves off if the circulation sys-
                                      tem fails (although automatic dosing monitors should remain in operation) to
                                      ensure that chemical dispersion is interrupted. If chemical dosing continues
                                      without water circulating, then high local concentrations of the dosed chemical
                                      will occur. On resumption of the circulation system, the high concentration
                                      will progress to the pool. If, for example, both hypochlorite and acid have been
                                      so dosed, the resultant mix containing chlorine gas may be dangerous to pool
                                      users.
                                    • Residual disinfectants are generally dosed at the end of the treatment process.
                                      The treatment methods of coagulation, filtration and ozonation or ultravio-
                                      let serve to clarify the water, reduce the organic load (including precursors for
                                      the formation of disinfection by-products) and greatly reduce the microbial
                                      content, so that the post-treatment disinfection can be more effective and the
                                      amount of disinfectant required is minimized.

                                    • It is important that disinfectants and pH-adjusting chemicals are well mixed
                                      with the water at the point of dosing.
                                    • Dosing systems, like circulation, should operate 24 h a day.
                                    Shock dosing
                                    • Using a shock dose of chlorine as a preventive measure or to correct specific
                                      problems may be part of a strategy of proper pool management. Shock dos-
                                      ing is used to control a variety of pathogens and nuisance microorganisms
                                      and to destroy organic contaminants and chloramine compounds. Destroy-
                                      ing chloramines requires free chlorine levels at least 10 times the level of com-
                                      bined chlorine. As a preventive measure, routine shock dosing (which is prac-
                                      tised in some countries) typically involves raising free chlorine levels to at least
                                      10 mg/l for between 1 and 4 h. Intervention shock dosing for a water qual-
                                      ity problem (such as an accidental faecal release) may involve raising the free
                                      chlorine residual to 20 mg/l for an 8-h period while the pool is empty (see
                                      Section 5.8).
                                    • Trying to compensate for inadequacies in treatment by shock dosing is bad
                                      practice, because it can mask deficiencies in design or operation that may pro-
                                      duce other problems.
                                    • If not enough chlorine is added, the combined chlorine (chloramines) problem
                                      may be exacerbated, and conjunctival irritation and obnoxious odours in the
                                      pool area may be raised to high levels. If too much chlorine is added, it may
                                      take a long time to drop to safe levels before bathing can be resumed. Chlorine
                                      levels should return to acceptable levels (i.e. <5 mg/l – see Section 4.4.1) before
                                      bathers are permitted in the pool.

                             5.4 Filtration
                                 The primary function of filtration is to remove turbidity to achieve appropriate water
                                 clarity. Water clarity is a key factor in ensuring the safety of swimmers. Poor underwa-
                                 ter visibility is a contributing factor to injuries (Chapter 2) and can seriously hamper
                                 recognition of swimmers in distress or a body lying on the bottom of the pool.
                                     Disinfection will also be compromised by particulates. Particles can shield micro-
                                 organisms from the action of disinfectants. Alternatively, the disinfectants may react
                                 with certain components of organic particles to form complexes that are less effective
                                 than the parent compounds, or the disinfectants may oxidize the organic material,
                                 thereby eliminating disinfection potential. Filtration is often the critical step for the
                                 removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts (see Section 3.3). Filtration is
                                 also effective against microbes, notably free-living amoebae, that harbour opportunis-
                                 tic bacteria such as Legionella and Mycobacterium species.

                         5.4.1 Filter types
                                 There are a number of types of filter available, and the choice of filter will be based
                                 on several factors, including:
                                    • the quality of the source water;
                                    • the amount of filter area available and number of filters> Pools benefit greatly
                                      from the increased flexibility and safeguards of having more than one filter;

                                    • filtration rate: Typically, the higher the filtration rate, the lower the filtration
                                      efficiency;
                                    • ease of operation;
                                    • method of backwashing: The cleaning of a filter bed clogged with solids is re-
                                      ferred to as backwashing. It is accomplished by reversing the flow, fluidizing
                                      the filter material and passing pool water back through the filters to waste.
                                      Backwashing should be done as recommended by the filter manufacturer, when
                                      the allowable turbidity value has been exceeded, when a certain length of time
                                      without backwashing has passed or when a pressure differential is observed; and
                                    • degree of operator training required.

                             1. Cartridge filters
                                 Cartridge filters can nominally filter down to 7 µm and last up to two years. The filter
                                 medium is spun-bound polyester or treated paper. Cleaning is achieved by removing
                                 the cartridge and washing it. Their main advantage is the relatively small space re-
                                 quirement compared with other filter types, and they are often used with small pools
                                 and hot tubs.

                             2. Sand filters
                                 Medium-rate sand filters can nominally filter down to about 7 µm in size with the
                                 addition of a suitable coagulant (such as polyaluminium chloride or aluminium hy-
                                 droxychloride). Cleaning is achieved by manual reverse flow backwashing, with air
                                 scouring to remove body oils and fats to improve the backwash efficiency. For indoor
                                 heated pools, the sand medium typically has a life of between five and seven years.
                                 Medium-rate sand filters are comparatively large-diameter pressure vessels (in a hori-
                                 zontal or vertical format) and require large plant rooms. Drinking-water treatment
                                 has shown that when operated with a coagulant, sand filters can remove over 99% of
                                 Cryptosporidium oocysts. Studies in a pilot sand filtration plant under swimming pool
                                 filtration conditions have shown that without the addition of coagulant, removal of
                                 the Cryptosporidium oocyst surrogate (fluorescent polystyrene particles sized between
                                 1 and 7 µm) was less than 50%. Using coagulants, polyaluminium chloride and poly-
                                 aluminium silicate sulfate improved the removal up to 99% (Pool Water Treatment
                                 Advisory Group, pers. comm.).

                             3. Ultrafine filters
                                 Ultrafine precoat filters (UFF) use a replaceable filter medium that is added after each
                                 backwash. Filter media include diatomaceous earth, diatomite products and perlite.
                                 The benefit of precoat filtration is that it can provide a particle removal of 1–2 µm
                                 and, as such, provide good removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Table 5.1 compares
                                 the alternative filter types.

                        5.4.2 Turbidity measurement
                                 Turbidity is a measure of the amount of suspended matter in water, and the more
                                 turbid the water, the less clarity. Turbidity needs to be controlled both for safety and
                                 for effective disinfection. For identifying bodies at the bottom of the pool, a universal
                                 turbidity value is not considered to be appropriate, as much depends on the charac-
                                 teristics of the individual pool, such as surface reflection and pool material/construc-
                                 tion. Individual standards should be developed, based on risk assessment at each pool,

                                    but it is recommended that, as a minimum, it should be possible to see a small child
                                    at the bottom of the pool from the lifeguard position while the water surface is in
                                    movement, as in normal use. An alternative is to maintain water clarity so that lane
                                    markings or other features on the pool bottom at its greatest depth are clearly visible
                                    when viewed from the side of the pool. Operators could determine these indicators as
                                    a turbidity equivalent through experience and then monitor routinely for turbidity.
                                    In terms of effective disinfection, a useful, but not absolute, upper-limit guideline for
                                    turbidity is 0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), determined by the nephelomet-
                                    ric method (ISO, 1999).

                             5.5 Dilution
                                    Coagulation, filtration and disinfection will not remove all pollutants. Swimming
                                    pool design should enable the dilution of pool water with fresh water. Dilution limits
                                    the build-up of pollutants from bathers (e.g. constituents of sweat and urine), of by-
                                    products of disinfection and of various other dissolved chemicals. Dilution rates need
                                    to account for the replacement of water used in filter backwashing, evaporation and
                                    splash-out. As a general rule, the addition of fresh water to disinfected pools should
                                    not be less than 30 litres per bather.

                             5.6 Circulation and hydraulics
                                    The purpose of paying close attention to circulation and hydraulics is to ensure that
                                    the whole pool is adequately served by filtered, disinfected water. Treated water must

                                 get to all parts of the pool, and polluted water must be removed – especially from
                                 areas most used and most polluted by bathers. It is recommended that 75–80% be
                                 taken from the surface (where the pollution is greatest – Gansloser et al., 1999), with
                                 the remainder taken from the bottom of the pool. The bottom returns allow the
                                 removal of grit and improved circulation within the pool. Without good circulation
                                 and hydraulics, even water treatment may not give adequate pool water quality.
                                     The circulation rate is defined as the flow of water to and from the pool through all
                                 the pipework and the treatment system. The appropriate circulation rate depends, in
                                 most cases, on bathing load. There are, however, some types of pool where circulation
                                 rate cannot realistically be derived from bathing load – diving pools and other waters
                                 more than 2 m deep, for example, where the bathing load relative to water volume
                                 may be very low. Circulation rate is related to turnover period, which is the time taken
                                 for a volume of water equivalent to the entire pool water volume to pass through the
                                 filters and treatment plant and back to the pool. Turnover periods must, however, also
                                 suit the particular type of pool (see Box 5.1 for an example of guidance); this is related
                                 to the likely pollution load based on the type of activity undertaken and the volume
                                 of water within the pool. Where pools have moveable floors, the turnover should be
                                 calculated based upon the shallowest depth achievable. Formulae are available for
                                 calculating turnover rates, and these should be employed at the design stage. Box 5.1
                                 gives some examples of turnover periods that have been employed in the UK.

                      BOX 5.1 EXAMPLES OF TURNOVER PERIODS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF POOLS
                    In the United Kingdom (BSI, 2003), the following turnover periods for different types of pools have
                    been recommended:

                             5.7 Bathing load
                                 Bathing load is a measure of the number of people in the pool. For a new pool, the
                                 bathing load should be estimated at the design stage.
                                    There are many factors that determine the maximum bathing load for a pool; these
                                 include:
                                    • area of water – in terms of space for bathers to move around in and physical safety;
                                    • depth of water – the deeper the water, the more actual swimming there is and
                                      the more area a bather requires;

                                        • pool type and bathing activity.
                                       Pool operators need to be aware of the maximum bathing load and should ensure
                                    that it is not exceeded during the operation of the pool. Where the maximum bathing
                                    load has not been established, it has been suggested in the UK that the figures in Table
                                    5.2 (BSI, 2003) can provide an approximation. These figures may not be appropriate
                                    for all pool types or all countries.

                             5.8 Accidental release of faeces or vomit into pools
                                    Accidental faecal releases may occur relatively frequently, although it is likely that most
                                    go undetected. Accidental faecal releases into swimming pools and similar environments
                                    can lead to outbreaks of infections associated with faecally-derived viruses, bacteria and
                                    pathogenic protozoa (Chapter 3); vomit may have a similar effect. A pool operator
                                    faced with an accidental faecal release or vomit in the pool water must, therefore, act
                                    immediately.
                                        If the faecal release is a solid stool, it should simply be retrieved quickly and discarded
                                    appropriately. The scoop used to retrieve it should be disinfected so that any bacteria
                                    and viruses adhering to it are inactivated and will not be returned to the pool the next
                                    time the scoop is used. As long as the pool is, in other respects, operating properly (i.e.
                                    disinfectant levels are maintained), no further action is necessary. The same applies to
                                    solid animal faeces.
                                        If the stool is runny (diarrhoea) or if there is vomit, the situation is more likely to be
                                    hazardous, as the faeces or vomit is more likely to contain pathogens. Even though most
                                    disinfectants deal relatively well with many bacterial and viral agents in accidental faecal
                                    releases and vomit, the possibility exists that the diarrhoea or vomit is from someone in-
                                    fected with one of the protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The infectious
                                    stages (oocysts/cysts) are resistant to chlorine disinfectants in the concentrations that are
                                    practical to use. The pool should therefore be cleared of bathers immediately.
                                        The safest action, if the incident has occurred in a small pool or hot tub, is to empty
                                    and clean it before refilling and reopening. However, this is practically impossible in
                                    many larger pools, for reasons of cost and extended periods of closure. If draining down
                                    is not possible, then a procedure based on the one given below should be followed (it
                                    should be noted, however, that this is an imperfect solution that will only reduce but
                                    not eliminate risk):
                                        • The pool should be cleared of people immediately.
                                        • As much of the material as possible should be collected, removed and disposed
                                          of to waste; this may be done through netting, sweeping and/or vacuuming
                                          (provided the equipment can be adequately disinfected after use).

                                      or chlorination to 20 mg/l at pH 7.2–7.5 for 8 h (shock dosing) should be
                                      performed.
                                    • Using a coagulant (if appropriate), the water should be filtered for six turnover
                                      cycles; this may mean closing the pool until the next day.
                                    • The filter should be backwashed (and the water run to waste).
                                    • The final residual disinfectant level and pH value should be checked, and if
                                      satisfactory, then the pool can be reopened.
                                     The willingness of operators and lifeguards to act is critical. Pool operators are un-
                                 likely to know with certainty what has caused a diarrhoea incident, and a significant
                                 proportion of such diarrhoea incidents may happen without lifeguards being aware
                                 of them. The most important contribution a pool operator can make to the problem
                                 is to guard against it. There are a few practical actions pool operators can take to help
                                 prevent faecal release into pools:
                                    • No child (or adult) with a recent history of diarrhoea should swim.
                                    • Parents should be encouraged to make sure their children use the toilet before
                                      they swim, and babies and toddlers that have not been toilet trained should ide-
                                      ally wear waterproof nappies or specially designed bathing wear.
                                    • Young children should whenever possible be confined to pools small enough to
                                      drain in the event of an accidental release of faeces or vomit.
                                    • Lifeguards should be made responsible for looking out for and acting on ac-
                                      cidental faecal release/vomit incidents.


                             5.9 Air quality
                                 Air quality in indoor swimming pool facilities is important for a number of reasons,
                                 including:
                                    • Staff and user health. The quantity of water treatment by-products, concentra-
                                      tion of airborne particulate matter and fresh air need to be controlled. The two
                                      areas of principal concern for health are Legionella and disinfection by-products,
                                      particularly chloramines. Although Legionella should primarily be controlled
                                      in the water systems, areas housing natural spas (thermal water) and hot tubs
                                      should also be well ventilated. Reducing exposure to disinfection by-products in
                                      air should be pursued in order to minimize overall exposure to these chemicals,
                                      as inhalation appears to be the dominant route of exposure during recreational
                                      water use (see Chapter 4). As concentrations of disinfection by-products de-
                                      crease rapidly with distance from the water, this has implications for ventilation
                                      design, which involves both mixing and dilution (i.e. with fresh air), and build-
                                      ing codes should stipulate appropriate ventilation rates (at least 10 litres of fresh
                                      air/s/m2 of water surface area).
                                    • Staff and user comfort. The temperature, humidity and velocity of the pool hall
                                      air should be appropriate to provide a comfortable environment.
                                    • Impact on the building fabric. The air temperature, concentration of airborne
                                      particulate matter and quantity of water treatment by-products need to be con-
                                      trolled in order to avoid an ‘aggressive environment’ that may damage the build-
                                      ing fabric.

                         5.10 Monitoring
                                Parameters that are easy and inexpensive to measure reliably and of immediate op-
                                erational health relevance (such as turbidity, residual disinfectant and pH) should
                                be monitored most frequently and in all pool types. Whether any other parameters
                                (physical, chemical and microbial) need to be monitored is, in practice, determined
                                by management capacity, intensity of use and local practice. However, microbial
                                monitoring is generally needed in public and semi-public pools.
                                    There should be pre-established (clear, written) procedures set up by managers for
                                acting on the results of monitoring, including how to act on any unexpected results.
                                Operators must know what to do themselves or how to ensure that appropriate action
                                is taken by someone else. Management should review data and test systems regularly
                                and ensure that pool operators have taken appropriate remedial action.

                      5.10.1 Turbidity
                                Turbidity testing is simple; approaches to establishing appropriate, facility-specific
                                turbidity standards are described in Section 5.4.2. Exceedance of a turbidity stan-
                                dard suggests both a significant deterioration in water quality and a significant health
                                hazard. Such exceedance merits immediate investigation and should lead to facility
                                closure unless the turbidity can rapidly be brought within standards.

                      5.10.2 Residual disinfectant level
                                National or other standards for minimum and maximum levels of residual disinfec-
                                tant vary widely. The main factor is that the residual disinfectant level should always
                                be consistent with satisfactory microbial quality.
                                   Failure to maintain target residual disinfectant should result in immediate in-
                                vestigation and follow-up testing. If residuals cannot be rapidly re-established and
                                maintained, then full investigation of cause and prevention of repetition are merited,
                                and public health authorities should be consulted in determining whether the facility
                                should remain open.

                             1. Chlorine-based disinfectants
                                For a conventional public or semi-public swimming pool with good hydraulics and
                                filtration, operating within its design bathing load and turnover and providing fre-
                                quent (or online) monitoring of chlorine and pH, experience has shown that ad-
                                equate routine disinfection should be achieved with a free chlorine level of 1 mg/l
                                throughout the pool. Free chlorine levels well above 1.2 mg/l should not be necessary
                                anywhere in the pool unless the pool is not well designed or well operated – if, for
                                example, circulation is too slow, distribution is poor or bathing loads are too heavy;
                                where this is the case, it is more appropriate in the long term to deal with the underly-
                                ing problem, rather than increasing disinfection levels.
                                    Experience suggests that the combined chlorine level within pool water (chloramines)
                                should be no more than half the free chlorine level (but combined chlorine should be as
                                low as possible and ideally less than 0.2 mg/l). If the levels are high, then it is likely that
                                there is too much ammonia in the water, indicating that bathing loads or pollution from
                                bathers may be too high, that dilution is too low or that treatment is suboptimal.
                                       Lower free chlorine concentrations (0.5 mg/l or less) will be adequate where
                                   chlorine is used in conjunction with ozone or UV disinfection. Higher concentra-

                    94                                                GUIDELINES FOR SAFE RECREATIONAL WATER ENVIRONMENTS




layout Safe Water.indd 116                                                                                                        24.2.2006 9:57:18
                                 tions (up to 2–3 mg/l) may be required to ensure disinfection in hot tubs, because of
                                 higher bathing loads and higher temperatures.
                                    If the chlorine source is chlorinated isocyanurate compounds, then the level of
                                 cyanuric acid must also be monitored and controlled; if it becomes too high (above
                                 100 mg/l), microbial conditions may become unsatisfactory, and increased freshwater
                                 dilution is required.

                             2. Bromine-based disinfectants
                                 Total bromine levels in swimming pools, should ideally be maintained at 2.0–2.5 mg/l.
                                 When bromine-based disinfectants are used in combination with ozone, the concentra-
                                 tion of bromide ion should be monitored and maintained at 15–20 mg/l. If BCDMH
                                 is the bromine source, the level of dimethylhydantoin must also be monitored; it should
                                 not exceed 200 mg/l.

                             3. Sampling and analysis
                                 In public and many semi-public pools, there will be continuous monitoring of residual
                                 disinfectant levels as the disinfectant is dosed (see Section 5.3.4). In addition to this, sam-
                                 ples should also be taken from the pool itself. In public and semi-public pools, residual
                                 disinfectant concentrations should be checked by sampling the pool before it opens and
                                 during the opening period (ideally during a period of high bathing load). The frequency
                                 of testing while the swimming pool is in use depends upon the nature and use of the
                                 pool. It is suggested that the residual disinfectant concentration in domestic pools be
                                 checked before use. All tests must be carried out immediately after the sample is taken.
                                    Samples should be taken at a depth of 5–30 cm. It is good practice to include as a
                                 routine sampling point the area of the pool where, because of the hydraulics, the dis-
                                 infectant residual is generally lowest. Occasional samples should be taken from other
                                 parts of the pool and circulation system.
                                    The tests employed should be capable of determining free chlorine and total bro-
                                 mine levels (depending upon the disinfectant used). Analysis is generally performed
                                 with simple test kits based on the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method,
                                 using either liquid or tablet reagents. This method can measure both free and total
                                 disinfectant and is available as both colorimetric and titration test kits.

                      5.10.3 pH
                                 The pH of swimming pool water should be controlled to ensure efficient disinfection
                                 and coagulation, to avoid damage to the pool fabric and ensure user comfort. The
                                 pH should be maintained between 7.2 and 7.8 for chlorine disinfectants and between
                                 7.2 and 8.0 for bromine-based and other non-chlorine processes. The frequency of
                                 measurement will depend upon the type of pool. It is suggested that for public pools,
                                 the pH value should be measured continuously and adjusted automatically; for other
                                 semi-public pools and public and semi-public hot tubs, it is suggested that monitor-
                                 ing be conducted several times a day, during operating hours; for domestic pools, it is
                                 advisable to measure prior to pool use. Actions to be taken on failure to maintain pH
                                 within the target range are similar to those for disinfectant residual.

                      5.10.4 Oxidation–reduction potential (ORP)
                                The oxidation–reduction potential (also known as ORP or redox) can also be used
                                in the operational monitoring of disinfection efficacy. In general terms for swimming
                                pools and similar environments, levels in excess of 720 mV (measured using a silver/
                                silver chloride electrode) or 680 mV (using a calomel electrode) suggest that the water
                                is in good microbial condition, although it is suggested that appropriate values should
                                be determined on a case-by-case basis.

                      5.10.5 Microbial quality
                                There is limited risk of significant microbial contamination and illness in a well
                                managed pool with an adequate residual disinfectant concentration, a pH value
                                maintained at an appropriate level, well operated filters and frequent monitoring of
                                non-microbial parameters. Nevertheless, samples of pool water from public and semi-
                                public pools should be monitored at appropriate intervals for microbial parameters.
                                Such tests do not guarantee microbial safety but serve to provide information with
                                which to judge the effectiveness of measures taken.

                             1. ‘Indicator’ organisms
                                As outlined in Chapter 3, monitoring for potential microbial hazards is generally
                                done using ‘indicator’ microorganisms, rather than specific microbial hazards (see
                                Box 3.1). Microorganisms used to assess the microbial quality of pools and similar
                                environments include heterotrophic plate count (HPC), thermotolerant coliforms,
                                E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Where
                                operational guidelines are exceeded, pool operators should check turbidity, residual
                                disinfectant levels and pH and then resample. When critical guidelines are exceeded,
                                the pool should be closed while investigation and remediation are conducted.
                                HPC
                                The HPC (37 °C for 24 h) gives an indication of the overall bacterial population within
                                the pool. This should be monitored in public and semi-public disinfected swimming
                                pools. It is recommended that operational levels should be less than 200 cfu/ml.
                                Thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli
                                Thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli are indicators of faecal contamination. Either
                                thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli should be measured in all public and semi-public
                                pools, hot tubs and natural spas. Operational levels should be less than 1/100 ml.
                                Pseudomonas aeruginosa
                                Routine monitoring of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recommended for public and semi-
                                public hot tubs and natural spas. It is suggested for public and semi-public swimming
                                pools when there is evidence of operational problems (such as failure of disinfection
                                or problems relating to filters or water pipes), a deterioration in the quality of the pool
                                water or known health problems. It is recommended that for continuously disinfected
                                pools, operational levels should be <1/100 ml; where natural spas operate with no
                                residual disinfectant, operational levels should be <10/100 ml.
                                   If high counts are found (>100/100 ml), pool operators should check turbidity,
                                disinfectant residuals and pH, resample, backwash thoroughly, wait one turnover
                                and resample. If high levels of P. aeruginosa remain, the pool should be closed and a

                                      thorough cleaning and disinfection programme initiated. Hot tubs should be shut
                                      down, drained, cleaned and refilled.
                                      Legionella spp.
                                      Periodic testing for Legionella is useful, especially from hot tubs, in order to determine
                                      that filters are not being colonized, and it is recommended that operational levels
                                      should be <1/100 ml. Where this is exceeded, hot tubs should be shut down, drained,
                                      cleaned and refilled. Shock chlorination may be appropriate if it is suspected that
                                      filters have become colonized.
                                      Staphylococcus aureus
                                      The routine monitoring of Staphylococcus aureus is not recommended, although mon-
                                      itoring may be undertaken as part of a wider investigation into the quality of the
                                      water when health problems associated with the pool are suspected. Where samples
                                      are taken, levels should be less than 100/100 ml.

                                2. Sampling
                                      Guidelines on routine sampling frequencies, along with a summary of operational
                                      guideline values, are outlined in Table 5.3. In addition to routine sampling, samples
                                      should also be taken from public and semi-public facilities:
                                          •    before a pool is used for the first time;
                                          •    before it is put back into use, after it has been shut down for repairs or cleaning;
                                          •    if there are difficulties with the treatment system; and
                                          •    as part of any investigation into possible adverse effects on bathers’ health.

                                  The most appropriate site for taking a single sample is where the water velocity
                              is low, away from any inlets. Depending on the size of the pool, it may be advisable
                              to take samples from multiple sites. Many leisure pools will have additional features,
                              such as flumes, islands and backwaters with a complex system of water flow; represen-
                              tative samples should be taken.
                                  Misleading information on pool water quality will result from incorrect sampling
                              procedures. Sample containers must be of a material that will not affect the quality of
                              the sample either microbially or chemically. Although a good-quality glass container
                              will meet these requirements, the risk of broken glass in the pool environment as a
                              result of breakage has favoured the use of shatterproof plastic-coated glass containers.
                              All-plastic containers can be used provided they do not react with microorganisms or
                              chemicals in the water; not all are suitable.
                                  For microbial examination, the bottle must be sterile and contain an agent that
                              neutralizes the disinfectant used in the pool water. Sodium thiosulfate (18–20 mg/l)
                              is the agent used for chlorine- and bromine-based disinfectants. Clearly, the testing
                              laboratory must be advised before sampling if any other disinfectant is being used.
                              Bacteria in pool water samples and especially those from disinfected pools may be
                              ‘injured’, and normal analytical ‘resuscitation’ procedures should be fully adhered to.

                      5.10.6 Other operational parameters
                              Several parameters are important for operational purposes. These include:
                                 • alkalinity: Alkalinity is a measure of the alkaline salts dissolved in the water. The
                                   higher the alkalinity, the more resistant the water is to large changes in pH in
                                   response to changes in the dosage of disinfectant and pH correction chemicals.
                                   If the alkalinity is too high, it can make pH adjustment difficult.
                                 • calcium hardness: Calcium hardness is an operational measure that needs to be
                                   monitored to avoid damage to the pool fabric (e.g. etching of surfaces and metal
                                   corrosion) and scaling water.
                                 • total dissolved solids: Total dissolved solids (TDS) is the weight of soluble mate-
                                   rial in water. Disinfectants and other pool chemicals as well as bather pollution
                                   will increase TDS levels. The real value of detecting an increase in TDS levels is
                                   as a warning of overloading or lack of dilution, and TDS levels should be moni-
                                   tored by comparison between pool and source water. If TDS is high, dilution is
                                   likely to be the correct management action.

                         5.11 Cleaning
                              Good water and air quality cannot be maintained without an adequate cleaning pro-
                              gramme. This should include the toilets, showers, changing facilities and pool surround-
                              ings on at least a daily basis in public and semi-public pools. Public and semi-public
                              hot tubs should be drained and the surfaces and pipework cleaned on a weekly basis.
                              Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems should be cleaned periodically (e.g.
                              weekly to monthly for those serving hot tubs). Features such as water sprays should be
                              periodically cleaned and flushed with disinfectant (e.g. 5 mg/l hypochlorite solution).

                                 vious chapters. It is necessary to address these issues and implement effective manage-
                                 ment options in order to minimize the adverse health consequences through imple-
                                 mentation of the Guidelines.
                                    Different stakeholders play different roles in the management of the recreational
                                 water environment for safety. The typical areas of responsibility may be grouped into
                                 four major categories, although there may be overlap between these and stakeholders
                                 with responsibilities falling within more than one category:
                                    •   design and construction;
                                    •   operation and management;
                                    •   public education and information; and
                                    •   regulatory requirements (including compliance).
                                    This chapter is arranged according to these categories, with the main stakeholders
                                 indicated for each category. Successful implementation of the Guidelines will require
                                 development of suitable capacities and expertise and the elaboration of a coherent
                                 policy and legislative framework.

                             6.1 Design and construction
                                 People responsible for commissioning pools and similar environments, along with
                                 designers and contractors, should be aware of the requirements to ensure safe and
                                 enjoyable use of facilities. Many decisions taken at the design and construction stage
                                 will have repercussions on the ease with which safe operation can be ensured once the
                                 pool is in use.
                                     Table 6.1 summarizes examples of good practice in design, specification or con-
                                 struction of swimming pools and similar environments in relation to the major health
                                 issues discussed in previous chapters, while Table 6.2 examines specific risks in various
                                 pool types in relation to design and construction issues.
                                     Local and national authorities may set specific requirements that must be met in
                                 the design and construction of swimming pools and similar recreational water facili-
                                 ties (see also Section 6.4). Alternatively, less formal guidelines may be established by
                                 these authorities or by professional or trade associations. Competent and experienced
                                 persons may be members of professional associations or may be subject to licensing
                                 schemes in order to practise (see Section 6.4.2). There may be a process of approv-
                                 al for design and during construction – for example, through building regulations.

                                 Equipment specified or purchased should meet prevailing standards (see Section
                                 6.4.2). In addition, guidance may be available with regards to the most suitable mate-
                                 rials to use for construction to minimize problems with corrosion.

                             6.2 Operation and management
                                 Facility operators play a key role and are responsible for the good operation and man-
                                 agement of the recreational water environment. Good operation is vital to minimize
                                 possible negative health impacts. Table 6.3 summarizes examples of good practice in
                                 operation and management to deal with the hazards identified in previous chapters.
                                    Table 6.4 examines specific risks in relation to good operation and management
                                 by pool type.

                        6.2.1 Pool safety plan
                                 The facility operator should have a pool safety plan, which consists of a description
                                 of the system, its monitoring and maintenance, normal operating procedures, a set
                                 of procedures for specified incidents, an emergency evacuation procedure and a ge-
                                 neric emergency plan (for things not covered under the specified incidents). Examples
                                 of what should be included within the normal operating procedure are outlined in
                                 Box 6.1.



                      BOX 6.1 EXAMPLES OF NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

                    1. Details of the pool(s); this should include dimensions and depths, features and equipment and a
                        plan of the whole facility. The plan should include positions of pool alarms, fire alarms, emergency
                        exit routes and any other relevant information.
                    2. Potential risk; a description of the main hazards and user groups particularly at risk is required
                        before safe operating procedures can be identified.
                    3. Dealing with the public; arrangements for communicating safety messages to customers, ensuring
                        maximum bather numbers are not exceeded, customer care and poolside rules.

layout Safe Water.indd 126                                                                                                                  24.2.2006 9:57:25
                                     The normal operating procedures cover day-to-day management and aim to
                                 prevent problems such as poor air and water quality or overcrowding from arising,
                                 through monitoring and appropriate management actions. In terms of water quality
                                 monitoring, for a number of parameters there will be both operational and critical
                                 limits (see Section 5.10). When operational limits are exceeded, action should be
                                 taken to bring levels back in line with guidelines or standards. When a critical limit is
                                 exceeded, more urgent action is required, which may include closing the facility.
                                     In addition to normal operating procedures, it is also necessary to have a series
                                 of incident plans that cover less routine matters, such as an accident to a water slide
                                 user (see Box 6.2) or how to manage an accidental faecal release (if this is not covered
                                 under the normal operating procedure – see Section 5.8).
                                     Situations that are not covered by either the normal operating procedure or the
                                 incident plans are likely to be unanticipated emergency situations such as structural
                                 failure and should be dealt with according to an emergency evacuation procedure.
                                 The pool safety plan should be fully documented and the results of monitoring and
                                 any incidents recorded.

                        6.2.2 Lifeguards
                                 The primary responsibilities of the lifeguard include the following (Sport England &
                                 Health and Safety Commission, 2003):
                                    • supervising the pool area, keeping a close watch over the pool and its users;
                                    • preventing injuries by minimizing or eliminating hazardous situations, inter-
                                      vening to prevent unsafe behaviours, exercising appropriate control and enforc-
                                      ing all facility rules and regulations;
                                    • anticipating problems and preventing accidents, including warning bathers of
                                      the risks of their specific behaviours;
                                    • identifying emergencies quickly and responding effectively, including effecting
                                      a rescue from the water, administering first aid or CPR, and informing other
                                      lifeguards and facility staff when more help or equipment is needed; and
                                    • communicating with the pool users and colleagues.
                                     Secondary responsibilities should not interfere with the primary responsibilities of
                                 lifeguard personnel. These secondary responsibilities include informing patrons about
                                 rules and regulations, helping patrons locate a missing person, completing required
                                 records and reports on schedule and submitting them to the proper person or office,
                                 and undertaking maintenance or other tasks as assigned.
                                     A detailed example of the duties and requirements of a lifeguard and determina-
                                 tion of lifeguard staffing levels are outlined in Appendix 1.

                             6.3 Public education and information
                                 Facility operators, local authorities, public health bodies, pool-based clubs (such as
                                 swimming clubs, aqua-aerobics classes, scuba clubs and so on) and sports bodies can
                                 play an important role in ensuring pool safety through public education and provid-
                                 ing appropriate and targeted information to pool users. Table 6.5 outlines education
                                 requirements and responses to identified risks by pool type.

                        BOX 6.2 EXAMPLE INCIDENT PLAN FOR LIFEGUARDS MONITORING A WAVE POOL OR WATER SLIDE
                    When you spot a user who needs help, follow this procedure:
                    • By immediately blowing one long, loud whistle blast, you notify your safety team that there is an
                      incident. Once you have given the signal, members of the safety team can react to the situation.
                    • Stop the waves or slide dispatch. At a wave pool, hit the emergency stop button to be sure the
                      waves are turned off. If you are on duty at the top of an attraction, do not dispatch any more riders.
                      Communication between the top and bottom positions is vital.
                    • Determine which method of rescue is needed. If it is necessary to enter the water to make a rescue,
                      use the entry most appropriate for the location you are lifeguarding. For example, you might use a
                      compact jump from a head wall. If it isn’t necessary to enter the water, use the appropriate equip-
                      ment to help the victim.
                    • If you are not the lifeguard making the rescue, make sure the rescuing lifeguard’s observation zone
                      is covered.
                    • Once the situation is under control, the lifeguard who made the rescue completes and files an inci-
                      dent report as soon as time permits. This report form should have a diagram of the pool or activity
                      on the back so that the location of the incident can be marked for future study.
                    • All equipment used in the rescue must be checked to ensure it remains in good condition and is
                      returned to the appropriate location. Lifeguards return to duty, if able, and users are allowed to
                      participate in the activity again if there are enough guards to cover it.

                                 Information can be conveyed by means of prominently and appropriately located
                                 signs. These should provide concise information and a single message (as distinct
                                 from notices and posters, which are covered under Section 6.3.2). Signs can be used
                                 to inform people of hazards and safe behaviours and also reinforce previous educa-
                                 tional messages. Warning signs, in particular, should be simple to understand and
                                 display a clear message. Many national organizations have adopted descriptive stan-

                                      Standardization (ISO) has adopted a standard for safety signs (not specifically swim-
                                      ming pool related) to try to avoid a proliferation of symbols that could cause confu-
                                      sion rather than send a clear message (ISO, 2003).
                                         Signage can convey the need for awareness (e.g. danger), the hazard (e.g. shallow
                                      water), the health risk (e.g. paralysis may occur) or the prohibition (e.g. no diving, no
                                      running, no glass, no alcohol). Signage also includes pool labels and markings, such
                                      as pool depth markings. Extra attention may be required when designing signs appli-
                                      cable to tourist groups with different languages and cultures, as, unsurprisingly, some
                                      signs have been ineffective when such explanatory and precautionary information was
                                      in a language not understood by the pool users.
                                         Signs alone may have a limited impact on behaviour (Hill, 1984; Goldhaber &
                                      de Turck, 1988). However, studies have shown that the public accept and recognize
                                      warning placards, pictographs and labelling. Therefore, signs are best deployed to
                                      reinforce previous awareness raising and education.

                          6.3.2 Education
                                      Education can encourage pool, hot tub and natural spa users to adopt safer behaviours
                                      that benefit both themselves and other users and should encompass issues such as pre-
                                      swim hygiene, when not to use a pool or similar environment and how to identify possible
                                      hazards. Schools, public health bodies (including health care providers), facility operators

                                 gest that health care providers can help to disseminate healthy swimming messages to
                                 their patients, especially those patients with diarrhoea and parents of children who are not
                                 toilet trained, or patients who are particularly susceptible to certain diseases or conditions.
                                 This would include messages on not swimming when you are suffering from diarrhoea,
                                 on showering before swimming or that immunocompromised patients should take extra
                                 precautions or not swim in areas with a higher probability of being contaminated.
                                     Bather safety may be improved if possible hazards are clearly identified at the facil-
                                 ity (see Section 6.3.1) and users educated before they enter the pool environment. An
                                 attempt at education may also be made by handing safety leaflets to users at the pool
                                 entrance or to those in charge of organized group activities and displaying posters
                                 in reception and changing room areas (Sport England & Health and Safety Com-
                                 mission, 2003). Lifeguards can also act as information providers, although this role
                                 should not interfere with their supervisory role.
                                     Box 6.3 provides a code for pool users, which could be displayed in public areas or,
                                 where membership to a facility is required, form part of a membership pack. Educa-
                                 tional information can also be added to agreements or contracts with groups that use
                                 pools for special purposes (e.g. scuba lessons, water aerobics, etc.).

                      BOX 6.3 EXAMPLE CODE FOR POOL USERS

                    Spot the dangers. Take care, swimming pools can be hazardous. Water presents a risk of drowning,
                    and injuries can occur from hitting the hard surrounds or from misuse of the equipment. Every pool is
                    different, so always make sure you know how deep the water is and check for other hazards, such as
                    diving boards, wave machines, water slides, steep slopes into deeper water, etc.
                    Always swim within your ability. Never swim under the influence of alcohol. Avoid holding your
                    breath and swimming long distances under water. Be especially careful if you have a medical condi-
                    tion such as epilepsy, asthma, diabetes or a heart problem. Follow advice provided for the safety of
                    yourself and others. Avoid unruly behaviour that can be dangerous, for instance, running on the side
                    of the pool, ducking, acrobatics in the water, or shouting or screaming (which could distract atten-
                    tion from an emergency). Always do as the lifeguards say, and remember that a moment of foolish
                    behaviour could cost a life.
                    Look out for yourself and other swimmers. It is safer to swim with a companion. Keep an eye open
                    for others, particularly younger children and non-swimmers. Learn how to help. If you see somebody
                    in difficulty, call for help immediately. In an emergency, keep calm and do exactly as you are told.
                    Do not swim if you have a gastrointestinal (stomach) upset or skin or respiratory infection. You
                    are likely to pass on the germs that are making you ill.
                    Shower before you swim. This will reduce the amount of germs, sweat and chemicals (such as cosmet-
                    ics) that you transfer to the water. This means that the water quality of the pool will be better.

                                 National legislation may include different sets of regulations that will apply to swimming
                                 pools and similar recreational environments. Regulation may control, for example, the
                                 design and construction of pools (see Section 6.1), their operation and management (see

                    110                                                GUIDELINES FOR SAFE RECREATIONAL WATER ENVIRONMENTS

                                 Section 6.2) and substances hazardous to health (e.g. chemicals). These may be quite
                                 detailed and specific in their requirements, covering water treatment processes, sampling
                                 and testing regimes, and they may be applied differently according to the type of pool
                                 (i.e. public versus semi-public versus domestic). Within regulations it is likely that there
                                 will be a requirement for the use of certified material, equipment and, possibly, staff
                                 registered to certain bodies (e.g. lifeguards, design and construction engineers).
                                     Another aspect of pool management that may necessitate regulatory involvement
                                 is occupational health and safety legislation, designed to ensure protection of pool
                                 employees (occupational health is not covered by these Guidelines; see Chapter 1), as
                                 well as the general public.
                                     Local regulatory oversight can support the work of pool management and provide great-
                                 er public health protection and public confidence. Inspections by the regulatory officials to
                                 verify compliance with the regulations are an important component of this oversight.

                        6.4.1 Regulations and compliance
                                 The extent to which swimming pools and similar environments are regulated var-
                                 ies greatly. In some countries, a permit or licence to operate is required by the local
                                 municipal authority. In others, a level of regulatory oversight is provided, based on
                                 specific regulations and/or advisory codes of practice.
                                     Local authorities may, for example, require that the initial plans for the construction
                                 of a new pool be submitted by a licensed engineer. The design and construction plans
                                 are then reviewed and approved by a competent person. These plans generally include
                                 complete details and layout of the facility, including amenities, and information re-
                                 garding the individual circulation system components (pumps, filters, chemical dosing
                                 system, etc.). Once approved, the construction of the facility may commence. However,
                                 prior to issuance of the final permit for operation, a physical inspection of the final
                                 facility and a review of the pool safety plan or daily operations management are usually
                                 required. Periodic audits may be required to ensure continued compliance. Regula-
                                 tions should provide for authority to close the facility if serious hazards and breaches to
                                 regulations or a significant risk to public health is identified, with reopening prohibited
                                 until the problem has been rectified and measures are in place to prevent recurrence.
                                     Most regulations apply to public pools, but limited evidence suggests that the
                                 greatest burden of disease and physical injury arises from domestic and semi-public
                                 pools. These may be subject to periodic or informal supervision, and their operation
                                 and maintenance may be less adequate than those at public pools per se.
                                     In terms of the operation and management of pools and similar environments, the
                                 typical requirements, in terms of a normal operating procedure, incident plans and an
                                 emergency plan, have already been outlined (Section 6.2). The preparation and use
                                 of such procedures ensure that the hazards specific to that facility have been evaluated
                                 and management actions determined.
                                     It may be a regulatory requirement that the results of hygiene and safety monitor-
                                 ing be made available to the public; this may be useful in terms of public education
                                 material and, if the regulator also provides comparable information from other ven-
                                 ues, as a means of comparing the health and safety records of different facilities.
                                     In all cases, regulatory involvement should be welcomed and not seen as a burden
                                 on pool management. The purpose of regulatory involvement is to ensure that pools
                                 and similar environments are operated as safely as possible in order that the largest

                        6.4.2 Registration and certification schemes
                               Certain staff members (e.g. lifeguards) and personnel involved in the design and con-
                               struction (for example) may be required to be registered with certain approved bodies.
                               In addition, all equipment components installed in the facility should meet minimum
                               performance, design, sanitation and safety requirements. Certification that the equip-
                               ment or the entire pool is in compliance with the guidelines or regulatory require-
                               ments is helpful for all involved parties. There are four basic methods of certification
                               in use; these are outlined in Box 6.4.
                                   Equipment that may be certified for performance, sanitation and/or safety consider-
                               ations includes the following: piping system; filters; pumps; surface skimmers; suction
                               fittings and drain covers; valves (multiport, three-way, butterfly, etc.); chemical feeding de-
                               vices (mechanical, flow-through); process equipment (chlorine/bromine generators, ozone
                               generators, UV disinfection systems and copper/silver ion generators); heaters; automated
                               chemical monitor/controllers; chemical disinfectants; and electrical equipment (safety).

                      BOX 6.4 BASIC METHODS OF CERTIFICATION
                    • First party – Self-certification of the product’s compliance against a standard by the manufacturer.
                      Concerns are often raised with manufacturers’ self-certification because of the potential bias of the
                      manufacturer and the lack of ongoing monitoring to ensure that the product continues to comply.
                    • Second party – Certification by a trade association or private party. In many instances, trade as-
                      sociations or private companies provide testing and certification services for products against
                      industry standards or regulations. Since a trade association represents and is often controlled by
                      manufacturers, second-party certifications are not considered to be completely independent. Typi-
                      cally, no follow-up services to monitor continued compliance are provided. As a result, it is often
                      difficult to determine whether a product selected for use is identical to the unit that was originally
                      evaluated for certification. Private entities also offer testing and certification services that moni-
                      tor the continued compliance of the product. These follow-up services often include audits of the
                      production location, ongoing testing and complaint investigation.
                    • Third party – Certification by an independent organization without direct ties to the manufactur-
                      ing sector. Third-party certifications provide for an independent evaluation of the product coupled
                      with follow-up services that help ensure that products continue to comply with all requirements.
                      These follow-up services typically include audits of the production location, ongoing testing of
                      representative products and complaint investigation. The follow-up service aspect of third-party
                      certification is an advantage, in that the purchaser has the assurance that the product installed is
                      identical to the product evaluated for the certification. Third-party certifiers also maintain close
                      working relationships with the regulatory and user communities. This provides for a more balanced
                      assessment of the product and helps ensure that the product will be accepted by local, regional and
                      national regulatory agencies.
                    • Fourth party – Certification by governmental agencies. In some instances, local, regional or na-
                      tional governmental agencies will require that products be evaluated by the agency or a designated
                      representative organization for compliance with regulations for installation, use and operation.
                      Typically, no follow-up monitoring services are provided by the agency. As a result, continued
                      compliance is often left up to the manufacturer.

                                   In order to ensure an effective overall system that will result in the safe and healthy use of
                                   swimming pools and similar recreational environments, it is necessary that these Guide-
                                   lines inform and be adapted to suit national systems. Figure 6.1 outlines how the Guide-
                                   lines and the four categories of responsibility outlined within this chapter fit together.

                    APPENDIX 1
                    Lifeguards




                    T  his appendix relates to people who are trained and positioned at swimming pools to protect
                       water users and who may be paid or voluntary. They may be referred to as lifesavers or life-
                    guards or given some other title. For simplicity, the term ‘lifeguard’ has been used throughout
                    this appendix. Box A.1 outlines an example of requirements of a lifeguard, while Box A.2 gives
                    an example of a lifeguard staffing approach.


                      BOX A.1 EXAMPLES OF REQUIREMENTS OF THE LIFEGUARD AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT
                    The lifeguard will normally need to be:
                    • physically fit, have good vision and hearing, be mentally alert and self-disciplined;
                    • a strong, able and confident swimmer;
                    • trained and have successfully completed a course of training in the techniques and practices of
                       supervision, rescue and first aid in accordance with a syllabus approved by a recognized training
                       organization.
                    The deployment of lifeguards would normally take the following into consideration:
                    • duty spells and structuring of duties – maximum uninterrupted supervision period, working day,
                       programmed breaks;
                    • lifeguard numbers – dependent on the pool type, size and usage;
                    • surveillance zones – observation and scanning requirements;
                    • supervision of changing facilities – showers, toilets, seating and other areas of potential hazard.
                    Adapted from Sport England & Health and Safety Commission, 2003




                       Should the pool be used by groups with their own lifeguards, it is important that the criteria
                    that apply to the professional pool lifeguard be equally applied to the groups’ lifeguards. Further-
                    more, there should be documentation on the roles and responsibilities of the groups’ lifeguards:
                    the hazards and the potential negative health outcomes associated with those hazards are no less
                    when supervision and management are undertaken by volunteers.
                       There are a multitude of courses offered for the training and certification of lifeguards. Box
                    A.3 provides examples of some important elements of lifeguard training. Box A.4 provides an
                    example of an international pool lifeguard certificate.

                      BOX A.2 EXAMPLE OF A LIFEGUARD STAFFING APPROACH
                    In the United Kingdom, lifeguard numbers may be determined as shown in Table A.1 (Sport England &
                    Health and Safety Commission, 2003).

                    Notes:
                    1. Where only one lifeguard is on duty, there should be adequate means of summoning assistance rapidly.
                    2. The ‘water area’ column can be used as a guide for irregular-shaped pools.

                    The number of lifeguards required for safety can also be calculated based on sweep time and response
                    time. Some lifeguard training organizations, for example, have created general rules for how quickly
                    they believe a lifeguard should be expected to observe a person in distress within their supervision
                    area and how quickly the lifeguard should be able to reach that person. Based on such rules, training
                    and evaluation, appropriate staffing levels can be derived.
