                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-241. Permit required to discharge

A. Unless otherwise provided by this article, any person who discharges or
who owns or operates a facility that discharges shall obtain an aquifer
protection permit from the director.

B. Unless exempted under section 49-250, or unless the director determines
that the facility will be designed, constructed and operated so that there will
be no migration of pollutants directly to the aquifer or to the vadose zone,
the following are considered to be discharging facilities and shall be
operated pursuant to either an individual permit or a general permit,
including agricultural general permits, under this article:

1. Surface impoundments, including holding, storage settling, treatment or
disposal pits, ponds and lagoons.

2. Solid waste disposal facilities except for mining overburden and wall rock
that has not been and will not be subject to mine leaching operations.

3. Injection wells.

4. Land treatment facilities.

5. Facilities that add a pollutant to a salt dome formation, salt bed
formation, dry well or underground cave or mine.

6. Mine tailings piles and ponds.

7. Mine leaching operations.

8. Underground water storage facilities.

9. Sewage treatment facilities, including on-site wastewater treatment
facilities.

10. Wetlands designed and constructed to treat municipal and domestic
wastewater for underground storage.

C. The director shall provide public notice and an opportunity for public
comment on any request for a determination from the director under
subsection B of this section that there will be no migration of pollutants
from a facility. A public hearing may be held at the discretion of the director
if sufficient public comment warrants a hearing. The director may inspect
and may require reasonable conditions and appropriate monitoring and
reporting requirements for a facility managing pollutants that are
determined not to migrate under subsection B of this section. The director
    ARS 49-241 Permit required to discharge (Arizona Revised
                   Statutes (2021 Edition))


may identify types of facilities, available technologies and technical criteria
for facilities that will qualify for a determination. The director's
determination may be revoked on evidence that pollutants have migrated
from the facility. The director may impose a review fee for a determination
under subsection B of this section. Any issuance, denial or revocation of a
determination may be appealed pursuant to section 49-323.

D. The director shall annually make the fee schedule for aquifer protection
permit applications available to the public on request and on the
department's website, and a list of the names and locations of the facilities
that have filed applications for aquifer protection permits, with a description
of the status of each application, is available to the public on request.

E. The director shall prescribe the procedures for aquifer protection permit
applications and fee collection under this section. The director shall deposit,
pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies collected under this
section in the water quality fee fund established by section 49-210 and may
authorize expenditures from the fund, subject to legislative appropriation, to

ยง 49-242. Procedural requirements for individual permits;
annual registration of permittees; fee

A. The director shall prescribe by rule requirements for issuing, denying,
suspending or modifying individual permits, including requirements for
submitting notices, permit applications and any additional information
necessary to determine whether an individual permit should be issued, and
shall prescribe conditions and requirements for individual permits.

B. Each owner of an injection well, a land treatment facility, a dry well, an
on-site wastewater treatment facility with a capacity of more than three
thousand gallons per day, a recharge facility or a facility that discharges to
navigable waters to whom an individual or area-wide permit is issued shall

pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

C. Each owner of a surface impoundment, a facility that adds a pollutant to a
salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground cave or mine, a mine
tailings pile or pond, a mine leaching operation, a sewage or sludge pond or
a wastewater treatment facility to whom an individual or area-wide permit is
issued shall register the permit with the director each year and pay an
annual registration fee for each permit based on the total daily influent of
pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

D. Pending the issuance of individual or area-wide aquifer protection
permits, each owner of a facility that is prescribed in subsection B or C of
this section that is operating on September 27, 1990 pursuant to the filing of
a notice of disposal or a groundwater quality protection permit issued under
title 36 shall register the notice of disposal or the permit with the director
each year and shall pay an annual registration fee for each notice of disposal
or permit based on the total daily influent or discharge of pollutants
pursuant to subsection E of this section.

E. Only for a one-time rule making after the effective date of this
amendment to this section, the director shall establish by rule an annual
registration fee for facilities prescribed by subsections B, C and D of this
section. The fee shall be measured in part by the amount of discharge or
influent per day from the facility. After the one-time rule making, the
director shall not increase those fees by rule without specific statutory
authority for the increase.

F. For a site with more than one permit subject to the requirements of this
section, the owner or operator of the facility at that site shall pay the annual
registration fee prescribed pursuant to subsection E of this section based on

may authorize expenditures from the fund to pay the reasonable and
necessary costs of administering the registration program.
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-243. Information and criteria for issuing individual permit;
definition

A. The director shall consider, and the applicant for an individual permit
may be required to furnish with the application, the following information:

1. The design of the discharge facility. When formal as-built submittals are
unavailable, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to allow
evaluation of those elements of the facility affecting discharge pursuant to
the demonstration required in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section.

2. A description of how the facility will be operated.

3. Existing and proposed pollutant control measures.

4. A hydrogeologic study defining and characterizing the discharge impact
area, including the vadose zone.

5. The use of water from aquifers in the discharge impact area.

6. The existing quality of the water in the aquifers in the discharge impact
area.

7. The characteristics of the pollutants discharged by the facility.

8. Closure strategy.

9. Any other relevant federal or state permits issued to the applicant.

10. Any other relevant information the director may require.

B. The director shall issue a permit to a person for a facility other than water
storage at a storage facility pursuant to title 45, chapter 3.1 if the person
demonstrates that either paragraphs 1 and 2 or paragraphs 1 and 3 of this
subsection will be met:

1. That the facility will be so designed, constructed and operated as to ensure
the greatest degree of discharge reduction achievable through application of
the best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating
methods or other alternatives, including, where practicable, a technology
permitting no discharge of pollutants. In determining best available
demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other
alternatives, the director shall take into account any treatment process
contributing to the discharge, site specific hydrologic and geologic
characteristics and other environmental factors, the opportunity for water
conservation or augmentation and economic impacts of the use of
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


alternative technologies, processes or operating methods on an industry-
wide basis. A discharge reduction to an aquifer achievable solely by means of
site specific characteristics does not, in itself, constitute compliance with
this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph for wetlands designed
and constructed to treat municipal and domestic wastewater for
underground storage pursuant to section 49-241, subsection B may be met
by including seepage through the bottom of the facility if it is demonstrated
that site characteristics can act to achieve performance levels established as
the best available demonstrated control technology by the director. In
addition, the director shall consider the following factors for existing
facilities:

(a) Toxicity, concentrations and quantities of discharge likely to reach an
aquifer from various types of control technologies.

(b) The total costs of the application of the technology in relation to the
discharge reduction to be achieved from such application.

(c) The age of equipment and facilities involved.

(d) The industrial and control process employed.

(e) The engineering aspects of the application of various types of control
techniques.

(f) Process changes.

(g) Non-water quality environmental impacts.

(h) The extent to which water available for beneficial uses will be conserved
by a particular type of control technology.

2. That pollutants discharged will in no event cause or contribute to a
violation of aquifer water quality standards at the applicable point of
compliance for the facility.

3. That no pollutants discharged will further degrade at the applicable point
of compliance the quality of any aquifer that at the time of the issuance of
the permit violates the aquifer quality standard for that pollutant.

C. An applicant shall satisfy the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of
this section either by making a demonstration that the facility will meet the
criteria of that paragraph or by agreeing to utilize the appropriate
presumptive controls adopted by the director pursuant to section 49-243.01,
subsection A.
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


D. In assessing technology, processes, operating methods and other
alternatives for the purposes of this section, "practicable" means able to be
reasonably done from the standpoint of technical practicality and, except for
pollutants addressed in subsection I of this section, economically achievable
on an industry-wide basis.

E. The determination of economic impact on an industry-wide basis for
purposes of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section shall take into account
differences in industry sectors, the type and size of the operation and the
reasonableness of applying controls in an arid or semiarid setting.

F. Control measures designed to further reduce discharge may not be
required if the director determines that site specific conditions, in
conjunction with technology, processes, operating methods or other
alternatives are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection B,
paragraph 1 of this section.

G. A discharging facility at an open pit mining operation shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section if the
director determines that both of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The mine pit creates a passive containment that is sufficient to capture the
pollutants discharged and that is hydrologically isolated to the extent that it
does not allow pollutant migration from the capture zone. For the purposes
of this paragraph, "passive containment" means natural or engineered
topographical, geological or hydrological control measures that can operate
without continuous maintenance. Monitoring and inspections to confirm
performance of the passive containment do not constitute maintenance.

2. The discharging facility employs additional processes, operating methods
or other alternatives to minimize discharge.

H. The director shall issue a permit to a person for water storage at a storage
facility proposed under title 45, chapter 3.1 if the person demonstrates that
the facility will be so designed, constructed and operated as to ensure that
the project will not cause or contribute to the violation of any standard
adopted pursuant to section 49-223 at the applicable point of compliance for
the facility.

I. With respect to the following pollutants, the permit applicant for a new
facility must meet the criteria of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section to
limit discharges to the maximum extent practicable regardless of cost:
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


1. Any organic substance listed by the secretary of the department of health
and human services pursuant to 42 United States Code section 241(b)(4), as
known to be carcinogens or reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens.

2. Any organic substance listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations section
261.33(e), regardless of whether the substance is a waste subject to
regulation under the resource conservation recovery act ( P.L. 94-580; 90
Stat. 2795).

3. Any organic toxic pollutant that the director lists by rule after determining
that minute amounts of that pollutant in drinking water will present a
substantial short-term or long-term human health threat.

J. The director, by rule, may prescribe requirements for issuing a single
permit applicable to all similar facilities under common ownership and
located in a contiguous geographic area in lieu of an individual permit for
each facility.

K. The director shall consider and may prescribe in the permit the following
terms and conditions as necessary to ensure compliance with this article:

1. Monitoring requirements.

2. Record keeping and reporting requirements.

3. Contingency plan requirements.

4. Discharge limitations.

5. Compliance schedule requirements.

6. Closure requirements and, for a facility that cannot achieve clean closure,
postclosure monitoring and maintenance requirements.

7. Alert levels that, when exceeded, may require adjustments of permit
conditions or appropriate actions as are required by the contingency plans.

8. Such other terms and conditions as the director deems necessary to
ensure compliance with this article.

L. With the consent of the applicant or permittee, the director may include
in an aquifer protection permit for an existing facility the requirement that
the applicant or permittee undertake a remedial action, as defined in section
49-281, to prevent, minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or
welfare or to the waters of the state resulting from a discharge that occurred
before August 13, 1986, if the following conditions are met:
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


1. The selection of remedial action, including the level and extent of cleanup,
was determined according to the criteria in section 49-282.06 and the rules
adopted pursuant to that section.

2. The pollutant that was discharged constituted a hazardous substance.

M. With the consent of the applicant or permittee, the director may include
in an aquifer protection permit as a condition the mitigation measures
authorized under section 49-286 instead of issuing a mitigation order under
section 49-286.

N. The director may deny a permit for a facility if the director determines
that the applicant is incapable of fully carrying out the terms and conditions
of the permit, including any conditions that require monitoring or installing
and maintaining discharge control measures. The following apply to an
application for a permit or to an issued permit:

1. The director may require the applicant to furnish information, such as
past performance, including compliance with or violations of similar laws or
rules, and technical and financial competence, relevant to its capability to
comply with the permit terms and conditions.

2. For the purposes of evaluating an applicant's financial competence for
closure, the director may consider a closure strategy and cost estimate
rather than a detailed closure plan. Except for a state or federal agency or a
county, city, town or other local governmental entity, the cost estimate shall
be based on the cost for the applicant or permittee to hire a third party to
conduct the closure strategy or plan unless the financial responsibility
mechanism provided pursuant to this subsection is a self-assurance or a
guarantee and the director determines that the applicant or permittee is
technically and financially capable of closing the facility at its own cost and,
if necessary, of conducting post-closure monitoring and maintenance.
Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local
governmental entity, the permittee shall update its cost estimate:

(a) For the duration of the permit on a periodic basis as scheduled in the
permit but not more frequently than once every five years. The cost estimate
shall be updated to adjust for inflation or as necessary to reflect increased or
decreased costs resulting from changes to the facility or to the facility
closure strategy or plan, or to any other relevant conditions related to the
facility.

(b) For a significant amendment as defined by rule adopted by the director,
if required to address incremental changes in the cost estimate that result
from the significant amendment.
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


3. Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local
governmental entity, the applicant or permittee shall demonstrate financial
responsibility to cover the estimated costs to close the facility and, if
necessary, to conduct post-closure monitoring and maintenance by
providing to the director for approval a financial assurance mechanism or
combination of mechanisms as prescribed in rules adopted by the director
or in 40 code of federal regulations section 264.143 (f)(1) and (10) as of
january 1, 2014. An applicant or permittee that demonstrates financial
responsibility by means of a self-assurance or guarantee shall aggregate the
estimated closure and post-closure costs for all aquifer protection permits in
this state for which the applicant, permittee or guarantor has provided a
self-assurance or a guarantee in order to determine whether the applicant,
permittee or guarantor meets the applicable financial test.

4. The permittee shall maintain its demonstration of financial responsibility
prescribed in this subsection for the duration of the individual permit.
Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local
governmental entity, the permittee shall periodically demonstrate financial
responsibility and report to the director that the financial assurance
mechanism is being maintained as scheduled in the permit and as
prescribed in paragraph 3 of this subsection but not more frequently than
once every two years. The permit's applicable reporting schedule shall be
based on the type of financial assurance mechanism that is selected
pursuant to this subsection.

5. A demonstration of financial responsibility made for a facility as
prescribed by section 49-770 shall suffice, in whole or in part, for any
demonstration of financial responsibility prescribed by this section.

6. A demonstration of financial assurance or competence required under
this section or section 49-770 for a facility shall not be required before
completion of construction but shall be required before the department
issues approval to operate. Financial assurance for a facility is not required
pursuant to this section if substantially similar financial assurance for that
facility is required and has been provided pursuant to other federal, state or
local laws, and evidence of that financial assurance is filed with the director.

7. Financial information required to be supplied under this subsection is
confidential.

O. The director shall require an applicant for an individual permit to submit
evidence that the discharging facility complies with applicable municipal or
county zoning ordinances and regulations. The director shall not issue the
permit unless it appears from the evidence submitted by the applicant that
the facility complies with the applicable zoning ordinances and regulations.
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


P. The director may issue a single area-wide permit applicable to facilities
under common ownership and located in a contiguous geographic area in
lieu of an individual permit for each facility. In issuing an area-wide permit,
the demonstration required under subsection B, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this
section may be considered collectively for all facilities included in the
permit. The director may evaluate discharge reduction collectively for
existing facilities in the pollutant management area by considering any one
or all of the factors set forth in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section. The
director may consolidate those permit conditions listed in subsection K of
this section that have general applicability to the facilities included in the
area-wide permit. An area-wide permit shall specify all of the following:

1. A description of the pollutant management area and point or points of
compliance.

2. Those facilities that have been evaluated individually for meeting the
criteria in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section and that are included in
the area-wide permit.

3. For multiple facilities within the pollutant management area that are
substantially similar in nature and, considered alone, would have a small
discharge impact area compared to other facilities in the area, narrative
permit conditions may be used to define the best available demonstrated
control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives
consistent with subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section replacing the need
for an individual technical review.

4. A compliance schedule for submittal and evaluation of information
regarding design and discharge for existing facilities within the pollutant
management area that, because of the small size, quantity or quality of
discharge, or physical location with regard to the point or points of
compliance, the director has determined that review for the purposes of
subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section shall be conducted in the future. In
determining the requirements and length of a compliance schedule for an
area-wide permit, the director shall consider the character and impact of the
discharge, the nature of the activities necessary to prepare appropriate
technical submittals, the number of persons potentially affected by the
discharge, the current state of treatment technology, and the age of the
facility.

Q. The director may expedite processing of an aquifer protection permit
application by a permit applicant who proposes a new facility to discharge
liquids that do not contain any pollutant in a concentration that exceeds a
numeric aquifer water quality standard. The director shall not require the
applicant to complete a hydrogeologic study in order to obtain the permit
    ARS 49-243 Information and criteria for issuing individual
   permit; definition (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


unless the permit applicant is relying on site specific characteristics to meet
the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section or unless the
study is necessary to demonstrate compliance with narrative aquifer water
quality standards. Applications made pursuant to this subsection shall have
precedence and be considered by the department before all other aquifer
protection permit applications.

     technology (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021 Edition))


ยง 49-243.01. Presumptive best available demonstrated control
technology

A. The director may establish, by rule, presumptive best available
demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other
alternatives, consistent with section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 1, for a
class of facilities, if the director determines that the facilities in that class are
substantially similar in nature. Once presumptive controls are established by
rule for a particular class of facilities the director shall review those rules
every five years and, if appropriate, revise the rules for that class of facilities.

B. An owner or operator of a facility who applies for an individual permit
under section 49-243 shall be deemed to have demonstrated that the design
meets the requirements of section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 1, if the
application incorporates the presumptive controls for that class of facilities
established pursuant to subsection A of this section.

C. A person or group of persons who own or operate facilities that are
required to obtain a permit pursuant to this article may petition the director
to establish by rule presumptive best available demonstrated control
technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives for that class
of facilities. The director may grant the petition if he determines that the
following conditions have been met:

1. The petition identifies the class of facilities for which rule adoption is
requested.

2. The petition includes a description of the presumptive controls for the
requested class of facilities.

3. The petition complies with section 41-1033.

4. The class of facilities described in the petition satisfies subsection A of this
section.

D. The owner or operator of a facility with a permit shall not be required to
obtain a new or modified permit because of rules adopted or revised
pursuant to subsection A of this section. Any complete application that is
filed before the effective date of any rules adopted or revised pursuant to this
section shall be processed by the department without requiring compliance
with the rules adopted or revised pursuant to subsection A of this section.
ARS 49-244 Point of compliance (Arizona Revised Statutes (2021
                          Edition))


ยง 49-244. Point of compliance

The director shall designate a point or points of compliance for each facility
receiving a permit under this article. For the purposes of this chapter, the
point of compliance is the point at which compliance must be determined
for either the aquifer water quality standards or, if an aquifer water quality
standard is exceeded at the time the aquifer protection permit is issued, the
requirement that there be no further degradation of the aquifer as provided
in section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 3. The point of compliance shall
be a vertical plane downgradient of the facility that extends through the
uppermost aquifers underlying that facility. For an aquifer that has no
existing or reasonably foreseeable drinking water beneficial use, the director
may establish monitoring for compliance in another aquifer in lieu of
monitoring in the uppermost aquifer. The point of compliance shall be
determined as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this section , for a pollutant that is a
hazardous substance the point of compliance is the limit of the pollutant
management area. The pollutant management area is the limit projected in
the horizontal plane of the area on which pollutants are or will be placed.
The pollutant management area includes horizontal space taken up by any
liner, dike or other barrier designed to contain pollutants in the facility. If
the facility contains more than one discharging activity, the pollutant
management area is described by an imaginary line circumscribing the
several discharging activities.

2. A point of compliance for hazardous substances other than that identified
in paragraph 1 of this section may be approved by the director if the facility
owner or operator can demonstrate either:

(a) That it is technically impracticable or inappropriate considering the
likely fate or transport of a pollutant in an aquifer to monitor at the
boundary specified in paragraph 1 of this section.

(b) The alternative point of compliance will allow installation and operation
of the monitoring facilities that are substantially less costly. Such a request

substance pursuant to this subdivision shall never be further downgradient
than any of the following:

(i) The property boundary.

(ii) Any point of an existing or reasonably foreseeable future drinking water
source.

(iii) Seven hundred fifty feet from the edge of the pollutant management
area.

3. For pollutants that are not hazardous substances the director, in
identifying a point of compliance, shall take into account the volume and
characteristics of the pollutants, the practical difficulties associated with
implementation of applicable water pollution control requirements, whether
the facility is a new facility or an existing facility, water conservation and
augmentation and the site-specific characteristics of the facility, including,
but not limited to, climate, hydrology, geology, soil chemistry and pollutant
levels in the aquifer. The point of compliance must be so located as to ensure
protection of all current and reasonably foreseeable future uses of the
aquifer.

quality standard or discharge limitation if the waiver will not endanger
human health or welfare, and if the director finds any of the following:

1. That an emergency of such severity exists that water supplies for domestic
uses will be inadequate to meet demand unless the facility is able to
temporarily exceed one or more water quality standards or discharge
limitations by its discharge into waters of the state.

2. That there has been a breakdown of equipment or upset of operations
resulting in a discharge to waters of the state in excess of one or more water
quality standards or discharge limitations, and both of the following apply:

(a) The breakdown or upset was beyond the control of the facility owner or
operator and the facility was being operated in compliance with this chapter
before the discharge.

(b) The breakdown or upset will be corrected in a reasonable period of time.

3. That the activity that is the subject of the waiver is necessary to protect
human health or welfare or minimize potential adverse impacts to the
environment.

B. A temporary emergency waiver of compliance issued by the director may
be subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as the director deems
necessary. The director may grant a waiver after the occurrence of the
activity that is subject to the waiver if the applicant demonstrates that
exigent circumstances made it impractical to secure the waiver in advance.

C. As a condition to the issuance of a temporary emergency waiver of
compliance, the director may require the facility owner or operator to
provide notice of the waiver to all downstream or downgradient users
directly affected by both:

1. Publication on not less than three consecutive days, or on three
consecutive weeks in the case of weekly publications, in a newspaper or
newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the emergency or
breakdown has occurred or is occurring.

2. Furnishing a copy of the publication to the radio and television stations
