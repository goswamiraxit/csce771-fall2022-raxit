Background
Over the past few years, several studies have reported the presence of microplastics
in treated tap and bottled water, raising questions and concerns about the impact
that microplastics in drinking-water might have on human health. This report, which
contains a summary of the evidence, key findings, recommendations and research
needs, is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) first effort to examine the potential
human health risks associated with exposure to microplastics in the environment.
The focus of this report is on the potential human health impacts of exposure to
microplastics through drinking-water. However, brief information on other routes
of human exposure is included for context.

This report was informed by literature reviews undertaken on the occurrence of
microplastics in the water cycle, the potential health impacts from microplastic exposure
and the removal of microplastics during wastewater and drinking-water treatment.
Throughout the report, WHO experts examined the quality and relevance of the
studies they found. The report was also informed by reviews conducted by several
major entities; these are referenced throughout the report.

As a category, microplastics encompass a wide range of materials with different chemical
compositions, shapes, colours, sizes and densities. There is no scientifically-agreed
definition of microplastics, although most definitions focus on composition and size.

Occurrence of microplastics in water
Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and have been detected in marine
water, wastewater, fresh water, food, air and drinking-water, both bottled and tap water.

Microplastics enter freshwater environments in a number of ways: primarily from
surface run-off and wastewater effluent (both treated and untreated), but also from
combined sewer overflows, industrial effluent, degraded plastic waste and atmospheric
deposition. However, there are limited data to quantify the contribution of each the
different inputs and their upstream sources. Further, the limited evidence indicates that
some microplastics found in drinking-water may come from treatment and distribution
systems for tap water and/or bottling of bottled water.

A recent systematic review of the literature identified 50 studies detecting microplastics
in fresh water, drinking-water or wastewater (Koelmans et al., 2019). The lack of




                                                                          Executive summary   vii
       standard methods for sampling and analysing microplastics in the environment means
       that comparisons across studies are difficult. In addition, few studies were considered
       fully reliable. Nevertheless, some initial conclusions can be drawn.

       In fresh water, the frequency of microplastic particles by polymer type was consistent
       with plastic production volumes and plastic densities. A wide range of shapes and sizes
       were found. Only nine studies analysed microplastics in drinking-water, and fragments
       and fibres were the predominant shapes reported. The polymers most frequently
       detected were polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene.

       For both freshwater and drinking-water studies, the smallest particles detected were
       often determined by the size of the mesh used in sampling, which varied significantly
       across studies. Particle counts ranged from around 0 to 103 particles/L in fresh water.
       In drinking-water, where smaller mesh sizes are typically applied, concentrations in
       individual samples ranged from 0 to 104 particles/L and mean values ranged from
       10-3 to 103 particles/L. The smallest particle size detected was 1 µm, but this result
       is constrained by current methods. In most cases, freshwater studies targeted larger
       particles, using mesh sizes that were an order of magnitude larger than those used in
       drinking-water studies. Thus, direct comparisons between data from freshwater and
       drinking-water studies cannot be made.

       Possible human health risks associated with microplastics
       in drinking-water
       The human health risk from microplastics in drinking-water is a function of both hazard
       and exposure. Potential hazards associated with microplastics come in three forms: the
       particles themselves which present a physical hazard, chemicals (unbound monomers,
       additives, and sorbed chemicals from the environment), and microorganisms that
       may attach and colonize on microplastics, known as biofilms. Based on the limited
       evidence available, chemicals and microbial pathogens associated with microplastics
       in drinking-water pose a low concern for human health. Although there is insufficient
       information to draw firm conclusions on the toxicity of nanoparticles, no reliable
       information suggests it is a concern.

       Particles
       Particle toxicity is dependent on a range of physical properties, including size, surface
       area, shape and surface characteristics, as well as the chemical composition of the
       microplastic particle. The fate, transport and health impacts of microplastics following
       ingestion is not well studied and no epidemiological or human studies on ingested
       microplastics have been identified. However, microplastics greater than 150 µm are
       not likely to be absorbed in the human body and uptake of smaller particles is expected



viii   Microplastics in drinking-water
to be limited. Absorption and distribution of very small microplastic particles including
nanoplastics may be higher, however the database is extremely limited and findings
demonstrating uptake in animal studies occurred under extremely high exposures
that would not occur in drinking-water. The limited number of toxicology studies in
rats and mice on ingested microplastics are of questionable reliability and relevance,
with some impacts observed only at very high concentrations that would overwhelm
biological clearance mechanisms and that therefore do not accurately reflect potential
toxicities that could occur at lower levels of exposure. Based on this limited body
of evidence, firm conclusions on the risk associated with ingestion of microplastic
particles through drinking-water cannot yet be determined; however at this point, no
data suggests overt health concerns associated with exposure to microplastic particles
through drinking-water.

Chemicals
Polymerization reactions during plastic production do not generally proceed to full
completion, resulting in a small proportion of monomers such as 1,3-butadiene, ethylene
oxide and vinyl chloride, that can leach into the environment. Residual monomers
may also arise as a result of biodegradation and weathering of plastics. However, the
extent to which this occurs is uncertain. It is likely that unbound monomers resulting
from these scenarios would leach into the environment, resulting in extremely small
concentrations in drinking-water sources.

Additives such as phthalate plasticizers and polybrominated diphenyl ether flame
retardants are, for the most part, not covalently bound to the polymer and can more
easily migrate into the environment. Migration can also be impacted by the molecular
weight of additives, with small, low molecular weight molecules generally migrating
at a faster rate than larger additives. Aging and weathering are likely to strongly
influence migration, the overall impact of which is not well understood. However,
relative to other emission routes of additives to the environment, it is anticipated that
leaching from microplastic will be relatively small. If microplastics are ingested through
drinking-water, the relative potential for the additives to leach from microplastics in the
gastrointestinal tract is also poorly understood, with conflicting information reported in
the limited number of available studies. It should be noted, however, that following the
introduction of regulations limiting the use of many additives-of-concern from plastics,
exposure is expected to become lower over time, although these substances can be
present in older plastics which may degrade into microplastics in the environment.

The hydrophobic nature of microplastic implies that they have the potential to accumulate
hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls,

                                                                          Executive summary   ix
    to microplastics will be small relative to other environmental media such as sediment,
    algae and the lipid fraction of aquatic organisms. If microplastics are ingested through
    drinking-water, the relative potential for POPs to leach from microplastics is not well
    understood and will depend on a variety of factors, including the relative size of the
    particle, mass of chemical accumulated, relative level of contamination within the gut,
    and the gastrointestinal residence time of the particle.

    To assess potential health risks associated with exposure to chemicals associated
    with microplastics, WHO developed a conservative exposure scenario, assuming high
    exposure to microplastics combined with high exposure to chemicals and applied a
    margin of exposure (MOE) approach. Chemicals included in the assessment have
    been detected in microplastics, are of toxicological concern and have adequate or
    accepted toxicological point of departures to derive a MOE. MOEs were derived for
    each chemical by comparing the estimated chemical exposure for a very conservative
    exposure scenario to a level of exposure at which no or limited adverse effects were
    seen. A judgement of safety could then be based on the magnitude of this MOE. MOEs
    derived from the risk assessment were found to be adequately protective, indicating
    a low health concern for human exposure to chemicals through ingestion of drinking-
    water, even in extreme exposure circumstances.

    Biofilms
    Biofilms in drinking-water are formed when microorganisms grow on drinking-water
    pipes and other surfaces. Although most microorganisms in biofilms are believed to be
    non-pathogenic, some biofilms can include free-living microorganisms and pathogens
    such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella spp., and Naegleria fowleri. Biofilm-forming
    microorganisms attach faster to hydrophobic nonpolar surfaces, such as plastics,
    than to hydrophilic surfaces. Environmental conditions can also influence biofilm
    formation on plastics and microplastics. A limited number of occurrence studies in
    fresh water indicate the possibility that microplastics could enable the long-distance
    transport of pathogens and increase the transfer of antimicrobial resistant genes
    between microorganisms. However, there is no evidence to suggest a human health
    risk from microplastic-associated biofilms in drinking-water. The risk is considered far
    lower than the well-established risk posed by the high concentrations and diversity of
    pathogens in human and livestock waste in drinking-water sources. Further, the relative
    concentration of microplastics in fresh water is significantly lower than other particles
    that pathogens can adhere to in fresh water. For microplastics that are not removed
    during drinking-water treatment, the relative significance of microplastic-associated
    biofilms is still likely negligible due to the much larger surface area of drinking-water
    distribution systems and their subsequent ability to support more biofilms, compared
    to microplastics.

Treatment technologies for removing microplastics from
water
Wastewater and drinking-water treatment systems—where they exist—are considered
highly effective in removing particles with characteristics similar to those of microplastics.
Properties relevant to removal in water treatment include size, density and surface
charge. According to available data, wastewater treatment can effectively remove
more than 90% of microplastics from wastewater, with the highest removals from
tertiary treatment such as filtration. Although there are only limited data available on
the efficacy of microplastic removal during drinking-water treatment, such treatment
has proven effective in removing far more particles of smaller size and at far higher
concentrations than those of microplastics. Conventional treatment, when optimized to
produce treated water of low turbidity, can remove particles smaller than a micrometre
through processes of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation/flotation and filtration.
Advanced treatment can remove smaller particles. For example, nanofiltration can
remove particles >0.001 µm while ultrafiltration can remove particles >0.01µm.
These facts combined with well-understood removal mechanisms point to the rational
conclusion that water treatment processes can effectively remove microplastics.

An important consideration is that wastewater and drinking-water treatment is not
available nor optimized in many countries. Approximately 67% of the population in
low- and middle-income countries lack access to sewage connections and about 20%
of household wastewater collected in sewers does not undergo at least secondary
treatment (UNICEF/WHO, 2019). In these places, microplastics may exist in greater
concentrations in freshwater sources of drinking-water; however, the health risks
associated with exposure to pathogens present in untreated or inadequately treated
water will be far greater. By addressing the bigger problem of exposure to untreated
water, communities can simultaneously address the smaller concern related to
microplastics in surface water and other drinking-water supplies.

Another factor to consider is how treatment waste is handled. Plastics are not
usually destroyed, but rather transferred from one phase to another. For this reason,
water treatment waste needs to be considered as a potential source of microplastics
contamination in the environment. There are currently limited data available on how
treatment wastes are handled and the impact they may have on the environment.

Managing plastic and microplastic pollution in the
environment
Irrespective of whether there are any risks to human health from ingestion of
microplastics in drinking-water, there is a need to improve management of plastics



                                                                             Executive summary   xi
      and reduce plastic pollution to protect the environment and human well-being. Poorly
      managed plastic can contribute to sanitation-related risks and air pollution, and impact
      tourism and overall quality of life. If plastic emissions into the environment continue at
      current rates, there may be widespread risks associated with microplastics to aquatic
      ecosystems within a century (SAPEA, 2019), with potentially concurrent increases
      in human exposure.

      In response to concerns about the impact of plastic and microplastic pollution, public
      engagement and political commitment has increased. More than 60 countries are
      already taxing or banning single-use plastics, primarily plastic bags (UNEP, 2018).

      Strategies to reduce the number of plastics released into the environment are critical
      to the effort to minimize adverse impacts of discarded plastics. Where simple, low
      cost actions can be taken to make even a small difference to plastic inputs to the
      environment, it would be sensible to implement them. Actions could include improving
      recycling programmes, reducing littering, improving circular solutions, reducing the
      use of plastics where possible and decreasing waste inputs into the environment by
      industry. Care must be taken, however, when considering mitigation strategies so that
      addressing one problem does not simply result in the creation of a new one. This is
      particularly important in view of the limited data on sources of different sizes and
      types of microplastics, including the very small particles that are currently not well
      quantified. The benefits of plastic must also be considered before introducing policies
      and initiatives. For example, single-use syringes play an important role in preventing
      infections. Priority management actions should be “no regrets,” in that they confer
      multiple benefits and/or that they are cost-effective.

      Recommendations
      Routine monitoring of microplastics in drinking-water is not recommended at this
      time, as there is no evidence to indicate a human health concern. Concerns over
      microplastics in drinking-water should not divert resources of water suppliers and
      regulators from removing microbial pathogens, which remains the most significant
      risk to human health from drinking-water along with other chemical priorities. As
      part of water safety planning, water suppliers should ensure that control measures
      are effective and should optimize water treatment processes for particle removal and
      microbial safety, which will incidentally improve the removal of microplastic particles.

      However, for researchers, it would be appropriate to undertake targeted, well-
      designed and quality-controlled investigative studies to better understand the sources
      and occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water, the efficacy of
      different treatment processes and combinations of processes, and the significance



xii   Microplastics in drinking-water
of the potential return of microplastics to the environment from treatment waste
streams including the application of sludge biosolids to agricultural land.

Measures should also be taken to better manage plastics and reduce the use of plastics
where possible, to minimize plastic and microplastic pollution despite the low human
health risk posed by exposure to microplastics in drinking-water, as such actions can
confer other benefits to the environment and human well-being.

Research needs
To better assess human health risks and inform management actions, a number of
research gaps need to be filled. With respect to exposure, there is a need to better
understand microplastics occurrence throughout the water supply chain, using quality-
assured methods to determine the numbers, shapes, sizes, composition and sources
of microplastics and to better characterize the effectiveness of water treatment.
Research is also needed to better understand the significance of treatment-related
waste streams as contributors of microplastics to the environment.

With respect to potential health effects, quality-assured toxicological data are needed
on the most common forms of plastic particles relevant for human health risk
assessment. Further, a better understanding on the uptake and fate of microplastics
and nanoplastics following ingestion is needed.

Finally, given that humans can be exposed to microplastics through a variety of
environmental media, including food and air, a better understanding of overall exposure
to microplastics from the broader environment is needed.

1.1 Purpose of this report
This report focuses on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water and the
potential risks to human health that may be associated with such exposure. The target
audience includes drinking-water regulators, policy makers and water suppliers. The
purpose of this report is to increase understanding on the issue of microplastics in
drinking-water and to summarize how current knowledge might influence policy and
management actions as well as research needs. Given the broad interest in plastic
and microplastic pollution, this document may also be of interest to researchers,
the public and civil society groups concerned with plastic pollution. Additionally, a
separate information sheet has been prepared that summarizes the key findings and
conclusions in this report that the public and other stakeholders may find useful. This
report, focused specifically on bottled water and tap water, marks the beginning of
WHO's effort to assess the potential human health risks associated with exposure
to microplastics in the environment.


1.2 Scope of this report
This document summarizes the latest knowledge on microplastics in drinking-water.
It references other routes of human exposure such as food and air to provide a
benchmark for the relative significance of exposure via drinking-water. It does not
cover the extensive literature relating to the potential ecological effects of microplastics
in the wider environment (see Box 1.1). Nanoplastics are considered in this report,
although at present there is insufficient information available for an in-depth evaluation.      




   Box 1.1 The risk of microplastics to aquatic ecosystems

   There is a growing body of literature on the possible ecological effects of microplastics in freshwater
   environments and extensive literature on plastics of all sizes in the marine environment. Oceans serve
   as the ultimate sink for much of the world’s mismanaged plastic and microplastic waste, including from
   freshwater environments. While the literature has been reviewed elsewhere (GESAMP, 2015, 2016; FAO,
   2017; SAPEA, 2019) and is not repeated here, the key conclusions are that although large pieces of plastic
   are harmful to marine life, the impact of microplastics is less certain. However, there may be widespread
   risks to aquatic ecosystems within a century if microplastic emission in the environment continues at the
   current rate (SAPEA, 2019). It is important to make clear though, that risks to the aquatic ecosystem do
   not necessarily equate to human health risks.




                                                                                        Chapter 1: Introduction   1
    Brief background information is provided on plastic production and the value of plastics
    to society (section 1.3), since policy and management actions (Chapter 6) should also
    consider the broader benefits of plastics.  

    The state of knowledge on microplastics is evolving rapidly, as evidenced by the
    significant increase in the number of recent publications, including research articles
    that address the issue. A number of initiatives are being taken up by governments,
    universities and other stakeholders to better understand the occurrence of microplastics
    in freshwater environments and drinking-water as well as the effectiveness of water
    treatment technologies. This report may therefore be updated once a significant body
    of further evidence becomes available. Currently, WHO is focusing efforts on a more
    in-depth assessment of potential human health risks of microplastics in the environment
    and intends to publish a complementary report to this document.


    1.3 Background
    Interest in microplastics in drinking-water was stimulated initially by studies (Kosuth,
    Mason and Wattenberg, 2018; Mason, Welch and Neratko, 2018) that reported
    the presence of microplastics in tap water and in bottled water. Since then, several
    additional studies have been published (Oßmann et al., 2018; Pivokonsky et al., 2018;
    Schymanski et al., 2018; Strand et al., 2018; Uhl, Eftekhardadkhah and Svendsen,
    2018; Mintenig et al., 2019) leading to genuine questions and concerns about whether
    the presence of microplastics in drinking-water poses a risk to human health. Risk,
    however, is a function of both hazard and exposure, and the presence of microplastics
    in drinking-water does not necessarily equate to a risk to human health. With scant
    data available on both hazard and exposure, WHO collated and reviewed existing
    information on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water, consequent human
    exposure via drinking-water, and the potential effects on human health. Since fresh
    water provides a vital source of drinking-water, occurrence of microplastics in fresh
    water was also reviewed, as were data on removal in drinking-water treatment which
    offers an effective barrier to a wide range of particles.

    1.3.1 Definitions of microplastics  

    The definition of microplastics is not completely straightforward. Microplastics
    represent a diverse range of material types, shapes, colours and sizes (Thompson, 2015).
    To account for these complexities, researchers have proposed definitions for plastic
    debris (Hartmann et al., 2019) and microplastics (Verschoor, 2015), for example, by
    describing them according to specific criteria. Because of the different methods used
    to collect and quantify microplastics, it was not possible to apply a uniform definition




2   Microplastics in drinking-water
to the results of existing studies. However, the lack of a uniform definition does not
impact this assessment, nor the conclusions in this report.

Most definitions in the literature focus on composition and size. A widely used definition
describes microplastics as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in length. However,
this is a rather arbitrary definition and is of limited value in the context of drinking-
water since particles at the upper end of the size range are unlikely to be found in
treated drinking-water. Some groups define a lower bound at about 1 µm. The lower
bound is often simply a function of the sampling and analytical technique used in the
study. A subset of microplastics smaller than 1 µm in length are often referred to as
nanoplastics, but again with an inconsistent upper bound.

As for the composition of microplastics, there is again no standard definition. Many studies
focus on particles made from synthetic polymers rather than using the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) definition, which excludes elastomeric materials
(ISO, 2013). The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research defines plastics as
a subgroup of polymers including elastomers and modified natural polymers (Braun et
al., 2018). The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA, 2019) uses solid polymer-containing
particles but excludes natural polymers that have not been modified.

Microplastics are sometimes categorized as two types, primary and secondary.
Primary microplastics are specifically manufactured in the microplastic size range, for
example industrial abrasives used in sandblasting and microbeads used in cosmetics.
Secondary microplastics are formed by the fragmentation and weathering of larger
plastic items (e.g. bags, bottles, clothing, tyres, etc.) either from wear or from their
release into the environment.

1.3.2 Plastic production and types

Plastics are formed by the reaction of small organic molecules called monomers resulting
in long polymer chains. Some polymers, such as polyethylene (PE), are formed by addition
polymerization. Others, such as nylon, are formed by condensation reactions in which
small molecules, often water, are eliminated in the process of creating a longer chain.

The polymers used to make a plastic are almost always mixed with additives, including
colourants, plasticizers, stabilizers, fillers, and reinforcements. These additives affect
the chemical composition, chemical and mechanical properties and cost of the plastic.

There are two general types of plastics: thermoplastics and thermoset plastics.
Thermoplastics soften when heated, can be reformed and then harden when
cooled. This process can be repeated numerous times, which means thermoplastics
can be recycled. Thermoplastics include PE (used in toys, shampoo bottles, pipes,




                                                                        Chapter 1: Introduction   3
    etc.), polypropylene (PP—used in food packaging, snack wrappers, auto parts, etc.),
    polyethylene terephthalate (PET—often used for water and other beverage bottles),
    polystyrene (PS—used in foam food containers, eyeglasses, building insulation, etc.),
    polyvinylchloride (PVC—used in window frames, pipes, cable insulation, etc.), and
    others including polycarbonates (PC) and polyamides (PA). Thermoset plastics will
    not soften upon heating because permanent chemical bonds form between polymer
    chains (crosslinking). Thermoset plastics include polyurethane (PUR—used in building
    insulation, pillows and mattresses, insulating foams, etc.), epoxy resins, some acrylic
    resins and some polyesters.

    In the context of drinking-water, PE and PVC are used in water distribution mains and
    epoxy resins, PUR for relining existing mains, PP for various components and PA as
    coagulant aids in water treatment. Plastics are also used in membrane filters in water
    treatment systems. In the context of bottled water, PET is often used to make the
    bottles and PP and PE to make bottle caps. These materials are often regulated to
    ensure they do not leach substances (e.g. monomers, plasticizers or other additives)
    at concentrations of concern into drinking-water.

    Biodegradable plastics are plastics that can be decomposed by hydrolysis or ultraviolet
    (UV) light degradation or the action of microorganisms, usually bacteria. They can be
    made from either renewable raw materials or from petrochemicals. However, some
    “biodegradable” plastics require prolonged exposure to temperatures above 50°C
    to degrade completely. Such conditions exist in industrial composting but are rarely,
    if ever, met in the environment. Some plastics contain pro-oxidants which promote
    fragmentation, but there is some controversy as to whether there is any actual
    biodegradation of these plastics in the environment because they have the potential
    to form microplastics (UNEP, 2015).

    1.3.3 Estimates of global quantities of plastics produced

    World plastic production has increased roughly exponentially since large-scale production
    first began in the 1950s (see Figure 1.1). Global plastic production, excluding fibres,
    increased from 322 million tonnes (Mt) in 2015 (Plastics Europe, 2017) to 348 Mt in
    2017 (Plastics Europe, 2018). With fibres included, global production was estimated
    to be 381 Mt in 2015 and with additives included, 407 Mt (Geyer, Jambeck and Law,
    2017). Considering the estimated worldwide population growth rate and current
    consumption and waste habits, plastic production is predicted to double by 2025 and

    Of total non-fibre plastic production, 36% is PE, 21% is PP, 12% is PVC, and less than

the next largest group, much of which is PET. Together, these seven groups account for
92% of all plastics ever made (Geyer, Jambeck and Law, 2017). Intentional microplastic
production represents <0.1% of total plastic production based on European figures
from ECHA (2019) and Plastics Europe (2018).

1.3.4 Value to society

The proliferation of plastics can be attributed to their many desirable attributes. Different
plastics have different properties; they can be inexpensive, flexible, robust, lightweight,
waterproof, easy to clean and sterilize, and act as insulators. They are often the most
economical and sometimes only option in certain applications. Plastics are common in
packaging, building and construction materials, the automotive industry, electrical and
electronic parts, household leisure and sports products and the agricultural sector.
                                                                   Plastics are also used in a wide variety

    Economically, the plastic industry provides employment to millions of people. The
    European plastic industry, for instance, is estimated to involve 60 000 companies
    employing 1.5 million people, with a turnover of 355 billion Euros. The European
    industry represents 18.5% of the annual global plastics market of 348 Mt in 2017
    (Plastics Europe, 2018). Globally, employment and turnover may be five times the
    European estimate.


    1.4 Overview of contents
    Below is a brief description of each chapter to assist the reader in navigating the
    contents of this report.

    Chapter 2: Occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water
    This chapter summarizes what is known about the occurrence of microplastics in
    fresh water and drinking-water and describes the possible sources and transport of
    microplastics into the freshwater environment. It also includes information on sampling
    and analytical methods, the quality of the occurrence studies and, for comparative
    purposes, some information on microplastics in food and air.

    Chapter 3: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-
    water: particles and chemicals
    The potential hazards associated with microplastics in drinking-water include particles,
    chemicals and biofilms. This chapter examines microplastic particles and chemicals,
    including those that make up plastics: monomers and additives, as well as chemicals
    from the environment that may sorb to microplastics. The relevant health effects data
    for microplastic particles are summarized and information is presented on potential
    human health risks in the context of exposure.

    Chapter 4: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-
    water: biofilms
    This chapter examines the growth of microorganisms, or biofilms, on microplastics
    and the associated possible risks to human health.

    Chapter 5: Treatment technologies for removing microplastics from water
    Drinking-water treatment has an important role in reducing concentrations of
    microplastics that have been introduced into source waters. This chapter therefore
    discusses the effectiveness of drinking-water treatment in removing microplastics. Since
    wastewater effluent has been identified as a key source of microplastics in surface
    waters, an overview of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment is also provided.

Chapter 6: Managing plastic and microplastic pollution in the environment
This chapter discusses the benefits of plastic and microplastic waste management and
options to minimize plastic pollution into the environment.

Chapter 7: Conclusions, recommendations and knowledge gaps
This chapter summarizes key conclusions and research needs and recommends actions
for drinking-water regulators, policy-makers and water suppliers.

Annex1 supplements the information included in Chapter 2. It includes a summary
of a recent WHO-commissioned review of the literature by Koelmans et al. (2019)
on occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water, fresh water and wastewater. It also

    2. Occurrence of microplastics in fresh
       water and drinking-water

    2.1 Introduction
    This section summarizes what is known about the occurrence of microplastics in fresh
    water and drinking-water. The chapter begins with background information on the
    possible sources and transport of microplastics into the freshwater environment; the
    variety of methods used for sampling and analysis; the quality of existing occurrence
    studies; and recommendations on how to improve study methods. It then presents
    data from occurrence studies along with data on polymer types and particle shapes.
    For comparative purposes, some data on the presence of microplastics in food and
    air are included.


    2.2 Sources and transport of microplastics into water
    Tracing the sources and transport of microplastics in the environment is a complex
    task. Little is understood about the processes that govern the transport of microplastics
    through freshwater environments. However, key factors influencing their transport
    and distribution will be the inherent properties of the microplastics, i.e. their density,
    size and shape. Common consumer plastics range in density from 0.85 to 1.41 g/cm3
    (Eerkes-Medrano, Thompson and Aldridge, 2015). This range straddles the density
    of fresh water (1 g/cm3) so some microplastics will sink and some will float in water.
    The density of the microplastic, and hence where it sits in the water column, will
    also be influenced by the formation of a biofilm on its surface (Shah et al., 2008;
    see Chapter 4 for information on biofilms). The densities of a range of plastics are
    included in Table 2.1.

    Given the diverse uses of plastics, the many different shapes and types of microplastics
    and the myriad routes to freshwater environments, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint
    or quantify all sources of microplastics to freshwater environments. Available
    information on inputs of microplastics into the aquatic environment is often based
    on modelling, and there are insufficient data to accurately validate these modelled
    estimates. Further, there are insufficient methods to track the sources and transport
    of microplastics in the environment (SAPEA, 2019). Nevertheless, there is a general
    tendency to observe higher concentrations of microplastics in areas near densely
    populated urban centres (Eriksen et al., 2013; Baldwin, Corsi and Mason, 2016).
    A recent review of the literature (Alimi et al., 2018) estimates loads into different




8   Microplastics in drinking-water
environmental compartments. Sources of microplastics into fresh water included:
run-off from land-based sources, wastewater effluents and mishandled plastic wastes.
Each of these and other potential sources are described below.

2.2.1 Run-off from land-based sources

Several studies (Sundt, Schulze and Syversen, 2014; Lassen et al., 2015; Sherrington et
al., 2016; Boucher and Friot, 2017) have attempted to characterize the various inputs of
microplastics into the aquatic environment from land-based sources, although many of
these studies have focused on inputs into the marine environment. Land-based sources
of microplastics into the aquatic environment, including fresh water, can originate from
a variety of activities, infrastructure and land use practices. For instance, road surface
run-off from the breakdown of road-marking paints and tyre wear debris has been
suggested to be a significant input (Verschoor, 2016; FWR, 2017). Another important
land-based source of microplastics is microplastic fibres that are released from textiles
due to wear-and-tear and washing (Lassen et al., 2015; Henry, Laitala and Klepp, 2019;
Schöpel and Stamminger, 2019). “City dust”, which is used to describe a number of
sources related to abrasion of objects, such as synthetic soles of footwear and artificial
turfs, can collectively be significant (Boucher and Friot, 2017). Finally, agricultural run-off
has been identified as a potential source of microplastics in freshwater environments,
particularly where sewage sludge has been applied to the land or where agricultural
plastics, such as those used for mulching, have been used (Horton et al., 2017).

     2.2.2 Wastewater effluent

     Wastewater effluent is another widely recognized source of microplastic pollution
     in fresh water (FWR, 2017; WE&RF, 2017). Increases in microplastic concentrations
     downstream of effluent discharge compared to upstream have been reported in the
     UK (Kay et al., 2018) and the USA (McCormick et al., 2014). As summarized by the
     Science Advice for Policy by European Academies (SAPEA, 2019), synthetic textile
     fibres from clothes washing, cosmetic microbeads1 and disintegrated parts of larger
     consumer products that are flushed down toilets and sinks are major domestic inputs
     into sewage systems (see Box 2.1).



           Box 2.1 Lack of sewage treatment: the bigger problem?

           Although treated wastewater effluent is recognized as an input of microplastics in fresh water, well-
           equipped sewage treatment can effectively remove most microplastics from the effluent (see section 5.2).
           Most wastewater in high-income countries is in fact collected in sewers and then treated. However, in
           low- and middle-income countries, only 33% of the population have sewer connections. Wastewater for
           the remaining 67% of the population is collected and treated in onsite systems or discharged directly to soil
           and water bodies (UNICEF/WHO, 2019). Therefore, the lack of wastewater treatment or other appropriate
           systems for collecting and treating wastewater may be the more significant issue.


     The large volume of effluent produced from wastewater treatment means that, even
     with effective removal, high absolute numbers of microplastics can be discharged.
     One study calculated that 65 million microplastic particles were released each day in
     the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), equating to approximately
     100 particles/population-equivalent/day (Murphy et al., 2016). Such estimates are highly
     variable, for example, Carr, Liu and Tesoro (2016) estimated that for every microplastic
     particle discharged to the environment from wastewater treatment, 1140 L of water
     was discharged from a secondary WWTP. Based on 120 L water use/person/day, this
     is three orders of magnitude below the per-capita estimate quoted above.

     2.2.3 Combined sewer overflows

     Combined sewer overflows designed to cope with storm events and heavy rainfall
     can also be direct sources of microplastics in fresh waters since the barrier provided
     by wastewater treatment is temporarily bypassed (FWR, 2017).

         Inputs of cosmetic microbeads into the aquatic environment, while considered minor compared to other sources (Boucher and Friot, 2017; WE&RF,
         2017), have been minimized after voluntary initiatives from the industry and government restrictions on the use of microbeads in wash-off
         cosmetics in a number of countries (e.g. Defra and Gove, 2018).

2.2.4 Industrial effluent

The relative contribution of industrial effluents to microplastics in wastewaters has yet
to be investigated (van Wezel et al., 2018 as cited in SAPEA, 2019). However, industry-
related microplastics have been reported in fresh waters. In particular, pre-production
pellets have been detected in the Great Lakes, the Danube River and a river in the Los
Angeles basin (Eerkes-Medrano, Thompson and Aldridge, 2015). Whilst these pellets
may represent a concern to aquatic wildlife, they will not be found in treated drinking-
water because of their size. However, if they are degraded to smaller microplastics,
they may pose more of a challenge to drinking-water treatment processes. Some PE
manufacturers have installed fine-meshed filters on the outgoing storm and process
water in an effort to significantly reduce emissions (Lassen et al., 2015).    

2.2.5 Fragmentation and degradation of macroplastics

Macroplastic debris originating from urban environments can enter freshwater systems
(Gasperi et al., 2014; Morritt et al., 2014) and may also represent an important source of
microplastic formation by fragmentation. Data are limited on the rates of fragmentation
and degradation of macroplastics in the marine or freshwater environment. Nevertheless,
the large volumes of macroplastics observed in the marine environment have been
suggested to be a significant source of microplastics, as it is assumed that these materials
will eventually fragment and degrade (Barnes et al., 2009). Once macroplastic debris
has reached the aquatic environment, UV radiation and high temperatures can cause
chemical changes, making plastics brittle and thus more susceptible to fragmentation
and degradation (Andrady, 2007a; Andrady, 2007b). Similar processes are likely to
operate in freshwater and marine environments. Zbyszwski and Corcoran (2011)
examined degradation patterns of microplastics in fresh waters using a scanning electron
microscope and found them similar to those found on marine beaches (Corcoran,
Beisinger, and Grifi, 2009). Hüffer et al. (2017) noted that in estimating the amount of
secondary microplastics formed, the total production volume may be less relevant than
the release processes and subsequent fragmentation in the environment. It is possible
that further fragmentation of microplastics to nanoplastics can occur and Alimi et al.
(2018) has stated that “although environmental levels of nanoplastics are yet to be
quantified, plastic nanolitter is expected to be as ubiquitous as its bulk counterparts.”  

2.2.6 Atmospheric deposition

Atmospheric deposition has been identified as an additional potential contributor to
microplastics in freshwater environments through wet and dry deposition, precipitation
and run-off (Wright and Kelly, 2017). Further information on airborne microplastics
is included in section 2.8.2.

               The schematic above (Figure 2.1) outlines some potential sources and transport
               mechanisms of plastics and microplastics in fresh water in relation to how microplastics
               may reach drinking-water.

               2.2.7 Drinking-water production and distribution

               While drinking-water treatment provides an effective barrier to a wide range of
               waterborne particles, including, probably to microplastics (see section 5.3), some
               treatment-plant components and distribution networks are made from plastic and their
               erosion or degradation may contribute to microplastics in drinking-water (Mintenig et
               al., 2019). Similarly, the bottles and caps of some bottled waters are made of plastic,
               which themselves may be a source of microplastics in drinking-water (Oßmann et al.,
               2018; Schymanski et al., 2018—see section A.4 for further information).


               2.3 General principles of sampling and analysis
               Historically, analysis for microplastics has focused on environmental samples. However,
               there is currently no standard method for sampling and analysis of microplastics in
               the environment, although ISO are currently looking at this issue and a number of
               reviews have been conducted to compare methods (ISO, in press; Hidalgo-Ruz et al.,
               2012; Li, Liu and Chen, 2018).




12             Microplastics in drinking-water
Sampling and analysis involves three complex steps: (1) sampling; (2) sample extraction
and isolation; and (3) identification, characterization and quantification. The environmental
medium being examined (e.g., water, sewage sludge
or effluent) determines the procedures required for                   There is currently no
sampling and preparation. Methods for drinking-water                 standard method for
are derived from those used in environmental water                   sampling and analysis
samples, but few studies have been conducted and,                   of microplastics in the
again, there is no agreement on a standard method.                        environment.

2.3.1 Sampling

Microplastic samples can be acquired using trawl nets (typically 300 μm) drawn
across the surface of the water, or through collection of water samples from which
the particles are extracted later. Initial sample purification usually involves filtration,
followed by some sort of extraction process such as density separation, in which
samples are mixed with a liquid of defined density, allowing microplastic particles to
float and heavier particles to sink (see Table 2.1 for a list of plastics and their densities).
Further purification may require chemical or enzymatic methods to remove organic
or inorganic contaminants (biofouling). The extent of the preparation is dependent on
the nature of the samples: dirtier samples will require more preparation. Since treated
drinking-water and bottled water are relatively clean media, some of the purification
steps required for other environmental samples may not be necessary.

2.3.2 Analysis

Microplastics are recovered from the supernatant and filtered or sieved. The
concentrate may be visually sorted before quantification by microscopic counting
with or without tagging using dyes, but neither of these methods can unambiguously
confirm the particles are plastics.

Three different approaches are available to determine the chemical composition and/or
size of plastic particles: spectroscopic, thermoanalytical, and chemical. These methods
are described briefly below. For further information about these methods, including
capabilities and limitations related to detection levels and the ability to detect particle
dimensions, see Braun et al. (2018).

Spectroscopic methods are used to identify the specific chemical structure of polymers
by comparing their absorption or emission spectra with reference spectra. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a well-established, relatively fast and reliable
spectroscopic method that, when coupled with microscopy, can identify particles to
about 10–20 µm. However, biofilms, if not removed, can interfere with the detection




                                Chapter 2: Occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water   13
     of microplastics. FTIR also requires expensive instrumentation not available in many
     laboratories. Microscopy coupled with Raman spectroscopy can identify particles in
     the 1–20 µm range. However, it can be subject to interference, may be slow, and also
     requires expensive instrumentation.

     With thermoanalytical methods, the sample is pyrolysed under inert conditions, so
     that specific decomposition products of the individual polymers can be analyzed. These
     methods tend to require larger particle masses compared to spectroscopic methods.
     Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can provide information
     on additives as well as the polymer, and if the sample is large enough, can identify the
     polymer composition of nanoplastic particles.

     Conventional chemical methods such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
     can be used to decompose the samples and detect specific fragments of polymers
     or elements. Again, these tend to require larger particle masses (Braun et al., 2018).

     Software packages are often used in both tagging and spectroscopic studies to recognize
     and count particles and to characterize particles by comparing them with library spectra.


     2.4 Overall reliability of studies
     Throughout the sampling and analysis process, careful controls need to be in place to
     avoid contamination, as microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment. A systematic
     review of 50 studies on microplastics in fresh water, drinking-water and wastewater
     commissioned by WHO (Koelmans et al., 2019) concluded that methods for microplastic
                                        sampling and analysis of water samples need to be
     The majority of microplastic improved for reproducibility and comparability of
      occurrence studies are not results. To determine the reliability of the studies,
       considered fully reliable.       Koelmans et al. (2019) applied nine quality control
      There is a significant need       criteria adapted from criteria developed for biota
         to improve the quality         samples (Hermsen et al., 2018). Only 4 of 50 studies
       assurance of occurrence          received positive scores in all criteria. A full 46 studies
       studies on microplastics.        were not considered reliable on at least one crucial
                                        criterion. Areas requiring the most improvement
     included sample treatment, polymer identification, laboratory preparation, clean air
     conditions and positive controls. The fact that data or a study may not be fully reliable
     according to these criteria does not imply that the data are not useful.

     Some improvements in quality assurance for sampling and analysis methods may have
     already occurred since the four studies that received positive scores in all criteria
     were the more recent ones, published in 2017 and 2018. Average quality scores were

highest in the studies assessing bottled water, followed by tap water, water from a
drinking-water treatment plant (DWTP), surface water and wastewater. This ranking
likely reflects the relative ease of analysing the different water types (Koelmans et al.,
2019). Further details on the systematic review including the nine key quality control
criteria are summarized in the annex and recommendations to improve sampling and
analytical methods are included in Box 2.2.



  Box 2.2 Recommendations to improve sampling and
  analytical methods

  There is a general need to improve microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The following
  improvements are considered to be particularly important:
   Studies should provide complete information about the method of sampling so that it can be
     reproduced.
   The sample volumes will depend of the nature of the water being sampled and size of the particles
     being analysed, which in turn is determined by the filter or mesh size being used. Sample volumes
     should be sufficiently large to reliably detect low microplastic concentrations.
   Wherever possible, plastic material should be avoided for sampling and analyses. If plastic material
     must be used, it should be characterised and reported.
   Materials should be rinsed with filtered water to avoid contamination.
   Sampling and sample processing should be carried out by trained professionals or the quality of
     samples collected or processed by volunteers should be (quantitatively) validated against results
     obtained by professionals.
   If preservatives are used, their ability to affect polymer mass or particle shapes should be tested,
     either in the context of the study or via literature support.
   Laboratory surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned with filtered water to avoid contamination.
   All samples should be handled in a laminar-flow hood or in a clean-air laboratory.
   Blanks should be run, per day or per series, at least in triplicate, to verify and correct for
     contamination and results should be corrected against blanks.
   Positive controls should be used to verify the recovery of particles during digestion, density
     separation and filtration steps.
   Digestion should be applied when necessary. Usually digestion is not necessary for drinking-water
     from a treated source. However, for surface water and wastewater samples, where high organic matter
     concentrations hamper the selection and (visual) identification of particles, a digestion step is required.
   Polymer identification is required for a representative subsample of the entire sample.
   Data should be reported as number of particles/L and mass/L together with their detection limits.
     Minimum and maximum particle sizes and when possible, morphologies should be specified. All
     these characteristics may inform the risk assessment.
   Standard methods of sampling and analysis should be developed but may differ for the different
     media being sampled. For example, sediment methods may differ from seawater methods which
     will also differ from drinking-water methods. As far as possible the same principles need to be
     followed.




                                     Chapter 2: Occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water      15
     2.5 Microplastic concentrations reported in fresh water
     Microplastics are frequently present in the freshwater environment, with studies
     reporting particle counts ranging from around 0 to 103 particles/L (Koelmans et al.,
     2019). The relative concentration of microplastics detected is dependent on the
     location, the sampling technique (mesh size) and method of analysis. Larger sieves
     will not retain small particles, so total particle numbers will be lower from samples
     taken with large sieves than from small sieves.

     In Koelmans et al. (2019), 31 studies of microplastics in fresh water were identified
     and the six highest-scoring studies in terms of methodological quality (studies with
     a total accumulated score (TAS), greater than nine or 50% of the maximum value),
     are summarized in Table 2.2 below. The reported concentrations of microplastics
     ranged from averages of 4.7 particles/L in the study using a 48 µm sieve down to
     0.00026 particles/L in a study using a 333 µm sieve. Not surprisingly, the one groundwater
     study found low concentrations of microplastics relative to other water types despite
     using a very small sieve size (3 µm). A priori, low particle counts would be expected
     in many groundwaters because of the protection afforded by the overlying strata.

         These values include samples of groundwater and drinking-water derived from groundwater subject to further filtration.




16   Microplastics in drinking-water
A direct comparison of data between studies of fresh water and drinking-water,
described below, cannot be made because in most cases freshwater studies targeted
larger particles, using mesh sizes that were an order of magnitude larger than those
used in drinking-water studies (see Box 2.3). Consequently, the small particles detected
in drinking-water are not detected in most freshwater studies.



   Box 2.3 Interpretation and comparison of occurrence studies

   Interpretation and comparison of study results reporting microplastic particle numbers should be done with
   great care, as the studies often use different methods, including filter size and enumeration methods. This
   means some studies will not detect smaller sized particles at all or will characterize non-plastics as plastics.



2.6 Microplastic concentrations reported in drinking-
    water
A total of nine studies measured microplastics in drinking-water. Particle concentrations
reported in individual samples ranged from 0 to over 104 particles/L and mean
values ranged from roughly 10-3 particles/L in a study of drinking-water derived from
groundwater to over 103 particles/L. In general, groundwaters are well protected
from particulate contamination. Similarly, conventional drinking-water treatment is
expected to provide an effective barrier for a wide range of particle sizes (see further
information in section 5.3).

Different studies looked at different ranges of particle sizes and had different cut-offs
for reporting particle sizes. Studies typically used a filter with a mesh or pore size
of less than 10 µm and in some cases characterized particles as small as 1 µm. In the
context of drinking-water, an arbitrary cut-off of 100 µm in length was suggested to
distinguish large particle from small particles (Koelmans et al., 2019). Where studies
looked at both large and small particles, small particles tended to be more numerous.
Since there were so few studies, each is described in more detail in the annex. They
are described in the annex in order of decreasing study quality, as determined by
the TAS quantitative assessment, primarily from Koelmans et al. (2019). Some key
results of the eight of the nine scored studies are summarized in Table 2.3. There was
insufficient detail to fully assess the study quality of one of the studies, and therefore,
is not summarized in the below table, but a short description is included in the annex
for completeness.

                                     Chapter 2: Occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water   19
     2.7 Particle size, shape and polymer type in fresh water
         and drinking-water
     Size, shape and polymer type are characteristics of microplastics that may influence
     how they are transported in water and may have implications for toxicity and efficacy
     of drinking-water treatment. Below is a brief summary of the characteristics of
     microplastic particles found in freshwater and drinking-water samples. For a detailed
     overview, see Koelmans et al. (2019).

     The smallest particle sizes measured in fresh water are determined by the mesh size of
     the trawl net, which is typically 300 µm, although a few studies have been conducted
     with finer meshes. Higher particle counts tend to be reported when smaller particles
     are measured (Koelmans et al., 2019). Based on current analytical capabilities, particle
     sizes measured in drinking-water can be as low as 1 µm. This does not imply that
     particles smaller than 1 µm are not in drinking-water, rather detection is limited by
     currently available methods.

     In freshwater studies, the shape of particles varied widely, with fragments, fibres,
     film, foam and pellets being the shapes most often reported (Koelmans et al., 2019).
     Fragments and fibres were the predominant particle types found in drinking-water.
     However, as stated by the authors, this data on shapes should be interpreted with
     caution, as they represent only a subset of isolated particles, which may or may not
     represent all particles. Also, each study focused on specific sizes and defined ambiguous
     shapes differently such as nurdle, pellet, pre-production pellet, resin or granule, making
     it difficult to compare across studies. Studies also differed in the extent to which their
     water samples represented the studied water systems or water type, which varied
     over space and time.

     PP, PE, PS, PVC and PET were the polymers detected most frequently, an order
     that agrees roughly with production volumes. As described above, in addition to the
     production volume, polymer density is a key factor in determining which particles
     might be detected in studies that sample the upper layer of water. In bottled water,
     there is some evidence that microplastic occurrence appears to be at least partially
     attributable to the bottling process and/or packaging.


     2.8 Other routes of exposure
     Since plastics are so widely used in society, the public will be frequently exposed to
     plastics and potentially to microplastics. This includes direct exposure, whereby any
     plastic item placed in the mouth may expose a person to microplastics by abrasion.




20   Microplastics in drinking-water
Small children may potentially have increased exposure given the number of plastic
toys and cups and cutlery made for children, and given oral exploration is a normal
stage of child development. Everyday use of household objects (e.g. plastic cutlery,
toothbrushes, cutting boards, cups, etc.) may also be sources of exposure. However,
given there are no data on such exposures, this section focuses on food and air.

2.8.1 Food

In 2016, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) conducted a comprehensive
review of existing data on microplastics in food. Nanoplastics were included within the
scope of the EFSA review, but no occurrence data were available. Of the 13 studies
cited, 10 measured microplastic concentrations in marine fish and shellfish. Typical
concentrations of microplastics were single-digit particles per fish ranging up to 7
particles per fish and up to 10 particles/g of shellfish. Particle sizes in fish ranged from
130–5000 µm. Particle sizes found in shellfish were typically in the ranges 5–25 µm and
20–90 µm, although in some cases, longer fibres up to 4700 µm were reported (FAO,
2017). One study looked at microplastic concentrations in honey, reporting 0.166
fibres/g (range 40–9000 µm) and 0.009 fragments/g (range 10–20 µm). Another study
analysed beer, reporting 0.025 fibres/mL and 0.033 fragments/mL (sizes not stated).
Particles found in honey and beer were not spectroscopically confirmed. Another
study examined salt, finding the highest concentration of microplastics in sea salt, at
0.550–0.681 particles/g (size 45–4300 µm).

Because mussels contained the highest median value of 4 microplastic particles/g
and since they are eaten without removing their digestive tract, mussels represent a
conservative microplastic exposure scenario for all fish and other seafood. Assuming
the microplastic particles were 25 µm diameter with a density of 0.92 g/cm3, EFSA
estimated an intake of 7 µg of microplastics based on a 225 g portion of mussels.
Based on intake at the highest concentration of sorbed contaminants or additives in
the plastics and complete release from the particles upon ingestion, EFSA estimated
that this scenario would result in very small increases in intakes of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) (<0.006% increase), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (<0.004%
increase) and bisphenol A (BPA) (about 2% increase). The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (2017) reached a similar conclusion for
PCBs, PAHs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), BPA and polybrominated diphenyl
ethers (PBDEs) considering the highest concentration of contaminants or additives
in microplastics and the same worst-case microplastic intake assumption applied by
EFSA. Note that systematic quality assessments for studies reporting microplastic
concentrations in food and air have not yet been conducted, aside from seafood as
reported in Hermsen et al., 2018.




                               Chapter 2: Occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water   21
     2.8.2 Air

     Limited data are available on levels of microplastics in air. Thus, the sources and
     transport mechanisms of microplastics in air remain poorly understood. A potentially
     important source of fine microplastic particulates to the atmosphere could be associated
     with tyre and road-wear particles. A recent study investigating the contributions of
     polymeric materials originating from tyre and road-wear particles, however, reported
     an average contribution of only 0.27% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in London,
     Los Angeles and Tokyo (Panko et al., 2019). Sea salt aerosol formation, wind-driven
     release of wastewater sludge, degradation of plastic sheeting and other construction
     materials, clothes drying, and wear and tear of textiles are all possible sources of
     airborne microplastics (Wright and Kelly, 2017). High concentrations of microplastics
     have been reported in occupational settings (SAPEA, 2019) and some data from
     domestic settings are outlined below.

     Dris et al. (2016) monitored microplastics in total atmospheric fallout at two sites in
     Paris. Fibres accounted for almost all of the material collected, the remainder being
     a few plastic fragments (<100 µm in size). Atmospheric fallout of between 2 and 355
     fibres/m2/day was calculated from experimental data. Total atmospheric fallout during
     wet weather periods was substantially larger than during dry periods but a statistically
     significant correlation was not found. The predominant fibres were 200–600 µm in
     length and 7–15 µm in diameter. FTIR of a subsample confirmed that 50% of the
     total fibres were natural (mainly wool and cotton) and 21% were manufactured by
     transformation of natural polymers (rayon or acetate from cellulose). The remaining
     29% contained at least some purely synthetic fibres, mainly PET and some PA. The
     lower size limit of the analysis was 50 μm.

     Dris et al. (2017) investigated the fibres present in indoor and outdoor air, as well as in
     indoor settled dust. Three indoor sites and one outdoor site in Paris were monitored.
     Overall, indoor concentrations ranged between 0.4 and 59.4 fibres/m3 with a median
     value of 5.4 fibres/m3. Outdoor concentrations were significantly lower, ranging between
     0.3 and 1.5 fibres/m3. The deposition rate of fibres in the indoor environments ranged
     between 1586 and 11 130 fibres/m2/day. The nature of the fibres was similar to that
     observed in the previous study by the same authors (described above): 67% were
     made of natural materials while the remaining 33% of fibres contained petrochemicals
     with PP being predominant. A similar size distribution was determined for indoor air,
     outdoor air and dust fall, and the distribution was similar to total atmospheric fallout
     with fibre length between 50 µm (the observation lower limit) and 450 µm.




22   Microplastics in drinking-water
Catarino et al. (2018) compared the relative exposure from ingesting marine mussels
with the level of exposure from household deposition during a meal. To estimate
microplastic exposure from mussels, measurements in mussels of 3 particles/g (mostly
fibres) were multiplied by average shellfish consumption in the UK to arrive at an
exposure level of 123 microplastic particles/year/capita in the UK and up to 4620
particles/year/capita in countries with a higher shellfish consumption. To estimate
microplastic concentrations that would accumulate on a dinner plate during a meal,
deposition rates of between 1 and 5 fibres were measured over a small surface area
(approximately 4 cm2) for 20 or 40 minutes. This yielded deposition rates over an
order of magnitude larger than those observed by Dris et al. (2017). A correction
was then made for the abundance of microplastics in dust based on Dris et al. (2017).
Estimated exposure to microplastics during a meal via dust fallout ranged from 13 731
to 68 415 particles/year/capita which was much larger than via mussel consumption
(4620 particles/year/capita). It should be stressed that these estimates were made by
extrapolating a small number of particles falling on a small surface area and so should
be treated with some caution.

     2.9 Conclusions and research needs
     Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment. They have been found in marine
     water, wastewater, fresh water, food, air and drinking-water, both bottled water and
     tap water. With the information available at this time, it is difficult to make a robust
     quantitative estimate on the relative contribution from difference sources.

     Two of the main inputs of microplastics into fresh water are surface run-off and
     wastewater effluent, although better data are required to quantify both these and
     other inputs and associate them with more specific sources.

     The quality and quantity of data varies across different water types. Data on the
     occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water are limited at present, with few reliable
     studies using different methods and tools to sample and analyse microplastic particles.

     Methods of sampling and analysis are not always straightforward. Important factors to
     consider when conducting sampling and analysis are summarized in Box 2.2. Principal
     amongst these include the need to avoid or minimize contamination during sampling
     and analysis and to use field and laboratory blank samples for quality control. Another
     important factor is confirming the polymer identity of the microplastic particles.

     A wide range of particle shapes and sizes are found in fresh water, and the smallest
     particles detected are often determined by the mesh size. Typically, studies using
     large mesh sizes will report lower particle counts than those using small mesh sizes.
     The frequency with which different plastic polymer types are found is consistent with
     production volumes and plastic density. Routine methods are currently not available
     to detect nanoplastics in environmental samples.

     The results of studies need to be interpreted in the context of the methods used and
     associated quality assurance/quality control mechanisms. However, limited data on
     drinking-water have provided some initial results.

       • Microplastics have been identified in drinking-water as small as 1 µm, based on
         the smallest particle size detected by current methods.
       • Large particles occur less frequently than small particles.
       • The predominant particle shapes are fragments and fibres.
       • The predominant plastic types are PET and PP.
       • In addition to fresh water being a potential source of microplastics in drinking-water,
         there is some evidence from the type of plastics found that some contamination
         may arise during treatment and distribution of tap water, and/or bottling of bottled
         water. More data are needed to confirm the contamination sources.

Research needs

The following research would clarify the occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water
and freshwater sources:

  • More data are needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water to
    assess human exposure from drinking-water adequately.
  • Studies on occurrence of microplastics must use quality-assured methods to
    determine numbers, shapes, sizes, and composition of the particles found. They should
    identify whether the microplastics are coming from the freshwater environment
    or from the abstraction, treatment, distribution or bottling of drinking-water.
    Initially, this research should focus on drinking-water thought to be most at risk
    of particulate contamination.
  • Drinking-water studies would be usefully supplemented by better data on fresh
    water that enable the freshwater inputs to be quantified and the major sources
    identified. This may require the development of reliable methods to track origins
    and identify sources.
  • A set of standard methods is needed for sampling and analysing microplastics in
    drinking-water and fresh water.
  • There is a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of nanoplastics in the
    aquatic environment. A first step to address this gap is to develop standard methods
    for sampling and analysing nanoplastics.

     3. Possible human health risks
        associated with microplastics
        in drinking-water: particles and
        chemicals

     3.1 Introduction
     Microplastics can present several unique challenges for traditional human health risk
     assessment approaches. Microplastics are not single chemicals or well-characterized
     substances but are particles that vary in shape, size and composition. Plastic polymers
     are generally considered to be of low toxicity. Being insoluble, they are unlikely to
     be absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and generally do not interact with
     biological matrices, although particle size may influence absorption and toxicity
     (i.e. smaller particles may represent a greater hazard). However, plastics can contain
     additives and unbound monomers, which may leach out either into the surrounding
     water environment prior to human consumption or potentially, into the GI tract
     to become bioavailable under some circumstances. Further, plastic particles can
     sorb chemicals from the environment, some of which are of toxicological concern.
     The potential hazards from microplastic particles and chemicals associated with
     microplastics are explored in this chapter along with an assessment of their potential
     risk to human health.

     The next chapter (Chapter 4) explores the hazards and potential risks associated with
     plastics in the environment (see Box 3.1), including microplastics that can provide a
     surface for microorganisms to attach and colonize (known as biofilms) with some
     potential for pathogenic organisms to be part of this biofilm.   



        Box 3.1 Risk is a function of toxicity and exposure

        The potential hazards associated with microplastics in drinking-water come in three forms: particles
        presenting a physical hazard; chemicals, including monomers, additives and sorbed substances; and biofilms.
        Chapters 3 and 4 provide an assessment of these potential hazards along with an assessment of risk, which
        is a function of both toxicity and exposure. The same substance can have different effects at different doses,
        which depends on how much of the substance a person is exposed to and may also depend on the route
        by which the exposure occurs, e.g. ingestion, inhalation or injection. Consequently, the potential toxicity
        of these substances does not necessarily equate to risk in drinking-water. Similarly, the potential presence
        of a chemical, or release from plastic, does not in itself imply a risk to human health. Chemical risks are
        explored more thoroughly than other risks because there are more data available to inform risk scenarios.

  3.2 Potential hazards associated with particles
  Humans routinely ingest many different kinds of particles consisting of a variety of
  substances. Toxicity posed by particles is dependent on a wide range of physical
  properties that include size, surface area, morphology (shape), and surface characteristics.
  Toxicity can also depend on the chemical composition of the particles (discussed
  in section 3.3). Although toxicity is relatively well studied for inhaled particles, the
  toxicity of ingested particles is less understood. The fate and transport of particles
  following ingestion, particularly in the context of physicochemical properties, is not
  well studied. However, it is likely humans have ingested plastic particles for decades
  as a result of widespread contact with plastics in household objects including cutting
  boards, food packaging, and direct contamination in air and food.

  When considering potential hazards from exposure to plastic particles, the actual
  particle component of the substance (i.e. physical hazard) and implications for toxicity
  and kinetics with oral exposure need to be assessed.

  3.2.1 Toxicological data on microplastic particles

  To date, most toxicological tests of microplastics have focused on aquatic organisms
  or ecotoxicology. No epidemiological or human studies on ingested microplastics have
  been identified. Data from studies on laboratory animals are scant and inadequate to
  inform human health risk assessment of microplastics ingestion. The current database
  of information on plastic particle toxicity (and absorption) is limited to a few studies
  using PET, PS or PE, and there are questions regarding the reliability of some of these
  studies, which are briefly described below.

  In an OECD-compliant 90-day dietary study, no treatment-related adverse effects on
  blood parameters, organ weights or histopathology (including liver, a potential target
  organ) as well as mutagenicity, were seen when finely ground PET powder was mixed
  into the diet of 10 Sprague-Dawley rats per sex and dosed at 0, 0.5, 2.5 or 5% (Merksi
  et al., 2008). Particle sizes and counts were not reported, although particles were
  likely in the range of 1 to 50 µm (Welle and Franz, 2018). Although the study authors
  did not identify a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) based on the reported
  results, the NOAEL can be considered the highest dose, equivalent to approximately
  2500 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day, assuming a default 5% food factor for rats.

  In non-standard studies in mice, liver effects reported by Deng et al. (2017) are
  considered with caution due to notable limitations in study design, data reporting and
  biological plausibility of results (Böhmert, Stock and Braeuning, 2019; Braeuning, 2019).
  Briefly, five mice per group that were exposed to high concentrations of PS particles




Chapter 3: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: particles and chemicals   27
     (mixture of 5 x 106 particles of 5 μm and 1 x 105 particles of 20 μm at 0.5 mg/day for
     28 days via gavage) exhibited hepatic inflammation and lipid droplets at this highest
     dose tested, a dose selected as being five-fold higher than environmental exposures
     (Deng et al., 2017). However, incidence or severity data were not reported and effects
     on biochemical or molecular endpoints from this study have unclear functional or
     biological relevance. Male mice exposed to very high concentrations of PS particles
     (1.5 x 1010 particles/L of 0.5 μm at 100 or 1000 µg/L or 1.5 x 104 particles/L of 50
     μm at 100 or 1000 µg/L in drinking-water for 5 weeks) had altered lipid metabolism
     and gut microbiota compared to controls (Lu et al., 2018). Another study in the
     same laboratory associated the altered gut microbiota, intestinal mucus secretion,
     and barrier function to the presence of 5 μm PS particles in the gut after these high
     exposures (1.5 x 106 particles/L at 100 µg/L or 1.5 x 107 particles/L at 1000 µg/L in
     drinking-water for 6 weeks) (Jin et al., 2019). The relevance of these high exposure
     scenarios where effects were reported in non-standard studies to human drinking-
     water exposures, as described in section 2.6, is questionable.

     In the single identified study that evaluated oral toxicity of nanoplastics in a mammalian
     test species, no effects on body weight or on a battery of neurobehavioral tests were
     seen in adult male Wistar rats administered PS nanoplastics (mixture of 25 and 50
     nm, average hydrodynamic diameter of 38.92 nm) via gavage at 0, 1, 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg
     bw/day for 5 weeks (particle count not reported) (Rafiee et al., 2018).

     A co-exposure study with PE or PS microplastics (2000 µg/L) and organophosphorus
     flame retardants for 90 days in drinking-water (Deng et al., 2018) was not reviewed
     further due to the very high microplastic exposure and the inability to assess the
     individual contributions of PE, PS or the flame retardants to the observed effects.  

     In vitro assays in human cell lines were limited to a study in which PS and PE
     microplastics in two human cell lines showed oxidative stress for PS but not for PE
     and only at the highest concentration of 10 mg/L (Schirinzi et al., 2017), a very high
     concentration of unclear relevance to in vivo exposures. No effects were seen at the
     lower concentrations of 0.05, 0.1 or 1 mg/L. The limited number of identified in vitro
     and/or non-mammalian studies were not reviewed further due to limited relevance
     to the present human health effects assessment.

     Studies on the release of plastic particles from surgical materials, such as prostheses,
     are of limited utility to inform possible health effects of microplastics (FAO, 2017; US
     EPA 2017). These studies have reported changes in gene expression, DNA damage,
     oxidative stress, cellular proliferation, tissue necrosis and inflammation but represent a
     very different exposure scenario from that of ingested microplastics in drinking-water
     and the relevance of these findings is highly uncertain.




28   Microplastics in drinking-water
  There have been some studies that examined the effects of occupational exposure
  in the polymer industry and also exposure in non-occupational settings from indoor
  air caused by inhalation of polymer particles (Wright and Kelly, 2017; SAPEA, 2019).
  However, these exposure scenarios have unclear relevance to exposure through
  drinking-water.

  3.2.2 Microplastic and nanoplastic uptake and kinetics

  To assess possible risks associated with ingestion of plastic particles, it is important to
  understand how the particles will behave within the human body, and especially whether
  there is uptake in the GI tract. Uptake kinetics for microplastics and nanoplastics have
  been examined by the FAO (2017) and the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food
  Chain (EFSA, 2016). Based on limited data and biological assumptions discussed below,
  the EFSA panel concluded that the largest fraction of ingested microplastics (>90%)
  was not likely to be absorbed and likely to be excreted directly through faeces, that
  microplastics >150 μm were likely not absorbed and that uptake of smaller microplastics
  was expected to be limited (i.e. ≤0.3%). Similar conclusions based on similar assumptions
  were reached by FAO, including unlikely absorption for microplastics >150 μm and
  limited overall absorption and uptake into organs for particles <20 μm. It is possible that
  absorption and distribution may be more significant for nanoplastics than microplastics
  (up to 0.3% for microplastics <150 μm and up to 7% for nanoplastics <0.1 μm) (FAO,
  2017). However, EFSA (2016) and FAO (2017) both caution against extrapolations
  from the limited data available on only one type of nanoplastic.

  EFSA and FAO conclusions are based on several studies including one in which uptake
  of 2 μm latex particles by rodents was reported as 0.04–0.3% (Carr et al., 2012) and
  another in which uptake of 3 μm polylactide-co-glycolide in mounted human colon
  tissue was approximately 0.2% for healthy individuals and 0.45% for tissues of patients
  with inflammatory bowel disease (Schmidt et al., 2013). The size threshold of <150 μm
  was selected based on limited data suggesting that particles in this size range possibly
  translocate from the gut into the lymphatic system (Hussain, Jaitley and Florence, 2001)
  and based on the translocation of PVC particles up to 110 μm to the portal vein of
  dogs (Volkheimer, 1975). Furthermore, particles >130 μm cannot cross the epithelium
  through persorption mechanisms. A recent study reported in the FAO document but
  not employed to draw conclusions examined uptake and distribution of fluorescent
  PS microplastics (1.46 x 106 particles/L of 5 µm and 2.27 x 104 particles/L of 20 µm)
  that were orally administered to mice over 4 weeks. Translocation to the liver and
  kidney reportedly occurred and particles could be detected 1 week after cessation of
  exposure (Deng et al., 2017). However, the plausibility of this study has been criticized
  due to inconsistencies related to analytical and mathematical methods used to estimate




Chapter 3: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: particles and chemicals   29
     target organ burdens (Böhmert, Stock and Braeuning, 2019; Braeuning, 2019). Before
     any indications of possible absorption or adverse effects can be inferred, the results
     need to be replicated after the methodological limitations are resolved.

     Nanoplastic absorption may be potentially higher than their larger microplastic
     counterparts; however, the database is even more limited. Uptake of nanoscale (i.e.
     <0.1 μm) PS ranged from 0.2–7% in in vivo studies in rats (Jani et al., 1990; Walczak et
     al., 2015a) and 1.5–10% in in vitro studies (des Rieux et al., 2007; Kulkarni and Feng,
     2013; Walczak et al., 2015b) (presented in EFSA, 2016); the rest was eliminated with
     faeces as unabsorbed material.

     3.2.3 Information from broader particle toxicology

     Potential effects in the gut
     As noted above, most microplastics ingested via drinking-water are expected to pass
     through the Gl tract without being absorbed. However, because the gut is the primary
     tissue that will come into contact with ingested particles, it has been identified as
     the tissue most likely to show effects. Oral exposure to particles in general, albeit at
     very high levels, has been associated with mild intestinal irritation and inflammation.
     There is speculation based on inferences from other particles (e.g. titanium dioxide
     and aluminosilicates) that plastic particles could accumulate in phagocytes of gut tissue
     (Wright and Kelly, 2017). While accumulation in phagocytes could potentially interfere
     with their function and compromise lymphocyte detection of infections and impair
     local immunity, this interference remains to be established. PS particles (1.5 x 1010
     particles/L of 0.5 μm or 1.5 x 104 particles/L of 50 μm) were also shown to alter the
     gut microbiome in mice exposed to high doses of 100 and 1000 μg/L through drinking-
     water for 5 weeks (Lu et al., 2018). Chickens exposed to 50 or 200 nm carboxylated
     PS nanoparticles at high doses (2 mg/kg bw/day for 2 weeks) showed increased iron
     uptake, suggesting that exposure to nanoplastics may affect the barrier properties of
     the gut epithelium (Mahler et al., 2012). Particle counts were 2 x 1013 particles/L of
     50 nm or 1.25 x 1012 particles/L of 200 nm. Given significant inter-species variations
     in the microbiome, the relevance of these findings to humans needs to be investigated
     further before drawing any firm conclusions.

     Particle properties and potential toxicity
     The size and concentration of microplastic particles may influence their potential for
     toxic effects. As noted in section 3.2.2, smaller particles are more likely to cross the
     gut wall and reach other tissues. Moreover, as particle size decreases, its surface-
     area-to-volume ratio increases, which may make smaller particles more susceptible
     to adsorbing biologically-significant proteins and molecules. Furthermore, in the
     environment, the increased particle surface-area-to-volume ratio theoretically increases



30   Microplastics in drinking-water
  the sorption capacity of environmental chemicals relative to particle weight. An
  increased surface-area-to-volume ratio also means that microplastics degrade faster
  than larger plastic particles (Gewert, Plassmann and MacLeod, 2015), although it is
  not clear if conditions in the human GI tract are amenable to plastic degradation. One
  study has shown that Antarctic krill can fragment PE particles of 31.5 μm to pieces
  smaller than 1 μm (Dawson et al., 2018), thus suggesting the potential for microplastics
  to break down into smaller plastic particles within at least some biological systems.
  Particle count (concentration) information is often not reported and may influence
  observed responses at higher concentrations by overwhelming biological mechanisms
  responsible for particle clearance.

  Additional considerations including particle morphology and surface chemistry may
  play an important role in particle uptake and clearance in the lung (e.g. particularly
  evasion of clearance mechanisms), but how this relates to ingested plastic particles,
  which can occur in irregular shapes or as fibres, is less certain.

  Aging plastics have been shown to form oxygen-containing functional groups on their
  surfaces. Therefore, weathered plastic particles may have different physicochemical
  properties including reduced hydrophobicity, which could reduce their ability to sorb
  hydrophobic substances (Endo, 2005) but increase potential for sorption of hydrophilic
  organic pollutants (Liu et al., 2019). Further, any particle with a diameter of less than
  0.1 µm in any dimension, including nanoplastics, may exhibit physicochemical properties
  different from the bulk material (Khan, Saeed and Khan, 2017).


  3.3 Potential hazards associated with monomers,
      additives and sorbed chemicals

  3.3.1 Monomers

  Polymerization reactions do not generally proceed to full completion, resulting in a
  small proportion of monomers that are free to leach from polymerization products.
  Residual monomer content can range from negligible to up to 4% depending on the
  type of polymer produced and polymerization technique used (Araújo et al., 2002;
  Lithner, Larsson and Dave, 2011). Biodegradation of plastics (e.g. by microorganisms on
  biofilms) and plastic weathering may also degrade plastic polymers into monomers and
  oligomers; however, the extent to which this occurs is uncertain. Should degradation
  occur, it should be noted that unbound monomers are likely to leach in the environment,
  resulting in extremely small concentrations in drinking-water sources and that many
  are not stable in water. For example, propylene oxide would convert to propylene
  glycol which has low toxicity (Trent, 2001).




Chapter 3: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: particles and chemicals   31
     Some monomers, such as acrylamide, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride
     are considered more hazardous than others based on a hazard ranking approach for
     61 monomers described in Lithner et al. (2011). The risk associated with these monomers
     varies significantly, depending on a number of factors, including the level and route
     of exposure. The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (2017a) assessed six
     of these monomers and established guideline values for five substances (acrylamide,
     epichlorohydrin, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, styrene, and vinyl chloride) ranging from 0.3 (for
     vinyl chloride) to 300 µg/L (for 1,4-dichlorobenzene) (WHO, 2003d, e; 2004c, e; 2011a;
     2017a). These guideline values generally represent concentrations in drinking-water
     that do not result in any significant health risk over a lifetime of consumption (WHO,
     2017a). Of these, only vinyl chloride was assessed as a monomer associated with plastic,
     as it can be released from unplasticized PVC pipes. Acrylamide and epichlorohydrin
     were assessed in relation to coagulant aids and styrene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and
     formaldehyde as pollutants or by-products of water treatment. Formaldehyde was
     also assessed but no formal guideline value was established, although a tolerable
     concentration was identified at 2.6 mg/L (WHO, 2005).

     3.3.2 Additives

     Additives are incorporated into plastics in various quantities to confer specific properties.
     In contrast to monomers, additives are not covalently bound to the polymer (with the
     exception of a few that are co-polymerized) and can thus leach into the surrounding
     environment (Hahladakis et al., 2018). Following the principles of thermodynamics,
     chemical additives will leach in a manner that enables them to reach a thermodynamic
     equilibrium with their surroundings, potentially resulting in chemical additives from
     microplastics being emitted to air, water and soil.

     The molecular weight of additives may also influence their release into the environment.
     In general, small, low molecular weight molecules can migrate at a faster rate than
     larger additives. Substances with a molecular weight higher than 600 g/mol have a
     low tendency to migrate from plastic (Hansen et al., 2013). Migration may potentially
     increase as plastics age and weather, although this phenomenon is not well understood
     (Suhrhoff and Scholz-Böttcher, 2016; Jahnke et al., 2017).

     There are no data to quantify the relative importance of microplastics in contributing
     to chemical additives in the environment, including drinking-water. However, relative
     to other emission routes of additives to the environment, it is anticipated that leaching
     from microplastic will be relatively small. Although some plastic additives, such as
     phthalates, PBDE and lead or cadmium-containing colorants, are considered hazardous
     at sufficient exposures, health-based values, regardless of source, have been established
     for many of these additives by international agencies.



32   Microplastics in drinking-water
  There is limited information to support the possibility that microplastics act as a vector
  of transport for chemical additives. A study by Tanaka et al. (2015), for instance, reports
  the presence of deca PBDE in the stomach oil of seabirds as a result of plastic ingestion.
  Other studies, such as by Koelmans, Besseling and Foekema (2014), appear to question
  the relative importance that leaching of nonylphenol and BPA from microplastic plays
  as a source of contamination to lugworms and cod.

  Many efforts have been taken to reduce the use of additives-of-concern from plastics
  (especially for phthalates, PBDEs, cadmium, lead and BPA). However, it is possible for
  these substances to be present in older plastics, which may degrade into micro- or
  nanoplastics in the environment.

  3.3.3 Sorbed chemicals

  The hydrophobic nature of microplastics implies that they have the potential to accumulate
  hydrophobic substances such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including PCBs,
  PAHs, and organochlorine pesticides. Indeed, the capacity of plastic polymers, such
  as PE and PUR, to accumulate POPs from the environment is a fundamental principle
  in their application as passive samplers used for environmental monitoring (Müller et
  al., 2001; Adams et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2010; Lohmann et al., 2012).

  Observations reporting the concentration of POPs associated with microplastics have
  largely focused on the marine environment. Data from the literature spanning four
  decades have been reviewed in Wang et al. (2018), for instance, who report significantly
  higher concentrations of POPs in microplastics near populated urban areas, which is
  consistent with the relative level of contamination of the surrounding environment
  for these contaminants. In 2005, the International Pellet Watch was launched as a
  volunteer-based means of monitoring POPs on unintentionally released plastic particles
  collected on beaches around the world (Pellet Watch, 2019). Some information on
  reported concentrations of chemicals detected in microplastics, including some POPs,
  is included in Table 3.2.

  In addition to accumulating in microplastics, it is well understood that POPs will
  indiscriminately sorb to organic carbon in the environment, such as that found in sediment,
  algae and the lipid fraction of biological organisms. Given the relative abundance of
  sediment, algae and aquatic organisms compared to microplastic particles in freshwater
  environments, the fraction of POPs sorbed to microplastics will be small compared
  to the other environmental media. Thus, the relative importance of microplastics to
  act as a vector of transport of POPs is likely to be negligible (Koelmans et al., 2016).

  Should microplastics be ingested through drinking-water, the rate at which chemicals
  are released or taken up from microplastic in the GI tract will depend on interactions



Chapter 3: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: particles and chemicals   33
     between the chemical and the microplastic particle itself, as well as the properties
     of the surrounding environment (Karapanagioti and Werner, 2018). For instance,
     chemical uptake and release can be influenced by the size of the particles, whereby
     decreasing size increases the rate of uptake or loss (Lassen et al., 2015). In studies
     using a simulated gut fluid, the release of POPs, such as PCBs, can be observed
     whereby a relatively uncontaminated gut fluid and long residence time can result in
     significant chemical leaching.  Alternatively, when the gut fluid already contains the
     chemical contaminant, the reverse process can be observed, with uptake into the
     plastic occurring (Mohamed Nor and Koelmans, 2019). Consequently, the relative
     potential for POPs to leach from microplastics will depend on a variety of factors,
     including the relative size of the particle, mass of chemical accumulated, relative level
     of contamination within the gut, and the GI residence time of the particle.

     As it is well understood that POPs are associated with a variety of potentially adverse
     human health effects, health-based values have been established for many of them by
     international agencies. For example, WHO has developed a drinking-water guideline
     value for benzo(a)pyrene of 0.7 μg/L; this compound is associated with particles from
     old coal tar-lined water mains (WHO, 2003c).


     3.4 Assessing possible risks from microplastics
     In assessing the potential human health risks from exposure to microplastics in drinking-
     water, a first step is to consider the exposure from that source.

     There is currently a paucity of information to quantitatively assess any potential risk
     associated with exposure to microplastic particles. Considerations related to certain
     risk aspects of particle exposure are discussed in section 3.4.1.

     With respect to chemicals associated with microplastics, due to the limited data
     available, estimates of exposure are made using an extremely conservative approach
     described in section 3.4.2. This analysis provides a means for estimating upper-bound
     contributions of exposure to microplastics from drinking-water and represents the
     starting point in a tiered risk assessment. If there is no apparent risk in an extreme
     exposure scenario, then there is no need to refine the assumptions underpinning the
     exposure assessment unless and until more information becomes available that might
     contradict these assumptions.

     To characterize the risk for chemicals associated with microplastics, the estimated
     exposure in drinking-water can be compared to conservative levels at which adverse
     biological effects could be observed (the toxicological point of departure, or POD)
     to determine if there is a sufficiently large margin of exposure.

  3.4.1 Assessment of risk related to particle exposure

  There is insufficient information to draw firm conclusions on potential risk associated
  with exposure to particles at this time. However, the polymers comprising microplastic
  particles are generally considered to be inert when ingested and the limited evidence
  on particle kinetics suggests that a large fraction
  of microplastics pass through the digestive system         Although there is insufficient
  without uptake. Potential uptake of very small               information to draw firm
  microplastic particles is a topic of emerging research      conclusions on the toxicity
  interest. However, the limited studies that have related to the physical hazard
  investigated uptake of microplastic particles <50 µm of plastic particles, particularly
  in size lack methodological robustness and present          the nano size particles, no
  findings only at extremely elevated exposure reliable information suggests
  concentrations. Elevated levels of exposure                   it is a concern through
  to particles are likely to overwhelm biological              drinking-water exposure.
  mechanisms that would allow particle clearance,
  and therefore, there is no information of suitable quality to draw any conclusions on
  uptake of small particles at this time. It is unclear if absorption of small plastic particles
  in the GI tract, like other inert particulate matter to which humans are exposed to on
  a regular basis, would pose any human health concerns. As noted earlier, it is almost
  certain that humans have been exposed to microplastics for decades, as well as other
  particles in the environment for much longer. Overall, there does not seem to be
  any reliable information at this time that would suggest any overt health concerns
  associated with microplastic particles. This does not mean that plastic particles are a
  priori innocuous, as this cannot be determined with any accuracy at present with the
  limited data on microplastics in drinking-water. Consequently, assessing the potential
  hazards, exposure and thereby risk would benefit from studies that can identify those
  properties of microplastic particles that might represent a hazard and then develop
  methods aimed at assessing their exposure to enable a robust assessment of risk.

  3.4.2 Assessment of risk related to chemical exposure

  As described in section 3.3, microplastic particles can contain unreacted monomers
  and various additives, such as stabilizers and colourants, which may leach out in water
  or the GI tract. Regulatory systems for plastics in contact with food or water consider
  the leaching potential of these substances into environmental media as part of the
  approval process. While regulations do not directly relate to human consumption of
  plastic particles, they do constrain the additives and residual monomer content that
  can be included, which is particularly important for plastics in contact with drinking-
  water that could be a source of particles. However, many plastics not intended for




Chapter 3: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: particles and chemicals   35
     contact with food or water (which are likely to be a key source of microplastics in
     freshwater environments) will not have undergone such assessments and may contain
     unregulated substances and substances at potentially higher concentrations. There is
     also the potential for some microplastics in the environment to sorb substances that
     could be a concern at higher concentrations. To estimate potential human health risk,
     the first step in a tiered approach is to determine whether very high exposures to
     these potential hazards pose a risk to consumers.

     3.4.2.1 Conservative Exposure Scenario
     A scenario that would result in very high exposure to microplastics is presented below.
     This scenario is intended to represent an extreme case and in the absence of a more
     thorough understanding of the factors contributing to exposure, is likely to exaggerate
     probable exposure. Assumptions are made regarding the size, shape and density of
     the microplastic particle and the particle numbers in drinking-water. Table 3.1 lists
     all exposure assumptions and provides an indication of the level of conservativism
     of each. While it is important to remember that multiplying a series of theoretical
     extreme assumptions can lead to assumed situations that are well outside the realms
     of realistic exposure in the environment, or in this case drinking-water, it is a useful
     screening tool to indicate where the evaluation may need to be refined.

     Considering the above assumptions on particle characteristics and a default consumption
     of 2 L of drinking-water/day (WHO, 2017a), an intake of 85 µg of microplastics/day can
     be estimated. This corresponds to an intake of 1.4 μg microplastics/kg bw/day based
     on a default body weight of 60 kg for an adult, which is considered to be extremely
     conservative and highly unlikely since it is based on a combination of extreme scenarios.

     Applying the same assumptions to actual data on particle numbers and sizes reported
     by Kosuth, Mason and Wattenberg (2018), Oßmann et al. (2018), Pivokonsky et al.
     (2018) and Schymanski et al. (2018), more realistic estimated intakes would be around
     2 µg/day or 0.03 µg/kg bw/day. Estimated intake based on data from Mintenig et al.
     (2019) on particle numbers and sizes is 0.01 µg/day. Welle and Franz (2018) estimated
     intakes ranging up to 8.7 µg/day. For the sake of comparison, EFSA (2016) estimated
     that a worst-case intake from seafood alone based on a 225 g portion of mussels
     would be 7 μg microplastic.

     3.4.2.2 Margins of exposure assessment
     When assessing risk of environmental chemicals, it is common to use a screening level
     margin of exposure (MOE) approach. Here, a toxicological POD, usually a NOAEL or a
     lower confidence limit on the benchmark dose (BMDL) from laboratory animal studies,
     is divided by the estimated human exposure to characterize potential health risks.
     MOEs of at least 100 when based on animal data and 10 when based on human data
     are an indication for low health concern for effects with an apparent threshold (FAO/
     WHO, 2009). For genotoxic carcinogens there is low health concern for compounds
     with an MOE above 10 000. Such defaults are considered adequately protective of a
     wide range of individuals within the population, particularly when combined with the
     elevated assumptions in the exposure assessment, as carried out here.

     To calculate the MOE associated with microplastics in drinking-water, chemicals
     were included if:

          • they have been detected in microplastics,
          • are of toxicological concern, and
          • have adequate or accepted toxicological PODs for deriving a MOE (on this basis,
            lead and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were excluded from the MOE
            approach).

     In calculating the estimated daily intakes of chemicals associated with microplastics,
     the very conservative exposure assumptions as described in table 3.1 were maintained
     and additional exposure assumptions were added (see Table 3.2):

38   Microplastics in drinking-water
  As shown in Table 3.3, MOE values derived in this risk assessment were adequately
  protective, indicating low health concern for exposure to chemicals in microplastics
  through ingestion of drinking-water. Margins of exposure were generally much
  greater than 100, and for the two genotoxic carcinogens (benzo(a)pyrene and
  hexachlorobenzene), were greater than 10 000.

  Although the MOE values indicate a low health concern for human exposure to chemicals
  through ingestion of drinking-water containing microplastics at the levels detected in
  the available studies, there is significant uncertainty related to exposure to smaller
  plastic particles. One study by Mason, Welch and Neratko (2018) that investigated
  microplastics in bottled water measured 315 particles/L, for the size fraction of 6.5
  to 100 μm (median particle size = 53.25 μm) that
  could be plastic. While there is some uncertainty          MOE values derived in

  Changing these assumptions did not significantly         for exposure to chemicals
  impact the outcome of the preliminary risk                in microplastics through

         Comparison of maximum daily intakes for all substances to their respective WHO health-based drinking-water values also demonstrated a
         negligible contribution of these chemicals from microplastics in drinking-water. Contributions from benzo(a)pyrene (WHO, 2003c), chlordane
         (WHO, 2004a), DEHP (WHO, 2003b), DDT (WHO, 2004b), and hexachlorobenzene (WHO, 2004d) were well below 1%. Contribution of cadmium to
         the WHO guideline value (WHO, 2011b) is less than 5%. Lead was not considered in this risk assessment because WHO concluded that it was not
         appropriate to set a health-based guideline value for this metal; the provisional guideline value of 0.01 mg/L is based on practical achievability,
         where lead may be used in plumbing materials in buildings, including fittings, solders and pipes, as well as service connections to buildings (WHO,
         2016). Lead stabilizers were used in unplasticized PVC water pipes but this has not been the case for decades. The highly conservative estimated
         maximum intake from microplastic particles for a child would be 0.025 μg/kg bw so this would equate to an intake of approximately 2% of the
         provisional guideline value and therefore of low concern.
     b
         Maximum daily intake = maximum concentration in microplastic [µg/g] × mass of plastic particle [g] × particle concentration in water
         [particles/L] × daily drinking-water intake [L]/default body weight; where an adult is assumed to consume 2 L water/day, and default body
         weight is 60 kg (WHO, 2017a). The mass of a plastic particle is calculated as 4/3 r3 x density, where the radius is 75 µm, and density is 2.3 g/cm3.
         As noted in section 3.4.2, the exposure assessment assumptions were highly conservative. Therefore, this estimated maximum daily intake is
         extremely improbable; actual intakes are likely to be significantly lower.
     BPA: Maximum concentration is from marine microplastics (Hirai et al., 2011). POD is human equivalent dose from a lower 95% confidence limit
     on the benchmark dose for a 10% response (BMDL10) based on kidney weight changes in mice (EFSA, 2015). A more recent draft report of an
     extensive study by the National Toxicology Program in the USA (2018) concluded that “BPA produced minimal effects that were distinguishable
     from background in this study, particularly below 25 mg/kg bw/day.” This is greater than 25 times the POD used here. Because it is still in draft, the
     original value was retained, but it is probably highly conservative in comparison to the most recent data.
     Cadmium: Maximum concentration is from the southwestern English shore (FAO, 2017; Massos and Turner, 2017). Note that cadmium-based
     pigments are now rarely used in plastics nor have cadmium compounds been used as stabilizers in plastics in contact with drinking-water. Cadmium
     is rarely detected in drinking-water above the WHO drinking-water guideline value of 3 µg/L; the MOE for cadmium is calculated using the POD
     corresponding to the 5th percentile level of calcium intake (as indicated by urinary biomonitoring marker for renal pathology) in an extensive human
     study in individuals aged 50 years or older (JECFA, 2011).
     Chlordane: Maximum concentration is from a review of concentrations in marine microplastics (Nerland et al., 2014); POD is NOAEL from a long-
     term study in rats (WHO, 2004a).
     DDT: Maximum concentration in marine microplastics is estimated from the sum of DDT congeners (Rios, Moore and Jones, 2007). Based on the
     information presented in Rios, Moore and Jones (2007), it is estimated that the concentration of DDT is 1.6 µg/g. Note that concentrations of DDT in
     the environment has decreased over time. POD is NOAEL for DDT based on developmental toxicity in rats (FAO/WHO, 2001). Therefore, the estimated
     MOE is likely to be conservative.
     DEHP: Maximum concentration is from the coastal beaches of North China (Zhang et al., 2018). DEHP is primarily used in PVC and can account for
     10–40% of PVC; POD is NOAEL based on liver peroxisome proliferation in rats (WHO, 2003b).
     Hexachlorobenzene: Maximum concentration is from marine microplastics from the coastal beaches of Brazil (Taniguchi et al., 2016). POD is NOAEL
     from hepatic effects in pigs and rats (IPCS, 1997). Tumorigenic dose associated with a 5% incidence for tumours (TD5) for neoplastic effects is also
     available, but provides a larger MOE.
     PAHs: Maximum concentration is the sum of 16 PAHs in marine microplastics in China (Mai et al., 2018). Benzo(a)pyrene, the most thoroughly
     studied and highly potent PAH has low solubility and has been rarely detected in drinking-water at concentrations above 10 ng/L; POD is BMDL10 for
     benzo(a)pyrene-induced forestomach and lung tumors in mice (JECFA, 2006b).
     PBDEs: Maximum concentration is the sum of 20 PBDEs from marine microplastics (Hirai et al., 2011). The limited toxicity data suggested that for the
     more toxic PBDE congeners, adverse effects would unlikely occur in rodents at doses of less than 100 µg/kg bw/day. POD as cited by the Joint FAO/
     WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA 2006a) is conservative compared to more recent assessments by other agencies.
     PCBs: Maximum concentration is from marine microplastics in Japan (Endo, 2005). POD is lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) for
     decreased immune response in monkeys (IPCS, 2003).

     3.5 Conclusions and research needs
     Investigation of potential risks related to particles indicate that it is possible that some
     smaller plastic particles may be able to pass through the gut wall and translocate to
     tissues remote from the mucosa, although this may not necessarily translate to a
     health risk. Humans have always ingested particles and have ingested plastic particles
     for decades with no related indication of adverse health effects. In addition, a good
     deal of evidence suggests that microplastics pass through the GI tract into the faeces.
     The health effects database of plastic particles is limited to a few studies. Although
     there are some data of questionable quality to suggest limited uptake of microplastics
     <50 µm in the GI tract in laboratory animals at high concentrations, the data require
     confirmation under realistic exposure scenarios. The evidence presented by these
     studies does not indicate whether there are risks relating to the physical hazard of
     plastic particles. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions on toxicity
     related to microplastic exposure through drinking-water, particularly for the smallest
     particles, but no reliable information suggests it is a concern.

     With respect to chemicals, a very conservative exposure scenario and MOE assessment
     indicates low concern for human health.




42   Microplastics in drinking-water
  Research needs

  In order to conduct a more robust human health risk assessment of microplastics,
  the following data gaps should be addressed:

    • There is a need to better understand occurrence of microplastics in drinking-water,
      as described in Chapter 2, based on high quality and quality-assured detection
      and enumeration methods. Studies should include nanoplastics when standard
      methods are available.
    • More research is needed to understand the uptake and fate of microplastics in
      the GI tract and the influence of particle size, shape and chemical composition,
      particularly in relation to the smallest particles.
    • Quality-assured toxicological data from cell models and/or experimental animals
      are needed for the most common forms of plastic particles that are appropriate
      for human health risk assessment.
    • More knowledge is needed on the characteristics of plastic particles that are most
      predictive of their toxicity.
    • A better understanding of the bioavailability of chemical substances associated
      with microplastics within the GI tract and other organs would be helpful to refine
      the exposure assessment.

     4. Possible human health risks
        associated with microplastics in
        drinking-water: biofilms

     4.1 Introduction
     Biofilms in drinking-water are the result of the growth of microorganisms on drinking-
     water pipes and other surfaces (WHO, 2014). In drinking-water distribution systems,
     biofilms can detach from the pipe walls into the water, representing a source of the
     background numbers of heterotrophic bacteria that are found in all drinking-water.
     Although most microorganisms found in biofilms are believed to be primarily non-
     pathogenic, some biofilms can include free-living microorganisms and opportunistic
     pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella spp., non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium
     spp. and Naegleria fowleri. In contrast, obligate enteric pathogens can be harboured
     within biofilms but generally do not multiply outside host organisms.

     The characterization of biofilms and their related health risks from distribution systems
     are described in the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO, 2017a) and in the
     Water Safety in Distribution Systems document (WHO, 2014). However, little is
     known about the presence of microplastic-associated biofilms in drinking-water and
     whether there are any related possible human health risks. Since the surface area
     of plastic particles is dwarfed by the surface area of drinking-water distribution and
     premise plumbing systems, the potential risk of biofilms associated with microplastics
     is considered far lower than for biofilms associated with drinking-water distribution
     systems. Nevertheless, this chapter discusses the hazards and potential risks associated
     with biofilms that may attach to and colonize microplastics and find their way into
     drinking-water or drinking-water sources.


     4.2 Characteristics of plastics and microorganisms that
         influence biofilm formation
     Materials of many sorts, including microplastics, provide a surface for biofilm-forming
     organisms to attach and colonize in aquatic environments. These plastic-associated
     communities are sometimes referred to as “plastispheres” (Zettler, Mincer and Amaral-
     Zettler, 2013). Several physical, chemical and biological factors have been identified
     that influence the formation of plastispheres, mostly in marine environments. Surface
     roughness of synthetic polymers promotes biofilm formation (Pedersen, 1990, Rogers
     et al., 1994; Nauendorf et al., 2016), while physicochemical properties drive the



44   Microplastics in drinking-water
attachment process. Biofilm-forming organisms attach faster to hydrophobic nonpolar
surfaces, such as plastics, than to hydrophilic surfaces, such as stainless steel (Rummel
et al., 2017). Gene sequencing analysis have shown that bacteria assemble differently
on microplastics and have lower taxon richness, diversity and evenness on plastic than
on non-plastic substrates (McCormick et al., 2016). Plastic surface properties influence
the composition of the plastisphere community, as noted with biofilms on plastic versus
non-plastic pipes used to convey drinking-water (Buse et al., 2014; van der Kooij et al.,
2017). For example, most bacterial and fungal strains found on plastic were those able
to degrade plastic polymers such as various species within Pseudomonas, Arcobacter,
Erythrobacter, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Phanerochaete
(Bhardwaj, Gupta and Tiwari, 2012; McCormick et al., 2014).

Biological characteristics of biofilm-forming organisms also influence their attachment to
plastic surfaces including microplastics. Adaptation strategies, including hydrophobicity
of cell walls and repulsive/attractive interactions between the surfaces of biofilm-forming
organisms and the surrounding medium, promote attachment (Rummel et al., 2017).
Moreover, environmental conditions, including high nutrient concentrations (nitrogen
and phosphorus), salinity, temperature, high UV radiation and oxygen content are
also factors influencing plastics and microplastics-biofilm formation (Harrison et al.,
2018; Oberbeckmann, Kreikemeyer and Labrenz, 2018).


4.3 Potential concerns associated with microplastic-
    associated biofilms in water
The possibility that microplastics could act as vectors for the long-distance transport
of pathogens and increased transfer of antimicrobial resistance has been raised based
on a limited number of occurrence studies in fresh water.

4.3.1 Long-distance transport of pathogens

Although limited, current evidence suggests that microplastics may be able to transport
and disperse plastisphere communities over long distances. For example, microplastics
released from WWTPs may enable transport of sewage-related microorganisms in
the effluent for long distances (McCormick et al. 2016; Oberbeckmann, Kreikemeyer,
and Labrenz, 2018). Microplastics may also serve as vectors for harmful organisms,
including enteric viruses and protozoa, as these organisms can accumulate in biofilms,
harbour other pathogens and remain infectious in the plastisphere (Atanasova et al.,
2018; Sun et al., 2018). A study conducted in nine rivers in Illinois, USA, found higher
presence of Pseudomonas spp., Burkholderiales incertae sedis, and Campylobacteraceae on
microplastics than on other suspended matter or in water (McCormick et al., 2016).




          Chapter 4: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: biofilms   45
     However, the increased abundance of Campylobacteraceae on microplastics was not
     significant. Pseudomonas spp. have been associated with degradation of plastic polymers;
     Burkholderiales incertae sedis are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems;
     and Campylobacteraceae include pathogenic species that are common in sewage and
     can cause a range of infections if ingested in contaminated drinking-water (WHO,
     2017a). Although sewage-related pathogens can attach to microplastics and may be
     transported downstream of WWTPs, it is unclear how long they will persist, as obligate
     pathogens such as Campylobacter will not multiply in biofilms.

     The issue of plastic-mediated transport of pathogens should not be overestimated as
     there are significantly greater sources of opportunist and obligate pathogens in surface
     waters used as sources of drinking-water. In addition, drinking-water treatment can
     remove most of these plastic particles (see section 5.3).

     4.3.2 Antimicrobial resistance

     A series of laboratory studies using lake water found that antimicrobial-resistant
     strains that attach to biofilms on microplastics transfer antimicrobial-resistant genes
     more frequently and to a broader range of species than free-living bacteria or biofilms
     associated with natural aggregates (Arias-Andres et al., 2018). The authors of these
     studies hypothesized that the high density and close physical contact between cells
     of biofilms could facilitate the transfer of plasmids with antimicrobial-resistant genes.
     Similarly, Eckert et al. (2018) showed that attachment to microplastic could favour
     bacterial survival from WWTPs, including genes associated with antibiotic resistance.
     The possibility that pathogens could invade new localities, and natural, non-pathogenic
     microorganisms could potentially acquire and spread antimicrobial resistance genes
     are issues of concern that need to be further studied. However, to contextualize
     the issue, biofilms in WWTPs carry a much greater density of organisms carrying
     resistance than do biofilms on microplastics.


     4.4 Distribution and risk of microplastic-associated
         biofilms in drinking-water
     To date, there are limited data on the distribution of microplastic-associated biofilms
     in drinking-water. Further, current knowledge on the adverse effects of microplastic-
     associated biofilms in fresh water and drinking-water is limited (US EPA, 2016; Li, Liu
     and Chen, 2018).

     Although microplastic-associated biofilms have been detected in fresh water, their
     presence does not necessarily translate to occurrence and risk in drinking-water
     and there is currently no evidence to suggest a human health risk from microplastic-



46   Microplastics in drinking-water
associated biofilms in drinking-water. As part of drinking-water treatment, clarification
and membrane processes represent effective methods to remove particles with
attached microorganisms (see section 5.3) and disinfectants should inactivate biofilms.
As discussed in section 2.2.7, there is evidence
that small numbers of microplastics can slough       There is currently no evidence
from materials within water treatment and            to suggest a human health risk
distribution systems. The surface area of these       from microplastic-associated
particles and associated biofilms however, will         biofilms in drinking-water.
represent a very small fraction of the surface
area and biofilms generated on the source materials. In addition, in many countries,
plastics and other materials used in drinking-water systems are subject to standards,
including tests to demonstrate that they do not support microbial growth (WHO, 2014).




          Chapter 4: Possible human health risks associated with microplastics in drinking-water: biofilms   47
     4.5 Conclusions and research needs
     There is currently no evidence to suggest a human health risk from microplastic-
     associated biofilms in drinking-water.

     While there are substantial gaps in knowledge, the potential risks from microplastic-
     associated microorganisms are far lower than the well-established risk posed by the
     high concentrations and diversity of pathogens present in human and livestock wastes
     in drinking-water sources. In addition, in terms of providing surfaces for attachment and
     transport of microorganisms including pathogens, the concentrations of microplastics
     reported in drinking-water sources are far lower than concentrations of non-plastic
     particles that contribute to normal turbidity in water.

     The diversity of organisms in the plastisphere is constrained by environmental factors
     and material properties such as surface roughness and hydrophobicity (McCormick
     et al., 2016; Rummel et al., 2017; Oberbeckmann, Kreikemeyer, and Labrenz, 2018).
     These constraints are also likely to apply to pathogens. Drinking-water treatment is
     designed to remove particles and the use of both clarification processes and disinfection
     will further reduce the potential for any pathogens to reach drinking-water.

     The potential risk from pathogens found on biofilms associated with microplastic
     is also far lower than on biofilms associated with water distribution systems. The
     surface area provided by the low concentrations of microplastics (see Chapter 2)
     that escape treatment is extremely small compared to the surface area of materials
     in distribution systems. Further, biofilms pose a low risk compared to other risks,
     including enteric pathogens, particularly in well managed drinking-water distribution
     systems. However, certain pathogens present in biofilms in distribution systems, such
     as Legionella spp., could result in a health burden (Cassini et al., 2018) to susceptible
     populations exposed to water in building-specific water systems such as hospitals,
     where water systems' materials and temperatures could encourage the growth of the
     pathogen within the distribution system. Regardless of source, routine disinfection
     of distribution systems can control the growth of biofilms and minimize exposure to
     opportunistic and obligate pathogens.

Research needs

To better understand microplastic-associated biofilms and their significance, the
following research could be carried out:

 • Further studies could be conducted on the factors that influence the composition
   and potential specificity of microplastic-associated biofilms.
 • Studies could also consider the factors influencing biofilm formation on plastic
   surfaces, including microplastics, and how these factors vary for different plastic
   materials, and what organisms more commonly bind to plastic surfaces in freshwater
   systems.
 • Research could be carried out to better understand the capacity of microplastics
   to transport pathogenic bacteria longer distances downstream, the rate of
   degradation in freshwater systems and the relative abundance and transport
   capacity of microplastics compared with other particles.
 • Research could consider the risk of horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance
   genes in plastisphere microorganisms compared to other biofilms, such as those
   found in WWTPs.

     5. Treatment technologies for
        removing microplastics from water

     5.1 Introduction
     Most drinking-water—whether from a tap, well, or bottle—comes from surface water
     or groundwater. Virtually all drinking-water supplies sourced from surface water
     are filtered and some receive further treatment. Groundwater is typically of higher
     quality as it is naturally filtered through soil and rocks when it passes into underground
     aquifers, and hence, it often receives less treatment, if any.

     Since microplastics have been found in fresh water, primarily surface waters,
     understanding the effectiveness of drinking-water treatment in removing microplastics
     is important in assessing exposure of humans through drinking-water. Understanding
     the effectiveness of wastewater treatment is also important in the context of drinking-
     water since wastewater effluent is a key source of microplastics in surface waters
     (see section 2.2). This chapter therefore reviews the effectiveness of wastewater and
     drinking-water treatment processes for removal of microplastics.

     Even though limited empirical data exist on the ability of different treatment systems
     to remove microplastics (see Box 5.1), considerable data do exist on the removal of
     particles similar to microplastics. One of the key roles of both drinking-water and
     wastewater treatment is to remove or reduce particles, and treatment processes
     are therefore expected to be effective in removing microplastics from water (Mason
     et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2016; Mintenig et al., 2017; Trussell and Tate, 1979).
     Microplastics have characteristics similar to many natural particles. Depending on the
     type of treatment under consideration, properties relevant to removal can include
     size, density and surface charge (Tobiason et al., 2011). The mechanisms for removing



        Box 5.1 Data limitations

        As discussed in Chapter 2, accurate and standardized methods for determining microplastic concentrations
        and compositions in water and wastewater remain a significant challenge, with the majority of occurrence
        studies conducted in drinking-water and wastewater considered not fully reliable. Further, studies often use
        different detection methods. This means that some caution is required when interpreting and comparing
        the results of studies on the removal of microplastics in treatment and the occurrence data in fresh water
        and drinking-water. However, no study has been discounted at this stage given the paucity of data. Where
        quality scores are available, these have been included.




50   Microplastics in drinking-water
particles includes adsorption, enmeshment in coagulation floc aggregates, flotation,
sedimentation, filtration and straining by size exclusion. Particles can also be removed
using membrane processes such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and
reverse osmosis.


5.2 Wastewater treatment
WWTPs are a principal barrier to the direct discharge of waterborne microplastic
pollution into the aquatic environment. However, only a limited number of studies
have examined microplastic removal through the various treatment processes (Sun
et al., 2019). A review of 18 studies on the occurrence of microplastics in wastewater
found that typical WWTP effluent has a lower median concentration of microplastic
particles compared to the influent, although the range in effluent concentrations
varied significantly (Koelmans et al., 2019). This may be an indication that some
WWTP facilities have ineffective treatment practices or are not designed for optimal
removal of microplastics (Magnusson and Norén, 2014). In these cases, discharges
from WWTPs can represent routes for microplastics to enter into fresh waters and
then possibly into drinking-water (Kay et al., 2018).

In many countries, significant efforts have been made to increase the quality of WWTP
effluent to meet higher quality targets for surface water. Where such receiving waters
are used as a drinking-water source, the microplastic load originating from the WWTP
is expected to be significantly reduced. However, in low- and middle-income countries,
only 33% of the population have sewer connections. Wastewater for the remaining
67% of the population is collected and treated in onsite systems or discharged directly
to soil and water bodies. In addition, approximately 20% of household wastewater
collected in sewers does not undergo at least secondary treatment (UNICEF/WHO,
2019). In these cases, the contribution of microplastics into the receiving water body
is expected to be higher.

5.2.1 Studies assessing the efficacy of microplastic removal

According to available data, conventional wastewater treatment using primary and
secondary treatment processes can effectively remove most microplastics from
wastewater. Removals of more than 90% have been reported, with most of the
microplastics removed during pre-treatment and primary treatment stages (Talvitie
et al., 2017a). A large Italian WWTP (400 million L/day) reportedly removed 84% of
microplastics >63 μm (Magni et al., 2019). However, the concentration of microplastics
found in the influent wastewater was quite low, with an average of 2.5 particles/L in the




                             Chapter 5: Treatment technologies for removing microplastics from water   51
     influent and 0.4 particles/L in the effluent following screening, grit and grease removal,
     biological treatment, sedimentation, sand filtration and disinfection. Data from a Scottish
     WWTP recorded average microplastic concentrations of 15.7 particles/L (size 598 ±
     0.89 µm) in wastewater influent. Treatment removed 98.4% of microplastic particles,
     with much of the removal taking place in the grease removal process (Murphy et al.,
     2016). In Turkey, assessments of two WWTPs recorded between 12–36 particles/L
     in the influent and 2–9 particles/L in the secondary effluent, with overall removal of
     between 54–92% for plastic particles classified from <100 µm to 5000 µm (Gündoǧd       ̆ u
     et al., 2018). In a Finnish WWTP, pre-treatment and primary treatment removed 97%
     of microplastic particles, with activated sludge removing a further 7–20% for particles
     captured on sieves between 20–400 µm (Talvitie et al., 2017a).

     Some final stage wastewater treatment technologies have also been very effective in
     enhancing microplastic removal from effluents. For example, between 95–99.9% of
     microplastics (>20 μm) were removed by particle removal technologies such as rapid
     sand filters, membrane bioreactors and dissolved air flotation (Talvitie et al., 2017b;
     Lares et al., 2018). Another study concluded that secondary and tertiary treatment
     processes were highly efficient in removing microplastics, with greater than 99.9%
     removal when samples were processed using a
     range of sieves with mesh sizes between 20–400           Wastewater treatment can

     of wastewater from a German WWTP completely            90%    of microplastic particles,
     removed microplastics >500 µm, and removed                with the highest removals
     93% of microplastics smaller than 500 µm (LoD           seen   after tertiary treatment
     20 μm) and 97.7% of plastic classified as synthetic            such as filtration.
     fibres (Mintenig et al., 2017). In another example
     of a highly treated wastewater, 0.28 particles/L (>25 μm) were identified after tertiary
     ultrafiltration and 0.21 particles/L (>25 μm) after reverse osmosis (Ziajahromi et al.,
     2017) (TAS = 12). These concentrations were below the concentrations found in
     theoretically particle-free blanks from the study by Uhl, Eftekhardadkhah, and Svendsen
     (2018). Wastewater treated using biologically aerated filters as a tertiary treatment
     saw no microplastic removal across the treatment (Talvitie et al., 2017a). A summary
     of these studies is included in Table 5.1.

     5.2.2 Factors influencing microplastic removal

     The primary mechanisms for removing microplastics during wastewater treatment is
     through agglomeration into biological flocs followed by separation using sedimentation,
     flotation and filtration (Murphy et al., 2016; Talvitie et al., 2017a). During these solid-
     liquid separation processes, microplastics are concentrated and transferred from the

     water phase into the solid phase. Due to the hydrophobic nature of microplastics,
     many are expected to be removed with fats, oils and greases in grease traps, sewerage
     systems and floating debris. Observations of microplastic removal in grease traps at
     a municipal WWTP were consistent with this assumption: a significant proportion of
     microplastics were accumulated in the grease waste (19.67 microplastic particles/2.5
     g), including microbeads (Murphy et al., 2016). Also, other studies have shown
     that filtration and other tertiary treatment stages can significantly reduce the total
     microplastic discharge. This removal is influenced by the surface characteristics of
     the microplastic (such as roughness, hydrophobicity and surface charge) as well as
     the size of the particles being filtered.


     5.3 Drinking-water treatment
     Drinking-water treatment plays an important role in reducing concentrations of
     microplastics that have been introduced into source waters. Ideally, all drinking-water
     that comes from surface water sources will undergo treatment prior to distribution.
     Typically, surface water is treated more substantively than groundwater, as groundwater
     is generally of higher quality due to natural filtration that occurs as it percolates through
     soil and rock before reaching underground aquifers.

     Limited empirical data exist on the presence of microplastics in drinking-water and
     their removal across drinking-water treatment processes (Lancet Planetary Health,
     2017). Only a few studies report concentrations
     of microplastics along the whole drinking-water     Drinking-water treatment has

     5.3.1 Studies assessing microplastic removal efficacy

     As noted earlier, empirical evidence for the removal of microplastics across
     different drinking-water treatment systems is currently limited to a few studies.




54   Microplastics in drinking-water
Mintenig et al. (2019) (TAS = 15) monitored microplastics at different stages of the
drinking-water treatment and distribution system from a groundwater source. Low
numbers of microplastic particles were detected in both the raw water and the treated
drinking-water at concentrations between 0 to 0.007 particles/L, with an overall mean
of 0.0007 particles/L. There were no significant differences between concentrations and
types of microplastics in the source water and treated water. Microplastics identified
were PE, PA, PEST, PVC and epoxy resin and were between 50 and 150 μm in size.
The authors suggested that the abrasion of plastic equipment used during water
treatment or distribution was a likely source of the plastic particles detected in the
water samples. Pivokonsky et al. (2018) (TAS = 11) reported microplastic removal
efficiency of between 70–82% across three water treatment processes that used
conventional coagulation, clarification and filtration processes. However, inter-stage
monitoring was not carried out in this study.

In an assessment of 24 water treatment plants in Norway that applied coagulation and
filtration processes, very low concentrations of microplastics were found in treated water
(Uhl, Efteckhardadkhah, and Svendsen, 2018) (TAS = 9). The authors demonstrated that
the concentrations of microplastic particles in treated water were lower than those in
the raw water, confirming that coagulation and filtration were effective in microplastic
removal. Some contrasting results have been seen in laboratory studies that investigated
the application of iron and aluminum coagulants for the removal of PE microplastics (Ma
et al., 2019). Up to 40% removal of PE was observed when using aluminum coagulants,
higher than that observed using iron coagulants. Removal was enhanced as the plastic
particles became smaller. The presence of a coagulant aid (polyacrylamide) had a positive
and substantial effect on removal.

5.3.2 Factors influencing microplastic removal

Drinking-water treatment processes can effectively eliminate particles and colloids
across a wide size range (from dissolved/colloidal materials to particles of a few mm).
For example, an optimized treatment process is capable of removing pathogenic bacteria
and Cryptosporidium (US EPA, 2003, 2006), which are typically <5 μm. Larger particles
are more easily removed. Although a wide range of microplastic types have been
identified, for the purpose of water treatment, the physicochemical properties of the
material will determine the mechanisms of removal. Particle removal processes used in
drinking-water treatment can typically be divided into: (1) clarification processes that
use combinations of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation/flotation and filtration;
and (2) membrane processes.




                             Chapter 5: Treatment technologies for removing microplastics from water   55
     Clarification processes
     Clarification processes such as those involving coagulation are the most common methods
     of removing particles in drinking-water treatment. During coagulation, small particles and
     colloids are destabilized with the addition of a coagulant chemical, allowing formation
     of aggregates known as microflocs. Microflocs are typically encouraged to grow into
     larger flocs during slow mixing in a process known as flocculation. Large aggregates
     can then be settled or float in the water (Letterman and Yiacoumi, 2011). Generally,
     for coagulation and flocculation, particle properties can impact their agglomeration
     and entrapment in flocs, including surface charge, size, distribution and shape profile,
     concentration and the strength of bonds formed between particles when captured
     in a floc (Letterman and Yiacoumi, 2011). Most of the residual particles that remain
     are then removed by granular media filtration processes. Typically, sand grains with a
     diameter around 500 µm are used as the granular media, although media down to 200
     µm can be used (Crittenden et al., 2012). Particles between 80–100 µm cannot pass
     through the spaces between the filter media and are strained from the water. Particles
     smaller than a micrometre can be removed when they attract to the media grains in
     the filter. The attachment mechanisms depend on the size, shape and charge of the
     particles being filtered, as well as the hydraulic conditions present in the filter. Very
     low concentrations of residual suspended solids should be present in water that has
     been treated by a well-operated granular media filtration system (Tobiason et al., 2011).

     When separating solids from liquid, water quality and operating conditions can limit
     the effectiveness of the process. As most plastic particles are hydrophobic, adsorption
     of organic compounds can occur (Napper et al., 2015). Because of this interaction,
     plastics are likely to adopt the characteristics of background organic matter, which
     will influence their removal profile in different solid-liquid separation processes.
     Humic acids, which can form a large proportion of organic matter, for example, can
     stabilize particles in water and prevent aggregation (Jarvis et al., 2005). However, since
     microplastics are relatively large compared to other particles removed in drinking-
     water treatment, the effect may not be as important as it is for other particles. The
     presence of organic matter might be more relevant for nanoplastics. Understanding
     which micro- and nanoplastics behave like other environmental particles is critical for
     appropriate risk characterization in drinking-water treatment. Hydraulic conditions
     can also influence the effective removal of particulates, including microplastics, during
     clarification processes. For example, flocs can be broken by shear forces or changes of
     pH, forming smaller particles that may be more difficult to remove during clarification
     (Jarvis et al., 2005; Slavik et al., 2012).

     Membrane processes
     Membrane processes can be divided into diffusional membranes (reverse osmosis and the
     lower end of nanofiltration) and porous membranes (microfiltration, ultrafiltration and


56   Microplastics in drinking-water
the upper end of nanofiltration). For diffusional membranes, only dissolved substances
can diffuse through the membrane; no particles should pass through the membrane.
For porous membranes, the nominal pore size determines the size of particles that can
pass through the membrane. Particles above the pore size will be rejected. Typically
microfiltration rejects particles >1 µm, ultrafiltration rejects particles >0.01 µm, and
nanofiltration >0.001 µm. For all membranes, these cut-offs are far below the size
of microplastics that have been detected in drinking-water to date. Consequently,
no microplastics above these size ranges should pass through membranes unless the
membranes are damaged (which is usually monitored by routine integrity testing). This
conclusion is consistent with the limited data available for removal of microplastics
from drinking-water using membranes. In a laboratory study, PE microplastics were
completely rejected by ultrafiltration membranes (Ma et al., 2019).

5.3.3 Other considerations

To date, no information is available to indicate if and how microplastics are transformed
during oxidative processes used in water treatment, such as ozonation, chlorination
or advanced oxidation. There is no reason to assume that these processes will not
interact and react with microplastics present in the water. However, whether the
processes affect the surface of microplastics or cause further breakdown of the particle
into smaller particles is poorly understood.

An interesting side note in the consideration of drinking-water and wastewater treatment
processes is whether they contribute microplastics into water themselves. For example,
many membranes are composed of polymeric materials. Similarly, processes such
as ion-exchange used for water softening, de-ionization and removal of nitrate and
natural organic matter often use polymeric plastic materials (e.g. PS and polyacrylics).
These processes are exposed to abrasion and wear over time which might release
low quantities of microplastics into water. In a similar vein, high shear-rate processes
used in both drinking-water and wastewater treatment (e.g. in mixing systems) may
degrade plastic particles into smaller pieces, in turn making them more challenging to
remove. Water pipes composed of plastic materials will also be subject to abrasive
processes. Further research is needed to determine how these processes influence
microplastic levels in water, if they do at all.

5.3.4 Turbidity as an indicator of microplastic removal

Given the low concentrations of microplastics in drinking-water sources, it is difficult
to monitor the efficacy of microplastic removal across water treatment processes such
as filtration. The standard approach for monitoring efficacy of filtration is to monitor
turbidity in treated water (WHO, 2017b). Turbidity describes the cloudiness of water




                             Chapter 5: Treatment technologies for removing microplastics from water   57
     caused by suspended particles of mineral, chemical or biological origin. Microplastics
     may contribute to the turbidity of water if present in sufficient concentrations. The
     advantages of turbidity measurements are simplicity, relatively low cost and speed of
     results. However, different turbidity-causing materials can exhibit different relationships
     between particle concentration and the resultant turbidity signal (Farrell et al., 2018).
     It is likely that different types of microplastics will also exhibit unique relationships
     between particle concentration and turbidity. Microplastics may also be associated with
     other types of particles, for example, when they become incorporated into flocs. This
     makes it challenging to assess removal of specific types of particle, such as microplastics,
     using a bulk water parameter such as turbidity. For these reasons, turbidity should be
     used as a general indicator of water quality and for general operational monitoring and
     process efficacy including particle removal, but should not be used to directly infer
     microplastic concentrations. The same considerations should be given to other particle
     monitoring instruments such as particle counters, which have become a common tool
     for process and water quality monitoring.


     5.4 Considerations for drinking-water and wastewater
         treatment sludge
     An important consideration for both wastewater and drinking-water treatment is that
     the plastics are usually not destroyed, but rather transferred from one phase to another.
     Sludge disposal methods must therefore be considered since sludge application to land
     is a probable route for re-contamination of the environment. Equally, where membrane
     cleaning or back-flushing of filters is practiced, waste streams may be returned directly
     to the aquatic environment. Although it is clear that use and/or disposal practices for
     waste products containing microplastics warrants special consideration, there are
     limited data available on the impact of such practices.

5.5 Conclusions and research needs
Limited data on wastewater treatment confirm it is effective in removing microplastics
along with other particles. Wastewater treatment can typically remove more than
90% of microplastic particles, with the highest removals seen after tertiary treatment
such as filtration.

Only limited quantified data are available to demonstrate the efficacy of microplastic
removal across drinking-water treatment processes. However, conventional drinking-
water treatment (coagulation, sedimentation and filtration) is designed to remove
particulates and is therefore expected to effectively remove microplastics, particularly
when optimized to produce treated water of low turbidity. When optimized, conventional
treatment can remove particles smaller than a micrometre. Advanced treatment using
membranes would be expected to achieve 100% removal of microplastics larger than
0.001 to 1 µm, with removal capabilities >0.001 µm for nanofiltration, >0.01 µm for
ultrafiltration and >1 µm for microfiltration.

An important consideration is that wastewater and drinking-water treatment is not
available nor optimized in many countries. In these settings, there may be higher levels
of microplastics in drinking-water and freshwater sources. However, the health risks
associated with exposure to pathogens and other chemicals present in untreated or
inadequately treated water will be far greater. By addressing the bigger problem of
exposure to untreated or inadequately treated water, communities can simultaneously
address the smaller concern related to microplastics in surface water and other
drinking-water supplies.

Since microplastics removed through both wastewater and drinking-water treatment
will be incorporated into sludge or other waste streams, there is potential for particles
to return to the environment depending on the use or disposal practices.

     Research needs

     Although water treatment can be effective in removing particles, there is limited data
     specific to microplastics. To support human health risk assessment and management
     options, the following data gaps related to water treatment need to be addressed:

       • More research is needed to understand the fate of microplastics across different
         wastewater and drinking-water treatment processes (such as clarification processes
         and oxidation) under different operational circumstances, including optimal and
         sub-optimal operation and the influence of particle size, shape and chemical
         composition on removal efficacy.
       • There is a need to better understand particle composition pre- and post-water
         treatment, including in distribution systems. The role of microplastic breakdown
         and abrasion in water treatment systems, as well as the microplastic contribution
         from the processes themselves should be considered.
       • More knowledge is needed to understand the presence and removal of nanoplastic
         particles in water and wastewater treatment processes once standard methods
         for nanoplastics are available.
       • There is a need to better understand the relationships between turbidity (and
         particle counts) and microplastic concentrations throughout the treatment
         processes.
       • Research is needed to understand the significance of the potential return of
         microplastics to the environment from sludge and other treatment waste streams.

6. Managing plastic and microplastic
   pollution in the environment

6.1 Benefits of managing plastic and microplastic
    pollution
Irrespective of any risks to human health from ingestion of microplastics in drinking-
water, improved management of plastics and a reduction in plastic pollution holds
multiple benefits for the environment and human well-being.

A growing body of evidence confirms that larger plastic waste and macroplastic
debris—themselves precursors to microplastic pollution—can harm wildlife and the
                                          environment. Researchers have estimated that
   Irrespective of any risks to           as of 2015, only 9% of plastic ever produced

  of microplastics in drinking-           2050, there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic in
water, improved management                landfills and the environment (Geyer, Jambeck,

                                          livelihoods. Poorly managed plastic waste streams
can contribute to the obstruction of storm drains and sewers, which prevents proper
drainage and increases sanitation-related risks. Incineration of plastic waste, with its
resulting air pollution, and the climate change-inducing greenhouse gas associated with
plastic production, could impact human health and the environment.

Concerns relate also to microplastics. If plastic emissions into the environment
continue at current rates, there may be widespread risks associated with microplastics
to aquatic ecosystems within a century (SAPEA, 2019), with potentially concurrent
increases in human exposure.


6.2 Responses to growing concern over plastic pollution
In response to concerns about the impact of plastic and microplastic pollution,
public awareness and engagement has increased. Activities have ranged from schools
adopting educational activities on plastics, to civil society launching campaigns and
some industries pledging to reduce plastic use. Political commitment is also growing.




                             Chapter 6: Managing plastic and microplastic pollution in the environment   61
     Ministers of Environment from 157 countries committed to significantly reduce single-
     use plastic products by 2030 at the 4th UN Environment Assembly in March 2019
     (UNEP, 2019a). This followed an agreement at the previous Assembly to recognize
     the importance of long-term elimination of microplastics from the oceans. In May
     2019, governments agreed to amend the Basel Convention to require the consent of
     importing countries for mixed and contaminated plastic waste (UNEP, 1989, 2019b).
     The aim is to improve regulation of the global trade in plastic waste to support better
     and safer management.

     More than 60 countries are already taxing or banning single-use plastics, primarily
     plastic bags (UNEP, 2018). Countries such as the UK and the USA have developed
     legislation to eliminate plastic microbeads in personal care products such as scrubs
     and toothpastes (US Government, 2015; UK Government, 2017) while the European
     Union is currently considering such legislation (ECHA, 2019).


     6.3 Options to curb plastic and microplastic pollution
     As outlined in Chapter 2, microplastics can come from a number of sources including
     from the degradation of larger plastic items found in the environment, frequently as
     a consequence of the poor management of used and discarded plastic items. With
     only limited data on the number and composition of microplastic particles in drinking-
     water, it is not possible to identify the most important sources of microplastics in
     drinking-water, making it difficult to determine what actions might best be directed
     in the short- to medium-term. However, it is likely that microplastics in fresh water
     contribute to the presence of microplastics in drinking-water where there is an
     inadequate filtration barrier.  

     Strategies to better manage plastics and reduce the use of plastics where feasible,
     are critical to the effort to minimize adverse impacts of discarded plastic. Strategies
     to minimize microplastic inputs can confer other benefits as well. For example,
     installing and optimizing wastewater treatment will not only reduce the direct input
     of microplastics to the aquatic environment but will also reduce the input of enteric
     pathogenic microorganisms and a number of chemical micropollutants into drinking-
     water sources. Similarly, optimizing the performance of processes that remove
     microplastics from water sources will also reduce concentrations of microbial and
     chemical hazards in drinking-water.

     Where possible, preventing new sources of plastics from entering the environment
     and/or reducing existing sources would be appropriate. Care must be taken, however,
     when considering mitigation strategies for existing plastics so that solving one problem




62   Microplastics in drinking-water
does not simply create a new one. This is particularly important in view of the limited
data on sources of different sizes and types of microplastics, including the very small
particles that are currently not well quantified. The removal of particles in wastewater
and drinking-water treatment that are then returned to the environment in backwash,
sludge biosolids or other waste streams, either through direct discharge or from run-
off from receiving land, is an area requiring study before appropriate decisions can be
made as to what actions might be required.

Where simple, low cost actions can be taken to make even a small difference to plastic
inputs to the environment, it would be sensible to implement them. This is in line
with the Rio declaration and the Rio statement of the precautionary principle, which
considers cost–effectiveness: “Where there are threats of serious or irreversible
damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing
cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” (United Nations, 1992).

The benefits of plastic must also be considered before introducing policies and initiatives.
For example, single-use syringes play an important role in preventing infections. Priority
management actions should be “no regrets”, in that they confer multiple benefits and/
or that they are cost-effective.

A few broadly categorized preventive measures to reduce the entry of plastics into
the environment are described below. These are outlined in the EU Plastics Strategy
(European Commission, 2018), adopted in January 2018, which contains measures in
four broad groups:
  1. Improve the economics and quality of plastic recycling
  2. Curb plastic waste and littering
  3. Drive innovation and investment towards circular solutions and sustainable
     manufacturing practices to decrease waste inputs to the environment
  4. Engage in international efforts to minimize and eliminate plastic waste

Other measures proposed to address plastic pollution include bans, fees (e.g. charges
or taxes on disposable bags and bottles), Extended Producer Responsibility, voluntary
agreements and mandatory consideration of non-plastic alternatives, with a recommendation
to focus actions on plastic waste streams with high volumes, high-emission profiles and
high-hazard plastic uses (SAPEA, 2019). With respect to single-use plastics, the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2018) has proposed a 10-step roadmap for
policymakers to curb waste. The report also recognizes the importance of broader
cooperation, from raising awareness among consumers to public-private partnerships.

     7. Conclusions, recommendations and
        knowledge gaps

     7.1 Conclusions
     Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment, including in the water cycle. They
     have been detected in marine water, wastewater, fresh water and both tap and bottled
     water. However, the quality and quantity of data vary across different water types
     and the data on occurrence in drinking-water are limited.

     In drinking-water, the typical characteristics of microplastics (i.e. composition including
     polymer type, size and shape) and their route into bottled water and tap water is still
     uncertain, although the frequency of detected polymers is generally consistent with
     production volumes and plastic density. Important sources of microplastics into fresh
     water are surface run-off and wastewater effluent, but there are insufficient data to
     quantify these inputs and determine more specific primary sources. Further, some
     contamination may also occur during treatment, distribution or bottling processes.

     Study results should be interpreted in the context of the methods used, for example,
     smaller mesh sizes are generally used in drinking-water studies compared to freshwater
     studies, contributing to higher particle counts. In general, there is a need to improve,
     standardize and harmonize microplastic sampling and analysis in water; most studies
     conducted to date are not considered fully reliable. Box 2.2 summarizes areas that
     likely require the most improvement.

     There are no studies on the impacts of ingested microplastics on human health and
     there are only a limited number of animal studies of questionable reliability and
     relevance. Some data suggest a very limited uptake and impact of microplastics <50 µm
     in laboratory animals at high concentrations, but the relevance to humans is unknown.
     These studies require confirmation under realistic exposure conditions before firm
     conclusions can be drawn. Despite limited health data, several inferences could be
     made with respect to human health risks:
       • Although it is not possible to draw any firm conclusion on toxicity related to the
         physical hazard of plastic particles, particularly the nano size particles through
         drinking-water exposure, no reliable information suggests it is a concern. Humans
         have ingested microplastics and other particles in the environment for decades
         with no related indication of adverse health effects. In addition, drinking-water
         treatment is effective at removing particles. Although there is only limited quantified
         evidence on microplastic removal across water treatment processes, conventional



64   Microplastics in drinking-water
   drinking-water treatment (coagulation, sedimentation and filtration) is expected
   to effectively remove microplastics since conventional treatment is designed to
   remove particulates, particularly when optimized to produce treated water of low
   turbidity. Advanced treatment, particularly membrane filtration, would be expected
   to achieve 100% removal of particles >0.001 µm for nanofiltration, >0.01 µm for
   ultrafiltration and >1 µm for microfiltration.  
 • The substantial margin between a theoretical conservative exposure to a range
   of chemical contaminants detected in microplastics through drinking-water and
   the level at which no or limited adverse effects were seen, indicates there is a
   low health concern for chemicals associated with microplastics. A summary of
   the estimated MOEs and implications for human health are included in Table 3.3.
   Applying assumptions with higher particle numbers in smaller size ranges does
   not change the conclusions.
 • The risks from pathogens in microplastic-associated biofilms is considered
   far lower than the well-established risk posed by the high concentrations and
   diversity of pathogens present in human and livestock waste, which often make
   their way into drinking-water sources with inadequate treatment. Further, the
   relative surface area for attachment and transport of microorganisms, including
   pathogens, is far lower for microplastics based on the concentrations reported
   in drinking-water and drinking-water sources compared to the concentrations of
   non-plastic particles that contribute to normal turbidity in water. For microplastics
   that are not removed during drinking-water treatment, these particles also provide
   an extremely small surface area for the development of biofilms compared to
   drinking-water distribution systems and therefore, the relative significance of
   microplastics-associated biofilms is still likely to be negligible. Regardless of source,
   drinking-water treatment is largely designed to remove particles and the use of
   both clarification processes and disinfection, including disinfection in distribution
   systems, will reduce the potential for any pathogens to be present in drinking-water.

Future research and emerging science to address data gaps will enable more accurate
and reliable assessments of exposure and potential impacts to human health.

A summary of the potential hazards and estimated risk is included in Table 7.1.

66   Microplastics in drinking-water
Considerations for exposure and risk
Absorption of smaller microplastics may be higher compared to larger microplastics based on limited studies
examining exposure at high concentrations. Elevated exposure, however, is likely to overwhelm biological
particle clearance mechanisms.
Smaller particles may be more susceptible to adsorb biologically-significant proteins and molecules.
The influence of shape and surface chemistry impacting toxicity is unknown for ingested microplastics.
Conventional drinking-water treatment is effective at removing particles and is capable of removing
particles smaller than a micrometre when optimized to produce treated water of low turbidity. Advanced
treatment can remove smaller particles (e.g. nanofiltration can remove particles > 0.001 µm).


Weathering and biodegradation may degrade polymers into monomers but the extent to which this occurs
is unknown. However, unbound monomers are likely to leach into the environment, resulting in extremely
small concentrations in drinking-water sources. Many monomers are likely to convert to more stable
compounds in water (e.g. propylene oxide would convert to propylene glycol, which has low toxicity).
Materials in contact with drinking-water, including plastics, should be approved for such use to ensure they
do not leach substances, including monomers, at concentrations of concern.
Smaller additives with low molecular weight can migrate faster than larger additives. Migration may
potentially increase as plastics age and weather. However, relative to other emission routes of additives to
the environment, leaching from microplastic will likely be small.
Inconclusive and limited evidence is available on the relative importance of microplastics acting as a vector
of transport of chemical additives.
Efforts have been taken to reduce the use of additives-of-concern from plastics.
Materials in contact with drinking-water, including plastics, should be approved for such use to ensure they
do not leach substances, including additives, at concentrations of concern.


The hydrophobic nature of microplastics implies that they can have the potential to accumulate POPs.
Sediment, algae, the lipid fraction of biological organisms and microplastics all have similar capacities to
accumulate POPs. Given the larger mass of soil, algae and aquatic organisms, the relative importance of
microplastics to act as a vector of transport of POPs is likely negligible in comparison to other exposure
routes.

Based on limited studies, microplastics may enable pathogens to travel longer distances in freshwater
environments.
Based on limited studies, biofilms on microplastics may contribute to antimicrobial resistance.
Drinking-water treatment (clarification and membrane processes) is effective at removing particles,
including microorganisms attached to particles. For microplastics that are not removed during treatment,
the relative significance of microplastic-associated biofilms is still likely negligible due to the larger mass
of drinking-water distribution systems and their subsequent ability to support more biofilms, compared
to microplastics. Disinfection, including in distribution systems, can inactivate pathogens and control their
growth.




                                                Chapter 7: Conclusions, recommendations and knowledge gaps        67
     An important consideration is that wastewater and drinking-water treatment is not
     available nor optimized in many places. In these settings, there may be higher levels
     of microplastics in drinking-water and freshwater sources. However, the health risks
     associated with exposure to pathogens present in untreated or inadequately treated
     water will be far greater. By addressing the bigger problem of exposure to untreated
     or inadequately treated water, communities can simultaneously address the smaller
     concern related to microplastics in surface water and other drinking-water supplies.


     7.2 Recommendations
     Routine monitoring of microplastics in drinking-water is not recommended at this
     time, as there is no evidence to indicate a human health concern. Concerns over
     microplastics in drinking-water should not divert
     resources of water suppliers and regulators from                Concerns over

     However, more research is needed to better understand the occurrence of microplastics
     in the environment and in media that may result in human exposure. Although routine
     monitoring is not recommended, it would be appropriate to undertake targeted, well-
     designed and quality-controlled investigative studies to better understand the sources
     and occurrence of microplastics in fresh water and drinking-water, the efficacy of
     different treatment processes and combinations of processes, and the significance
     of the potential return of microplastics to the environment from treatment waste
     streams including the application of sludge biosolids to agricultural land.

     To help inform water supply management options, more information is needed on
     the source of microplastic pollution in fresh water and drinking-water, as well as the
     mechanisms and efficacy of removing plastic particles in both wastewater and drinking-
     water treatment. However, regardless of the human health risk posed by exposure
     to microplastics in drinking-water, improving management of plastics and reducing
     the use of plastics where feasible, to minimize the number of plastics released into
     the environment is recommended because these actions can confer other benefits to

the environment and human well-being. Strategies to minimize microplastic inputs can
result in other benefits as well, for example, improvements to water treatment can
result in the removal of a range of contaminants, from microbial pathogens to emerging
contaminants including microplastics in both wastewater and drinking-water, providing
a more sustainable and comprehensive solution than microplastic removal alone.


7.3 Knowledge gaps and research needs
There are a number of data gaps that preclude a more accurate and reliable assessment
of exposure and potential impacts to human health. This section summarizes the highest
priority research needs to better assess human health risks and inform management
actions.
  • Development of standard methods: There is a need to improve microplastic
    sampling and analysis using quality-assured methods. Standard methods for measuring
    microplastic particles, including nanoplastics in water should be developed to
    improve the quality of studies and enable researchers to compare and reproduce
    results. To date, there are no data on the occurrence of nanoplastics in drinking-
    water or drinking-water sources.
  • More studies on the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics: There is
    a need to better understand the occurrence of microplastics in the environment
    and in drinking-water using quality-assured methods to determine numbers, shapes,
    sizes, composition and sources of microplastics.
  • Improved understanding of sources of microplastics into fresh water: Although
    surface run-off and wastewater effluent are considered the main sources of
    microplastics into fresh water, better data are required to quantify their contributions
    relative to other inputs and identify the original sources of contamination through
    these pathways. This may require establishing reliable methods to track origins
    and identify major sources of microplastics in fresh water.
  • More data on the occurrence and fate of microplastics throughout the
    water supply chain: In drinking-water, an understanding of the occurrence and
    fate of microplastics is needed throughout the water supply chain, pre- and post-
    treatment and in sub-optimal conditions to determine the proportion of and types
    of microplastic particles coming from the freshwater environment, abstraction,
    treatment systems, distribution systems and bottling and to better characterize
    effectiveness of water treatment.
  • More data on the return and significance of treatment waste streams: Since
    plastics are usually not destroyed, but rather transferred from one phase to




                                      Chapter 7: Conclusions, recommendations and knowledge gaps   69
          another, a better understanding on the return and significance of microplastics to
          the environment from drinking-water and wastewater treatment waste streams,
          including sludge, is needed. There are currently limited data available on this.
       • Increased understanding of toxicological effects of microplastics following
         ingestion: Toxicological testing of microplastics has been limited mostly to aquatic
         organisms, and there are no toxicological or epidemiological studies that would
         inform human health risk assessment for microplastic ingestion. Some toxicological
         endpoints in a limited number of studies have been conducted but there are
         questions regarding the reliability of these studies, which are generally limited to
         assessing effects under high exposure scenarios with unclear relevance to human
         exposure via drinking-water at significantly lower concentrations. Quality-assured
         toxicological data are needed from cell models and/or animals on the most common
         forms of plastic particles appropriate for human health risk assessment. A better
         understanding is also needed on the characteristics of microplastics that are most
         predictive of their toxicity.
       • More data on the uptake and fate of microplastics in the GI tract: The current
         database of information on plastic particle absorption and toxicity is limited
         to a few studies using PE, PET or PS. A better understanding is needed on the
         uptake of microplastic particles, the fate of microplastics in the GI tract and the
         influence of particle size, shape and chemical composition, particularly in relation
         to nanoplastics.
       • Better understanding of overall microplastic exposures in the environment:
         The significance of exposure to microplastics in drinking-water also needs to
         consider relative exposure from other sources such as food and air. It is difficult
         with available information to make a robust quantitative estimate on the relative
         contribution from different sources. A better understanding of occurrence in these
         environmental compartments, including quality of these studies, will be useful in
         articulating relative exposure through drinking-water compared to other sources.

     Annex 1: Systematic review and other
     studies of microplastics in fresh water
     and drinking-water

     This section summarizes a systematic review commissioned by WHO titled, Microplastics
     in freshwaters and drinking-water: Critical review and assessment of data quality (Koelmans et
     al., 2019). It also includes a summary of the studies on microplastics in drinking-water.


     A.1 Overview of systematic review
     As part of the systematic review, Koelmans et al. proposed several best practices for
     sampling, extracting and detecting microplastics and divided these best practices into
     nine quality criteria. The authors then assessed available studies on the occurrence of
     microplastics in drinking-water, surface water, groundwater and wastewater against
     these nine quality criteria to determine the overall reliability of the studies. They also
     summarized data on microplastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. A
     summary of the data on concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes is included
     in sections 2.5–2.7.


     A.2 Systematic review methods

     A.2.1 Literature search approach

     The authors reviewed 50 studies reporting microplastic concentrations in drinking-
     water, freshwater sources and wastewater. Because some studies reported data on
     microplastics in more than one water type, 56 records were reviewed (2 tap water,
     3 bottled water, 2 water exiting a DWTP, 1 groundwater, 30 surface water, and
     18 wastewater). Most papers were retrieved from the Scopus database using the search
     strings ‘microplastic AND (bottle OR surface OR tap OR wastewater OR groundwater)’. Three
     studies were identified from the grey literature (i.e. not peer-reviewed) via Google
     searches, using the same or similar key-word combinations as used for the Scopus
     database. The systematic search was performed until August 2018. Only those studies
     that reported original concentration data were reviewed.




88   Microplastics in drinking-water
A.2.2 Study characteristics

For each study the following characteristics were summarized in tabular form (see
Table S1 in Koelmans et al., 2019):
  •   Reference, country (area)
  •   Source (water type)
  •   Treatment (for wastewater and drinking-water treatment)
  •   Sampling date; size and shape (of microplastics detected)
  •   Polymer types (of microplastics detected)
  •   Chemicals (analysed in water or polymer)
  •   Value (of microplastics detected in water sample)
  •   Quality assurance applied (detection limit, blanks)
  •   Sampling method
  •   Analysis method
  •   Comments

A.2.3 Quantitative quality assessment

The reliability of data in these studies was assessed against nine “crucial” criteria,
which are detailed below. These criteria are an adaptation of the methods developed
for microplastic biota samples by Hermsen et al. (2018), which has been recognized
in the recent report from The Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of
Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) (2019).

For each criterion a value of 2 (reliable), 1 (reliable to limited extent) or 0 (unreliable)
was assigned. A TAS was calculated by adding scores for individual criteria for a
maximum of 18 points (See Table A.1 below). Assuming all individual criterion are
genuinely crucial, an overall quality score can be defined by multiplying the individual
scores, followed by a 2Log X transformation to obtain a linear scale for a maximum
score of nine. Such an approach implies that if even one of the crucial criteria is not
met, the overall quality score will be zero and the data reported in the study are not
considered fully reliable.

Quality criteria
 1. Sampling methods. This criterion assessed whether sampling was described in
    sufficient detail, including, for instance, date, location, and materials used. Specific
    sub-criteria were defined for wastewater, groundwater, surface water, tap water
    and bottled water.




                                                                                      Annex    89
       2. Sample size. To render a sample representative of the type of water studied, a
          minimum sample size was defined, or for bottled water, a minimum number of
          bottles to be analysed. The sample size needs to be sufficiently large to reliably
          detect at least one microplastic particle with statistical rigor.
       3. Sample processing and storage. When transferring a primary sample (e.g.
          material in a net) to a sampling bottle or preserving or storing samples before
          reaching the laboratory, certain criteria need to be met, such as confirmation that
          fixatives do not affect the particles. To minimize contamination, plastic materials
          should not be used to sample or store samples.
       4. Laboratory preparation. Prior to analysing a sample, certain measures need
          to be taken in the laboratory, including wearing cotton laboratory coats, and
          pre-rinsing and cleaning materials to minimize airborne contamination.
       5. Clean air conditions. Clean air conditions are also needed to minimize
          contamination with airborne microplastic particles or fibres. Samples should be
          handled in a laminar-flow cabinet or clean-air laboratory.  
       6. Negative controls. To confirm and correct for contamination or to demonstrate
          absence of contamination, replicated procedural blanks should be analysed. Blanks
          should be reported with particle counts, including standard deviations, and actual
          sample results should be corrected for the blank values and indicated as such.
       7. Positive controls. To confirm a sufficiently high recovery of particles during
          filtration, digestion transfer and analysis, representative and replicated positive
          controls should be performed.
       8. Sample treatment. To ensure the quality of visual inspection and subsequent
          sample analysis, a sample digestion step should be performed for surface water
          and wastewater samples. Tap water and bottled water do not require a digestion
          step and thus were automatically assigned 2 points.
       9. Polymer identification. To ensure reliable assessment of plastic particles, the
          identity of the polymer needs to be confirmed by using FTIR or Raman spectroscopy,
          pyrolysis-GC/MS or thermogravimetric analyser-GC/MS techniques. Where
          subsampling is required, best practices for subsampling and subsequent polymer
          identification will depend on the microplastic size classes and technologies applied.

     A detailed description of scoring criteria is provided in Koelmans et al., 2019.

A.3 Overview of systematic review results
Studies differed widely in sampling and analytical methods. Few studies reported a
detection limit. Generally, surface water samples employed plankton nets or trawls
to collect high-volume samples. Other sampling methods (also used on other water
types), included pump and spot sampling. As for analytical methods, most studies
sorted the samples through sieving or density-separation and treated the samples
chemically to remove organic material that otherwise may interfere with the microplastic
identification process. Chemical treatments differed widely but hydrogen peroxide,
which has been demonstrated to have minimal impacts on the microplastic weights,
count and shapes within an exposure of 48 hours, was often used. Several studies,
however, treated the samples at higher temperatures, which may impact the polymer.
Polymer identification mostly used FTIR methodologies.

Quality assurance remained limited, often lacking positive controls, sufficient blank
controls or measures to reduce airborne contamination of samples. The average scores
per criterion across 52 studies were lower than 1 for the criteria sample treatment
(0.93), polymer identification (0.89), laboratory preparation (0.77), clean air conditions (0.64),
and positive controls (0.21). Key areas to improve sampling and analytical methods are
included in Box 2.2.

Average TAS were 13.7 for bottled water, 12.5 for water exiting a DWTP, 11.5 for
tap water, 7.9 for surface water and 7.3 for wastewater studies. This ranking likely
reflects the relative ease of analysing the different water types, although there were
only three studies assessed for bottled water, two for tap water and two for water
exiting a DWTP. The overall quality scores were zero, except for four studies: Wang
et al. (2018, surface water) received a quality score of 6; Mason et al. (2018, bottled
water) scored a 5; Ziajahromi et al. (2017, wastewater) scored 3; and Hendrickson,
Minor and Schreiner (2018, wastewater) scored a 2. This means that 46 studies were
considered not fully reliable on at least one crucial criteria. However, improvements
in quality assurance in assessment and analysis methods may be occurring already,
since the four studies that received positive scores in all criteria were published more
recently, in 2017 and 2018. See Table A.1 for an overview of individual and total scores
from studies reporting microplastics in drinking-water, fresh water and wastewater.

The fact that data or a study may not be fully reliable according to these criteria does
not imply that the data are not useful. For instance, data may provide insights collectively
on the extent of contamination in the environment and the most important polymer
types and shapes, even if the sampling method is not described in a reproducible way.
A study may provide data with some systematic error due to sample contamination,
which may still be useful for comparisons within that study.

     A.4 Summary of drinking-water studies
     Since there are a limited number of drinking-water studies, with even less considered
     reliable, each of the drinking-water studies is described in more detail below. They are
     described in order of decreasing study quality, as determined by the TAS quantitative
     assessment, primarily from Koelmans et al. (2019). One additional unscored study
     identified from the grey literature had insufficient detail to assess fully the study quality
     but a short description is included in this section for completeness.

     1. Mintenig et al. (2019) analysed groundwater and drinking-water derived from the
        groundwater for the presence of microplastics. Samples were taken at different
        locations within the drinking-water supply chain. Large volume samples were
        filtered through a 3 µm mesh filter and particles over 20 µm were characterised
        using FTIR imaging. Four 150 L volume blank samples were found to contain both
        fibres and particles (0.67 particles/L, 0.3 fibres/L). Fibre numbers in blank samples
        exceed those in raw and treated waters indicating the fibres were not present in
        the water but were introduced during sample processing. Particles in blanks were
        mainly blue PP and SAN and were attributed to contamination from the filter unit
        and were excluded from the analysis. Concentrations reported ranged from 0 to
        0.007 particles/L in both raw water and drinking-water with an overall mean of
        0.0007 particles/L. These particles were identified as PE, PA, PEST, PVC or epoxy
        resin and were between 50 and 150 μm in size. The authors suggested the abrasion
        of plastic equipment used during water treatment or transport was a likely source
        of the plastic particles detected in the water samples.

     2. Mason, Welch and Neratko (2018) tested 259 individual bottles from 27 different
        lots across 11 brands of bottled water purchased from 19 locations in 9 countries.
        Samples were stained with Nile Red (a fluorescent dye used to stain particles)
        and filtered through 1.5 μm pore filter. Large particles >100 μm were removed
        and about half were analysed by FTIR. The remaining smaller fluorescing particles
        were counted using a software system. Blank samples were subject to the same
        procedures and were found to contain on average 4.15 particles/L (>100 μm) and
        23.5 particles/L (between 6.5–100 μm). Nearly all (93%) of the bottles showed some
        evidence of microplastic contamination. After correcting for blanks, the average
        count of particles >100 µm was 10.4 particles/L of bottled water, ranging from 0 to
        66 particles/L . Fragments were the most common shape (66%) followed by fibres
        (13%) and films (12%). PP, the most common plastic used for bottle caps, was the
        most common polymer (54%) and 4% of particles showed presence of industrial
        lubricants. The authors suggested that the contamination was at least partially
        coming from the packaging and/or the bottling process itself. Smaller particles in




96   Microplastics in drinking-water
  the range 6.5–100 µm were identified by Nile Red tagging without spectroscopic
  confirmation, and the average count reported was 315 particles/L of bottled water
  (range of 0 to over 10 000 particles/L). All the tagged larger particles analysed
  by FTIR showed some evidence of polymeric content, increasing the authors’
  confidence in the tagging method in this study. Based on this and other studies that
  had detected small microplastics in bottled water, the authors expected that the
  smaller particles were plastic or of some other anthropogenic origin, although no
  confirmatory spectroscopic analysis was conducted.

3. Strand et al. (2018) examined drinking-water from 17 sites around Denmark. All
   drinking-water in Denmark is derived from groundwater with the exception of one
   small island not included in the study (Andreas Herfelt, Danish Ministry of Environment
   and Food, personal communication, November 2018). A 50 L sample from each
   site was filtered through a 10 μm stainless-steel filter. The filters were examined
   by microscopy for microplastic-like particles with sizes >100 μm. The predominant
   type of microplastic-like particles observed were fibres (82%). On average 0.312
   particles/L and a maximum of 0.6 particles/L >100 μm were observed. Five blank
   50 L samples were analysed and found to contain on average 13.2 microplastic-like
   particles (0.26 particles/L). Results were used to generate a limit of detection of
   0.58 particles/L. In 16 of the 17 drinking-water samples, the numbers were below
   the limit of detection. Of the total particles identified, 124 (44%) microplastic-like
   particles were further characterised by FTIR. Of the microplastic-like particles,
   3% were verified as microplastic, whereas the majority consisted of cellulose-like
   material (76%), with the remainder having poor spectra (10%), unknown (7%) or
   protein-like material (4%). The types of microplastic particles detected in the tap
   water samples were PET, PP and PS. Some further analysis of particles in the range
   of 10 to 100 μm also found low levels of microplastic.

4. Schymanski et al. (2018) used micro-Raman spectroscopy to identify microplastics
   in bottled water where particle sizes are in the low micrometre range. The authors
   tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single-
   use plastic bottles, 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles purchased in Germany.
   Samples were filtered through a 3 µm pore size filter. Larger (50–500 µm) and very
   small (1–50 µm) microplastic fragments were found in every type of water sample.
   Most (80%) of the microplastic particles found were between 5 and 20 µm in size.
   The average microplastic content reported was 118 ± 88 particles/L (range 28–241
   particles/L ) in returnable bottles, 14 ± 14 particles/L (range 2–44 particles/L) in
   single-use plastic bottles, 11 ± 8 particles/L (range 5–20 particles/L) in beverage
   cartons and surprisingly 50 ± 52 particles/L (range 4–156 particles/L) in glass bottles.
   Only the returnable bottles showed a statistically significant difference from the blank




                                                                                     Annex    97
        value (14 ± 13 particles/L). Most of the particles in water from returnable plastic
        bottles were identified as PET (84%) and PP (7%) consistent with the material used
        to manufacture bottles (PET) and the caps (PP). In other bottle types microplastic
        particles other than PET were found, for example PE or other polyolefins. The
        authors noted that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps
        are treated with lubricants and that the findings indicate that the packaging itself
        may release microparticles.

     5. Oßmann et al. (2018) analysed 32 samples of bottled mineral water purchased in
        Germany for concentrations of microplastics particles. Using 0.4 µm membrane
        filters and micro-Raman spectroscopy on five 1 mm2 areas of the filter, particles
        as small as 1 μm were analysed. Microplastics were found in water samples from
        all bottle types. The average count of microplastics reported in mineral water was
        2649 particles/L in single-use PET bottles, 4889 particles/L in reusable PET bottle and
        between 3074 particles/L (excluding an outlier) and 6292 particles/L (all samples) in
        glass bottles. On average 384 microplastic particles/L (range 0–1175) were found
        in blank samples, consisting mainly of PP, some of PS, PE and PET. Whilst in plastic
        bottles, the predominant polymer type was PET, in glass bottles various polymers
        such as PE or styrene-butadiene-copolymer were found. The authors concluded that
        in addition to the packaging itself, other contamination sources have to be considered.
        Over 95% of the detected microplastics particles found in plastic bottles were smaller
        than 5 μm and over 75% of those found in glass bottles were smaller than 5 µm.

     6. Pivokonsky et al. (2018) investigated microplastic concentrations in fresh water
        and drinking-water. Researchers studied three DWTPs in the Czech Republic and
        analysed raw and treated water for microplastics. All waters were derived from surface
        sources. Analysis involved peroxide oxidation, sequential filtering through 5 and 0.2
        µm filters; sections of the filters were analysed by electron microscopy to quantify
        particle numbers, shapes and sizes. Numbers were corrected based on the finding of
        the spectroscopic analysis. Particle characterisation was by FTIR on particles above
        10 µm and Raman spectroscopy on particles above 1 µm. Microplastics were found
        in all water samples in the range 1473 to 3605 particles/L in raw water and 338 to
        628 particles/L in treated drinking-water. Background contamination, determined by
        analysing blank filters, was less than 5% of the abundance of microplastics detected
        and was considered negligible. Typical removal across drinking-water treatment
        was reported as 70–80%. Microplastics smaller than 10 μm were the most plentiful
        in both raw and treated water samples, accounting for up to 95% of the particles
        found. Fragments clearly prevailed at two of the DWTPs in both the raw and treated
        waters and fibres together with fragments predominated at the remaining DWTP.
        Despite 12 different materials forming the microplastics identified, the majority of
        the microplastics (70%) were comprised of PET, PP and PE.


98   Microplastics in drinking-water
7. Uhl, Eftekhardadkhah, and Svendsen (2018) studied raw water, treated water and
   drinking-water from the distribution system at 24 water works in Norway. Of those,
   20 used surface water and 4 used groundwater. All samples were taken as triplicates
   of 1 L volume, sampling was done by professional personnel, and special attention
   was given to avoid contamination during sampling and analysis. Samples were filtered
   through commercial glass fibre filter papers. Analysis was done microscopically and in
   addition to the 216 bottles, 72 blanks were analysed. In the blanks, 0.5 microplastic
   particles/L were found on average, showing some contamination from processing
   samples in the laboratory. A statistical analysis of the results from the triplicates
   yielded a LoD of 0.9 microplastic particles/L and a LoQ of 4.1 microplastic particles/L,
   both with a 67% confidence level. No differences between groundwater and surface
   water were found. At 20 of 24 sites, the concentration in raw water was below
   the LoQ. Four of the raw-water sites showed average concentrations of up to
   2.7 particles/L. Concentrations in treated water were, lower than in raw water, with
   a 67% confidence level. Except for 1 of the 72 triplicates, all averages were below the
   LoQ (67%). Only one triplicate of drinking-water taken from the distribution system
   showed an average concentration above the LoD, i.e. 5.5 microplastic particles/L.
   However, that could be attributed to environmental contamination due to rough
   sampling conditions. The study also presented some evidence for contamination of
   water samples from air when blank bottles were exposed open to air for 24 hours.

8. Kosuth, Mason and Wattenberg (2018) investigated the presence of anthropogenic
   particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water. Samples were collected in 500
   ml PE bottles, vacuum filtered through a cellulose filter with a pore size of 2.5 μm
   and analysed using staining of natural organic matter with Rose Bengal, (a fluorescent
   dye,) and microscopy. Since no confirmatory spectroscopic analyses, such as FTIR,
   were conducted, the unstained particles were described as anthropogenic particles
   rather than microplastics. Of the tap water samples analysed, 81% were found to
   contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibres (98.3%)
   between 0.1–5 mm in length, with an average of 0.96 mm. The range reported was
   0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Of the 30 total deionized
   blanks, 5 were reported with one anthropogenic particle in them and the others
   were reported with none. For the three brands of bottled water also included
   in the study, the average reported concentration of anthropogenic particles was
   3.57 particles/L. Of the 539 particles found, the most common colour was blue,
   followed by red/pink, and brown. Water sourced from more developed nations had
   an average particle count higher than that sourced from less developed nations.

9. Results from an unpublished study (Mahon et al., 2017) reported maximum
   concentrations of microplastics of 6.5 particles/L in untreated private well-water




                                                                                     Annex    99
         samples and 1.6 particles/L in a public water supply in Ireland. The report contained
         insufficient details on the methods of analysis to interpret or contextualize these
         results. The public water supply came from a lake and the treatment process
         involved fine screening (5 mm), coagulation, settlement, pH correction, rapid-gravity
         filtration, UV treatment, disinfection and fluoridation. The authors considered the
         ability of fibres to pass through such a robust treatment system raises the question
         of whether systems that employ fewer treatment stages may not be as efficient
         in capturing microplastics, but without further details of contamination control
         measures, the results should be treated with caution.
