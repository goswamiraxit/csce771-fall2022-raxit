        11 Natural uranium and thorium-230 are approved as gross alpha calibration standards for gross alpha with co-precipitation and evaporation methods; americium-241 is approved with co-
      precipitation methods.
        12 If uranium (U) is determined by mass, a 0.67 pCi/µg of uranium conversion factor must be used. This conservative factor is based on the 1:1 activity ratio of U–234 to U–238 that is
      characteristic of naturally occurring uranium.

  1 Table  is for illustrative purposes; consult the text of this section for precise regulatory requirements.
  2 Small and medium-size systems have to monitor for water quality parameters only during monitoring periods in which the
system exceeds the lead or copper action level.
  3 Orthophosphate must be measured only when an inhibitor containing a phosphate compound is used. Silica must be meas-
ured only when an inhibitor containing silicate compound is used.
  4 Calcium must be measured only when calcium carbonate stabilization is used as part of corrosion control.
  5 Inhibitor dosage rates and inhibitor residual concentrations (orthophosphate or silica) must be measured only when an inhibi-
tor is used.

   1 Only required for a PWS that, during any of the first twelve months of monitoring at the treatment plant influent, detects 10 or
more Giardia cysts, or 10 or more Cryptosporidium oocysts, or one or more total culturable viruses in one liter of water; or cal-
culates a numerical value of the Giardia or Cryptosporidium concentration equal to or greater than 1000 per 100 liters or virus
concentration equal to or greater than 100 per 100 liters; or detects no pathogens in the sample and calculates a numerical
value of the detection limit for Giardia or Cryptosporidium concentration equal to or greater than 1000 per 100 liters or virus con-
centration equal to or greater than 100 per 100 liters. The PWS shall collect one sample of finished water during each month
that the treatment plant is operated at each such treatment plant beginning in the first calendar month after the PWS learns of
such a result. A PWS shall continue finished water monitoring monthly until 18 months of treatment plant influent monitoring has
been completed.
   2 A PWS may avoid virus monitoring if the PWS has monitored total coliforms, fecal coliforms, or E. coli in the source water for
at least five days/week for any period of six consecutive months beginning after January 1, 1994, and 90% of all samples taken
in that six-month period contained no greater than 100 total coliforms/100 ml, or 20 fecal coliforms/100 ml, or 20 E. coli/100 ml.
   3 A PWS may avoid the requirement for finished water monitoring of Giardia and Cryptosporidium if the PWS notifies EPA that
it will comply with the alternative monitoring requirements in § 141.143(a)(2)(iii). The PWS must still conduct finished water mon-
itoring for all other microorganisms, except that Giardia and Cryptosporidium monitoring in the finished water is not required.

   4 Washwater return shall be sampled prior to blending with the process train.
   5 For utilities using ozone or chlorine dioxide, Tables 4 and 5, respectively, of this section, show additional monitoring require-
ments at this sampling point. Addition of ammonia for the purpose of converting free chlorine to chloramines is considered a
point of disinfectant addition. PWSs that disinfect just before filtration may use the ‘‘before filtration’’ sampling point analytical re-
sults to meet the monitoring requirement for this point.
   6 Entry point to distribution system only required for treatment plants that blend finished water with finished water from other
treatment plant(s) prior to entry point of distribution system. For most treatment plants, the finished water sample point and the
entry point to the distribution system are the same.

   2 Entry point to distribution system only required for treatment plants that blend finished water with finished water from other
treatment plant(s) prior to entry point of distribution system. For most treatment plants, the finished water sample point and the
entry point to the distribution system are the same.
   3 Simulated Distribution System (SDS) sample shall be collected at the finished water sampling point (or entry point to distribu-
tion system if finished water from two or more plants are blended prior to entering the distribution system) and analyzed using
the method specified in § 141.142. PWSs using purchased finished water are not required to take an SDS sample at treatment
plants that use only purchased finished water.
   4 For each treatment plant, one distribution system equivalent sample location (known as DSE) shall be chosen to correspond
to the SDS sample, one sample location shall be chosen to be representative of maximum residence time for the treatment
plant, and the remaining two sample locations shall be representative of the average residence time in the distribution system for
the treatment plant. PWSs using purchased finished water shall take three samples representing the average residence time in
the distribution system for the treatment plant and one representing the maximum residence time for the treatment plant (no DSE
sample required).
   5 Free chlorine residual and total chlorine residual shall be measured in treatment systems using free chlorine. Total chlorine
residual, but not free chlorine residual, shall be measured in treatment systems using chloramines as the residual disinfectant.
   6 A PWS may use TTHM compliance monitoring locations and analytical results under § 141.30 of this part to the extent that
such locations and analytical results are consistent with the requirements of this section.
   7 PWSs are encouraged to also analyze for the additional haloacetic acids bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo-, and tribromo-acetic
acid, and report the results as part of the reports specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        1 A reservoir to which oxidants, disinfectants, or coagulants are added is considered a presedimentation basin.
        2 Baffling type classified as one of the following: 1 (Unbaffled (mixed tank)), 2 (Poor (inlet/outlet only)), 3 (Average (Inlet/Outlet and intermediate)), 4 (Superior (Serpentine)), or 5 (Perfect
      (Plug flow)). Information on classifying baffling types can be found in ‘‘Guidance Manual for Compliance with the Filtration and Disinfection Requirements for Public Water Systems using
      Surface Water Sources’’, Appendix C.
        3 ‘‘SCFM’’ is standard cubic feet per minute. ‘‘Equ/ft3’’ is equivalents per cubic foot.
        4 The mean velocity gradient is typically computed as G=square root of (P/uV) where P=power expended, u=viscosity, and V=liquid volume.
        5 The disinfection contact basin shall have a stable liquid level.
        6 Disinfection Contact Basin can be used to represent a pipe with a long contact time.
        7 A clear well may have a variable liquid level.




462
        8 The ‘‘Washwater Return’’ shall mark the point in the process train where washwater joins the main flow.
        9 Additional water sources includes water that is added to the process train after the influent.
