viii   Water safety in buildings
Foreword

  Extensive experience shows that poor design and management of water systems in
  buildings can cause outbreaks of disease. The types of building, water uses, disease
  outcomes and individuals affected are diverse. The health risks are preventable and
  can be readily controlled. However, evidence from outbreak detection suggests that the
  overall trend is increasing. With increasing global urbanization, the overall exposure
  of the human population to poorly designed or managed water systems in buildings is
  increasing rapidly. Consequently, the risk of disease outbreaks is also increasing. Actions
  to reduce the risk of disease should be considered a public health priority.
  One of the challenges is that management of building water supplies is often overlooked.
  In many countries and regions, management actions for water supplies in buildings may
  fall outside the responsibility of the drinking-water supplier. This can be influenced by a
  range of factors, including ownership of assets and rights of access. Water safety plans
  (WSPs) for managing public water supplies are not typically extended to apply within
  buildings. In many cases, owners, managers or maintenance personnel are responsible for
  management of building water supplies, but awareness and application of drinking-water
  guidelines is often limited.
  This text is one of series of supporting documents that provide guidance on implementing
  the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ)
  (WHO, 2008). It is intended to support improvement of water safety within buildings.
  The third edition of the GDWQ (WHO, 2008) introduced the concept of WSPs within
  a Framework for safe drinking-water (see Figure 1.1 in the introduction, below). The
  framework focuses attention on effective preventive management and thereby disease
  prevention. The GDWQ include specific reference to issues associated with large
  buildings, such as health care facilities, schools and daycare centres, and recommend that
  these buildings have their own WSPs to ensure the maintenance of safe water supplies.
  The intention is that such building plans should complement the WSPs of water suppliers.
  The issue of water safety in buildings and the need for additional guidance was identified
  as a priority at the meeting of government-nominated experts who finalized the third
  edition of the GDWQ. This led to the development of this document. The guidance
  provided in this document is based on the framework from the GDWQ (WHO, 2008), as
  well as other supporting texts, particularly those dealing with:
  • Guidelines for safe recreational water environments volume 2: swimming pools and
    similar environments (WHO, 2006a)
  • health aspects of plumbing (WHO/WPC, 2006)
  • heterotrophic plate counts (Bartram et al., 2003)
  • Legionella and the prevention of legionellosis (Bartram et al., 2007)
  • pathogenic mycobacteria (Bartram et al., 2004).

  The development of this document was guided by the recommendation of expert meetings
  hosted first in March 2005 (by the University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom),



                                                                                           ix
    then in December 2005 (by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Promoting
    Water Management and Risk Communication, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health,
    University of Bonn, Germany). These meetings were followed by meetings in February
    2007 (by the Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy), in October 2007 (by the Scottish
    Executive, Edinburgh, Scotland), and finally in July 2008 (by the Federal Ministry of
    Health in Berlin, Germany). The development of this document was also guided by a
    series of critical reviews by specialists in the field.
    The Department of Public Health and Environment (Programme on Water, Sanitation,
    Hygiene and Health, WHO) led the production of this document.
    This document is written for the full range of “actors” who influence the overall safe
    management of building water supplies. In particular, it is directed to those who design,
    construct, manage, operate, maintain and regulate building water systems. It is intended
    to be a useful resource for the development of training and information material.

1 Introduction

  This document deals with all buildings where people use or are exposed to water, with
  a particular focus on buildings that include public use or shared facilities. Many of the
  principles also apply to sole occupancy dwellings and homes; however, it is not expected
  that management actions, such as the implementation of water safety plans (WSPs), will
  be applied in private homes.
  Vulnerable population groups may be particularly susceptible to water-related hazards,
  and certain types of building are therefore of special concern. Important examples include
  medical and other health-care environments where the growth of a range of opportunistic
  waterborne pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-tuberculous Mycobacteria
  and Legionella, is a significant health concern and can lead to substantial and avoidable
  costs.
  Outbreaks have been associated with both microbial and chemical contamination. A
  significant proportion of such waterborne disease is associated with contamination within
  buildings. This can arise from:
  • direct contamination through faults in water systems (e.g. bird and small animal
    droppings into storage tanks) or leaching from inappropriate materials or corrosion
    (e.g. copper, lead, nickel, cadmium);
  • indirect contamination through cross-connections between drinking-water systems
    and contaminated water or chemical storages;
  • growth of indigenous microbes (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-tuberculous
    Mycobacteria and legionellae).

  Guidance is provided for managing water supplies in buildings where people may
  drink water; use water for food preparation, washing, showering, swimming or other
  recreational activities; or be exposed to aerosols produced by water-using devices, such
  as cooling towers. These uses occur in a variety of buildings, such as hospitals, schools,
  child-care and aged-care facilities, medical and dental facilities, hotels, apartment blocks,
  sport centres, commercial buildings and transport terminals.
  Although the focus of this document is managing water supplies within buildings,
  microbial and chemical hazards may sometimes also be introduced from water delivered
  to buildings from external sources.
  The inadequate management of water in buildings has considerable health effects, as
  well as significant direct and indirect economic and social impacts. The World Health
  Organization (WHO) has identified that the benefits of all interventions to reduce risks from
  unsafe water outweigh costs by substantial margins (Hutton & Haller, 2004). In health-
  care settings, the costs of nosocomial infections, including those that are waterborne, are
  substantial and rising—in terms of both direct costs and reputational impacts (Anaissie et
  al., 2002). Travel and hotel stays are recognized as risk factors for legionellosis (Bartram
  et al., 2007). In Europe, approximately 20% of detected legionellosis cases are considered
  to be travel associated (Joseph, 2002; Bartram et al., 2007). Cases of legionellosis in




                                                                                             1
    hotels have often received extensive and damaging publicity, with significant economic
    impacts due to reduced patronage.
    The document does not deal with the management or protection of water resources, or
    the use of recycled water. Further detail on these aspects is provided in the supporting
    text, Protecting groundwater for health (Schmoll et al., 2006), the Guidelines for safe use
    of wastewater, excreta and greywater (WHO, 2006b) and a forthcoming text on surface
    water.
    The guidance provided in this document is based on the Framework for safe drinking-
    water, from the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality (WHO, 2008). The
    framework is shown in Figure 1.1.

    This document is divided into four sections:
    • Section 2 is made up of short introductions with principles that describe the core issues
      of water safety in buildings. It is organized into subsections that address hazards and
      risks, people and building types.
    • Section 3 deals with the role and responsibilities of stakeholders who influence
      the safety of water systems within buildings. Stakeholders can be involved in the
      planning, design, construction and renovation of buildings, as well as development of
      WSPs, and ongoing maintenance and operation of water systems.

  examples on how those key principles can be applied to buildings. This section is
  organized into subsections explaining how to assemble teams; understand the water
  system; identify hazards and assess risks; put in place control measures, operational
  monitoring and management procedures; and establish verification and supporting
  programmes.
• Section 5 deals with the environment that supports the delivery of safe water within
  buildings but does not affect water quality directly. This section is organized into
  subsections addressing independent technical inspection and surveillance, disease

2 What are the issues?

   This section describes the issues that confront engineers and planners when planning and
   implementing water safety plans (WSPs). It discusses water-system design, hazards and
   risk assessment, the end-users and building type.

2.1 Background
   The World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ)
   (WHO, 2008) describe a quality of water that is safe for a lifetime of consumption. The
   focus of the guidelines is the Framework for safe drinking-water, incorporating WSPs.
   This framework is applicable to all drinking-water systems, ranging from those serving
   the largest of cities to the smallest non-piped and household supplies. The framework is
   also applicable to delivery of drinking-water within buildings.

   2.1.1    Purpose of WSPs
   WSPs are the most effective means of consistently ensuring the safety of drinking-water
   supplies through a comprehensive risk-management approach that encompasses all steps,
   from source through treatment and distribution to consumers. The WSP approach is based
   on identifying all significant risks to public health, ensuring that effective controls and
   barriers are applied to minimize these risks to acceptable levels, and monitoring the
   operation of the controls and barriers to ensure that safety is maintained.
   Application of WSPs and good management by those responsible for drinking-water
   production and distribution can assure drinking-water safety. However, management of
   building water systems can be complicated by a number of factors, including ownership
   of assets and rights of access that change on building property boundaries. Drinking-water
   systems in buildings are generally designed, installed and controlled independently from
   public water supplies. This contributes to buildings representing specific environments
   with specific hazards and hazardous events. Other complicating factors include:
   • designated uses of buildings (e.g. hospitals, medical centres, residential care);
   • use of supplementary water supplies, such as roof rainwater, greywater and water
     from private supplies (e.g. wells, bores and springs);
   • supplementary point-of-entry treatment for water supplied from public systems;
   • connection of drinking-water systems with water-using devices, such as cooling
     towers, evaporative condensers, boilers, swimming pools, washing machines,
     dishwashers, dental chairs, medical devices and industrial equipment;
   • the vulnerabilities of people using buildings (e.g. in hospitals and aged-care facilities);
   • the potential for multiple owners and shared assets, particularly in larger buildings.

   In addition, buildings can have complex plumbing systems with at least two distinct
   systems for drinking-water and wastewater (sewage and greywater). In some buildings, a




                                                                                               5
    third system might be installed to distribute recycled water (treated sewage or greywater)
    for uses such as toilet flushing. The drinking-water system is typically divided into two
    sections providing hot and cold water, and large buildings may incorporate a separate
    section conveying water for firefighting.

    2.1.2        Factors that affect WSP operation
    One of the consequences of the separation of ownership and oversight has been a tendency
    for water safety in buildings to be overlooked, or at best receive limited attention.
    While public water supplies are generally maintained by water utilities or agencies with
    particular expertise, this is often not the case with water supplies within buildings. A
    general perception can be that water systems in buildings connected to public supplies are
    safe, ignoring the potential for contamination (both chemical and microbial) and growth
    of waterborne opportunistic pathogens within the building water systems. This also
    applies to devices (e.g. cooling towers, boilers, washing machines, swimming pools, hot
    tub pools) and equipment. Water systems are often managed by general maintenance staff
    with little training or expertise in managing water quality. Regulatory authorities often
    establish working relationships and provide oversight of public water supplies, but this
    is more challenging with building managers. There may be a limited number of public
    water suppliers in urban areas, but many thousands of independently owned buildings.
    As a result, there are many examples where faults within buildings have led to outbreaks
    of drinking-water-derived disease (Kuroki et al., 1996; CDC, 1997a; Blackburn et al.,
    2004; Robert Koch Institute, 2004; Yoder et al., 2004, 2008ab; Djiuban et al., 2006;
    Liang et al., 2006; Vianelli et al., 2006). These have included diverse outcomes such as
    outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease associated with contamination of drinking-water by
    Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora, legionellosis (Legionnaires’ disease) associated with
    hot and cold water systems and cooling towers, and methaemoglobinemia from boiler
    fluid contamination of drinking-water. Aesthetic issues, such as taste and odours, can be
    caused by water stagnation and through back-siphonage from flexible hoses connected to
    devices such as washing machines and ice machines. Turbidity and colour can be caused
    by corrosion or resuspension of biofilms and sediments from storage tanks and hot-water
    tanks.
    A common theme associated with outbreaks has been poor management of building
    water systems. Outbreaks can be prevented through design and application of WSPs.
    WSPs should deal with all sources of water, including community and private supplies
    (e.g. roof rainwater or groundwater) and should consider the characteristics and quality
    of the available sources. This includes determining whether community supplies have
    established WSPs. Building WSPs should be complementary to any existing plans
    developed by operators of community supplies. In these circumstances, drinking-water
    suppliers should provide assistance and information to building owners and managers
    responsible for developing WSPs.
    Public health and regulatory authorities should provide guidance on development and
    implementation of WSPs. These authorities should also undertake surveillance to ensure
    that WSPs are operating effectively (see section 4).




6   Water safety in buildings
2.2 System design
    The basic requirements for establishing effective WSPs are good design and a sound
    knowledge of the physical characteristics of water systems. Water systems in buildings
    are often designed with limited attention to minimizing risks to public health. Retrofitting
    existing systems to improve management and safety is expensive. Every effort should be
    made in designing and constructing new systems to support the implementation of WSPs.
    This should include minimizing sources of hazards (e.g. stagnant water, long branch pipes
    and dead legs), as well as enabling access for monitoring and maintenance.
    Knowledge of the characteristics of existing systems is often lacking, and in many cases
    there are no accurate, well-maintained maps of water systems. This is particularly true for
    large buildings and can be complicated in buildings that have been renovated or repaired.
    Pipework belonging to various networks (drinking-water, wastewater, recycled water,
    etc.) are often poorly labelled, which increases the likelihood of cross-connections and
    associated health risks. In addition, when problems arise, responses can be delayed by
    first having to map the system.

2.3 Hazard identification and risk assessment
    Effective management of drinking-water systems in buildings requires a comprehensive
    understanding of the system, including the range of potential hazards, hazardous events
    and risks that may arise during delivery and use of water by occupants and visitors to
    buildings. It also requires an understanding of the quality and management of the water
    delivered to buildings. This can vary from high-quality, well-managed urban water
    supplies to poor-quality, intermittent community supplies or independent building-
    specific supplies.

    2.3.1    Hazards
    The GDWQ (WHO, 2008) describe a range of hazards that can threaten drinking-water
    supplies. All these hazards could enter buildings if present in external water supplies or
    could be introduced within buildings. Hazards include the following:
    • Enteric pathogens (bacteria, viruses and protozoa) from faecal contamination can
      enter the system through faults in water supplies provided to buildings or within
      internal plumbing systems.
    • Environmental organisms such as Legionella and Pseudomonas can grow in
      distribution systems and water-using devices, such as cooling towers and hot-tub
      pools. Growth is promoted by conditions such as low flow, stagnant water and warm
      water temperatures. In hospitals, a broader range of environmental bacteria and fungi
      such as Acinetobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Burkholderia cepacia and Aspergillus
      have been identified as causes of nosocomial infection (Annaisie et al., 2002; Sehulster
      et al., 2004).
    • Chemicals from external environmental, industrial and agricultural sources can
      enter the water-supply system. In addition, chemical hazards can be introduced from
      treatment processes, leached from unsuitable materials, or released from corrosion
      of pipework and fittings (e.g. copper, lead, cadmium and nickel) used in plumbing
      systems. Corrosion can be exacerbated by stagnation.



                                                                      2 What are the issues?   7
    2.3.2        Hazardous events
    Buildings represent specific independent environments that can include a wide range of
    conditions and situations (hazardous events), leading to the occurrence of hazards. The
    likelihood of hazardous events is influenced by the size and complexity of buildings
    and can be exacerbated by poor design, construction, operation and maintenance. These
    hazardous events include:
    • poor flow and stagnation due to
         –    poor design, including long branch pipes and dead ends
         –    intermittent use or extended periods with no use (e.g. floors or wings of hotels
              with seasonal occupancy; schools during holidays);
    • poor temperature control, including
         –    inadequate heating capacity and poor design of hot-water systems, including
              long branch mains
         –    elevated temperatures in cold-water systems due to proximity of hot-water
              systems and poor insulation;
    • unsuitable materials used in plumbing
         –    products that leach hazardous chemicals or support microbial growth
         –    materials incompatible with the physical and chemical characteristics of water
              supplied to the building (leading to increased corrosion or scaling);
    • open water-storage tanks allowing access of external contamination;
    • cross-connections with independent water systems (e.g. roof rainwater), fire systems
      or recycled water systems, and inadequate backflow prevention from connected
      water-using devices (e.g. cooling towers, heat exchangers, boilers, washing machines,
      dishwashers) and liquid storages;
    • poor management of water-using devices (e.g. cooling towers, drinking-water
      fountains, hot-tub pools and baths, swimming pools);
    • poor management, maintenance and repair, exacerbated by inadequately mapped
      systems (e.g. schematic diagrams not updated following modifications) and poorly
      labelled pipework (e.g. distinguishing drinking-water, wastewater and recycled-water
      systems);
    • unauthorized repairs and modifications (e.g. installation of point-of-use [PoU] devices
      such as carbon filters).


    2.3.3        Risk assessment
    Once potential hazards and hazardous events have been identified, the levels of risk need
    to be assessed so that priorities for risk management can be established. Risk assessments
    need to consider the likelihood and severity of hazards and hazardous events in the
    context of exposure (type, extent and frequency) and the vulnerability of those exposed.
    Although many hazards may threaten water quality, not all will represent a high risk. The
    aim should be to distinguish between high and low risks so that attention can be focused
    on mitigating risks that are more likely to cause harm.

8   Water safety in buildings
2.4 People who use buildings
    Buildings represent specific environments and can provide specific services (e.g. hospitals,
    clinics, dental surgeries, aged-care facilities and schools). To determine the health risk
    associated with hazards from building water systems, it is necessary to consider:
    • the vulnerability of people who work in, live in or visit the building
    • the number of occupants and visitors
    • the frequency and length of visits
    • the types of water use and exposure.


    2.4.1    Users of buildings
    The types of people who use buildings will depend on the purpose of the buildings and
    services that are provided. Different groups can include:
    • residents (e.g. of apartment blocks);
    • long-term and short-term residents of hotels;
    • hospital inpatients, outpatients and visitors;
    • elderly residents in retirement complexes or aged-care facilities;
    • dentists, doctors and nurses;
    • patients at health-care centres and dental or medical clinics;
    • visitors to museums, theatres, sports stadiums, shopping centres and garden centres;
    • users of services (e.g. restaurants, food outlets and cafes);
    • users of facilities (e.g. fitness centres, swimming pools, sporting clubs and leisure
      centres, ice rinks);
    • workers in residential buildings;
    • workers with particular exposures (e.g. lifeguards and swimming instructors);
    • maintenance employees and contractors, particularly those with responsibilities
      relating to water systems and water-using devices;
    • university and school students;
    • very young children attending child-care facilities;
    • prisoners.


    2.4.2    Vulnerabilities
    Those at greatest risk of waterborne disease are infants and young children, people who
    are immunocompromised, and the elderly. For most buildings, the health and vulnerability
    of users, visitors, residents and workers in buildings will be representative of the general
    population. However, some buildings will be used or visited by greater numbers of people
    who are more vulnerable to waterborne disease. These include very young children at
    child-care facilities and in hospitals; the elderly in retirement complexes or aged-care



                                                                       2 What are the issues?   9
     facilities; patients attending doctors’ surgeries; outpatients at hospitals and other health-
     care facilities; inpatients, particularly those who are immunocompromised (e.g. cancer
     patients); transplant patients; and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
     Patients with respiratory disorders may be more susceptible to waterborne organisms
     transmitted by inhalation (e.g. Legionella and mycobacteria).
     Renal dialysis patients are vulnerable to microorganisms, endotoxins, toxins and chemical
     contaminants. This vulnerability was demonstrated in 1996 by the death of 50 patients
     after exposure to water contaminated by high levels of microcystin (Jochimsen et al.,
     1998; Pouria et al., 1998) and 10 patients from aluminium encephalopathy (Berend et
     al., 2001). In the latter case, a community desalinated water supply was used for dialysis
     without further treatment for a number of years. The deaths occurred when corroding
     ductile-iron pipes were coated with a cement mortar containing aluminium. Dialysis
     patients are also sensitive to chemical disinfectants used to disinfect drinking-water
     supplies (Ward, 1996; Davidovits et al., 2003; Hoenich, 2009).
     Due to advances in medical care, the proportion of people in communities with greater
     susceptibility to disease is increasing, particularly in developed countries. Communities
     are ageing, and survival of cancer patients and transplant recipients is improving.

     2.4.3      Exposure
     Exposure will be influenced by the length of occupancy, the frequency and length of
     visits, the nature of the building and the type of user.
     Length of exposure will range from permanent residents of apartment buildings to long-
     term employees and workers; regular attendees at universities, schools, fitness centres
     and swimming pools; long- and short-term hospital patients; occasional attendees at
     medical and dental surgeries; and occasional visitors to restaurants, hotels and museums.
     The type and nature of exposure will vary. While consumption of drinking-water
     involves potentially the highest volume exposure, other transmission pathways need
     to be considered. Exposure could include direct ingestion of drinking-water or indirect
     consumption through food and beverages prepared at restaurants, food outlets, cafes, hotels
     and bed-and-breakfast facilities. Ingestion and contact with water could occur through
     normal bathing activities, as well as through the use of swimming pools, hydrotherapy
     pools and hot-tub pools. Aerosols from showers, hot- and cold-water outlets, hot-tub
     pools or cooling towers can be inhaled, as can disinfection by-products released into the
     air at indoor swimming centres. Aerosols can also be generated by decorative fountains,
     irrigation systems used in garden centres or misting devices used in food markets.
     Exposure could be associated with equipment used in hospitals, such as humidifiers and
     nebulizers, or in dental surgeries.
     Exposure could also occur though inappropriate uses of piped water supplies. For
     example, drinking-water supplies are generally not suitable without additional treatment
     to wash wounds and burns or to wash and rinse medical equipment. Water used for renal
     dialysis needs to be highly treated to ensure that it is microbially and chemically safe.




10   Water safety in buildings
2.5 Building types
    Buildings can include specific environments that influence the level of risk associated
    with drinking-water systems. This can also be influenced by vulnerabilities of those who
    use and visit different types of buildings.

    2.5.1    Large buildings
    All buildings can represent sources of hazards and hazardous events. Large buildings can
    present particular challenges related to size and complexity. Drinking-water distribution
    systems in large buildings tend to be very long and complex, with many branch pipes.
    They can include large variations in flow, including very low flows at the end of long
    branches and dead legs. Plumbing systems are often poorly documented, particularly
    as buildings age and are modified or extended. Control over distribution systems in
    large buildings is also more difficult to maintain. Temporary or even extended periods
    of non-use of sections of buildings and associated plumbing systems are often poorly
    documented or managed.
    Storage tanks can be used to maintain water pressure within the building (under-roof)
    or to provide buffering storage. The integrity of storage tanks needs to be maintained.
    In hot climates, the temperature of water—particularly in under-roof storage tanks—can
    increase and support the growth of environmental opportunistic pathogens.
    Addition of PoU devices can occur without the knowledge of building management and
    maintenance staff. The potential for inadvertent cross-connections between drinking- and
    non-drinking- water systems increases in relation to the size and complexity of buildings.
    Large buildings are more likely to incorporate independent fire systems, which are prone
    to stagnation and the development of biofilms. Although they are generally supplied
    with mains water, these systems need to be kept independent through the installation of
    backflow-prevention devices. Ideally, fire systems should have a separate connection to
    the external mains water system.
    The use of recycled water in large buildings is increasing; for example, greywater for
    toilet flushing (e.g. in environmentally friendly buildings). Recycled-water pipework and
    any accessible outlets should be marked to indicate that the water is not suitable for
    drinking. Where recycled-water systems are installed, there is a potential to lower flows
    and increase detention times in the drinking-water system due to reduced usage.
    Large buildings are more likely to use evaporative condensers and cooling towers as
    part of air-conditioning systems and boilers to provide heating. Evaporative condensers
    and cooling towers can be sources of harmful microorganisms such as Legionella,
    while hazardous chemicals can be used to treat or condition boilers (e.g. nitrates and
    metaborate).
    Particular types of large buildings include the following:
    • Educational facilities. Schools, colleges, technical colleges, further education
      facilities and universities provide drinking-water for typical uses, as well as specialized
      uses in teaching and research laboratories and technical training facilities. Technical
      equipment using water and storages could present sources of hazards. Laboratories
      are also likely to include eye-wash stations and safety showers, which—like fire
      systems—are prone to stagnation and growth of biofilms unless flushed regularly.



                                                                      2 What are the issues?   11
        Water use in educational facilities and associated buildings (residential, sport
        clubrooms, etc.) can be intermittent, with extended periods of stagnation possible,
        particularly during holidays.
     • Hotels. Hotels can include recreational facilities such as swimming pools and hot-
       tub pools, and, in some cases, rooms can be provided with single-use hot-tub baths,
       which can be a source of environmental pathogens. Occupancy of hotels and other
       accommodation facilities can vary markedly depending on seasons; buildings, parts
       of buildings or floors may be closed during “off seasons”. Associated water-using
       devices such as cooling towers and evaporative condensers may also be shut down for
       extended periods.
     • Conference centres. Where accommodation is provided, these centres can include
       similar features to hotels.
     • Apartment blocks (low rise and high rise). Maintenance and management can
       be complicated by individual ownership or leasing of apartments. Risks in shared
       hot- and cold-water systems can be increased where individual apartments are used
       infrequently or remain empty for extended periods, and through connection of PoU
       treatment (e.g. carbon filters) and water-using devices such as washing machines and
       dishwashers, and by other modifications undertaken by tenants and apartment owners.
     • Office blocks. Like apartment blocks, maintenance and management can be
       complicated by multiple ownership or tenancies.
     • Public buildings (e.g. museums, art galleries, theatres and cinema complexes).
       A common concern with these buildings is maintaining hygiene and ensuring that
       drinking-water outlets are kept clean.
     • Shopping centres can include decorative fountains, garden shops and fresh fruit and
       vegetable markets that use misting machines to keep produce fresh. These spray and
       mist devices produce aerosols that can disseminate organisms such as Legionella
       and Mycobacterium spp. if present. Centres can also include speciality shops such as
       hairdressing salons.
     • Factories, manufacturing industries and production centres. These buildings can
       include storages of liquid chemicals and distribution systems that circulate water used
       for cooling or liquid coolants. Industrial buildings can include devices for worker
       safety, such as eye-wash stations and safety showers.
     • Transport terminals. Transferring water at terminals to aeroplanes, ships, trains or
       buses needs to be managed to ensure that water safety is maintained. Specific guidance
       for aeroplanes and ships is provided in the WHO Guide to hygiene and sanitation in
       aviation (WHO, 2009) and the WHO Guide to ship sanitation (WHO, 2010). The
       hygiene and safety principles described in these guides should also be applied for
       trains and buses.


     2.5.2      Hospitals
     Hospitals can be very large buildings or complexes with extensive water systems. Due
     to the vulnerability of some patients, hospitals are more likely to provide additional
     treatment at the point of entry of external piped supplies. Common forms of treatment
     include filtration, disinfection, softeners and deionizers. Treatment is also likely where


12   Water safety in buildings
hospitals use private water supplies (e.g. wells, bores). These processes can represent
sources of treatment chemicals (e.g. membrane de-scalants, coagulants, disinfectants and
disinfection by-products). Wards and rooms are not always occupied continuously. This
can provide intermittent flows or stagnation in water systems.
Drinking-water should be suitable for human consumption and for all usual domestic
purposes, including personal hygiene for most patients. However, it may not be suitable
for all patients or uses in a hospital, and further processing or treatment or other
safeguards may be required. Patients in intensive or critical care facilities, including
cancer wards, transplant wards and renal wards, can be immunocompromised and at
increased risk from waterborne disease through ingestion, contact or inhalation. In wards
where patients are in protected environments with filtered air and modified diets, equal
attention needs to be paid to drinking-water, beverages and ice. There are many examples
of legionellosis being recorded in hospitals (Bartram et al., 2007). Inhalation of aerosols
from showers, hot- and cold-water outlets, nebulizers and humidifiers has been identified
as a route of transmission, while aspiration from ice has been associated with infection of
immunocompromised patients or those with significant respiratory impairments (WHO,
2007).
Drinking-water can contain a range of microorganisms that represent little concern through
water consumption by most patients. However, some organisms (e.g. Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aspergillus) can cause severe infections in those who are
immunosuppressed or immunocompromised. They can also cause infections if present
in water used to wash or irrigate wounds and burns; to wash medical devices, such as
endoscopes and catheters; or in devices such as nebulizers and humidifiers. Water used
for such purposes needs to be of a higher quality than described in the GDWQ (WHO,
2008) and may require additional processing, such as microfiltration, disinfection or
sterilization, depending on use.
Renal dialysis requires large volumes of water that exceed the chemical and microbial
quality requirements for drinking-water. Water used for dialysis requires special
processing to minimize the presence of microbial and chemical hazards, including
residual disinfectants.
Hot-water distribution systems may be maintained at lower temperatures (warm water)
or have thermostatic mixing valves installed before outlets to reduce the risk of scalding
(typically 41–45 °C). Warm-water systems or pipework downstream of mixing valves
can provide environments for growth of environmental pathogens.
Hospitals may operate hydrotherapy pools as part of treatment regimes and include ice
machines and drinking-water fountains.

2.5.3    Other medical and health facilities
Medical and health facilities include medical clinics, health centres, doctors’ surgeries
and dental surgeries. As in hospitals, risks can be elevated in these facilities due to the
types of exposures involved and the potential vulnerabilities of some patients
Water of appropriate quality should be used in medical and dental equipment and
procedures (e.g. washing and irrigation of wounds and burns). For example, dental chairs
often include water systems that deliver water to high-speed equipment, de-scalers and
rinsing sprays. These sprays can be inhaled and aspirated by patients. Dental water lines


                                                                 2 What are the issues?   13
     can become colonized with bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Most of these organisms are
     of limited significance, but pathogenic species, including Legionella, Pseudomonas
     aeruginosa and Mycobacterium spp., have been detected (Sehulster et al., 2004).

     2.5.4      Aged-care facilities and retirement homes
     Aged-care facilities and retirement homes house elderly people who can be more
     susceptible to waterborne disease. In some cases, residents will have underlying illnesses
     that increase this susceptibility.
     Like hospitals, water systems can be extensive and supply water to wards and rooms
     that are not always occupied. Hot-water distribution systems may be maintained at lower
     temperatures or have thermostatic mixing valves installed to reduce the risk of scalding.
     2.5.5      Child-care facilities
     Child-care facilities can cater for very young children who can be more susceptible to
     disease. Children’s hygiene is not always well developed, and attention needs to be paid
     to keeping water outlets and toilets clean (Adams et al., 2009). Young children are also
     more susceptible to contaminants such as lead (WHO, 2008). Corrosion and leaching of
     metals such as lead can be exacerbated by intermittent water use, with stagnation over
     weekends and during holidays.
     Hot-water distribution systems may be maintained at lower temperatures or have
     thermostatic mixing valves installed to reduce the risk of scalding.

     2.5.6      Small hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, farmstays and campsites
     Hotels, motels and bed-and-breakfasts provide water for drinking and bathing for guests
     and may use drinking-water supplies in water-using devices, such as swimming pools
     and hot-tub pools. In some cases, rooms can be provided with single-use hot-tub baths.
     Some facilities may have private water supplies that can be potential sources of microbial
     and chemical hazards.
     Campsites can include permanent buildings providing shared facilities (e.g. for cooking,
     bathing). In some cases, separate non-drinking-water supplies may be provided for
     bathing. These need to be appropriately marked using words as well as symbols, noting
     that the water is not suitable for drinking.
     Like hotels, these accommodation facilities can be subject to seasonal use.

     2.5.7      Sporting facilities and health centres
     Sporting facilities and health centres can include sports grounds, stadiums, leisure centres,
     swimming pools, ice rinks, health clubs and fitness centres. These facilities can include
     swimming pools or hot-tub pools.
     Swimming pools have been associated with outbreaks of illnesses such as
     cryptosporidiosis, and hot-tub pools with legionellosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis
     (from mycobacteria). Indoor pools can generate elevated levels of chloramines and
     other disinfection by-products, which can lead to eye, nasal and respiratory irritation.
     Disinfection byproducts at indoor pool centres could be associated with asthma in
     children (Weisel et al., 2009).



14   Water safety in buildings
At large sporting clubs, immersion pools and communal pools are used to assist recovery
of competitors.

2.5.8    Garden centres and conservatories
Garden centres, greenhouses and conservatories typically use irrigation systems to water
plants. In large centres, these irrigation systems can include storage tanks and sumps.
Often, irrigation pipes include materials that are not suitable for contact with drinking-
water.
Irrigation systems typically use spray and mist devices to produce aerosols, which can
disseminate organisms such as environmental pathogens, if they are present. Water
features and hot-tub pools on display in garden features may also generate aerosols. In
warm environments (especially those exposed to sunlight), water in the irrigation pipes
and hoses of these systems can heat up and cause microbial growth.

2.5.9    Detention centres, prisons and military barracks
These buildings can house large numbers of people in relatively confined spaces. Bathing
and sanitary facilities are typically shared by groups of people, and breakdown in hygiene
can be a source of microbial hazards. Due to the numbers of occupants in close proximity,
the secondary spread of disease is likely.

2.5.10   Other buildings
Other buildings include restaurants, fast-food outlets, cafes, veterinary surgeries,
ambulance and fire stations, beauty salons and hairdressers. Each type of building can
include specific uses of water requiring appropriate management.




                                                                2 What are the issues?   15
3 Roles and responsibilities

   This section describes the roles of stakeholders and other responsible personnel to ensure
   that the water supply is safe. Many people are involved in water safety, from the initial
   water planners to ongoing operation and maintenance providers, and their range of duties
   is illustrated in this section.

3.1 Background

   A large number of stakeholders can influence the safety of water systems within buildings.
   These stakeholders can be involved in the planning, design, construction and renovation
   of buildings, as well as development of water safety plans (WSPs), and the ongoing
   maintenance and operation of water systems. The specific titles of stakeholders and
   divisions of responsibilities will vary between different countries and jurisdictions, but
   the broad range of tasks will remain fairly consistent. Figures 3.1–3.3 (at the end of this
   section) provide examples of roles and responsibilities in one jurisdiction.
   Stakeholders can include:
   • building commissioners who are involved before construction of new buildings or
     renovation of existing buildings, such as developers, planning officers, architects,
     design engineers, builders, plumbers, manufacturers and suppliers;
   • building operators, including building managers and owners, tenants and employers;
   • employees, residents and users of buildings;
   • service providers and specialist consultants who provide technical assistance, such as
     plumbers, maintenance contractors, water-treatment specialists, risk assessors and
     auditors;
   • professional bodies who develop guidance and training;
   • infection-control personnel in dental and medical facilities, and infection-control
     teams in hospitals and health-care facilities;
   • regulators responsible for oversight of building and plumbing codes, public health
     requirements and occupational health and safety;
   • public health and environmental health officials;
   • standard-setting bodies and certification agencies;
   • training providers;
   • providers of laboratory services.




                                                                                            17
3.2 Building commissioners
     A range of stakeholders can be involved in the design, construction and modification of
     buildings, including the installation of water systems. All stakeholders should be aware of
     relevant regulations, codes and standards and should implement requirements that apply
     to the building being commissioned. Many countries have codes and design standards
     that apply to water systems and devices, including cold- and hot-water systems, cooling
     towers, ice machines, swimming pools and hot tubs. In some cases, requirements are
     incorporated within building and plumbing codes, while in others codes and standards
     have been issued for specific components such as cooling towers. For further discussion,
     see section 4. Most countries have building and plumbing codes that include accreditation
     and approval requirements. However, these codes may not provide sufficient detail for
     the design of complex systems (e.g. direction on calculation of hot-water return-pipe
     capacities). Specific requirements for preventing the growth of microorganisms (notably
     avoiding long periods of stagnation of tepid water) may also not be included in these
     codes. Separate legislation and standards may apply to specific components of water
     systems (e.g. water-cooling devices, swimming pools, hot-tub pools). Where codes and
     standards do not provide sufficient detail, expert advice will need to be sought.
     It is essential that those involved in design, construction and modification of buildings
     document their actions and ensure that final plans and specifications are provided to
     building owners and managers.

     3.2.1      Developers
     Developers are ultimately responsible for oversight of the entire process of construction
     and installation. This includes ensuring that appropriate design requirements and
     standards are applied.
     Where buildings are intended for specific purposes (e.g. health facilities), particular
     requirements associated with the use should be determined through consultation with the
     user and from relevant legislation such as building codes and plumbing codes. Developers
     engage the architects, design engineers, builders, plumbers and others who design and
     construct buildings. Selected professionals and contractors should be familiar with the
     requirements associated with the intended use.

     3.2.2      Planning officers
     Planning officers can play a role relating to appropriate design of buildings and design
     and installation of water systems. Planners need to be aware of requirements relating to
     water systems. It is good practice for planning or development applications to be referred
     to health agencies for assessment of potential public health risks before approval is issued.

     3.2.3      Architects
     Architects are responsible for the overall design of buildings and need to have an
     understanding of the operation of, and requirements associated with, water supplies and
     devices that use water such as cooling towers. Good design can prevent or reduce many of
     the risks that can arise in water systems within buildings. Architects work in partnership
     with design engineers and other professionals who are responsible for construction details.




18   Water safety in buildings
Designs need to take into account requirements associated with specific uses, such as:
• residential health care
• hospitals
• dental surgeries
• medical surgeries
• renal dialysis clinics
• schools
• food retailers
•   hotels and guest accommodation (including specialist accommodation such as ski
    stations).

In the case of renovation or modification of existing and occupied facilities, architects
should consult with users of the building. The extent of consultation will be influenced by
the complexity of the project; however, it should include all those involved in management
and maintenance of water systems. In the case of hospitals and health-care facilities, it
should involve consultation with infection-control specialists.

3.2.4    Engineers
Design engineers are responsible for translating the architectural plans into building
designs, taking into account structural integrity and ensuring compliance with building
and plumbing standards. Project and construction engineers are responsible for
completion of buildings, including installation of water systems. When buildings are
being renovated, or existing structures are being modified, engineers provide a key role
in establishing risk-management plans to minimize risks to people currently using the
building. These risk-management plans should include instructions on how to deal with
potential problems and disruptions to services, and they should ensure that technical
standards and regulations are met. Risk-management plans should include education of
maintenance and construction workers. Project engineers are typically responsible for
final certification of satisfactory completion of building construction.

3.2.5    Plumbers
Protection of water quality and proper operation of water systems rely on plumbers.
Plumbers should be appropriately qualified and have the competence and knowledge to
design, install and maintain plumbing systems. Plumbers play a key role in managing
risks by ensuring compliance with applicable standards and codes. In addition, plumbers
and other plumbing professionals can play an important role in water conservation.
Well-designed plumbing systems are necessary to ensure that the installations are
efficient, safe and appropriate for the different circumstances they serve. The design of a
good plumbing service must be based on an understanding of the technical requirements
and relevant regulatory restrictions. Where industry-based risk-management strategies
and procedures have been established, they should be applied.
Plumbers have to ensure that water systems are intact and that intrusion of microbial
and chemical contaminants is minimized. Unintended or unprotected cross-connections


                                                             3 Roles and responsibilities   19
     should be prevented, and backflow-prevention devices should be installed where
     necessary. Only approved materials and devices should be used or installed.
     Plumbing systems have to comply with building plans. All work has to be documented,
     and installations and modifications need to be included within building plans.

     3.2.6      Manufacturers and suppliers
     Anyone involved in the manufacture and supply of water systems components, and
     specialized equipment and devices (e.g. cooling towers, washing machines, water-using
     medical devices) should ensure that they are designed and constructed so that they are
     safe when used for their designated purpose. Components and devices should be designed,
     constructed and installed in compliance with existing codes and design standards. Systems
     need to be constructed from materials that are appropriate for the function of the water
     system and device. In addition, systems should be designed to enable ease of operation,
     cleaning, inspection and maintenance. Training should be provided to people who operate
     devices, where appropriate.

3.3 Building operators
     Building operation and management can be undertaken by a range of different
     stakeholders, with specific responsibilities influenced by ownership and tenancy
     agreements. Legislative requirements may also assign responsibilities to specific parties.
     Requirements will generally include responsibilities relating to protecting the health and
     safety of residents and users of buildings. Employers have a specific duty to protect the
     health and safety of employees.
     Building operation can be the responsibility of a building owner, leasing agency, building
     manager, tenants, employers or combinations of these parties. In some cases, building
     owners maintain control over infrastructure including water systems, but in other cases
     this task might be undertaken by a leasing or building management agency. Alternatively,
     occupiers and tenants may install and manage water devices. Regulations and codes of
     practice often identify responsibilities for a number of parties. For example, the Victorian
     Government (in Australia) has published Legionnaires’ disease: managing the health
     risk associated with cooling tower and warm water systems (the Health Legionella
     Regulations) (Vic DHS, 2001), which identifies responsibilities for:
     • owners of land to register certain types of water devices and to take all reasonable
       steps to ensure that a risk-management plan is prepared, reviewed and audited on an
       annual basis;
     • owners or tenants of buildings to prevent conditions that may represent a risk to public
       health;
     • owners, managers or controllers of water devices to undertake appropriate levels of
       maintenance;
     • employers to maintain a safe workplace.

     In other jurisdictions, assignment of responsibilities may be different, but the tasks
     remain generally consistent. The tasks and individual responsibilities should be described
     in a WSP. Whoever takes the lead role in building management needs to be responsible



20   Water safety in buildings
    for the design and implementation of the WSP, including ensuring completion and
    documentation of tasks assigned to competent employees or to specialist contractors.
    Competence should be supported by training. Owners, managers or employers should
    ensure that those who are assigned to undertake specific tasks have appropriate levels
    of training. Additional training should be provided where required. In some countries,
    certification programmes have been established to provide evidence of training. Where
    such programmes have been established, owners, managers or employers should ensure
    that work is undertaken by employees or contractors with relevant certificates.
    Building managers and employers need to communicate with residents, users of buildings
    and employees in relation to:
    • potential risks associated with water systems;
    • management plans developed for these systems;
    • notification and information relating to any incidents that give rise to potential
      or perceived risks to public health; they should also report such incidents to the
      appropriate regulatory agencies.


3.4 Employees, residents and users of buildings
    Employees, residents and users of buildings are often the first to detect change or faults
    in water systems. These could be detected due to changes in temperature, appearance,
    odour or taste of water; reduced flow; or leaks. Reporting of changes and faults should
    be encouraged, and mechanisms should be established to support reporting. Feedback
    should be provided on the outcome of investigations and any remedial action.
    Employees and residents have responsibilities to operate and use water systems as
    intended and not to introduce modifications. For example, point-of-use devices should
    not be installed without permission from building managers. Devices and controls such
    as thermostats should not be altered without permission. This should be reinforced with
    education and communication from building managers.

3.5 Service providers and specialist consultants
    Building operators may use service providers and consultants as sources of specialist skills
    that are not available within their own organization. Service providers and contractors can
    be used to undertake a wide range of services associated with water systems, including:
    • installation of water-treatment devices and plumbing fittings
    • routine and emergency maintenance
    • risk assessments and development of WSPs
    • audits.

    Building operators should only engage providers who can demonstrate competence and
    compliance with relevant formal requirements (e.g. certification).
    Service providers need to be able to demonstrate competence in undertaking tasks for
    which they contract. In some cases, certification programmes have been established.



                                                                 3 Roles and responsibilities   21
     In other cases, levels of service or training may be specified by industry associations.
     Service providers need to be able to provide evidence of compliance with established
     programmes and, where available, certification.
     Service providers should provide evidence in the form of formal reports or certificates of
     completion to demonstrate that tasks have been completed in accord with requirements.

     3.5.1      Risk assessors
     Risk assessors need to have the expertise, knowledge and resources to undertake the task
     competently. Risk assessors should have expertise in:
     • public health aspects of water quality;
     • local legislative requirements, standards and codes of practice;
     • development of WSPs;
     • water systems in buildings, including water-using devices and equipment;
     • identification of hazards and potential sources of these hazards;
     • determination of risk;
     • identification and assessment of appropriate control measures;
     • operational monitoring procedures to ensure that the control measures remain
       effective;
     • verification procedures.

     In large buildings with complex water systems (e.g. hospitals), more than one risk
     assessor may be required to deal with the piped systems and the broad range of connected
     equipment and devices. Risk assessors need to comply with formal requirements, including
     certification and approval conditions established by regulatory agencies. If unacceptable
     risks are identified, they should be reported immediately to whoever commissioned the
     assessment. If a serious and potentially immediate risk to public health is identified,
     notification of the regulatory authority will be required.

     3.5.2      Independent auditors
     Some jurisdictions use and certify independent auditors to determine the effectiveness
     of WSPs and compliance with occupational health and safety requirements. Levels
     of knowledge and expertise, as well as the need to comply with formal requirements,
     are similar to those described for risk assessors. Auditors should also have expertise in
     assessing documentation and reporting mechanisms. Auditors may be required to submit
     reports of their findings to the regulatory agency.




22   Water safety in buildings
3.6 Professional bodies
    Professional bodies (e.g. for dentists, medical practitioners, hospital engineers, nurses)
    can perform a number of functions, including:
    • developing and advocacating for policies and codes of practice relating to water
      systems;
    • establishing practical guidelines to support implementation of WSPs;
    • training for members and their employees;
    • identifying practical issues associated with implementation;
    • providing mechanisms for gathering information relating to incidence of infection
      that may be related to water systems;
    • reporting notifiable diseases and unusual or elevated incidence of disease to public
      health agencies;
    • providing mechanisms for gathering information on successful management
      approaches.


3.7 Infection control

    3.7.1    Infection-control coordinators
    In small health facilities, clinics or surgeries, infection-control coordinators should be
    appointed to manage established control programmes. The coordinator could be the head
    of the facility or an employee trained for the task. The head of the facility is responsible
    for establishing the programme, ensuring that it is implemented, and ensuring that the
    coordinator has (or receives) appropriate training.

    3.7.2    Infection-control teams
    Hospitals and other health-care centres use infection-control committees and teams to
    prevent nosocomial infections, including those arising from water systems. The committees
    should include representatives from all relevant sections, including management, nursing,
    physicians, hospital engineers, microbiology, maintenance, cleaning and sterilization
    services, housekeeping and supply. These teams should contribute to ensuring that water
    systems are well managed, as follows:
    • Management is responsible for establishing and supporting the infection-control
      team, and should ensure that staff have sufficient understanding of water systems and
      water-using devices within the building. Management should ensure that a WSP has
      been developed and implemented by appropriate staff.
    • Nursing staff should be aware of the correct operation of relevant water-using devices
      and equipment and how this equipment should be cleaned and disinfected.
    • Maintenance and hospital engineers are responsible for implementing WSPs, including
      operational monitoring; for example, monitoring temperatures in cold- and hot-water
      systems, monitoring disinfection residuals in water systems, and monitoring water-
      using devices such as hydrotherapy pools. They are also responsible for maintaining
      water systems and devices to ensure that they function as required at all times.


                                                                 3 Roles and responsibilities   23
     • Physicians are responsible for ensuring safe use of water systems, water-using devices
       and equipment. Physicians should consider the potential contribution of water systems
       to nosocomial infections.
     • Microbiologists are responsible for monitoring cleaning, disinfection and sterilization,
       where appropriate, of water-using devices and equipment. They should be aware of
       appropriate procedures for collecting environmental samples.

     Infection-control teams should contribute to internal reviews of WSPs. This should
     include periodic review of potentially waterborne nosocomial infections as an assessment
     of effectiveness of the plan. One approach could be to establish a subgroup with primary
     responsibility for water management. This subgroup should work with, and report to, the
     full team.

3.8 Regulators
     A number of activities and requirements are subject to regulation. These include compliance
     with building and plumbing codes; occupational health and safety requirements; and
     codes applying to operation of devices, such as water-cooled air-conditioning plants,
     swimming pools and hot-tub pools. Implementation of these regulations may be
     administered by different agencies, including those with responsibilities for public health,
     environmental health and occupational health and safety. It is important that there is a
     shared understanding of agency responsibilities and the functions of different regulations
     to maintain consistency of purpose.
     In some countries, the “regulator” may not be an institutional body but a public officer
     from an agency or authority (e.g. government agency, local health authority). The
     regulator will have the responsibility for dealing with specific technical issues covered
     by regulations. The regulator may operate through multilateral committees and expert
     consultants.

     3.8.1      Public health agencies
     Public health agencies are responsible for ensuring that public health standards are
     maintained. They may act in a number of areas, including surveillance and auditing of
     water systems; they may also help to set standards and codes, detect and investigate
     disease, and monitor disease trends. Public health agencies are responsible for ensuring
     compliance with regulations designed to protect public health, and that the actions
     required by regulations or by codes of practice are followed. This can include regulations
     and codes applying to specific devices, such as water-cooled air-conditioning plants,
     swimming pools and hot-tub pools. Required actions can include development of WSPs.
     In the event of known or suspected disease outbreaks, public health officials are
     responsible for inspecting buildings, auditing WSPs and collecting water samples.
     Public health officers are also responsible for issuing directions relating to remedial
     action, and issuing public notifications where required.




24   Water safety in buildings
Disease surveillance

The role of public health agencies normally includes detecting and investigating disease,
and monitoring disease trends (for more information, see section 5.2) Public health
authorities need to establish criteria that would initiate an investigation and procedures
on how such investigations will be performed. This should include procedures for
identifying and confirming potential sources of disease. In the case of investigations
involving illnesses associated with buildings, public health agencies should work with
owners, managers and users of buildings. Advice and warnings may need to be issued to
occupants and employees of buildings, as well as the general public. This should be done
in a timely manner to reduce or contain public health impacts, and to provide appropriate
information about the level of risk, responses and triggers for seeking medical attention.
Monitoring of disease trends can provide evidence of the need to improve management of
water systems. Once a new strategy has been implemented, information on disease trends
can provide evidence of the strategy’s impact.
Public health agencies should establish networks with professional bodies to help detect
disease, and to disseminate public health information.

3.8.2    Surveillance of water supplies
Independent surveillance of water supplies is an important element of quality assurance.
Surveillance of water systems in buildings will include features similar to those applied to
drinking-water supplies, but may also incorporate additional elements to deal with specific
uses of the water, with water-using devices such as cooling towers, and with occupational
health and safety needs. The resulting surveillance programmes may include a range of
activities and agencies. For example, there could be specific surveillance programmes for
cooling towers, swimming pools and other devices. Specific surveillance programmes
could also involve agencies responsible for public health and for occupational health and
safety.
The role of different agencies and the requirements for specific surveillance programmes
should be identified and coordinated to avoid unnecessary duplication, and to ensure that
appropriate levels of surveillance are applied to all parts of water systems in buildings.
In some cases, surveillance could be performed by third parties such as contractors or
registered auditors under programmes directed by regulators. Such programmes should
include mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of the third-party audits.
Surveillance and auditing should include processes for approving WSPs, as well as
processes for verifying that WSPs are being implemented appropriately and protect
public health effectively.

3.8.3    Occupational health and safety agencies
Occupational health and safety regulations can be administered by specific departments
or agencies within government. In some jurisdictions, these regulations are the primary
legislative mechanism applied to water-using devices (e.g. cooling towers, evaporative
condensers), while in others they support or supplement public health legislation.




                                                              3 Roles and responsibilities   25
          Administration of occupational health and safety requirements should be coordinated
          with other functions and regulations designed to protect public health from water
          systems. Administration may include either random or routine inspections of workplaces,
          and occupational health and safety inspectors should be aware of other requirements
          developed to control risks associated with water systems.

     3.9 Standard-setting and certification bodies
          Devices and materials used in water systems need to meet quality requirements and
          comply with applicable standards and codes of practice. Some countries have established
          standard-setting bodies and certification systems to provide assurance that, when used
          in accord with design specifications, devices and materials will perform as required and
          be safe. Standards can apply to the design, installation, maintenance and operation of
          devices such as cooling towers and evaporative condensers, swimming pools, hot-tub
          pools, hot-water systems and plumbing devices. Standards can also apply to materials
          used in plumbing systems, including pipework. Material standards can deal with physical
          attributes, and ensure that products do not give rise to unacceptable contamination of
          water or support microbial growth. Standards should include criteria for achieving and
          measuring compliance.
          Certification is used to confirm that devices and materials used in water systems
          meet standards or alternative criteria. Certification can be undertaken by government
          agencies or private organizations. Certification agencies may assess data and information
          provided by manufacturers, undertake specific testing, or conduct inspections and audits.
          Certification may be issued subject to application of defined conditions. These conditions
          could identify specific applications and uses of certified products (e.g. where devices can
          and cannot be used).
          Standards are typically developed in cooperation with manufacturers, technical experts,
          regulatory agencies, certifying agencies and consumers. Public health agencies should
          participate in developing or approving parts of standards that are intended to protect
          public health.
          Standards can:
          • represent technical provisions and norms to be adopted on a voluntary basis as good
            practice;
          • be adopted as requirements by government or local government authorities;
          • be adopted by reference in regulations.

          Standard setting and certification also applies to sample collection and laboratory analysis.
          Samples need to be collected, stored and transported using established procedures and
          appropriate equipment (e.g. correctly prepared sample bottles). Similarly, laboratories
          need to be competent to perform the tests that they undertake. This includes using suitable
          methods, appropriate testing equipment, and qualified and capable personnel. Some
          countries have established standards supported by certification and accreditation systems
          for laboratory services.




26     Water safety in buildings
3.10 Training providers
    Design, installation and management of water systems can involve a range of personnel,
    all of whom must be competent to undertake assigned or required tasks. Training providers
    can provide courses to support competence. In some cases, course work can be combined
    with supervised “on-the-job” training. Training should be consistent with existing
    regulations, standards, codes of practice and requirements of regulatory authorities.
    Training can be provided by water companies, professional associations (e.g. builders,
    plumbers, engineers, environmental health institutes, dental and medical associations)
    and specialist technical colleges and institutes. In some countries, training programmes
    are subject to certification and accreditation programmes. Training providers should
    ensure that they comply with the requirements of such programmes.
    Training providers should regularly review the content of their courses. They should also
    consult with regulators and those seeking training to ensure that their needs are being met.
    The aim of training programmes is to produce personnel with sufficient expertise and
    training to undertake specific tasks. However, measuring the level of competence can
    sometimes be challenging. Measuring competence is easier when tailor-made courses and
    certification programmes are available—and many countries have accreditation systems
    for professional and technical personnel. In some cases, requirements for accredited
    operators can be included in regulations.
    Measuring competence is difficult when competence is based on degree of experience.
    A flexible approach to measuring may be needed, while ensuring that tasks are only
    performed by people who have sufficient expertise and knowledge. Codes and legislation
    that include reference to “competent persons” need to identify criteria for establishing
    competence, including qualifications, training requirements and relevant experience.
    Figures 3.1–3.3 show an example of the roles and responsibilities of people involved in
    water safety.

4 Water safety plans

   This section describes, in more detail, water safety plans (WSPs), including the steps
   required to set one up, and how the key principles can be applied to buildings. Information
   is also provided on how to organize a WSP team, and what actions to take if a water
   supply becomes contaminated.
   This section also explains risk assessments, control measures, operational monitoring
   and management procedures. Information that should be considered when designing and
   constructing new installation systems is also provided.

4.1 Background
   The continuous delivery of safe water requires effective management and operation
   throughout the water-supply chain, from catchments to consumer taps and points of
   use. The Guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) (WHO, 2008) indicate that
   this is most effectively achieved through the Framework for safe drinking-water, which
   encompasses the following elements:
   • establishing health-based targets as “benchmarks” for defining safety of drinking-
     water;
   • assuring safety by developing and implementing a WSP to systematically assess and
     manage risks;
   • establishing a system of independent surveillance to verify that WSPs work effectively
     and are capable of consistently delivering water that meets the health-based targets.

   WSPs provide a preventive risk-management approach that builds on other risk-
   management and quality-assurance principles. They systemize long-established principles
   and good practices in drinking-water supply, covering both water quality and quantity
   management issues. These principles also apply to management and use of water-using
   devices and equipment. WSPs for buildings should address drinking-water networks and
   consider connected devices and equipment.
   The development and implementation of WSPs can be the responsibility of various
   stakeholders: while WSPs for water treatment and distribution of public water supplies
   are typically the responsibility of the supplier, WSPs for buildings are the responsibility
   of building owners or managers, with support from various other stakeholders, as
   discussed in section 3. The level of detail and complexity of WSPs will depend on the
   size and nature of the building, including the level of risks posed by the installation, and
   on the population exposed to the water system inside the building. Nevertheless, the
   implementation of well-designed WSPs is recognized as the most effective tool to ensure
   provision of safe water supplies.
   Development of WSPs should not be considered as overwhelming or too complicated.
   The aim is straightforward: to ensure consistent supply of safe water to consumers. To a
   large extent, WSPs document established good practice, and the most important step is
   getting started.

4.2 Key principles of WSPs
     WSPs are typically developed after the supply system has been designed and constructed.
     However, where possible, new or renovated systems should be designed and constructed
     in a way that supports implementation of WSPs. This should include identifying
     potential hazards, incorporating appropriate control measures (e.g. treatment processes)
     and considering practical aspects (e.g. ease of access for maintenance, inspection and
     monitoring).
     Irrespective of when they are developed, WSPs should be working documents that are
     kept up to date and reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain current. WSPs should
     be reviewed if there are major changes to water supplies and uses.
     The mechanisms by which WSPs are developed and applied can vary. In some cases,
     tasks associated with implementation could be undertaken by an owner, manager or
     employer. However, they could also be delegated or assigned to competent individuals
     employed within a building, or to specialist contractors. When tasks are either delegated


32   Water safety in buildings
    or contracted, the owner, manager or employer retains the responsibility to ensure that
    those charged with performing designated functions are competent and that required
    tasks identified in the WSP are completed and documented appropriately.

4.3 Assembling a WSP team
    Assembling a team is a core preparatory requirement for the development and
    implementation of a WSP in a building. The team will be in charge of developing
    and implementing the WSP—a role that includes identifying hazards, assessing risks,
    identifying and monitoring control measures, and developing incident protocols.
    A responsible person (or WSP coordinator) needs to be identified to lead the team. This
    person should be either the building manager or a competent person delegated to this task
    by the manager. The WSP coordinator should have (or acquire) a good knowledge of the
    technical facilities in the building, and their daily work should be related to the building.
    Since the coordinator’s primary task is to coordinate the process of WSP development
    and implementation, they should understand the principles associated with development
    and implementation of WSPs. However, a special technical knowledge in drinking-water
    and/or sanitation, while useful, is not necessarily required. The coordinator should have
    the authority to ensure that the WSP is implemented. A building manager is a good choice
    for the WSP coordinator.
    The WSP coordinator needs to form a team of experts who will support WSP development
    and provide access to all relevant information needed. Team members should include the
    range of expertise needed for a thorough analysis of the building’s water system. The
    team should include expertise in design, operation and management of drinking-water
    supplies; engineering; plumbing; and public health risk assessment. The team will include
    employees with relevant specialist expertise, as well as representatives of key users of
    the building water systems. Development of WSPs could also involve consultation with
    specialist contractors.
    Some hazards that may compromise water quality in a building may be obvious to the
    building management; others may be more concealed. Therefore, it is essential that the
    WSP team is able to deal with all possible risks associated with delivering drinking-
    water. Managers of small buildings or facilities with simple water systems may not
    have “in-house” expertise. In this case, the manager or operators of the water system
    should coordinate development of the WSP and use health and water-quality expertise
    from external sources. This could include external agencies (e.g. health, water utilities),
    private consultants, or external specialists to provide expert advice. In some cases, health
    agencies may develop generic plans and guidance that can be applied.

4.4 Describing the water system
    The first step of the WSP team is to compile available information on the design and
    operation of the water-distribution system in the building. This needs to be described
    in a comprehensive plan, starting with the nature and quality of water supplied to the
    building up to points-of-use (taps and outlets) by building occupants, users and visitors.
    The plan should document all components of the building water systems, including point-
    of-entry (PoE) and point-of-use (PoU) treatment, distribution systems (e.g. hot water,
    cold water, firefighting), water-using devices (e.g. swimming pools, cooling towers) and


                                                                        4 Water safety plans   33
     specific water uses. An accurate description of the water system is essential to support
     the identification of hazards, allow risks to be assessed adequately and allow appropriate
     control measures to be identified.

     4.4.1      Functions of water networks inside buildings
     Drinking-water networks inside buildings have important differences from external
     public water-supply networks that need to be considered when analysing potential health
     hazards. In many buildings, at least two different drinking-water networks operate—that
     is, a cold-water and a hot-water system—with the following different design features and
     purposes:
     • Cold-water networks are typically designed to deliver water under satisfactory
       pressure and flow rate at all taps. Parts of the system with large flow rate demands
       will guide the capacity of the network. Cold-water networks may also deliver water to
       fire-protection systems. In some circumstances, additional treatment may be provided
       to supply higher water quality (e.g. in health-care buildings). Cold-water networks
       should be designed to be efficient, with minimal stagnation, and should be insulated
       and separated from hot-water networks to minimize heat gain. They should also be
       protected against corrosion and other damage, to maximize their lifespan.
     • The primary function of hot-water networks is to deliver sufficient quantities of water
       at satisfactory temperatures for its intended use, while limiting energy consumption.
       This may be achieved by storing hot water near PoUs, responding to demand peaks
       for large networks, and installing recirculation loops with short branch pipes to PoU to
       ensure supply of water on demand. Hot-water systems may incorporate temperature-
       reduction devices to reduce scalding. To reduce risks from Legionella, these should be
       placed close to PoUs. Networks should be designed to minimize areas with low flow
       or stagnation. Insulation of the piping system will minimize temperature loss.

     Buildings will also generally include a wastewater network and may include other
     networks for delivering other types of waters (e.g. distilled water, rainwater, water for
     firefighting, greywater, recycled water). All networks need to be identified and labelled
     clearly. Networks of different water quality need to be kept separate and isolated from
     both the cold- and hot-water networks. Where the drinking-water system is intentionally
     connected to a water system, appropriate backflow prevention is needed when delivering
     non-drinking-water (e.g. water for firefighting).

     4.4.2      Usages and water-use patterns
     A good understanding of a water network includes establishing the uses of water
     throughout the building. Where there are multiple supplies of water (e.g. external
     drinking-water, roof rainwater and recycled water), the uses of each type of water should
     be identified.
     Therefore, all water uses (planned and actual) should be established, as well as
     requirements for different user groups in a building. This analysis may be based on a list
     of different possible uses; for example, water for drinking, showering, preparing food,
     washing, cleaning, toilet flushing, technical uses, watering, firefighting or leisure activities.
     Specific uses (e.g. medical, dental) and supply to water-using devices (e.g. cooling towers,
     swimming pools, water coolers, water fountains) should be identified.


34   Water safety in buildings
Different water qualities and uses should be described clearly, using consistent
nomenclature, particularly in buildings with common purposes (e.g. hospitals and health-
care facilities). For example, Table 4.1 provides a description of water used in health-care
facilities in France.
Water usages determine the water volume and flow rates that have to be provided at each
PoU. This understanding, together with a knowledge of system capacities, is important
for identifying the likelihood of low flows and areas of stagnation. Parts of buildings that
have variable or seasonal occupancy rates should be identified.

     4.4.3        Understanding and documenting the design of the water system
     Effective assessment of potential health hazards and risks requires a sound description
     and documentation of the physical structure of the building’s water system (e.g.
     architecture, plumbing, materials, location of installations and equipment, connection to
     water-using devices) and its expected conditions of operation. Construction plans and
     any other available documentation of the building’s infrastructure provide a good basis
     for system description. Drawing high-level, simple flow diagrams will help to capture the
     various elements of the building’s water system, and will help to identify hazards, risks
     and controls.
     The existing documentation and the flow diagram need to be verified by an on-site
     examination to confirm that they are up to date and correct. Water systems in buildings
     are often poorly mapped and not updated after repairs or renovations. The on-site
     examination should follow the delivery of water from PoE to all points of delivery or use
     within the building.
     Elements to be examined and documented include (Figure 4.2):

     •       1   point(s) of entry to the building, including possible PoE treatment;

     •       2   possible building-specific sources of water and associated treatment;

     •       3   water piping, storage systems and connections between drinking- and non-
                 drinking-water systems, including intended connections (e.g. between drinking-
                 water systems and fire systems) and unintended connections (e.g. between
                 drinking-water systems and sewage or recycled-water systems);

     •       4   devices for heating and supplying hot water;

     •       5   hot-water piping systems;

     •       6   equipment installed at PoU (e.g. dishwashers, washing machines, drinking- water
                 fountains);

     •       7   water treatment systems at PoU.

     These elements are explained in more detail below.

         1       Point(s) of entry
     The most common source of drinking-water to buildings is an external piped water supply.
     The PoEs are often marked by a water meter on the property or building boundary. This
     is also the point where ownership and management responsibilities can change to the
     building owner. It is a critical point in terms of providing a basis for defining the physical
     scope of building WSPs. In some cases, buildings may have more than one PoE, and in
     other cases groups of buildings may be supplied through a single offtake and a shared
     meter. There could also be separate points of supply for firefighting. Each PoE should be
     identified, as well as their condition of use (permanent, intermittent, backup) and the way
     they are connected to the inner water system and to other entry points (i.e. whether they
     are interconnected or kept separate).

Figure 4.2       Typical components of water systems inside buildings




Issues that need to be considered include the:
• quality and composition of the delivered water (this needs to be obtained from the
  water supplier);
• continuity and quantity of water supply;
• conditions of accessibility to the PoE;
• presence of a water meter and of backflow-prevention systems to prevent contamination
  of the public network;
• responsibility of the water supplier in assuring water quality within the building;
  for example, it could be a requirement that the public water supply will not corrode
  building plumbing systems;
• treatment systems installed at the PoE (e.g. chlorinators, filters, water softeners,
  deionizers, activated carbon), including selection, storage, use and control of
  chemicals.




                                                                    4 Water safety plans     37
      2         Possible building-specific sources of
                water and associated treatment
     Buildings may use private sources of water or may augment external sources of water
     with building-specific sources, such as rainwater, wells, borewater and springs. If the
     water from the private source is not provided for human consumption (e.g. used for toilet
     flushing), safeguards (e.g. warning signs) must be installed to prevent this water being
     misused as drinking-water or being connected to the drinking-water supply.
     The following questions need to be considered:
     • What is the nature and location of the building-specific source?
     • How is it protected from external pollution?
     • How is it delivered to the building and what are the possibilities for contamination
       (e.g. through faults in pipework, open storage tanks, inappropriate materials in contact
       with water)?
     • What kind of treatment is applied at the PoE?
     • If the building-specific source is not used for drinking, what precautions are taken to
       ensure that the water is not misused or connected with the drinking-water supply?


      3         Water piping, storage systems and cross-
                connections to non-drinking-water systems
     Water piping systems in buildings vary in lengths, complexities, materials and designs.
     The structure of a piping system needs to be established by examining existing plans
     and by an on-site investigation. Plans should always be checked against reality, since
     they are not always updated when networks are upgraded or repaired. However, this can
     be difficult, particularly in large, complex buildings, because pipes are often concealed
     and embedded in walls or ceilings. It is important to catalogue as much of the system as
     possible and to document and retain all plans for future use. In particular, the following
     parts of the system should be identified:
     • water-storage tanks (may be larger where water supplies are intermittent), including
       consideration of size in relation to inflow and usage requirements (total and peak
       flows) within the building, detention and integrity;
     • points of delivery, including fixtures and connections to equipment (e.g. dishwashers,
       washing machines, medical equipment) and water-using devices (e.g. cooling towers,
       swimming pools, water fountains);
     • inadvertent or unintended connections between drinking-water systems and non-
       drinking-water systems (lower or higher quality water);
     • installation of backflow prevention between drinking-water systems and non-drinking-
       water systems (e.g. firefighting systems) and water-using devices;
     • physical separation of cold- and hot-water systems and separation of drinking-water
       systems and non-drinking-water systems;
     • labelling and identification of pipework;
     • thermal insulation of piping systems;



38   Water safety in buildings
• temperatures;
• antisiphonage systems or valves;
• branch pipes and dead legs;
• areas with potential for intermittent or seasonal use;
• materials used in pipes and other components, including compliance with established
  certification or authorization schemes for materials used in contact with drinking-

multipurpose building in Japan.


   Box 4.1      Cryptosporidiosis associated with water shortage
   From 30 August to 10 September 1994, there was an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among
   the people who visited or worked in a multipurpose building in Hitatsuka, Kanagawa
   Prefecture, Japan. The multipurpose building was constructed in 1970, with six storeys
   above the ground and one below. There were 10 restaurants or bars, a dance studio,
   a clothing store, a post office and accommodation for employees in the building. An
   epidemiological survey revealed that 461 out of 736 people investigated complained of
   cholera-like or influenza-like illness. An investigation of the water system in the building
   found that there were two separate systems: one directly connected to the public water
   supply served drinking-water to the first floor, while the other delivered water from the
   second to sixth floors through a storage tank, which was also supplied from the public
   water supply. The storage tank was adjacent to a night-soil tank, wastewater tank and
   artesian springwater tank in the basement. The tanks were concrete and separated by a
   wall with holes to allow connections between the tanks. (This kind of tank design is not
   allowed in new regulations for buildings.) Although the purpose of the holes was not clear,
   they might have helped to discharge excess drinking-water from the storage tank to the
   night-soil or wastewater tanks. Water level in the wastewater tanks was kept below the
   holes by pumping to the public drain.
   The epidemiological survey found that there were patients from every floor except the
   first. Polluted drinking-water was strongly suspected as a source of infection. According
   to the owner of the building, the wastewater pump was broken at the time of the
   outbreak. Several species of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from stool and water
   samples, but they were not considered to be the source of the outbreak. Oocysts of
   Cryptosporidium parvum were identified in 12 (48%) of the 25 stool samples, tap water,
   the storage tank and other tanks. It was concluded that the cause of this outbreak was
   drinking-water contaminated by Cryptosporidium oocysts following accidental malfunction
   of the wastewater drainage system.

      4      Devices for heating and supplying hot water
     The production of hot water is a common feature in buildings. Hot-water production may
     be instantaneous, or based on its storage in hot-water tanks. Buildings may be served
     by single hot-water systems or by multiple systems to supply individual floors, sections
     of buildings or living units. In large systems, hot-water production can be centralized
     in boiler rooms or provided by multiple units. Consideration should be given to the
     temperature of water in storage heaters and the capacity of systems compared with water
     usage.
     Box 4.2 provides a case study of methaemoglobinemia (a disease characterized by a
     higher than normal level of methaemoglobin, which does not bind oxygen, in the blood),
     arising from nitrite-contaminated water.


          Box 4.2       Methaemoglobinemia attributable to nitrite contamination of
                        potable water through boiler fluid additives, New Jersey, 1992
                        and 1996
          Two outbreaks of methaemoglobinemia were reported in 1992 and 1996. In the first
          outbreak, acute onset of illness was reported in 49 children from one school. Onset
          occurred within 45 minutes after lunch. Initial symptoms were blueness of lips and
          fingers, followed by nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and dizziness. Fourteen children
          were hospitalized and treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue. All children
          recovered in 36 hours. In the second incident, six workers reported acute onset of
          blueness of the skin. Two of the workers were treated with supplemental oxygen and
          methylene blue. All recovered within 24 hours.
          An investigation of the first incident found that the children had consumed soup diluted
          with a mixture of hot and cold tapwater. The soup contained 459 mg/L of nitrite, while
          the hot water contained 4–10 mg/L of nitrite. The hot-water boiler had been returned
          to service that morning after earlier servicing using a commercial conditioning fluid
          containing nitrite and sodium metaborate. Investigations found that a backflow-prevention
          valve preventing flow of water from the boiler to the drinking-water system was stuck in
          the open position. In addition, taps for the boiler treatment solution and the hot-water
          coil were in the same area but unlabelled. The water system was flushed, and the school
          discontinued heating water through boiler coils.
          An investigation of the second incident also found that a faulty backflow-prevention valve
          had allowed boiler conditioning fluid to contaminate hot water used to prepare coffee.
          Although the potential for this type of contamination from boilers was recognized with
          a regulatory requirement for backflow-prevention valves, there were no requirements
          for routine inspection, maintenance and replacement of valves. Maintenance of backflow-
          prevention devices used to prevent contamination of drinking-water is essential.




40   Water safety in buildings
 5    Hot-water piping systems
Hot-water systems should be mapped and catalogued in a similar fashion to cold drinking-
water systems. One of the problems associated with hot-water systems is balancing the
need to maintain water temperatures above 50 °C to minimize risks from Legionella,
while minimizing the risk from scalding. This applies particularly in aged-care and child-
care facilities and health-care facilities. Hot-water piping systems can be installed as one
unit at the scale of the entire building, or to serve sections of buildings.
When mapping hot-water systems, the following components and features should be
identified:
• hot-water devices and storage vessels;
• thermal insulation of piping systems and physical separation from cold systems;
• the presence of looped distribution systems (circulating systems);
• temperatures throughout the system, including at most distal points and, in the case of
  looped systems, on point of return to heating devices;
• installation of temperature-control devices to reduce the risk of scalding
  (e.g. thermostatic mixing valves) and distance from these devices to PoU;
• length and numbers of branch pipes and dead legs;
• areas with potential for intermittent or seasonal use;
• materials in pipes and other components;
• access for maintenance or disinfection.


 6    Equipment installed at PoU
Description of systems should identify all equipment using water.
Equipment at PoU varies in type, size and flow rates. Equipment includes sinks, taps,
baths and showers, dishwashers, washing machines, medical devices, sprinkler systems,
drinking-water fountains, decorative fountains and ice machines. All devices should be
identified, together with frequency of use. Installation of backflow prevention should be
recorded.

 7    Water treatment systems at PoU
Treatment may be applied at PoU using devices such as carbon filters, membrane filters,
water softeners, deionizers or ultraviolet disinfection systems. In large buildings, staff
may install PoU devices such as carbon filters without approval. All PoU devices should
be identified. Unauthorized equipment should be removed. Installation of backflow
prevention should be recorded.
Issues to be considered include correct installation and maintenance. For example, filters
need to be replaced regularly. Old carbon filters that have passed their “use-by” dates can
support growth of large concentrations of microorganisms.




                                                                   4 Water safety plans   41
     Existence of standards and regulations that apply to PoU equipment connected to water
     supplies should be determined. Where standards and regulations have been established,
     all equipment should be checked for compliance.
     Box 4.3 provides a case study of a Pseudomonas outbreak in a haematology unit.


        Box 4.3         Resolution of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak in a
                        haematology unit with the use of disposable sterile water filters
        In 2002, a high incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemia was detected in a
        haematology unit in which severely neutropenic patients were admitted. A total of 61
        of 1478 blood cultures were positive for P. aeruginosa, compared with 19 of 824 blood
        cultures performed in 2001.
        In an initial investigation in June 2002, eight water samples were collected from bathrooms
        used by patients, but only one contained P. aeruginosa. However, when the outbreak
        persisted, a further 85 samples were collected. These included 46 samples of water from
        outlets such as taps, showers and water traps, as well as samples of detergent, air, and
        bathroom and toilet surfaces. Twenty-nine of the water samples contained P. aeruginosa,
        while none of the other samples were positive.
        The installation of 0.2 μ membrane filters on taps and water heads significantly reduced
        the incidence of bacteraemia. In 2003 and 2004, P. aeruginosa was detected in 7 of 1445,
        and 11 of 1479 blood cultures, respectively.
        Tapwater has been documented as a potential source of P. aeruginosa infections in hospital
        settings. Additional measures such as point-of-use treatment can reduce the risk of
        infection in high-risk patients.

4.5 Identifying hazards and hazardous events
     In hazard identification, the WSP team is required to assess what could go wrong and
     where hazards and hazardous events could occur. The following sections discuss a range
     of possible generic hazards and hazardous events that may occur in buildings. However,
     it is important that hazards and related events are specifically identified for individual
     buildings under investigation.
     Box 4.4 provides definitions of hazards, hazardous events and risk, in the context of risk
     management.




42   Water safety in buildings
   Box 4.4       Definitions of hazards, hazardous events and risk
   Effective risk management requires the identification of potential hazards and their
   sources, and potential hazardous events, and an assessment of the level of risk presented
   by each. In this context:
    •   a hazard is a biological, chemical, physical or radiological agent that has the potential
        to cause harm;
    •   a hazardous event is an incident or situation that can lead to the presence of a hazard
        (what can happen and how);
    •   risk is the likelihood of identified hazards causing harm in exposed populations in a
        specified time frame, including the magnitude of that harm and/or the consequences.




4.5.1     Microbial hazards

Faecal contaminants

In common with most drinking-water supplies, ingress of enteric pathogens (bacteria,
viruses and protozoa) associated with faecal contamination can be a significant source
of hazards. Faecal contamination can enter through public water supplies provided
to buildings, building-specific water supplies, faults in internal plumbing systems
(e.g. unroofed water-storage tanks, cross-connections with sewage systems or with
recycled-water systems) and poor hygiene at PoU.

Growth of environmental organisms

Water systems in buildings can be prone to environmental microorganism growth,
including potentially pathogenic species and nuisance species, which can cause off-tastes
and odours. Environmental pathogens include Legionella, Mycobacterium spp. and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Water-borne Legionella is strongly associated with buildings,
while Pseudomonas has been identified as a particular concern in health-care settings
(Anaissie et al., 2002; Exner et al., 2005) and water-using devices such as swimming
pools and hot-tub pools (Yoder et al., 2004, 2008a; Djiuban et al., 2006; WHO, 2006a).
In hospitals, a broader range of environmental microorganisms have been identified
as causes of nosocomial infections, including Acinetobacter spp., Aeromonas spp.,
Burkholderia cepacia, Serratia, Klebsiella, Stentrophomonas maltophilia and fungi such
as Aspergillus, Fusarium and Exophilia (Annaisie et al., 2002; Sehulster et al., 2004).
Small invertebrate animals can survive and grow in distribution systems under conditions
that support microbial growth and biofilms (Ainsworth, 2004). These small animals are
not of health concern but can reduce the acceptability of water supplies.

4.5.2     Chemical hazards
Chemicals from environmental and industrial sources, agriculture, water treatment and
materials in contact with water can contaminate building systems. Contamination could be
introduced from external community supplies, building-specific water supplies or distribution
systems within buildings. Chemical quality of all water supplies used in buildings should be
determined. For external supplies, this information should be available from water providers,
while building-specific supplies will require monitoring (WHO, 2008).


                                                                         4 Water safety plans       43
     Chemicals used in water-using devices can also represent hazards, either from back-
     siphonage from the devices or from storages kept within buildings. These chemicals can
     include disinfectants, antiscalants, coolants, heating fuels, oils and other chemicals used
     in boilers.

     Materials

     Chemicals that can be leached from materials used in pipework, solders and associated
     fittings include aluminium, antimony, arsenic, benzo(a)pyrene, bismuth, cadmium, copper,
     iron, lead, nickel, organolead, organotin, selenium, styrene, tin, vinyl chloride and zinc
     (WHO, 2008; Health Canada, 2009). Organic substances can be released from plastic
     pipes and fittings, flexible hoses, glues, adhesives and tank-lining materials (plastic and
     bitumen based). These substances may be direct hazards or may cause indirect problems
     by supporting microbial growth (e.g. from polymeric or elastomeric compounds).
     In addition to potential health impacts, materials can contain chemicals that cause
     aesthetic problems. For example, iron and zinc do not produce health impacts, but rust
     will discolour water, while elevated levels of many metals such as zinc will add a metallic
     taste to water. Users will often assume that discoloured or poorly tasting water is unsafe.
     If the materials are suitable for use in drinking-water systems and corrosion is controlled
     (see section 4.6), the concentrations of hazardous chemicals released into water supplies
     should not represent a health risk. However, hazardous concentrations could be released
     by unsuitable materials. Some countries have established programmes to certify products
     and materials used in drinking-water distribution systems.

     Water-treatment chemicals

     Water treatment is used in some buildings to either improve untreated water supplies or
     to supplement treatment applied by the drinking-water provider. It may also be used to
     produce water of higher quality required for specialist purposes (e.g. renal dialysis or
     manufacturing processes). Common forms of treatment include filtration, disinfection
     and softeners. Water-treatment chemicals, such as disinfectants and coagulants, and
     chemicals used to maintain treatment processes, such as membrane-cleaning agents, can
     represent hazards.
     Annex 2 provides a summary of microbial and chemical hazards that can present a risk to
     building water supplies, including potential outcomes of infection or exposure as well as
     sources of exposure and methods for identification.

4.6 Hazardous events

     4.6.1      Contaminated or intermittent water supply
     The quality or quantity of external sources of piped water supplied to a building may be
     compromised due to intermittent supply, contaminated water or poor condition of the
     distribution system.
     Those responsible for water supplies in buildings should liaise with operators of external
     piped water supplies to review the performance and previous history of the supply. This
     review should consider the quality (including contamination events) and quantity (volume,



44   Water safety in buildings
reliability, frequency and length of interruptions) of the supply. The presence of buffering
storages and alternative sources of water will influence the impact of interruptions to
external supplies.
In cases where information on water quality of external supplies is inadequate, building
managers may need to consider monitoring.

4.6.2    Ingress of contamination

Water sources

Contamination of building water systems can be caused by ingress of hazards into
sources of external or building-specific supplies. Further information is provided in
the supporting texts on protecting groundwater (Schmoll et al., 2006) and the GDWQ
(WHO, 2008). Ingress of microbial and chemical contaminants can be caused by a range
of hazardous events, including contamination of water sources by human and animal
waste, industrial spills and discharges, inadequate treatment, inappropriate storage, pipe
breakages and accidental cross-connections. Water utilities should provide warnings to
building owners and managers when incidents threaten the safety of water delivered to
buildings. Building owners should ensure that mechanisms have been established for
notifications to be received and for appropriate responses to be initiated.

Building systems

Possible events leading to ingress of contamination can be determined by a systematic
review of the system components, taking a “what-can-happen” brainstorming approach.
The input of plumbing specialists, together with water microbiologists, is important
in hazard identification. Any break or disruption to the integrity of drinking-water
distribution systems can lead to ingress of microbial contamination. The likelihood of
contamination events is increased where drinking-water and wastewater networks are
installed in close proximity.

                                                                   4 Water safety plans   45
        Box 4.5         Water quality at rural South African health-care facilities
        Water quality problems at health-care facilities in developing areas are often not only
        the result of on-site microbial deterioration but start with the quality of the water
        supplied to the facility. In South Africa, rural facilities have to rely on boreholes or surface
        water for their source of potable water. The water is often supplied without treatment,
        or after only limited treatment. The quality of the potable water used in health-care
        facilities in rural areas in South Africa is not monitored routinely. During 2006, a small
        study was conducted at 21 clinics in the Limpopo province in the north of South Africa
        to determine the microbial water quality of the drinking-water. Water was tested for
        Escherichia coli. General information on water supply and sanitation issues at the clinics
        was also collected.
        Water availability was one of the most pressing problems experienced by many of the
        clinics. In many cases, this was blamed on inadequate technical support and maintenance.
        A significant percentage of the clinics studied used water that did not comply with South
        African drinking-water standards. This may have been partly due to the variety of sources
        upon which they need to rely, particularly when their primary source fails. A significant
        health risk to users was indicated by positive E. coli counts found in 14 of the 49 samples
        (29%), representing 38% of the clinics. This study highlighted the fact that health-care
        facilities in rural areas often receive water of inadequate microbial water quality, which
        could jeopardize the health of both patients and staff at the clinics.

     Events that can lead to ingress of contamination include the following:
     • Cross-connection of different water qualities (e.g. drinking-water and water of
       other quality) (USEPA, 2002) may not be readily apparent, because differences in
       physical appearance may not be recognized by users. Inadvertent connections may be
       introduced during maintenance and repair.
     • Inadequate backflow prevention on PoU equipment can allow contaminated water or
       chemicals used in the equipment to flow back into and contaminate drinking-water
       systems.
     • Leakage of chemicals or fluids, and cross-connections with chemical storages (e.g.
       heat transporters or corrosion-preventing additives associated with hot-water devices)
       can contaminate drinking-water (USEPA, 2002).
     • Inadequate protection of building storage tanks can lead to contamination from the
       water supply. Similarly, unprotected tanks are at risk of faecal contamination from
       birds and vermin.
     • Water supplies can be deliberately contaminated (Ramsay & Marsh, 1990).
     • Hydrophobic compounds can migrate through plastic piping. Storing or using
       hydrocarbons or solvents close to plastic piping that is porous to hydrophobic
       compounds can contaminate drinking-water. Storing such products in boiler rooms
       can lead to increased migration of organic substances due to elevated temperatures.




46   Water safety in buildings
Box 4.6 provides a case study of poor water-supply management in a health-care facility.


   Box 4.6       Poor management of a hospital water supply
   A hospital in Eastern Europe with 400 beds has two separate water sources of water: an
   intermittent community supply that provides sufficient water, and a shallow on-site bore
   that provides salty water. The community supply is sourced from a well about 5 km from
   the hospital. This community supply is treated using a rudimentary, manually controlled
   chlorination device. The community supply is poorly protected from contamination at
   both the source and during distribution. Supply from the community system is limited
   by the availability of power to the whole system, coupled with inadequate pumping and
   storage capacity at the hospital.
   As a result, the hospital has two internal systems.The first system distributes a mixture of
   water from the community supply and the on-site bore.This water is too salty to drink (it
   is classified as being non-drinkable), and is used for toilet flushing and to supply firefighting
   equipment. The second system delivers drinking-water from the community supply to
   about half the building. There is no labelling to distinguish between the two systems,
   even in rooms that have outlets from both systems. There is no evidence of backflow
   prevention in any parts of the plumbing systems.
   When water is available from the community supply (about twice a day), it is collected
   and stored for later use in bathtubs, buckets and any other available containers. There is
   no hot-water system, no bathing facilities in the hospital, and no hand-washing facilities
   near toilets. Drainage pipes from some sinks are not sealed at the point of entry into
   floors. The plumbing system is prone to freezing, because the central heating system has
   not operated for more than 15 years.
   A number of measures could lead to large improvements. The quality, management and
   constancy of the community supply could be greatly improved, but this is beyond the
   control of the hospital. The most pressing need at the hospital is to ensure that there
   is sufficient pump capacity and storage at the hospital to provide greater security of
   supply of water from the community system. This would allow disconnection of the on-
   site bore and reduce the need to collect water in open containers. Constant pressure
   in the hospital system would also reduce the likelihood of backflows and ingress of
   contaminated water. Sanitation at the hospital could be improved by providing more
   hand-washing facilities, ensuring that toilet facilities are functional and ensuring that
   drainage systems are maintained. The system should be examined for cross-connections,
   and, where necessary, backflow-prevention devices should be installed.
   Alternative sources of water such as deep bores could be investigated.
   Source: Prospal (2010).



4.6.3     Poorly controlled treatment
Installing water-treatment systems should improve water quality, if they are managed
properly. However, potential hazards may arise from:
• lack of validation that treatment systems will be effective;
• incorrect installation (e.g. softening systems should be calibrated so that they do not
  produce water that could be corrosive);
• operation by staff with insufficient training and knowledge;


                                                                            4 Water safety plans       47
     • inadequate monitoring and poor control;
     • insufficient maintenance;
     • inadequate response to equipment failures or poor monitoring results (e.g. inadequate
       disinfectant residuals);
     • excessive doses of treatment chemicals (e.g. disinfectants) and poor control of
       chemicals used in maintenance of treatment processes (e.g. cleaning agents for
       membrane filters).

     Disinfection by-products are likely to increase if disinfection is applied. While excessive
     doses of chlorine should be avoided, it is important that microbial control is maintained.

     4.6.4      Microbial growth and biofilms
     Water supplies in buildings connected to public or external supplies represent end-of-pipe
     systems. As such, they can often provide environments and conditions (e.g. low flows,
     stagnation) that are favourable for microbial growth and biofilm formation.
     Environmental pathogens are often adapted to grow in biofilms, and growth can be greater
     in conditions that support biofilm development. In well-managed systems, biofilms will be
     thin and relatively well contained. Concern arises when these biofilms become too thick
     and start to disseminate throughout the system. Organisms in established biofilms can be
     difficult to remove. Poorly managed building water systems are prone to colonization,
     and biofilms can develop within pipes and on components such as washers, thermostatic
     mixing valves and outlets. Biofilms are extremely difficult to remove from all parts of
     the system once they are established, and they can be resistant to disinfectants, such as
     chlorine. Well-managed disinfection regimes that maintain disinfectant residuals through
     water systems can inactivate potential pathogens released into the aqueous phase, but this
     protection is lost if disinfectant residuals fall below effective levels.
     Factors associated with microbial growth and biofilm formation in cold-water systems
     include:
     • stagnation and low water flows;
     • poor temperature control, which creates conditions supporting microbial growth;
       several environmental pathogens (e.g. Legionella) grow more quickly at body
       temperature (37 °C), and hot and cold water should therefore be kept above 50 °C
       and below 25 °C, respectively (inadequate separation and insulation of cold- and hot-
       water systems can lead to warming of cold water);
     • scaling (because of its impact on hydraulics);
     • scaling and corrosion, which provide rough surfaces that promote development of
       biofilms;
     • suspended matter, which can provide nutrients favouring microbial growth, and create
       deposited sludges that support biofilms;
     • source water that contains a high organic load (i.e. high total organic carbon);




48   Water safety in buildings
• inappropriate materials containing microbial nutrients in contact with water;
• poor maintenance and intermittent use of PoU equipment and devices (e.g. ice
  machines, cooling towers, old carbon filters past their “use-by” date), which can
  support microbial growth (e.g. Listeria, Pseudomonas, Legionella and fungi); for
  example, filters need to be replaced regularly.

The case study in Box 4.7 describes what can happen when a cold-water system fails.


   Box 4.7       Outbreak of legionellosis due to failure in cold-water system
   A hospital in Brandenburg, Germany, with more than 900 beds opened a new building
   and began to move patients from some older wards to the new one. The management of
   the hospital changed with the opening of the new building. Soon after starting operation
   of the new wards, seven patients were diagnosed with legionellosis. Samples had been
   collected from the hot-water distribution system before moving patients and had not
   contained Legionella. As soon as the outbreak was detected, the water distribution
   system was inspected. Use of water from showers and other utilities was restricted,
   filters were installed, and patients were subjected to stricter surveillance.
   At the same time, alterations were made to the water-system operations, particularly the
   disinfection regimes. Details of theses alterations remain unclear due to the simultaneous
   change of management and limited availability of documentation. Afterwards, the system
   was checked again and was considered safe.
   Six months later, another new building was opened, and again patients were moved from
   old wards to the new building. Again, the hot-water distribution was examined before
   the move, with no detection of Legionella. And again, five patients fell ill with legionellosis
   shortly afterwards.
   A more in-depth inspection of the whole water system was conducted, along with
   immediate measures such as installing filters and carrying out disinfection procedures.
   Both new buildings had separate hot-water distribution systems. Both were only sparsely
   contaminated with Legionella. However, both buildings shared the same cold-water
   distribution system, and the temperature in these pipes was shown to be higher than
   allowed by technical standards (25 °C maximum allowed for cold water). Apart from
   insufficient insulation of the cold-water pipes, the hydraulics of the whole system had not
   been optimized, leading to stagnation. There were cross-connections with fire hydrants
   and pipe sizes that were inadequate.
   Corrective measures introduced following the initial response (disinfection and
   installation of filters) comprised installation of regulation valves and recirculation pipes to
   avoid stagnation and heating of cold water. Changes in management had been associated
   with poor documentation associated with planning, construction and modifications.
   Documentation of the water distribution system and disinfection procedures was
   improved. A more detailed risk assessment was performed.
   The two outbreaks following the opening of the biggest new hospital buildings in the
   region drew major public attention, and the new management faced severe criticism. Costs
   for corrective action to avoid closing the hospital (or at least the buildings affected) were
   remarkably high. Two of the twelve patients who were confirmed cases of legionellosis
   died. Legal action was pursued.

     Factors associated with biofilm formation and growth of environmental pathogens in hot-
     water systems include:
     • insufficient heating capacity to cope with demand;
     • poor temperature control, leading to reduction of hot-water temperatures below 50 °C;
       factors can include
        –     poor insulation of hot-water systems
        –     poor design, leading to low flow or stagnant areas (long branch pipes and dead
              ends)
        –     installation of high-volume storage tanks that support stagnation and
              stratification (stratification can lead to lower water temperatures at the bottom of
              storage vessels)
        –     failure to maintain water at sufficiently high temperatures in storage vessels
              (in some cases, temperatures in storage vessels may be reduced in a bid to save
              heating costs or to reduce risks of scalding by cooling the whole hot-water
              system)
        –     insufficient equilibrium of permanent flow in looped systems or insufficient total
              flow rates to feed all parts of the piping system (see Box 4.8)
        –     incorrect positioning or operation of temperature-reduction measures (e.g.
              thermostatic mixing valves); the main fault is locating these devices too far
              away from taps and outlets, creating long lengths of pipework containing warm
              water;
     • corrosion and scaling, resulting in the accumulation of sediments and microorganisms
       at the bottom of storage tanks;
     • inadequate cleaning and maintenance.

   Box 4.8           Legionella hazard due to unbalanced looped hot-water systems
   Looped hot-water networks are designed in such a way that the temperature in the loops
   is maintained because the loops are insulated and a minimum flow rate is maintained in
   each loop. For a given loop, the difference in temperature between the two points where
   it is connected to the main distribution circuit (“departure” and “arrival”) is inversely
   proportional to the flow rate in the loop. For example, in a typical building with six levels,
   a 5 °C temperature difference may be maintained only under the condition that the flow
   rate in the loop is equal to or above 40 litres per hour. Very often, this condition can be
   attained only by specific valves that equilibrate flows among the loops. However, if the
   design or construction of such networks is poor, flows may not be balanced—that is, the
   first loops take the largest part of the flow rate, so that there is not enough flow for the
   last loops. As the figure below shows, this frequent type of fault can directly affect the
   temperature of the last loops, which can then become incubators of Legionella and other
   environmental pathogens at temperatures below 50 °C.

4.6.5         Release of hazards from materials and equipment
Unsuitable materials and equipment used in water systems may release hazardous
substances into drinking-water (Health Canada, 2009). The chemicals could be
contaminants in the materials (see section 4.5.2), be leached during initial use, or be
leached due to elevated corrosion.
Stagnation of water within the building system can increase concentrations of hazardous
chemicals released from materials. Intermittent use of end-of-plumbing fixtures (e.g.
drinking-water coolers in schools) can result in the presence of elevated concentrations
of heavy metals such as copper from copper piping or lead from brass fixtures.

Corrosion and scaling

A wide range of materials can be potential sources of chemicals through corrosion,
including pipes, solders and fittings (Health Canada, 2009). Corrosion of materials in
contact with water is natural and will eventually cause leakages or failures, allowing
ingress of contamination. In addition, the formation of corrosion product layers can
promote microbial growth. The aim is to keep corrosion to a minimum; however, it can
be accelerated by a number of factors, including water quality (particularly pH, chloride
and sulfate, disinfectant concentrations, organic materials), poor material quality, use
of materials that are incompatible with the given water quality, poor installation (poor


                                                                                                                    4 Water safety plans   51
     welding, interconnection of different types of metal piping), water stagnation and
     temperature (Health Canada, 2009). Some waters, particularly those with low levels of
     dissolved minerals, can be corrosive for metal pipes and fittings, including copper, lead
     and brass (which often contains lead). Water utilities should be able to supply information
     on the characteristics of water supplied to buildings, including the likelihood of corrosion.
     Water with high levels of hardness can cause increased scaling. Again, water utilities
     should be a source of information on hardness of incoming water supplies. Hot-water
     devices are particularly susceptible to scaling.
     Scaling can cause energy losses (due to increased pumping and heating costs), resistance
     to disinfection, and premature failure of appliances (e.g. boilers and hot-water systems).

     4.6.6      Specific uses
     Sources of specific hazards can arise from specific uses (e.g. medical, dental), or from
     water-using devices, such as cooling towers, swimming pools, water coolers, water
     fountains or misting systems (e.g. in garden centres and conservatories).
     Hazardous events associated with specific uses include:
     • inadequate backflow prevention, allowing contaminated water or chemicals used in
       water-using devices to flow into drinking-water systems;
     • aerosol formation (from showers, decorative fountains, etc.), providing potential
       exposure to respiratory diseases (e.g. legionellosis, mycobacterial hypersensitivity
       pneumonitis);
     • poor maintenance and intermittent use, providing conditions that support microbial
       growth (e.g. Listeria, Pseudomonas, Legionella and fungi), corrosion (e.g. copper
       leaching from piping in drinking-water coolers) or leaching of chemicals from
       materials (e.g. plasticizer from plastic piping and tubing);
     • inadequate treatment in swimming pools and hot-tub pools, allowing survival of
       enteric pathogens (e.g. Giardia, E. coli 0157, Norovirus) or growth of environmental
       pathogens (e.g. Legionella and Pseudomonas) (Craun et al., 2005; Pond, 2005;
       Sinclair et al., 2009).


     4.6.7      Poor management (intermittent use)
     Water distribution systems require proper management. Where parts of buildings and
     associated plumbing are not used for extended periods (e.g. months), the water system should
     be physically disconnected to avoid stagnation. Stagnant water can support growth of biofilms
     and environmental pathogens, such as Legionella and mycobacteria, and can contain elevated
     concentrations of chemicals released from pipework, such as copper and lead.

     4.6.8      Construction work, renovations and repairs
     If not properly planned and managed, renovation, repairs and modifications to buildings
     and associated water supplies can lead to introduction of microbial and chemical hazards.
     Where water distribution systems are extended, modified or repaired, there will be periods
     when flow is stopped and when pipework is intentionally cut and left open for periods,
     allowing potential ingress of contamination.



52   Water safety in buildings
    Hazardous events that could occur during construction, extension or repairs of systems include:
    • the use of inappropriate materials—this can include using metallic products that are
      incompatible with existing materials in the system, causing corrosion;
    • microbial or chemical contamination during repair or maintenance;
    • accidental cross-connection between systems delivering different water qualities—
      renovation work may highlight deficiencies in labelling of existing pipework, which
      should be rectified;
    • temporary switching to alternative supplies during construction, as well as introduction
      of temporary stagnation, dead legs and blind ends;
    • failure to upgrade heating capacity when hot-water systems are extended;
    • changes to the established equilibrium of operation in terms of hydraulic conditions,
      thermal capacity and corrosion risks; for example, renovating or altering the type
      of system described in Box 4.8 (above) could change performance, and extending
      the system may increase the total pressure too much for regulation valves to
      counterbalance, making equilibrium among loops impossible.

    Extensions and renovations should not be assessed as separate entities from the existing
    system. Modifications can have wide-ranging ramifications on performance of the existing
    system through changing flow patterns, increasing capacity requirements and complexity.
    Renovations leading to change of use (e.g. from a commercial building to an apartment
    block) can be particularly complex and involve substantial changes to water systems and
    water usage. After construction, the existing system and extension should be considered
    as a single “new” system to be reassessed for potential hazardous events. WSPs will need
    to be reviewed and amended following any significant modifications.
    Changes need to be recorded in system descriptions and distribution system maps.

    4.6.9     Emergencies leading to contamination of external supplies
    Major events such as flooding and other faults leading to contamination of external
    supplies (e.g. leading to a boil-water advisory) can contaminate building water supplies,
    including end-of-plumbing and PoU devices such as ice machines, beverage dispensers,
    drinking-water coolers and other water-using devices.
    Alternative water supplies used in the event of an emergency may be a source of hazards
    and should be used with care.

4.7 Risk assessment
    Risk assessment is a process by which identified hazards and hazardous events are evaluated
    to decide whether they represent a significant risk that needs to be controlled. The type of
    information that should be considered in a risk assessment is shown in Figure 4.3.
    Risk assessments should take into account the number and vulnerability of exposed
    people and the type of exposure.
    In the risk-assessment process, the important issue is to identify and prioritize unacceptable
    risks that need to be controlled. It is important not to get caught by identifying all risks
    and providing them with equal weighting.


                                                                          4 Water safety plans   53
     Risk assessments can be applied at the time of planning or constructing a system; they
     can also be applied to an existing system. The preventive approach to include risk
     assessment with planning and construction is always preferable. Modifying existing
     systems, including retrofitting additional monitoring and control measures, is typically
     more expensive. Reactive risk assessments and modifications taken after harm has been
     caused can be complicated by political and legal influence, and time constraints.
     Assessments for new buildings will identify risks that need to be controlled and the
     measures that need to be incorporated in the new water systems. Therefore, risk
     assessments should be conducted as early as possible within planning and design phases.

     Figure 4.3          Types of information to consider in risk assessment


     Risk assessments for existing buildings should identify and consider the effectiveness
     of established control measures. If the control measures are either insufficient or not
     effective, the risk-assessment process will identify significant risks and point to system
     modifications required to achieve water-quality targets. Therefore, the outcome of risk
     assessment is a plan of action that documents necessary additional or improved control
     measures, including time lines and responsibilities for their implementation. This should
     include establishing priorities for action.
     Risk assessment and prioritization methods range from relatively simple team decision
     approaches, through semiquantitative, matrix-based approaches, to fully quantitative risk
     assessments (WHO, 2009). Which method is best in a given situation will depend on the
     complexity of the building water system assessed. The method of choice for a small or
     simple structured building may be qualitative team decisions based on the judgement
     and experience of the WSP team. For example, risks could be classified as significant,


54   Water safety in buildings
uncertain or insignificant. Those classified as significant should be considered as clear
priorities for further action that could include application of additional control measures,
while risks classified as uncertain may require further investigation.
Similarly, this type of approach could be applied to assess the risks from contamination
or failure of external supplies. Where data are available on performance in the preceding
years (e.g. over the past 5–10 years), a risk assessment could be based on:
• one or no major contamination or water-shortage events in the past 5–10 years, safe
  supply resumed after less than two days (= reliable public distribution);
• one to two major contamination or water-shortage events per year, resumed after less
  than two days (= generally satisfactory public distribution; PoE treatment may be
  considered for high-risk buildings or populations); or
• frequent major contamination or water-shortage events (= public distribution is not
  sufficiently reliable; PoE treatment or alternative sources should be considered).

Risk assessments for more complex buildings with a range of different water usages and
technologies may benefit from a more formal and structured approach. In all cases, the
WSP team needs to decide on a consistent risk-assessment methodology.
Tables 4.2 and 4.3 illustrate one approach for assessing and ranking risks. In this approach,
the likelihood of a hazard occurring is combined with the severity of consequences to
provide a risk matrix and is particularly applicable to hazardous events. The tables can
be varied to meet the needs of the organization undertaking the risk assessment. For
example, the numbers of categories for likelihood and consequence could be reduced.

Table 4.3 gives an example of descriptors that can be used to rate the likelihood of
occurrence and severity of consequences. A “cut-off” point must be determined above
which all hazards will require immediate attention. There is little value in expending large
amounts of effort to consider small risks. For example, in the first instance, a cut-off point
could be those risks above the bold line. Once these risks are managed, the cut-off point
could be lowered.

                                                                           4 Water safety plans   55
     For some hazards, it may be possible to incorporate a quantitative risk assessment. This
     assessment can provide a numerical estimate of whether the risk is tolerable or unacceptable.
     For chemicals, this estimate can include guideline values. For microbiological quality,
     quantitative risk assessment can be applied using a four-step process involving
     hazard identification, dose–response determination, exposure assessment and risk
     characterization. Hazardous events that lead to chemical guideline values being exceeded,
     or to high levels of microbial risk, should be considered unacceptable and hence require
     management.
     The risk assessment should consider the effectiveness of existing control measures. Where
     risk remains unacceptably high, alternative or additional controls will be required (after
     existing measures have been considered). These additional measures must be evaluated in
     a supplementary risk assessment after additional control measures have been put in place.

     Regardless of which method is preferred, any decision taken in the risk assessment
     needs to be documented to ensure that decisions are sufficiently transparent for external
     examination (e.g. in audits) and to allow reassessment in periodic reviews.
     Further information on hazards, risks and responses is provided in Box 4.9.




56   Water safety in buildings
Box 4.9       Example of a risk assessment
A water safety plan (WSP) team investigated the water system in a school building for
600 pupils. The building included a gymnasium with two shower rooms (40 showers in
total). The WSP team found the following problems:
•   One distribution pipe within the building was made of lead.This pipe delivers water to
    three bathrooms and one small kitchen.
 • One small leakage in a pipe in the basement was identified.
Hot water was prepared from a centralized system in the main building at a temperature
of 60 °C. There was no circulation loop. The hot-water pipes supplying water to the
showers in the gymnasium were not insulated properly. Cold-water pipes were close to
the hot-water pipes.
The WSP team prepared the following table for the risk assessment and for the decision
about additional control measures.

4.8 Control measures
     Control measures are barriers to risks. They need to be identified and implemented for
     hazards identified as a significant priority. In the context of a WSP, control measures are
     defined as those steps in drinking-water supply that directly affect drinking-water quality,
     either by preventing the occurrence of significant hazards or by inactivating, removing or
     reducing them to acceptable levels.
     Control measures can include a wide range of activities and processes. They can be:
     • preventive (and be incorporated in design, planning, construction and commissioning)
     • treatment (e.g filtration, disinfection, softeners)
     • technical (e.g. temperature control, maintenance procedures)
     • behavioural (e.g. measures that influence how water is used).

     Control measures must be defined specifically and precisely for all significant risks, and
     adapted to the local conditions. They should never be imprecise or vague.
     While the type and number of control measures will vary for each supply system, their
     collective implementation and maintenance is essential to ensure that water quality is
     controlled effectively.
     Adequate control measures may already be established in many buildings. However, after
     reviewing their effectiveness in the course of system assessment, additional measures
     may need to be identified or existing measures may need to be modified. Improvement
     plans should be designed to deal with significant risks. Optimum solutions may not be
     economically, technically or socially feasible in the short term, and improvement plans may
     need to set short-, medium- and long-term goals.
     Table 4.4 (at the end of this section) provides examples of control measures. Some of the
     control measures are applied during design and installation, while others involve a range of
     practical measures, including flushing, cleaning, disinfection and other routine maintenance
     procedures. Simple systems will require fewer control measures than more complex systems
     in large buildings.


58   Water safety in buildings
While control measures are directed at ensuring water quality, there may also be
preventive actions and responses applied to maintain constancy of supply. These could
include installation of sufficient buffering storage tanks or identification of alternative
sources of water. Examples are included in Table 4.4.

4.8.1    Validation
All control measures should be validated to ensure effectiveness. Validation is the process
of obtaining evidence that control measures are effective and achieve the required results.
Validation can take the form of intensive monitoring during commissioning or initial
implementation of a new or modified control. Alternatively, validation can take the form
of assessing technical data from published studies or data provided by manufacturers
(preferably confirmed by independent certification). This is a common approach
used in assessing treatment processes. Validation can also be informed by successful
implementation in other buildings.
Validation will typically only apply under certain conditions and these will typically be
defined by operational limits. For example, chlorination could be validated (confirmed)
as being effective if a minimum chlorine residual of 0.5 mg/l is achieved. In this case,
0.5 mg/l is used as a lower limit in operational monitoring (see section 4.9).

4.8.2    Ingress of contamination

Microbial contamination

Control measures to reduce ingress of microbial contamination from water sources can
include water treatment at the PoE. This is particularly important where the quality of
the source water cannot be guaranteed or where improved quality water is required—
for example, in health-care facilities that accommodate patients with increased risk of
infection.
Water treatment can be used:
• at PoE to
   –    supplement treatment applied by the drinking-water provider
   –    improve untreated building-specific water supplies or supplementary sources of
        water (e.g. rainwater);
• before devices such as hot-water systems or specialized equipment to improve water
  quality;
• at PoU (e.g. carbon filters, membrane filters).

Common forms of treatment include filtration, disinfection, softeners and carbon filters.
Selection of PoE devices will be based on the nature of the source water (surface water,
groundwater, rainwater, etc.), susceptibility to contamination (e.g. by human and livestock
waste), the intended use of the water and the vulnerability of users.
Within buildings, control measures include ensuring the physical separation of systems
transporting different qualities of water (e.g. drinking-water from sewage). These systems
should be clearly marked to ensure that the possibility of inadvertent cross-connections
is minimized during maintenance, repairs and renovations. Where systems and devices


                                                                   4 Water safety plans   59
     are connected to drinking-water systems (e.g. firefighting supplies, cooling towers),
     backflow devices need to be installed to prevent ingress of contaminated water. Many
     countries have technical guides on how this should be achieved.
     Where possible, positive pressure should be maintained to reduce the likelihood of ingress
     of external contamination. Pressure fluctuations should be minimized for the same reason.

     Chemical and physical contamination

     Control measures to ensure the physical and chemical quality of water entering buildings
     can include treatment at PoE. This could apply to either public or building-specific water
     supplies. The selection of appropriate solutions will depend on the nature of the chemical
     contamination. Selection of PoE devices should be based on expert advice.
     Common forms of treatment include water softeners, deionizers, activated carbon and
     filtration.

     Microbial growth and biofilms

     Pathogen-control strategies inside buildings should prevent the development of conditions
     that can foster growth of hazardous environmental pathogens, such as Legionella and
     Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
     Control measures should focus on good design principles and temperature management, and
     limit the development of biofilms. Systems should be designed and operated to maximize
     circulation and flows (avoiding stagnation, low flows, long branch pipes and dead ends,
     poor distribution of flow among branch pipes, etc.). Water temperatures should be kept
     below 20 °C in cold-water systems and above 50 °C in hot-water systems. Pipes carrying
     hot water should be insulated, while cold-water systems should be protected from heat
     sources. Ideally, hot water should be stored at above 60 °C and circulated at 50 °C or higher.
     In tropical and hot climates, keeping cold-water systems below 20 ºC during summer
     months is difficult. In these cases, using alternative controls (e.g. reducing stagnation, low
     flows and other risk factors) will have a higher priority.
     Temperature reduction to reduce the risk of scalding in hot-water systems (e.g. by using
     thermostatic mixing valves) should be applied as close as possible to PoU. Distribution
     systems that incorporate multiple loops should be designed to ensure that flow rates can
     be equilibrated among the various loops. The capacity to disinfect hot-water systems using
     elevated temperatures or chemical processes should be considered. If PoE disinfection is
     installed to reduce the risk of microbial growth, it should be maintained and monitored to
     ensure effectiveness.
     Additional safety measures may be applied in buildings or parts of buildings used by higher
     risk populations. This could include PoU devices (e.g. filters or ultraviolet disinfection
     units) installed on showers and taps. Effectiveness of these devices has been demonstrated
     in high-risk areas of health-care facilities, such as intensive-care units, for control of
     Legionella and Pseudomonas (Exner et al., 2005; Trautmann et al., 2008). Use of these
     devices should also be considered as a general measure where there are concerns about
     the quality of water entering buildings. Installation should be accompanied by ongoing
     maintenance and replacement programmes. Poorly maintained devices will not perform
     effectively and may support growth of biofilms.




60   Water safety in buildings
4.8.3    Materials and equipment

Degradation, corrosion and scaling

The aim is to minimize corrosion and hence control the release of chemical hazards and
extend the life of pipework and associated equipment. In many countries, water suppliers
are required to provide water that is not aggressive (likely to cause corrosion in internal
plumbing systems). However, this is not always the case, and building owners may need
to implement control measures.
Corrosion can be controlled by:
• selection of suitable materials (i.e. not only more “resistant” material but also a better
  quality of the same material);
• minimizing water stagnation;
• preventing galvanic corrosion by avoiding contact between different metals;
• preventing bacterial regrowth (biofilm formation);
• treating water (e.g. removing corrosive ions such as chloride);
• adding corrosion inhibitors (e.g. polyphosphates, sodium silicates);
• encouraging corrosion “competition” with cathodic protection (e.g. using sacrificial
  galvanic anodes that dissolve instead of the piping material, or using inert electrodes
  powered by an external source of direct current in water-storage tanks).

Water with high levels of hardness can cause increased scaling. Increased temperature
can exacerbate scaling, and hot-water devices and heating elements are particularly
susceptible. A common control measure to reduce scaling is installation of water softener
to reduce hardness.

4.8.4    Specific uses and water-using devices
Risks associated with specific uses (e.g. medical, dental) and water-using devices can be
controlled by measures directed towards reducing contamination and preventing direct
exposure to contaminated water or aerosols. Where devices are connected to drinking-
water systems, the ingress of contamination to the main supply should be prevented by
installing appropriate backflow-prevention devices.
All devices need to be maintained to minimize microbial growth and biofilm formation.
Control measures for these types of devices should be based on regular cleaning, flushing
of piping and tubing, and disinfection. Where devices produce sprays, possible exposure
to fine aerosols should be minimized. This can be achieved by reducing release from
devices such as cooling towers (e.g. by installing drift eliminators) or, where possible,
reducing public exposure by operating systems outside opening hours (e.g. irrigation
systems in garden centres).
Many countries have regulations and standards that apply to water-using devices. These
regulations and standards can include general requirements such as requiring installation
of backflow prevention on equipment connected to drinking-water supplies. Regulations
may also specify application of control measures, including water treatment, disinfection
and regular cleaning for specific devices such as cooling towers, swimming pools, hot-
tub pools and hot-tub baths. Further information on control measures for these devices

                                                                   4 Water safety plans   61
     can be found in Guidelines for safe recreational water environments volume 2: swimming
     pools and similar environments (WHO, 2006a) and Legionella and the prevention of
     legionellosis (Bartram et al., 2007).

     4.8.5      Management, maintenance and repair
     Water treatment devices at PoE and PoU and water-using devices should be cleaned
     regularly to minimize microbial growth and corrosion (softeners and carbon filters may be
     colonized if not adequately maintained). Water-using devices should be decommissioned
     when not in use, and drained where possible. Water-using devices such as cooling towers
     and evaporative condensers will often require cleaning and decontamination before being
     returned to service. Devices such as drinking-water fountains should be flushed following
     periods of non-use (e.g. school holidays).

     4.8.6      Construction and renovation
     In new buildings and upgraded parts of buildings, appropriate planning, construction and
     commissioning provides the first opportunity to apply control measures for preventing
     hazards and minimizing risks.

     Planning

     Initial planning of new buildings and upgrades for existing buildings often give little
     attention to water quality and hygiene issues. Functional and aesthetic features of a new
     building are generally given higher priority. Planning and designing safe water systems
     normally has to adapt to a physical framework that is already set. Planning of water systems
     is commonly left to subcontractors or subordinates in teams of designers. If not integrated
     in early stages of planning, there can be major consequences for the functionality and safety
     of water distribution within the building. Malfunction of water installations and subsequent
     retrofitting and remedial action can be very expensive and can interrupt construction or
     commissioning. Therefore, it is important to include specialists for water utility planning
     as soon as possible.
     Definitions of water usage in new buildings are often imprecise, particularly in multipurpose
     buildings. This can be exacerbated where the intended uses of a new building are not
     known or are subject to substantial changes during the planning phase. Owners may not
     have decided where to put certain devices and end-of-use equipment, and can often be
     unaware of consequences and associated risks. Calculations of water usage and appropriate
     dimensions of the water distribution system are essential to ensure that systems are
     designed with appropriate capacities. This involves consideration of how the system and
     any associated equipment are to be used (e.g. numbers of users, frequency). Both over- and
     under-estimation of water capacity can compromise safety. As much detail as possible about
     projected water use and equipment requirements must be obtained from owners or intended
     users of buildings. Dual plumbing systems incorporating recycled water for toilet flushing
     and other non-drinking uses are becoming more popular. Installation of these systems will
     reduce water usage through drinking-water systems, and unless this taken into account it
     will lead to over-capacity and increased risks of stagnation.
     In some cases, building owners are not the users or managers of buildings. For example,
     hotel buildings are quite often built and owned by companies other than those responsible
     for operating and managing the hotel. Early consultation between the various parties,


62   Water safety in buildings
    including documentation of water-installation issues, is recommended to prevent the
    need for modifications during commissioning.
    It may help to learn from existing buildings and transfer this experience to new, comparable
    projects. In most cases, pre-existing examples of safe water distribution systems are available.
    Dealing directly with manufacturers and providers of equipment (e.g. dimensions for water
    boilers or tanks) is useful, but design engineers may be a better source of information,
    because water hygiene depends on the whole system, rather than on individual components.

    Construction phase

    The initial plan for water distribution facilities should be followed wherever practical. If
    changes are made, they need to be incorporated into an amended plan; this includes changes
    to materials or dimensions of pipework and equipment. It is not appropriate to use working
    sketches from the planning office that do not reflect the actual installation.
    Risks of biofilm formation or corrosion can be reduced by using only materials that are
    certified for use with drinking-water. Using incorrect or inferior—and possibly cheaper—
    alternatives will generally incur high costs for subsequent corrective measures.
    Special care must be taken with procedures that are known to be crucial for system
    performance. It is essential that only water of drinking quality comes in contact with fittings
    and materials, even during construction. Alternatively, measures should be taken to ensure
    that the dead water is completely removed and the new fittings are flushed before being
    commissioned.
    Pressure tests for distribution systems can be critical. Sometimes, water of lower quality
    is used for this purpose. While draining, flushing and high-dose chlorination can reduce
    risks from contamination, they may not always be completely successful. The pressure
    test should be used (with air, oil-free gas or drinking-water) to avoid this risk of residual
    contamination. If lower quality water is used, the system must be thoroughly drained and
    disinfected afterwards.
    Timing also needs to be considered. Construction of a large building is often done in several
    phases. It is important to keep all finished parts of the water installation dry until the whole
    system is commissioned for routine operation. Introducing water into the system too early
    (e.g. weeks or months before a system becomes fully operational) can cause long-term
    problems. Retained water will become stagnant and support growth of biofilms, which are
    difficult to remove. Wherever possible, water should only be added to the system as a final
    step before it becomes operational. If this is not possible, sections that remain stagnant
    for extended periods should be thoroughly drained and disinfected before the system is
    commissioned.

4.9 Operational monitoring of control measures
    A key requirement in identifying control measures is that performance can be monitored.
    Thus, operational monitoring procedures need to be established for each newly identified
    or existing control measure. Operational monitoring is used to assess the performance
    of individual control measures to ensure that they are working effectively, as designed.
    Monitoring frequencies should be selected to ensure that corrective actions can be introduced
    in a timely fashion to prevent loss of control and development of hazardous situations.



                                                                          4 Water safety plans   63
     WSPs should incorporate a monitoring plan to answer the following questions:
     • What will be monitored?
     • How will it be monitored?
     • Where will it be monitored?
     • When and how often will it be monitored?
     • Who will do the monitoring?
     • Who will receive the results for analysis and, where necessary, ensure appropriate
       remedial responses are implemented?

     Operational monitoring does not necessarily involve complex and time-consuming microbial
     or chemical tests. It rather takes the form of a planned sequence of inspections of observable
     features. As summarized in Table 4.4, many of the operational monitoring requirements
     involve regular inspection (e.g. checking structural integrity of storage tanks) or auditing of
     maintenance procedures (e.g. checking that PoU devices have been maintained according
     to manufacturers’ instructions). Operational monitoring can include relatively simple field
     measurements, such as monitoring for turbidity, the appearance of the water, temperature
     and chlorine residuals. The general principle is that frequent performance of quick field
     tests is preferable to infrequent and expensive laboratory-based testing. Poor performance
     of hot-water systems can be detected more quickly and on an ongoing basis through
     monitoring of water temperatures, rather than by testing for pathogens such as Legionella,
     Pseudomonas or mycobacteria.
     For each control measure, operational limits defining acceptable performance need to be
     identified and applied to operational monitoring parameters. These limits are typically
     identified during validation of control measures and can take the form of upper or lower limits
     or tolerance ranges. For example, this could include identifying a minimum temperature of
     50 °C for hot-water systems and a maximum temperature of 20 °C for cold-water systems
     to prevent the growth of environmental pathogens, such as Legionella. Control measures
     are considered to be effective if monitoring results comply with the limits. If these limits are
     not met, corrective actions need to be taken immediately to bring the measure back under
     control. Corrective actions must be specific and predetermined, where possible, to enable
     rapid implementation. For hot-water systems, this includes identified actions to ensure that
     temperatures above 50 °C are restored and maintained. In some cases, it can be useful to set
     preliminary targets that provide an early warning if control measures are not be performing
     as well as possible. If these targets are not met, corrective actions can be implemented
     before control is lost. For example, if the low temperature limit in a hot-water loop is 50 °C,
     a preliminary target at which action is initiated could be 53 °C.

4.10 Management procedures and corrective responses
     All aspects of WSPs need to be documented in a management plan. This includes system
     mapping, hazard identification, risk assessment, identification of control measures,
     monitoring programmes, corrective actions, improvement plans and communication
     strategies. Much of the management plan will describe monitoring and maintenance




64   Water safety in buildings
procedures that will be routinely followed on a day-to-day basis during normal
performance. Many of these procedures will relate to sensible and practical measures to
maintain cleanliness, hygiene, integrity and performance of systems. The key is to ensure
that procedures are precisely described, with clear directions on what needs to be done
and who will do it. However, documentation should also include corrective actions and
response to incidents and failures. Many potential incidents are predictable (e.g. ingress of
contamination, microbial growth and biofilms), and specific responses can be identified. A
procedure also needs to be developed to deal with unpredictable events. This should take the
form of an incident-response plan dealing with general principles, including responsibilities
and communication requirements.

4.10.1     Ingress of contamination from external water sources
Chemical and microbial contamination may enter the distribution system of the buildings
from external water supplies. If contamination is detected in a public water supply, advice
should be provided to building owners or managers by the water supplier. This should
include advice on recommendations for users of the water, alternative sources, responses
implemented by the water utility, and estimated time frames for return to normal operation.
Depending on the contamination and potential impacts, the following measures could be
considered for building water supplies:
• Prevent the consumption of contaminated water.
   –     Provide advice to all users of the building that water from the building system
         should not be consumed. Label taps and outlets with appropriate advice.
   –     Consider the need to provide bottled, packaged or tankered water to the building
         users. The building owner should ensure that the alternative source of water is safe
         and, if tankers are used, that they are suitable for delivering safe drinking-water.
   –     Switch to an uncontaminated source of water to the building, if possible.
   –     Use mobile treatment units (e.g. temporary chlorinators) to produce safe
         drinking-water, if contamination is likely to persist for an extended time.
         Monitor the operation of treatment devices to ensure that they produce safe
         drinking-water.
• Disinfect the system.
   –     If microbially unsafe water is or was supplied to the building, it will be
         necessary to disinfect and flush the whole water system. This process should be
         monitored by on-line and field measurement of disinfectant concentrations at
         outlets throughout the building. The effect of the disinfection should be verified
         by microbiological analysis.
• Flush the system.
   –     If chemically contaminated water is or was supplied to the building, it will be
         necessary to flush the whole water system. The effect of flushing should be
         verified by chemical analysis.




                                                                     4 Water safety plans   65
     4.10.2     Ingress of contamination from building systems
     If ingress of contamination in the building is identified, the source must be eliminated.
     Other corrective actions and responses could include the following:
     • Prevent the consumption of contaminated water.
       – Issue advice to all users of the building or users of mains water in the affected
          section of the building that the water supply should not be consumed. Label taps
          and outlets with appropriate advice.
       – Consider the need to provide bottled, packaged or tankered water to building
          users while remedial action is taken. The building owner should ensure that the
          alternative source of water is safe and, if tankers are used, that they are suitable
          for delivering drinking-water.
     • Disinfect the system.
       – In the event of microbial contamination, it will be necessary to disinfect and flush
           the whole water system or the affected sections of the system, depending on the
           type and extent of the contamination. This process should be monitored by on-line
           and field measurement of disinfectant concentrations at outlets throughout the
           building. The effect of disinfection should be verified by microbiological analysis.
     • Flush the system.
       – In the event of chemical contamination, it will be necessary to flush the whole
          water system or the affected sections of the system. The effect of flushing should
          be verified by chemical analysis.

     Failure of point of entry

     PoE treatment devices need to be monitored to ensure that they function effectively.
     Non-compliance with critical limits should lead to an immediate assessment of impacts
     and remedial action. Further actions will depend on the nature and significance of the
     treatment (e.g. disinfection of a building-specific water supply compared with secondary
     disinfection of a treated external water supply).
     Where PoE treatment is required to produce safe drinking-water from unsafe private or
     public supplies, responses and actions could be similar to those applied to contaminated
     external supplies. If the PoE treatment (e.g. water softeners) improves water quality but
     is not critical for safety or the performance of other control measures, the responses will
     not be as substantial and warnings about consuming the water will not be required.

     4.10.3     Microbial growth and biofilms
     If impacts from microbial growth are detected (e.g. discoloured water, odours, off-tastes,
     and slimes and sludges in water-using devices), it is likely that water systems will require
     disinfection and flushing. Hot-water systems can be “pasteurized” by flushing with water
     at temperatures greater than 60 °C (preferably greater than 70 °C). Users should be
     notified when disinfection or “pasteurization” is implemented. Water hotter than 60 °C
     can cause severe scalding, while water containing high levels of disinfectants can have
     objectionable tastes and odours for some users. Water-using devices will also require
     cleaning and disinfection.
     The source of microbial growth should be examined. For example, the performance of
     treatment used in water-using devices should be checked. Where water temperatures

66   Water safety in buildings
are too high in cold-water systems or too low in hot-water systems, the cause should
be investigated and corrected. This could include examining separation of systems,
insulation, temperatures produced by water heaters, location and performance of
thermostatic mixing valves, and flow rates in all branches—particularly in return mains.
The operation of the system should be checked to determine whether usage patterns have
changed and whether areas of water stagnation have been introduced.

4.10.4     Release of hazards from materials and equipment
Improvement programmes should be established to reduce or stop the release of hazards by
replacing the responsible components within the distribution system. Where this involves
large amounts of pipework and fittings, this may need to be a staged process. For example,
if there are large numbers of lead-based pipes (in some cases, most pipes in a building
could contain lead), it is often impractical to replace it all at once. Depending on the extent
and significance of contamination and potential impacts, the following measures should be
considered:
• Prevent the consumption of contaminated water where the water is considered
  unsafe.
  – Issue advice to all users of the building or users of mains water in the affected
     section of the building that the water supply should not be consumed. Label taps
     and outlets with appropriate advice.
   –     Consider the need to provide bottled, packaged or tankered water to the users of
         the building while remedial action is taken. The building owner should ensure that
         the alternative source of water is safe.
• Flush the system.
  – It may be necessary to flush the whole water system or the affected sections of the
      system. It may be appropriate to implement regular flushing programmes (e.g. for
      lead contamination; USEPA, 2002; Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 2010).
      The effect of flushing should be verified by chemical analysis.
• Prevent corrosion.
  – Corrosion can lead to chemical contamination. If the contamination includes
     hazardous chemicals, then similar management procedures applied to ingress of
     chemical contamination (see above) should be considered. Corrosion can affect
     the taste and appearance of water. If this occurs, building water supplies should be
     flushed to reduce concentrations of corrosion products.
   –     Corrosion can also lead to faults that allow microbial contamination. Faults should
         be immediately repaired following standard maintenance procedures. This should
         include flushing and disinfection of affected parts of distribution systems.


4.10.5     Specific uses and water-using devices
Corrective actions and responses associated with incidents and failures detected in water
for specific uses normally focus on taking remedial action and preventing exposure.
Where faults and contamination are detected, a standard response is to stop use or operation
of the device until remedial action has been taken. Procedures describing when and how
to shut down devices, and how to clean and decontaminate them, should be documented


                                                                     4 Water safety plans   67
     and made available. These procedures should include monitoring requirements that must
     be met before devices are returned to service.
     Advice should be issued to users of the building or users of specialized equipment when
     the devices are not available. Devices should be labelled with appropriate advice.
     Where water is used for specific medical or dental procedures, alternative sources may
     be required. Procedures should be established to ensure that alternatives are available.
     Box 4.10 provides a case study of Legionella infection from a private hot tub.

        Box 4.10        Legionella infections from a private whirlpool (hot tub) in Sweden
        In mid-February, a middle-aged Swedish man fell severely ill with legionellosis.The cultivation
        of his sputum sample showed growth of Legionella bozemanii, an unusual species in Sweden.
        Since the patient had not recently travelled abroad, an investigation to find the source of
        infection was initiated by the department of communicable disease control and prevention
        in Stockholm County. The man was staying at his summer cottage during the incubation
        time. The water supply to his cottage was delivered through a long pipe via his neighbour’s
        property. Water in the pipe was suspected to be the source of infection, and so the water
        was sampled and analysed for the presence of Legionella, but none was detected. On
        further questioning, the patient recalled that he had visited a friend and they had bathed
        in the friend’s whirlpool bath.
        The owner of the whirlpool was contacted and was found to be suffering from protracted
        symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. He had taken a course of penicillin for about
        two months, with no effect on his symptoms. Serological results later showed raised titres
        of antibodies to Legionella bozemanii.
        At the end of April, samples were taken from the whirlpool, and very high concentrations
        of Legionella bozemanii/anisa were detected in the whirlpool water (3 600 000 cfu/l). The
        bacteriological analysis also showed high numbers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and very
        high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria (>30 000 cfu/ml). These results indicated that the
        whirlpool had not been maintained correctly.
        The owner of the whirlpool stated that he had maintained the whirlpool according to the
        manufacturer’s maintenance instructions, although he had changed the filter more often
        than was recommended. The whirlpool has a volume of about 3 m3; the owner changed
        the water every second week, and added chlorine (manually) as a disinfectant. The owner
        of the whirlpool contacted people who had visited him previously and had bathed in the
        whirlpool. He reported that about 40 people had developed mild respiratory symptoms
        after their visit.
        The growth of the unusual Legionella bozemanii/anisa may have been due to the fact that
        the water used in the household was a mixture of well water and water from a nearby
        lake. Outbreaks caused by whirlpools distributing Legionella are becoming more frequent.
        Outbreaks of Pontiac fever with high attack rate are more common, but legionellosis
        outbreaks also occur.
        Whirlpools are commonly installed in public places such as hotels, gyms or hot tubs,
        and poor maintenance of whirlpools is common. This was the first time that a private
        whirlpool had been found to be the vehicle of legionellosis in Sweden, but it is likely that
        the number of people contracting an infection with milder symptoms from their private
        whirlpools is underestimated.
        Guidelines have been produced for hotels and public places to help reduce the risk of
        whirlpools becoming sources of Legionella.

68   Water safety in buildings
    4.10.6    Emergencies affecting external supplies
    The quality of alternative water supplies provided in emergencies should be verified.
    Where treatment of these supplies is implemented, operational procedures and monitoring
    will be required to ensure that acceptable performance is achieved.
    As part of remediation following a contamination event, the entire distribution
    system, including water-using devices, PoU and end-of-pipe devices will need to be
    flushed and possibly disinfected or decontaminated. Treatment systems such as water
    softeners, deionizers and filtration systems will need to be regenerated, backwashed
    or recommissioned before being returned to service. Small PoU filters could harbour
    contamination and may need replacing.

4.11 Management procedures for new buildings or major upgrades
    Water systems, particularly in major buildings, tend to be complex in terms of both their
    geometry and the technical elements being installed. It is challenging to operate such
    systems correctly. In addition, personnel who will take responsibility for the new building
    may not have extensive expertise or training.
    Thus, commissioning of water systems in buildings can have a critical influence on the quality
    of water. The design, construction and function of water systems, as well as management
    procedures, need to be documented by the constructer of the building and by manufacturers
    of specific devices and specialized equipment installed in buildings. Operating instructions
    and maintenance plans should be included. The instructions must cover details about the
    proper operation of the drinking-water supply system and about adequate functional checks.
    The nature, scope and frequency of inspections should be specified.
    For buildings with specific requirements and potentially vulnerable users (e.g. hospitals,
    residential homes for the elderly, nursery schools), a specific hygiene plan should be
    established in cooperation with a hospital hygienist, the responsible public health authority
    and, if necessary, the water supplier.
    A complete documentation folder of management plans and procedures should contain
    detailed plans of the system and technical fact sheets for all installed components (e.g.
    water filters, disinfection systems, drinking-water heaters), water-using devices (e.g.
    cooling towers) and specialized equipment (e.g. medical equipment, dental chairs).
    Commissioning should incorporate a management and instruction protocol, which must be
    signed by both parties (manufacturer and operator of the system). There must also be an
    appropriate handover process to ensure that the building manager or operator is aware of all
    features and technical specifications of water systems, devices and associated equipment in
    the building. The responsible operator has to be informed about reporting requirements, legal
    obligations, codes of practice, national standards, technical rules and training requirements.
    Hygiene training may be required.
    At the time of commissioning, water quality should be documented by hygienic testing of
    microbial and chemical quality in an adequate set of drinking-water samples. Initial higher
    intensity monitoring (additional samples and parameters) might be necessary, depending on
    intended use of the facility, outcomes of inspection, any irregularities during construction or
    commissioning, and delays in beginning of regular use (see section 4.8.5). In these cases, a
    water-quality expert should be consulted.


                                                                         4 Water safety plans   69
4.12 Verification
     Verification is required to provide reassurance that WSPs are effective and water systems
     as a whole operate safely. Verification typically includes two components:
     • testing water quality
     • auditing WSPs.


     4.12.1     Water-quality testing
     The extent of water-quality testing will be influenced by the size and characteristics of
     the building, and the reliability and quality of the external water supply. In most buildings
     that have reliable, high-quality water supplies, there will be limited requirements for
     independent verification. Part of the responsibilities of the water utility is to ensure that
     the chemical and microbiological quality of water delivered to buildings is safe. The
     water utility should provide results on request.
     Testing of water-quality safety in buildings is generally only required where:
     • additional building-specific sources of water are used to augment the external supply;
     • t he building has specific purposes that increase potential risks (e.g. hospitals and other
        health-care facilities);
     • water-using devices such as cooling towers, swimming pools and hot tubs are installed;
        anagement actions are established to minimize ongoing sources of contamination
     • m
       (e.g. flushing to deal with lead contamination).
     Where additional building-specific sources of water are used, verification should include
     traditional indicators of faecal contamination, such as E. coli, and chemical parameters.
     The range of chemical parameters and frequency of testing will depend on the source of
     the water supply. Guidance on verification of microbial and chemical quality is provided
     in the GDWQ (WHO, 2008). In health-care buildings, particularly those incorporating
     intensive-care units, verification may include testing for specific microorganisms such
     as Legionella in hot-water systems. Further guidance is provided in Legionella and the
     control of legionellosis (Bartram et al., 2007). Verification of water quality in water-
     using devices such as cooling towers and swimming pools may also include testing for
     specific organisms. Further guidance is provided in Guidelines for safe recreational
     water environments volume 2: swimming pools and similar environment (WHO, 2006b).
     In some countries, verification of water-using devices may be a regulatory requirement.
     The quality of water allocated to specific uses may also need to be verified. The parameters
     included in monitoring will depend on the specific requirements of the end use.

     4.12.2     Water safety plan audits
     Verification should include audits of WSPs to demonstrate that the plans have been
     properly designed, are being implemented correctly and are effective. As described in the
     GDWQ (WHO, 2008), factors to consider include:
     • all significant hazards and hazardous events have been identified
     • appropriate control measures have been included



70   Water safety in buildings
    • appropriate operational monitoring procedures have been established
    • appropriate operational limits have been defined
    • corrective actions have been identified
    • appropriate verification monitoring procedures have been established.

    Audits should be included in internal reviews by building managers. Audits by
    independent experts should also be considered. Independent audits may be required by
    regulatory authorities or accreditation agencies for certain types of buildings (e.g. health-
    care facilities) or where buildings use independent sources of water.

4.13 Supporting programmes
    Supporting programmes are activities that support implementation of WSPs and assurance
    of water quality. Operators, maintenance staff, employees and users of buildings may have
    limited knowledge of WSP principles, technical aspects and good practice associated with
    water supplies in buildings. Therefore, an important component is developing training
    and education programmes for personnel who are involved in activities that influence
    the delivery of safe water, and personnel for whom it is critical to use water safely (e.g.
    health-care professionals).
    Section 5 provides further information on training.
    Codes of good operating practices and hygiene are also important components of
    supporting programmes. These can be captured in standard operating procedures that
    include but are not limited to:
    • hygienic use of water supplies
    • hygienic practices in maintaining water supplies, water-using devices and equipment
    • hygienic practices in performing repairs
    • calibration of monitoring equipment
    • instructions on access to equipment and modification of systems
    • training requirements for maintenance staff.

     The case study in Box 4.11 describes the response to a hospital water supply after
     contamination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.


        Box 4.11        Contamination of a hospital water supply with Pseudomonas
                        aeruginosa in Germany
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations up to and above 100 organisms per 100 ml
        were detected in the water supply to a new hospital building in a number of locations
        and on repeated occasions during 2005–06. The colonization could not be eliminated,
        despite repeated thermal disinfection and implementation of continuous chlorine dioxide
        disinfection. As a result, the building was vacated, and an expert consultant was engaged
        to provide advice.
        An ultraviolet plant was installed at the point of entry to the water system. The water
        system was intensively flushed and decontaminated with higher doses of chlorine dioxide
        disinfection for three days. This was augmented by intermittent dosing with hydrogen
        peroxide, as recommended in guidelines of the German Association for Gas and Water.
        After decontamination, there were only isolated detections of Pseudomonas (downstream
        of the pressure-increasing system).
        Further measures included replacing and disinfecting the pressure-increasing system, and
        placing the ultraviolet plant before the pressure-increasing system.
        Following these actions, it was decided to:
         •  move patients and employees into the building to avoid further stagnation (regular
            water throughput);
         • establish an incident plan;
         • continue microbiological testing.
        Ongoing testing has shown that the strategy has been successful, with no further
        contamination. The alternative was to completely replace the water distribution system at
        a projected cost of approximately €2 million.
        Source: Exner, Pleischl & Koch (personal communication, 2007).




4.14 Periodic review
     Periodic review is a key requirement of effective WSPs; for example, after every three
     to five years or after significant changes of the supply system. Periodic review ensures
     regular updates of system assessment and management procedures, and also allows for
     the inclusion of incremental improvement strategies in system upgrades.
     WSPs can become out of date due to modifications to water systems, changes in water
     uses, and changes in building ownership or tenancies. Therefore, WSPs should be
     reviewed whenever substantial changes occur.

5 Supporting environment

    This section describes the roles of supporting personnel to ensure the smooth running of
    water safety plans (WSPs). This includes surveillance, inspection, outbreak detection,
    regulatory and policy frameworks, and capacity building and training.

5.1 Independent inspection and surveillance

    5.1.1     Inspection
    Independent inspection and surveillance of drinking-water systems is essential for
    ensuring that systems are well designed and are managed and operated in a manner that
    protects public health. Independent inspections and surveillance can be undertaken during
    construction and major renovations of buildings, or can be applied to existing buildings.
    Independent technical inspections are often required as part of construction and renovation
    of buildings. For example, engineering inspections and certification of plumbing systems
    can be required under building and plumbing codes. These inspections should include
    assessments of public health impacts of drinking-water systems and associated devices.
    Public health agencies should also be consulted as early as possible during design and
    construction to assess the suitability of water systems, including the selection, installation
    and monitoring of control measures. Where possible, public health agencies should assess
    and approve WSPs developed for new buildings and new or renovated water systems,
    particularly in buildings where potential health risks can be high (e.g. health facilities).
    Independent technical inspections of existing buildings can be undertaken by auditors or
    specialists with expertise in areas such as WSPs, plumbing, water treatment, operation
    of water devices (e.g. water-cooled air-conditioning, swimming pools, hot tubs), water
    microbiology, infection control, and occupational health and safety. Technical inspections
    can be commissioned by building managers to provide assurance that systems are being
    operated so that they protect public health and are consistent with regulatory requirements.
    Remedial action or improvements identified by such independent inspections should be
    documented and implemented. In some circumstances, independent inspections may be
    included as part of accreditation activities. For example, accreditation of facilities such
    as hospitals or hotels can include independent inspection of drinking-water systems and
    WSPs. Independent inspections can also be a regulatory requirement. Outcomes of these
    inspections should be documented within WSPs.

    5.1.2     Surveillance
    Surveillance is one of the five key components of the Framework for safe drinking-
    water (WHO, 2008) and is necessary to verify that WSPs are well designed and correctly
    implemented. Surveillance is a specific and ongoing activity that should be undertaken
    by public health agencies to assess and review the safety of drinking-water systems. As
    well as being a measure of compliance with regulatory requirements, surveillance helps
    to protect public health by promoting ongoing improvement, and by contributing to the
    early detection of water quality risk factors and the subsequent selection of appropriate



                                                                                               89
     remedial actions. Ensuring timely implementation of corrective action and targeted
     improvement can prevent waterborne disease.
     Surveillance of drinking-water systems in buildings can involve audits, direct assessment
     or, ideally, a combination of these two approaches. Audits will generally include reviewing
     and approving new WSPs, as well as routine auditing of implementation of individual
     WSPs. Direct assessment involves testing of water quality. The advantage of audits is
     that they assess the capability to consistently produce safe drinking-water, while direct
     assessment assesses whether safe drinking-water was produced at the time of testing.
     Direct audits are more useful when they are included as part of broad surveys.
     Both approaches require the surveillance agency to understand drinking-water systems
     and the way in which WSPs are applied, as well as the capability to undertake audits
     and respond to significant water incidents. In addition, direct assessments require the
     surveillance agency to have expertise in identifying appropriate monitoring locations and
     parameters, and collecting samples. They must also have access to testing facilities, be
     able to interpret results, and provide reports to building managers.
     There are large numbers of buildings in urban centres, and routine surveillance of all
     building water systems will generally be impossible. Effective planning and development
     of surveillance programmes should identify priorities based on levels of risk. This requires
     an analysis of the types of buildings to be included in surveillance programmes, together
     with information on building characteristics and risk factors associated with building
     occupiers and users. Characteristics to be considered include:
     • building types (hotels, apartments, hospitals, aged-care facilities, hospices, clinics,
       schools, child care, recreation centres, etc.);
     • size and location of buildings and numbers of people potentially exposed;
     • vulnerability of occupiers or users of buildings (residents, workers, patients, elderly
       or very young people, etc.);
     • type and size of water systems (drinking-water supplies, hot-water systems, water-
       cooled air-conditioning systems, swimming pools, hot tubs, etc.);
     • expertise of building operators and employees;
     • availability of specialist service providers;
     • geographical and climatic conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, climate variability).

     In many cases, surveillance may be based on occasional surveys. However, buildings
     such as hospitals and aged-care facilities should be audited at least once per year. Specific
     surveillance may be conducted for buildings that are closed for extended periods and
     reopened (e.g. schools and seasonal hotels). Targeted surveillance may be performed
     for specific devices and equipment, such as cooling towers, evaporative condensers,
     swimming pools and hot tubs. In some countries, this type of targeted surveillance may
     be required by specific legislation.
     Surveillance can be undertaken or coordinated by central public health authorities in
     conjunction with regional and local offices, or with environmental health departments
     within local government. Programmes should be based on practical considerations, taking
     into account the capability of surveillance agencies. Greater attention should be focused
     on buildings that have potentially higher risks.


90   Water safety in buildings
When designing surveillance programmes, consideration should be given to whether
surveillance will be the responsibility of public health agencies or third parties (e.g.
specialist auditors), certified or approved by these agencies, or a combination of both.
Where third parties are used, the public health agency needs to retain responsibility
for implementing the surveillance programmes. The public health agency should also
provide directions on the frequency of inspections and audits, as well as the procedures
to be applied. Public health agencies should receive and assess third-party reports and
communicate assessments with building owners and managers.

Audits

Audits are on-site assessments, from intake to tap, of the whole water system—including
sources, transmission infrastructure, treatment processes, storage, distribution systems,
maintenance and monitoring programmes, and water uses within the building. Audits
should embrace all water systems existing within the building, such as cold-, hot- and
warm-water treatment and distribution systems; water-cooled air-conditioning systems;
swimming pools; hydrotherapy pools; and hot-tub pools. The objective is to evaluate the
ability of building management to produce and deliver safe drinking-water, as well as
water of quality suitable for other specific uses within a building (e.g. in clinics, dental
surgeries).
Audit-based approaches rely on data and information being provided by building owners
and managers. This will include descriptions of water systems and end uses, results of
operational monitoring to check that control measures are working effectively, results of
monitoring at point of delivery to assess compliance with water-quality requirements,
and evaluation of consumer satisfaction and complaints. Information should also be
provided on independent inspections, internal audits, previous surveillance audits, and
implementation of remedial action and improvement programmes.
Audits will normally focus on the design and implementation of WSPs. This could
include:
• reviewing the building’s water systems to examine whether all systems and uses are
  included and described accurately in WSPs;
• ensuring that WSPs consider all appropriate regulations, codes, guidelines and
  accreditation requirements;
• examining records to ensure that the system is being managed according to the WSP;
• assessing whether operational monitoring parameters have been kept within
  operational limits, that compliance was maintained, and that appropriate action was
  taken to respond to non-compliance, where necessary;
• ensuring that verification programmes are in place, that results demonstrate
  effectiveness of WSPs, and that appropriate action was taken to respond to non-
  compliance;
• examining maintenance records;
• assessing whether systems have been operated by appropriate personnel or appropriate
  service providers;
• ensuring that regulatory requirements have been met;



                                                               5 Supporting environment   91
     • examining reports of independent inspections and internal audits;
     • ensuring that all actions and results have been documented and reported according to
       the WSP;
     • assessing incident plans, contingency measures, and communication and reporting
       protocols;
     • assessing supporting programmes and strategies for improving and updating the WSP.

     Audits may involve interviewing building managers, operators and technical staff
     involved in water-system management. A final report should be completed at the end of
     the audit to formally notify the building owner or manager of the findings. The report may
     be used for future compliance actions and inspections and should summarize the findings
     of the survey, remedial action and recommended improvements, together with timelines
     for implementing actions and improvements.
     Targeted audits should be conducted after substantial changes to the source, distribution
     system or treatment process, and in response to significant incidents.
     Audits conducted in response to significant incidents detected by building operators
     should focus on verifying that:
     • the incident was investigated promptly and appropriately
     • the incident was reported to appropriate authorities in a timely fashion
     • the cause was determined and corrected
     • the incident and corrective actions were documented
     • the WSP was reassessed and amended, where necessary, to avoid a similar situation.

     Direct assessment

     Direct assessment involves the collection and analysis of water quality by the surveillance
     agency. It does not replace requirements for audits, and should not be used to reduce the
     frequency of audits. Results should always be reported to building managers and should
     complement verification testing.

     5.1.3      Incidents, emergencies and outbreaks
     Additional inspections will be required in the event of incidents, emergencies (including
     natural disasters) and waterborne outbreaks. This will involve inspection of WSPs and of
     associated water systems. Investigations will normally require immediate collection of
     water samples. Wherever possible, samples should be collected before remedial actions
     are taken—as long as this does not cause unnecessary delays. This is important in trying
     to establish the cause of outbreaks.
     The types of systems inspected will depend on the nature of the incident or outbreak. For
     example, investigations of waterborne gastroenteritis will be different from investigations
     of waterborne legionellosis. The former will focus on systems delivering water for
     ingestion, either directly or through food production; the latter will focus on systems
     containing water between 20 °C and 50 °C, and producing aerosols.




92   Water safety in buildings
Following an outbreak, a further inspection will be required to ensure that any required
remedial action has been taken, and that WSPs have been amended to minimize the
likelihood of recurrence. The effectiveness of remedial action and amended WSPs should
be verified by water-quality testing.

5.1.4    Supporting programmes
Surveillance should incorporate complementary health promotion and educational
components. It should be seen as an activity to maintain or improve public health standards
in a collaborative approach. Regulations should allow for penalties and sanctions, but
these should only be imposed as a last resort.
Building owners and managers should be aware of the standards required by surveillance
agencies, the purpose of audits and inspections, how audits will be performed, what
features will be examined, and what information is required from building managers
during an audit.

5.1.5    Reporting and communication
Reporting and feedback are essential elements of a successful surveillance programme and
should support the development of effective remedial strategies. Outcomes of surveillance
should always be reported to building managers. Annual reports should be prepared by
coordinating authorities and distributed to all agencies involved in surveillance activities
(e.g. national, regional and local agencies).
Agencies responsible for surveillance should also develop strategies for disseminating
and explaining outcomes of surveillance to building occupiers and users.

5.1.6    Use of information
Information gained from surveillance programmes should be collated and assessed. This
information is an invaluable source of data on effective management of water systems, and
can help to identify recurrent causes of problems. Analysing collated data may identify
common factors associated with potential water contamination, such as inadequate or
ineffective treatment processes, structural conditions (e.g. impacts of water-main breaks,
faulty valves or hydrants), hydraulic capacity (e.g. low-pressure complaints, rusty or
coloured water occurrence), leakage (e.g. pro capita water demand), or water quality
deficiencies due to cross-contaminations or to unintended uses.
Collated information can also be used to review relative health risks presented by
different types of buildings and circumstances; it can also be used to refine surveillance
programmes.

5.2 Disease surveillance and detection of outbreaks

     5.2.1      Purpose of disease surveillance programmes
     Establishing and verifying effective disease-control programmes, including WSPs,
     requires effective surveillance programmes. These surveillance programmes should
     provide:
     • accurate and timely information on disease occurrence
     • early detection and notification of outbreaks
     • assessment of responses to outbreaks
     • efficient monitoring of intervention programmes.

     The World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for drinking-water quality (WHO,
     2008) define the reduction of disease and outbreaks as health outcome targets. Reducing
     disease provides the most direct evidence of the success of WSPs, while continued
     disease provides evidence that WSPs are inadequate and require modification. While
     the immediate response to detection of disease is necessarily reactive, the subsequent
     responses can be proactive in identifying and eliminating building-specific and systemic
     risks.
     Many countries have mechanisms for surveillance and reporting of communicable
     diseases. The importance of these mechanisms is reinforced by the International
     Health Regulations (IHR) (WHO, 2005), which call for Member States to apply and—
     where necessary—strengthen capabilities for surveillance, reporting, notification and
     communication of infectious disease. While surveillance programmes often include
     waterborne organisms, specific surveillance of water as a source of disease is generally
     not well developed or coordinated. This includes waterborne disease associated with
     buildings.

     5.2.2      Structure of disease-surveillance systems
     The structure of disease-surveillance systems is governed by a number of factors,
     including legislation, the strategy for implementing surveillance, responsible agencies,
     and stakeholders and communication (WHO, 2006c).

     Legislation

     Public health legislation, including the IHR, provides the regulatory framework governing
     the identification, reporting and communication of notifiable diseases.
     Public health legislation can also include requirements for health-care facilities to
     implement infection-control capabilities, while legislation dealing with occupational
     health and safety can include requirements relating to control of specific diseases, such
     as legionellosis.

     Strategy

     Disease-surveillance strategies depend on the nature of the diseases under investigation,
     the objectives of surveillance, the methods for conducting surveillance, and the
     application of data in informing public health practice. Countries may have multiple


94   Water safety in buildings
disease-surveillance systems operating simultaneously. Some will be aimed at early
detection and response to outbreaks; others will focus on monitoring longer term disease
trends, or the impact of interventions and control programmes. Each type of surveillance
has specific characteristics. Disease surveillance used in health-care facilities is typically
more active and immediate than surveillance of the outcomes of interventions, such as
disease-control regulations or longer term public health programmes.
Disease-surveillance strategies can include:
• ongoing monitoring of reporting of communicable diseases by medical practitioners
  and laboratories;
• short-term and long-term analysis of results;
• investigation of clusters of illness or increased incidence of disease.

Monitoring of waterborne disease generally lags behind general disease surveillance
(Bartram et al., 2002; Hunter et al., 2003). One of the principal factors is that most of
the diseases transmitted by ingestion of contaminated water are transmitted in higher
frequencies from other sources, such as food and person-to-person contact. This makes
assessing the contribution of water difficult. In Europe, only 2% of gastrointestinal
disease between 1986 and 1996 was linked to water (Bartram et al., 2002). Based on
epidemiological investigations and intervention studies, estimates for the United States
of America have placed the contribution at 8–12% (Colford et al., 2006; Messner et al.,
2006).
Hence, while national and regional surveillance systems typically incorporate enteric
organisms that can be waterborne, confirming association with water supplies is generally
limited to outbreaks.
Some countries have established systems for detecting and reporting waterborne outbreaks.
These data indicate that waterborne disease outbreaks associated with large water supplies
have been substantially reduced, and that the proportion of outbreaks associated with
buildings has increased (Blackburn et al., 2004; Yoder et al., 2004, 2008ab; Djiuban et al.,
2006; Liang et al., 2006). In 2003–2004, the classification of waterborne disease by the
United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention was modified to include specific
categories dealing with plumbing deficiencies (Liang et al., 2006).
Some diseases are exclusively waterborne; for example, legionellosis (caused primarily
by Legionella pneumophila) and dracunculiasis (caused by Dracunculus medinensis).
For these organisms, disease surveillance has been an important tool in supporting
implementation of control measures. Waterborne legionellosis is strongly associated with
building water supplies.
Initially, improved surveillance can detect an increased prevalence of disease. This has
been reported for legionellosis in Europe (Bartram et al., 2007). Furthermore, improved
surveillance provides a more accurate basis for establishing the need for, effect of and
benefit of interventions. For example, in Australia, disease surveillance has demonstrated
the effectiveness of Legionella regulations in reducing both the occurrence of the
organism in cooling towers and the frequency of disease (Vic DHS, 2007).
Disease surveillance strategies can be tailored to deal with specific issues. For example,
surveillance in health-care facilities is likely to involve a different spectrum of diseases



                                                                5 Supporting environment   95
     from those included in general surveillance schemes, due to the increased and varied
     vulnerabilities of patients and residents. As described in section 2, organisms such as
     Acinetobacter, Aspergillus, Burkholderia, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas have been
     associated with disease in health-care facilities.

     Priority diseases and case definitions

     It is not economically possible or practical to monitor all diseases. General surveillance
     systems should include diseases of national public health importance. WHO has produced
     guidance for selection of priority diseases, including waterborne diseases (WHO, 2006d,
     2006e).
     Specific disease-surveillance systems, such as those in health-care facilities, should target
     diseases of public health concern within the setting in question. The range of agents can
     vary within buildings; for example, within health-care facilities, renal dialysis patients
     are more susceptible than other patients to endotoxins, toxins and chemical contaminants
     in water used for dialysis.
     Disease surveillance of water supplies in buildings will generally involve microbial
     pathogens, but should also consider chemical agents such as corrosion products (e.g.
     copper, lead, nickel and cadmium). Surveillance for chemicals is uncommon; prevention
     is by far the preferable approach. However, surveillance has been performed for lead (in
     blood) in certain circumstances (CDC, 2010).
     Case definitions should be identified and documented for all priority diseases. A national
     register of case definitions should be developed and applied in all disease-surveillance
     schemes.

     Responsible agencies and stakeholders

     Public health surveillance is typically coordinated at a national level by ministries of
     health, and operates at national, regional and local levels. Coordination and oversight of
     operations by a central agency is essential.
     Infection-control teams in health-care facilities play a key role in public health surveillance.
     Similarly, in commercial and industrial buildings, occupational health services play a role
     in disease surveillance. In some countries, control of legionellosis is regulated at least in
     part by occupational health legislation (Bartram et al., 2007).
     Coordination of all disease surveillance activities is important to support efficiency and
     to avoid duplication.

     Reporting and communication

     Reporting and communication support the collection of disease information, dissemination
     of outcomes, implementation of immediate responses, and longer term interventions.
     Reporting systems should be established to ensure that information moves from the point
     of generation (i.e. disease detection) to collection and coordination agencies. Standard
     operating procedures should be established for reporting. The procedures should deal
     with transmission of routine data, as well as data on suspected and confirmed outbreaks.
     Procedures should be communicated to everyone involved in disease surveillance.




96   Water safety in buildings
Communication between all stakeholders involved in disease surveillance is essential.
Coordination of all disease-surveillance activities undertaken by national, regional and
local authorities, infection-control teams and occupational health services is required to
ensure effective reporting of disease, timely detection of outbreaks, implementation of
responses and longer term control measures.
Disease-surveillance strategies typically involve reporting by medical practitioners and
laboratories. Timeliness and accuracy of reporting are crucial. In addition, systems should
be established to ensure that results of disease surveillance undertaken by infection-
control teams are routinely reported to coordinating agencies. Outbreaks detected in
health-care facilities should be reported immediately.
Communication of outcomes is required. This can include routine reports, as well
as issuing of warnings and advice to health practitioners, the public and managers
of buildings. It is important to have communication procedures in place to deal with
suspected or confirmed outbreaks of potentially waterborne disease. For example:
• the detection of outbreaks of legionellosis could result in communication with
  building owners during the outbreak about immediate action (e.g. precautionary
  decontamination of cooling towers);
• outbreaks of waterborne cryptosporidiosis could lead to issuing of advice to operators
  of leisure centres and swimming pools regarding practices to avoid primary and
  secondary transmission;
• increased incidence of nosocomial disease will require communication with staff and
  managers of health-care facilities.

Mechanisms should be established to facilitate this communication before outbreaks
occur.
After a disease outbreak, communication should be widened to include information on
the lessons learnt, and how practices will be used or applied to minimize the likelihood
of recurrence.
Communication should also include sharing of information between agencies and
stakeholders. For example, this should include establishing communication networks for
infection-control teams, to help identify common problems, causes and interventions.
Disease surveillance at a regional level should be supported by a national communication
system. Higher levels of travel have increased the spread of diseases across boundaries;
therefore, communication should be extended across borders to meet obligations of the
IHR (2005) and also to share experiences and lessons learnt.

Disease-surveillance guidelines and standards

Effective disease-surveillance systems are underpinned by comprehensive standards
and guidelines. These standards and guidelines should define priority diseases, and
include case definitions, notification and reporting requirements, responsibilities, data
management, evaluation, immediate and long-term responses, outbreak preparedness and
training.
Guidelines should deal with related aspects, such as infection control in health-care
facilities (WHO, 2002; Sehulster et al., 2004) and laboratory procedures such as standard
methods and quality control.


                                                              5 Supporting environment   97
     5.2.3      Disease surveillance for water supplies in buildings
     Disease surveillance for disease associated with buildings is a subset of general
     surveillance. However, building water supplies have some specific characteristics:
     • The water systems and hence the sources of disease are typically discrete and defined.
     • Buildings such as hospitals, medical clinics, aged-care facilities and child-care centres
       can cater for subgroups with increased vulnerabilities.
     • In health and aged-care facilities, infection-control teams play a central role in
       surveillance.

     Microbial pathogens represent the greatest risk associated with building water supplies,
     but toxic chemicals such as heavy metals, industrial compounds, coolants and boiler
     fluids can also cause illness.
     Microbial disease and outbreaks associated with buildings can be detected by active
     surveillance by national or regional agencies and infection-control teams, by passive
     processes such as reporting by medical practitioners and other health-care professionals,
     or through anecdotal reporting by building users.
     Acute disease caused by building-specific chemicals (e.g. boiler fluid) is generally detected
     by passive processes, while chronic and acute disease caused by heavy metals (e.g. copper
     and lead) can be detected by either passive processes or broader investigations. The latter
     could be implemented where there is evidence of systematic issues such as corrosion of
     plumbing systems caused by public water supplies.

     5.2.4      Disease-surveillance strategies for waterborne disease
     Surveillance of waterborne disease can be included in a range of programmes with
     different functions and characteristics. These can include surveillance of:
     • national and regional incidence of infectious disease
     • waterborne disease outbreaks
     • specific diseases, to measure incidence and the need for intervention
     • disease in specific settings, such as health-care facilities.

     National and regional incidence of infectious disease

     National and regional surveillance programmes can include specific waterborne diseases
     such as cholera, legionellosis and dracunculiasis. For these diseases, the outcomes of
     disease surveillance can be used to assess longer term trends as well as the outcome of
     intervention programmes.
     National and regional programmes typically include diseases that may be waterborne.
     General surveillance does not identify endemic waterborne disease without the addition
     of ancillary epidemiological studies (Calderon & Craun, 2006), but can detect waterborne
     outbreaks—although the sensitivity is poor (Padiglione & Fairley, 1998; Craun et al.,
     2004).




98   Water safety in buildings
Waterborne disease outbreaks

The likelihood of detection of waterborne disease outbreaks can be increased by
augmenting infectious-disease programmes with specific mechanisms to promote
reporting of such outbreaks. The data from outbreaks can be used to identify important
pathogens, water-system deficiencies and interventions to reduce waterborne disease
(Craun et al., 2006). The best example of outbreak detection is in the United States of
America, where statistical data on waterborne disease outbreaks have been collected and
reported since the 1920s (Djiuban et al., 2006; Yoder et al., 2008ab). Recent surveillance
data indicate that a substantial proportion of outbreaks in recreational water and drinking-
water was associated with buildings such as sports centres, hotels, schools, child-care
centres, nursing homes, hospitals and restaurants. Diseases were caused by a range
of agents, including Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Shigella, Legionella, Pseudomonas,
Norovirus, copper and ethylene glycol (Blackburn et al., 2004; Yoder et al., 2004, 2008ab;
Djiuban et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2006).
The reports have highlighted water-system deficiencies, such as cross-connections in
buildings and the need for improved control of opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella
and Pseudomonas.

Specific diseases

Surveillance for legionellosis is a good example of a targeted monitoring programme and
has been well documented elsewhere (Bartram et al., 2007). Surveillance has been used
to identify the prevalence of disease, the need for improved control, and the success of
intervention programmes (WHO, 2006c; Vic DHS, 2007).

Infection control

Infection rates in health-care facilities are an indicator of the quality of care, including the
safety of the environment. Surveillance is used to monitor incidence of disease, identify
risk factors and evaluate the impact of interventions. Waterborne disease involving
organisms such as Acinetobacter, Aspergillus, Burkholderia, Klebsiella, Legionella,
mycobacteria, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas has been identified as cause for
increased concern in health-care facilities (Annaisie et al., 2002; Sehulster et al., 2004).
Results of disease-surveillance programmes have been used to identify control measures
to minimize the risk of infection associated with building water supplies (Sehulster et al.,
2004; Bartram et al., 2007).

Review

The results of disease-surveillance programmes should be subject to regular review to
identify trends, including increases and decreases in disease rates, changes in patterns
of disease, the occurrence of emerging disease and the impacts of control measures.
Outcomes and any recommendations arising from reviews should be reported.




                                                                 5 Supporting environment    99
      5.2.5      Detection of outbreaks
      Outbreaks are generally defined as two or more cases linked in location and time.
      Waterborne outbreaks associated with water supplies in buildings represent preventable
      failures in WSPs. All outbreaks should be investigated to confirm occurrence, identify the
      source, implement immediate control measures, and identify the need for longer term and
      general changes in management programmes.
      Agencies and teams involved in disease surveillance should establish investigation
      protocols to respond to outbreaks. Early detection of outbreaks and appropriate, timely
      responses will reduce the size and impact of outbreaks. Pre-planning promotes rapid
      responses and avoids planning on the run, which is very likely to lead to poor coordination,
      mistakes and delays.
      Outbreak investigations follow a sequence of activities that includes:
      • pre-planning
      • outbreak confirmation
      • case definition
      • outbreak description
      • hypothesis generation and confirmation
      • control and prevention
      • communication.

      Pre-planning

      Pre-planning should identify who should be involved in the investigation of outbreaks. This
      should include responsibilities, leadership and coordination. Methods for investigating
      outbreaks and basic requirements (e.g. case definitions, data transfer and communication
      procedures) should be identified.

      Outbreak confirmation

      An increase in reported cases or detection of specific pathogens in clinical samples is
      generally the first sign of an outbreak. However, it is important to confirm that the apparent
      outbreak is real. Factors that have been shown to contribute to “pseudo-outbreaks” have
      included increased detection due to increased testing, contamination of clinical samples,
      false positive tests and coincidence of unrelated cases (CDC, 1995, 1997b, 2009; Regan
      et al., 2000; Kressel & Kidd 2001; Blossom et al., 2008).

      Case definition

      Once an outbreak is confirmed, a case definition should be developed to establish criteria
      for inclusion. The definition should include descriptions of place and time of onset,
      and specific biological and clinical criteria (symptoms and test results). Cases could be
      categorized as definite, probable or possible, based on the level of data available. Case
      definitions may also change during investigations as new information becomes available.




100    Water safety in buildings
Outbreak description

A detailed description of the outbreak should be generated as investigations progress.
The description could include information on numbers of cases, place, time, sex, age
and movement. Epidemic curves and mapping of geographical distribution can provide
evidence of sources of contamination and whether they are from single, intermittent or
ongoing events (WHO, 2002; Hunter et al., 2003).

Hypothesis generation and confirmation

As the outbreak description develops, it should be possible to formulate hypotheses on
sources of infection and routes of transmission, and identify possible control measures.
Confirmation is necessary, even in cases that appear to have an obvious source. Hypotheses
will be strengthened, refined, modified or discarded as the investigation continues. For
waterborne outbreaks, confirmation will generally involve collecting and analysing water
samples, and assessing the design and implementation of WSPs for failures. Genetic typing
of isolates is an important tool for identifying sources of cases, and can support or reject
hypotheses (Heath et al., 1998; Hunter et al., 2003; Gilmour et al., 2007). Epidemiological
methods such as case–control studies are also used to test hypotheses by comparing risk
factors between groups of cases and controls without disease (WHO, 2002).
It is important to identify the correct source of disease and to avoid going public with
unconfirmed hypotheses. Pressure to identify sources quickly should not be allowed to
compromise accuracy. Failure to identify the correct source can lead to expensive and
ineffective interventions.

Control and prevention

A priority in all investigations is to identify and implement effective control measures.
The aims are to:
• interrupt the chain of transmission and minimize the magnitude of the outbreak
• prevent future outbreaks.

The selection of control measures will require consultation with appropriate experts such
as environmental microbiologists and water-treatment specialists. Outbreak investigations
should assess the success of control measures, while ongoing disease surveillance should
be implemented to monitor continued effectiveness. This type of surveillance will include
monitoring of disease and the efficacy of the control measure. In the long term, monitoring
of preventive control measures will take precedence.

Communication

During investigations, timely and accurate information should be provided to public
health authorities (if not leading the investigation), building owners and managers,
patients and, where appropriate, the public. Where there is uncertainty—for example, in
the identification of sources—this should be communicated.
Full reports should be prepared at the end of outbreaks, describing events, interventions,
lessons learnt and recommendations to prevent further occurrence. These reports should
be made available to appropriate agencies, authorities, and building owners and managers
involved in operation of water supplies.

      5.2.6      Lessons learnt from disease surveillance and investigations
      Results of disease-surveillance activities and outbreak investigations must be used to
      inform practices, and measures applied to reduce waterborne disease. The decrease in
      drinking-water waterborne outbreaks in the United States of America since the 1980s
      has been attributed to more stringent regulation (NRC, 2006). Events such as the
      Milwaukee outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in 1993 (MacKenzie et al., 1994) contributed
      to the development of regulations. At the same time, the proportion of outbreaks and
      illness associated with buildings has increased (Blackburn et al., 2004; Yoder et al., 2004,
      2008ab; Djiuban et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2006). Water supplies in buildings are typically
      not included within the scope of national drinking-water regulations.
      However, lessons learnt from disease surveillance and outbreak investigations have been
      used to reduce risks associated with building water supplies. The clearest example of this
      is the development of guidelines and regulations for controlling waterborne legionellosis
      (see Legionella and the prevention of legionellosis; WHO, 2007). Other examples include
      increased attention on cross-connection control and backflow prevention (USEPA, 2002;
      NRC, 2004) and the development of guidelines for preventing waterborne disease in
      health-care facilities (WHO, 2002; Sehulster et al., 2004).
      On a national, regional and local level, it is important to learn from the application
      of control measures to deal with waterborne disease. Documentation, reporting and
      communication networks should support cataloguing of incidents and the sharing of
      experience in detecting deficiencies and implementing responses. Where appropriate,
      these can be translated into guidance and regulation to minimize risks of disease.

5.3 Regulatory and policy frameworks
      National governments, together with regional and local authorities, are generally deemed
      to be responsible for ensuring that consumers are provided with safe and wholesome
      water in sufficient quantity. Typically, this responsibility will lie within the ministry of
      health, although sometimes other agencies, such as those responsible for environmental
      protection, may play a role. The actions and responsibilities of these authorities and
      agencies need to be supported by legislative and regulatory tools. However, the diversity
      of constitutional and legal systems makes it impossible to define a single accepted way for
      developing and implementing legislation. Nevertheless, there are a number of common
      principles that should be applied.

      5.3.1      Purpose of legislation
      Legislation should define responsibilities, functions and obligations of agencies charged
      with ensuring compliance with drinking-water quality requirements. Legislation should
      also provide these agencies with necessary powers to administer laws and regulations. For
      instance, the requirements of surveillance within buildings can be hindered by difficulties
      for national, regional or local authorities in gaining access to undertake inspections and
      audits. This needs to be considered in regulatory frameworks. Responsibilities for water
      quality also need to be identified. This should include responsibilities of drinking-water
      suppliers and the managers, operators or owners of water systems in buildings.




102    Water safety in buildings
As discussed throughout this document, the most effective way of assuring drinking-
water safety in buildings is the application of WSPs that cover all issues, from planning
and construction to surveillance of tapwater quality. The central role of WSPs should be
reinforced and supported by regulatory and policy frameworks.
In addition to drinking-water legislation, many countries have established standard-
setting bodies and certification systems. Standards and codes of practice can apply to a
broad range of activities that can influence construction and management of drinking-
water systems in buildings. These can include standards relating to construction of
buildings, installation of plumbing, water systems and sewage systems, as well as the
design, installation, maintenance and operation of devices such as cooling towers and
evaporative condensers, swimming pools, hot-tub pools, hot-water systems and plumbing
devices. Standards could also apply to sampling, testing and accreditation of technical
experts (e.g. plumbers) and auditors.
Tables 5.1–5.3 summarize the tools needed by legislators for addressing WSP
implementation in accordance with national legislation, technical regulations, standards
and codes of practice.

5.4 Capacity building and training
      A wide range of responsibilities is associated with ensuring safety of water within
      buildings. The principles, including WSPs, are captured within the Framework for safe
      drinking-water. The risk-management principles described in the framework also apply
      to other devices, such as water-cooled air-conditioning plants, swimming pools and hot-
      tub pools (WHO, 2006a; Bartram et al., 2007).
      All the stakeholders identified in section 3 need to have the appropriate skills to perform
      their specific functions related to provision of safe water supplies. This includes building
      commissioners and designers, building managers, employees, public health agencies,
      auditors, professional bodies and infection-control practitioners.
      It is not practical or realistic to expect that all stakeholders will have the capacity to
      perform all functions. Training will need to be tailored for each group of stakeholders.
      Training provided to employees responsible for drinking-water systems will differ from
      training provided to employees responsible for water-cooled air-conditioning plants,
      swimming pools or hydrotherapy pools. However, all stakeholders need to have a basic
      understanding of risk-management principles associated with WSPs, including the
      identification of hazards, the assessment of risks and management strategies applied to
      control these risks. Each stakeholder should be aware of how their specific responsibilities
      fit within and contribute to the design and implementation of WSPs. They also need to be
      aware of the consequences of failure. Too often, this is not the case (Hrudey & Hrudey,
      2005).
      Overall, therefore, training programmes must be coordinated to ensure consistency of
      intent and understanding. In this way, all activities associated with water systems can
      contribute to a consistently high standard of design, construction, operation, maintenance
      and management.
      General training should be available on:
      • risk-management principles;
      • development and application of WSPs; this should include training on applying WSPs
        in specialized settings (e.g. for infection control in medical and dental surgeries and
        renal dialysis clinics);
      • risk assessment;
      • control measures, including treatment;
      • operational procedures, including monitoring and maintenance;
      • emergency actions and responses.

      In addition, specialized training may include the following components:
      • For professionals involved in designing or modifying buildings and water networks
         –    water-quality regulation, standards and guidelines
         –    information on the importance of water quality and implications of failure
         –    setting water-quality targets (e.g. environmental and building quality labels,
              certification)



108    Water safety in buildings
   –   prevention of microbiological and chemical contamination, including major
       mistakes to be avoided (e.g. poor-quality water resources; accidental or
       unintended cross-connections; poor design of water distribution networks, waste
       systems and venting systems; poor design of storage systems)
   –   maintenance and sampling requirements.
• For plumbers
   –   water-quality regulations, standards and guidelines
   –   responsibilities and legal obligations
   –   evidence of links between construction practices and water quality at the tap
       (e.g. impacts of welding practices on resistance to corrosion, use of incompatible
       materials, inappropriate pipe diameters, accidental or unintended cross-
       connections)
   –   water-system design, construction rules and good practices.
• For auditors
   –   detailed knowledge of national and local water standards and guidelines
       applying to system design and construction
   –   detailed knowledge of all aspects of WSPs
   –   auditing practices applied to the domain of water quality.
• For regulators
   –   understanding determinants of other disciplines that affect WSPs in their domain
       (e.g. health regulators should have an understanding of the main determinants of
       building design and construction)
   –   building and plumbing regulations, standards and codes of practice.
• For building managers
   –   importance of water quality and implications of failure
   –   water-quality regulation, standards and guidelines
   –   responsibilities and legal obligations
   –   water-system design and construction
   –   WSPs
   –   maintenance and surveillance of water systems
   –   supervision of water-system audits and risk assessments
   –   event and incident management
   –   audits of contractors’ qualifications and competence.

      • For employees responsible for specific installations (e.g. water-cooled air-conditioning
        plants, swimming pools, hydrotherapy pools)
         –    importance of water quality and implications of failure
         –    detailed knowledge of national and local design, construction, auditing and
              maintenance standards and guidelines for such installations
         –    prevention of microbiological and chemical contamination specific to such
              installations
         –    periodic feedback from others’ field experience and major mistakes to be
              avoided (e.g. through specialist workshops, industry associations).

      Mechanisms for providing this training and building capacity include formal courses
      that are accredited by national educational agencies, professional associations, industry-
      operated training courses, in-house training and mentor programmes, workshops, seminars
      and conferences. Training could be provided in stand-alone courses or within broader
      training programmes provided for specialists such as infection-control practitioners or
      plumbers. Where possible, training should be supported by provision of manuals, fact
      sheets and guidelines on websites. Contact details for appropriate experts or appropriate
      agencies should also be provided.
      Feedback from field experience should be organized and documented to support training
      programmes, so that professionals can benefit from others’ experience. Training and
      information sessions based on the presentation of field experience have been found to
      attract high levels of interest and increase the recognition and appreciation of water-quality
      issues and shared responsibilities. This type of networking and sharing of experiences can
      be valuable and effective. It should be encouraged.
      Training should be documented, and records of all employees who have participated
      in training should be maintained. Skills and knowledge need to be maintained through
      attendance at refresher courses or at workshops and seminars that can reinforce existing
      qualifications.

Glossary

Accreditation               An official authorization or certification to a person, organization
                            or laboratory that has the credential to deliver certain tasks;
                            certification to a laboratory, institution or someone who has met
                            the standard required by an official authority (WHO, 2009).
                            Accreditation provides an independent assessment of
                            competency that provides confidence to users of services.
Actor                       Individuals, groups or organizations that influence the
                            overall safe management of building water supplies,
                            including those who design, construct, manage, operate,
                            maintain and regulate building water systems.
Aerosol                     A suspension of fine solid or liquid particles in a gas, such as air.
Backflow                    The unintended reverse flow of water or other substances
                            into distribution pipes of drinking-water from an unintended
                            source that is capable of polluting the drinking-water
                            (American Society of Sanitary Engineering, 2007).
Backflow protection         Devices that prevent backflow (e.g. one-way valves, air gaps).
Back-siphonage              The reverse flow of water within a water-supply system
                            due to negative pressures in the pipe system, enabling
                            atmospheric pressure to force the flow of water backwards
                            through a siphon action (World Plumbing Council, 2008).
                            The reversing of normal flow resulting from negative or
                            subatmospheric pressures in the distribution piping of a
                            drinking-water supply system (WHO and WPC, 2006).
Biocide                     A diverse group of poisonous substances, including preservatives,
                            insecticides, disinfectants and pesticides, used to control
                            organisms that are harmful to human or animal health, or
                            that cause damage to natural or manufactured products.
Biofilm                     A slimy matrix produced and inhabited by bacteria,
                            which enables the bacteria to adhere to a surface and
                            carry out certain essential biochemical processes.
Certification (personnel)   A programme to substantiate the capabilities of personnel
                            by documenting their experience and learning in a
                            defined area of endeavour (Symons et al., 2000).
Community acquired          Cases of illness that are not acquired in a health-care, travel or
                            domestic (i.e. the patient’s home) setting (Bartram et al., 2007).
                            Community-acquired cases of legionellosis can almost always be
                            attributed to inhalation of aerosols from devices such as cooling
                            towers, hot tubs, industrial equipment and indoor fountains.

                                                                                 Glossary    135
 Hardness                             Hardness in water is caused by dissolved calcium and, to a lesser
                                      extent, magnesium. It is expressed as the equivalent quantity
                                      of calcium carbonate. Hardness above about 200 mg/litre can
                                      result in scale deposition, particularly on heating. No health-
                                      based guideline value is proposed for hardness (WHO, 2008).
                                      Hardness is caused mainly by the presence of calcium and
                                      magnesium in the water. Scale formation and excessive soap
                                      consumption are the main concerns. When heated, hard waters
                                      have a tendency to form scale deposits, which shorten the life
                                      of water heaters and other appliances (Health Canada, 2009).
 Hazard                               In the context of this document, a hazard is a biological,
                                      chemical or physical agent in water, or a condition of water,
                                      with the potential to cause an adverse health effect.
 Hazard identification                The identification of the type and nature of adverse
                                      effects that an agent has an inherent capacity to cause
                                      in an organism, system, or (sub)population.
 Hazardous event                      An event that introduces hazards to, or fails to remove
                                      them from, the water supply (Bartram et al., 2009).
 Health-based target                  Target based on critical evaluation of health concerns.
 Hot tub                              Facilities that are designed for sitting in (rather than swimming);
                                      contain water usually above 32 °C; are generally aerated; contain
                                      treated water; and are not drained, cleaned or refilled for each user.
                                      Hot tubs are also called spa pools, whirlpools,
                                      whirlpool spas and heated spas.
 Infection                            The entry and development or multiplication of an
                                      infectious agent in a host. Infection may or may not lead
                                      to disease symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea) (WHO, 2006b).
                                      The entry and development or multiplication of an
                                      infectious agent in the body of humans and animals that
                                      may constitute a public health risk (WHO, 2005).
                                      The presence in the body of viruses or organisms, such
                                      as bacteria, protozoa, fungi or helminths, which multiply
                                      or develop, completing all or part of their lifecycle within
                                      the tissues of an animal or human host (infection may or
                                      may not lead to a disease state) (WHO et al., 1996).
 Legislation (primary                 Law enacted by a legislative body or the act of
 and secondary)                       making or enacting laws (WHO, 2006b).
                                      Primary legislation is the law-making legislation, which
                                      is also known as enabling legislation, and can be
                                      found in the form of an Act, a statute or a bill.
                                      Subordinate legislation is legislation that is subordinate to the
                                      primary law-making legislation. It cannot make laws or change
                                      Acts, statutes or bills (World Plumbing Council, 2008).

Monitoring               The act of conducting a planned sequence of observations
                         or measurements of control parameters, to assess whether
                         a control point is operating within design specifications.
Multiple barrier         The multiple barrier approach in drinking-water is the
approach                 concept of using more than one type of protection
                         or treatment in series in a water-treatment process
                         to control contamination (Symons et al., 2000).
Operational monitoring   The act of conducting a planned sequence of observations
                         or measurements of control parameters to assess whether
                         a control measure is operating within design specifications
                         (e.g. for wastewater turbidity treatment) (WHO, 2008).
Outbreak                 An epidemic limited to localized increase in the
                         incidence of a disease (e.g. in a village, town or
                         closed institution) (McMichael et al., 2003).
                         A waterborne outbreak is a situation in which at
                         least two people experience a similar illness after
                         exposure to water (and possibly food) and the evidence
                         suggests a probable water source (WHO, 2007).
Pathogens                Any microorganisms that cause disease in an organism,
                         through direct interaction (infection) (Schmoll et al, 2006).
pH                       The pH of a solution is the negative common logarithm of the
                         hydrogen ion activity (WHO, 2008):
                                                      pH = –log (H+)
                         An expression of the intensity of the basic or

 Recycled water                     Water that has been treated so that its quality is suitable
                                    for particular specified purposes, such as irrigation, toilet
                                    flushing or possibly drinking (WHO, 2006b). Sources
                                    of recycled water include sewage and greywater.
 Risk                               The probability of an adverse effect in an organism,
                                    system, or (sub)population caused under specified
                                    circumstances by exposure to an agent (WHO, 2008).
                                    The likelihood of a hazard causing harm in exposed
                                    populations in a specified time frame, including
                                    the magnitude of that harm (WHO, 2008).
 Risk assessment                    A process intended to calculate or estimate the risk to a
                                    given target organism, system, or (sub)population, including
                                    the identification of attendant uncertainties, following
                                    exposure to a particular agent, taking into account the
                                    inherent characteristics of the agent of concern, as well
                                    as the characteristics of the specific target system.
                                    The overall process of using available information
                                    to predict how often hazards or specified events
                                    may occur (likelihood) and the magnitude of their
                                    consequences (adapted from AS/NZS 4360:1999).
 Risk management                    Decision-making process involving considerations of political, social,
                                    economic and technical factors with relevant risk-assessment
                                    information relating to a hazard so as to develop, analyse, and
                                    compare regulatory and non-regulatory options, and to select and
                                    implement appropriate regulatory response to that hazard. Risk
                                    management comprises three elements: risk evaluation, emission
                                    and exposure control, and risk monitoring (WHO, 2004a).
                                    The systemic evaluation of the water-supply system, the
                                    identification of hazards and hazardous events, the assessment
                                    of risks, and the development and implementation of
                                    preventive strategies to manage risks (WHO, 2006b).
 Sensitive or vulnerable            Vulnerable groups or populations are people who might
 population                         be vulnerable to the effects of exposure because of their
                                    development stage (e.g. children) or because of pre-existing
                                    health conditions (e.g. asthmatics and air pollution).
 Spa pool                           A facility that is designed for sitting in (rather than swimming);
                                    contains treated water usually above 32 °C; is usually aerated; and
                                    is not drained, cleaned or refilled for each user. Also known as a hot
                                    tub, whirlpool, whirlpool spa, heated spa, bubble bath or jacuzzi.
 Stakeholder                        Person or entity with an interest or ‘stake’ in the outcome
                                    of a particular action or policy (McMichael et al., 2003).
 Storage (cistern)                  Tank or storage container in which water is stored
                                    (American Society of Sanitary Engineering, 2007).

Water safety plan        A comprehensive risk-assessment and risk-
                         management approach that encompasses all steps in
                         water supply, from catchment to consumer.
Water system (external   An external system is one that provides multiple users
or building-specific)    and can be either publicly or privately owned.
                         A building-specific supply is defined as an individual
                         and isolated drinking-water system that is
                         distinct from any external water system.

146      Water safety in buildings
Extensive experience shows that poor design and management of water systems in buildings
can cause outbreaks of disease. The types of building, water uses, disease outcomes and
individuals affected are diverse. The health risks are preventable and can be readily controlled.
However, evidence from outbreak detection suggests that the overall trend is increasing.
With increasing global urbanization, the overall exposure of the human population to poorly
designed or managed water systems in buildings is increasing rapidly. Consequently, the
risk of disease outbreaks is also increasing. Actions to reduce the risk of disease should
be considered a public health priority.

This document provides guidance for managing water supplies in buildings where people
may drink water; use water for food preparation; wash, shower, swim or use water for other
recreational activities; or be exposed to aerosols produced by water-using devices, such
as cooling towers. These uses occur in a variety of buildings, such as hospitals, schools,
child and aged care facilities, medical and dental facilities, hotels, apartment blocks, sport
centres, commercial buildings and transport terminals.

This text is one of a series of supporting documents that provide guidance on implementing
the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for drinking-water quality (WHO, 2008). It is
intended to support the improvement of water safety within buildings.

overall safe management of building water supplies. In particular, it is directed at those
who design, construct, manage, operate, maintain and regulate building water systems.
This document is intended to be a useful resource for the development of training and
information material.
