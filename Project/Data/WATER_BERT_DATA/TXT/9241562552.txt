Microbial contamination of drinking-water contributes to disease outbreaks and
background rates of disease in developed and developing countries worldwide.
Control of waterborne disease is an important element of public health policy
and an objective of water suppliers.
   The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Guidelines for
Drinking-water Quality. These guidelines, which are now in their third edition
(WHO, 2004), provide an internationally harmonized basis to help countries to
develop standards, regulations and norms that are appropriate to national and
local circumstances. The latest edition of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-
water Quality is structured around an overall “water safety framework”, used to
develop supply-specific “water safety plans”. The framework, which focuses on
health protection and preventive management from catchment to consumer, has
five key components:
    • health-based targets, based on an evaluation of health concerns;
    • system assessment to determine whether the drinking-water supply
         (from source through treatment to the point of consumption) as a whole
         can deliver water of a quality that meets the health-based targets;

                                       (ix)
x                    Water treatment and pathogen control

    •    operational monitoring of the control measures in the drinking-water
         supply that are of particular importance in securing drinking-water
         safety;
    •    management plans that document the system assessment and monitoring
         plans, and describe actions to be taken in normal operation and incident
         conditions (including upgrade and improvement, and documentation
         and communication);
    •    a system of independent surveillance to verify that the above are
         operating properly.

    Understanding the effectiveness of water treatment is necessary for:
    • design of cost-effective interventions
    • review of the adequacy of existing structures
    • operation of facilities to maximum benefit.

    WHO has also developed a series of expert reviews covering various aspects
of microbial water quality and health (listed below). This publication forms part
of this series of reviews.

   Water safety management demands a quantitiative understanding of how
processes and actions affect water quality, which in turn requires an
understanding of risk assessment. This volume is intended to provide guidance
on using risk assessment when selecting appropriate treatment processes, to
ensure the production of high quality drinking-water. It is hoped that it will be
useful to water utilities, water quality specialists and design engineers.

This document is part of a series of expert reviews on different aspects of microbial
water quality and health, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to
inform development of guidelines for drinking-water quality, and to help countries
and suppliers to develop and implement effective water safety plans.
   Contamination of drinking-water by microbial pathogens can cause disease
outbreaks and contribute to background rates of disease. There are many
treatment options for eliminating pathogens from drinking-water. Finding the
right solution for a particular supply involves choosing from a range of
processes. This document is a critical review of some of the literature on
removal and inactivation of pathogenic microbes in water. The aim is to provide
water quality specialists and design engineers with guidance on selecting
appropriate treatment processes, to ensure the production of high quality
drinking-water. Specifically, the document provides information on choosing
appropriate treatment in relation to raw water quality, estimating pathogen
concentrations in drinking-water, assessing the ability of treatment processes to
achieve health-based water safety targets and identifying control measures in
process operation.

                                         (xvii)
xviii               Water treatment and pathogen control

    Processes for removal of microbes from water include pretreatment;
coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation; and filtration. Pretreatment can
broadly be defined as any process to modify microbial water quality before, or
at the entry to, the treatment plant. Pretreatment processes include application of
roughing filters, microstrainers, off-stream storage and bank infiltration, each
with a particular function and water quality benefit. Applications of these
pretreatment processes include removal of algal cells, high levels of turbidity,
viruses and protozoan cysts.
    For conventional treatment processes, chemical coagulation is critical for
effective removal of microbial pathogens. Together, coagulation, flocculation
and sedimentation can result in 1–2 log removals of bacteria, viruses and
protozoa. For waters with high levels of algae, care must be taken to remove
these organisms without disrupting the cells, which may release liver or nerve
toxins. High-rate clarification using solids contact clarification, ballasted-floc,
or contact clarification systems can be as, or more, effective than conventional
basins for removal of microbes. Dissolved air flotation can be particularly
effective for removal of algal cells and Cryptosporidium oocysts. Lime
softening can provide good microbial treatment through a combination of
inactivation by high pH and removal by sedimentation.
    Granular media filtration is widely used in drinking-water treatment. It
removes microbes through a combination of physical–hydrodynamic properties
and surface and solution chemistry. Under optimal conditions, the combination
of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and granular media filtration can
result in 4-log or better removal of protozoan pathogens. However, without
proper chemical pretreatment, this type of rapid rate filtration works as a simple
strainer and is not an effective barrier to microbial pathogens. Slow sand
filtration works through a combination of biological and physical–chemical
interactions. The biological layer of the filter, termed schmutzdecke, is important
for effective removal of microbial pathogens. Precoat filtration was initially
developed as a portable unit to remove Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan
parasite. In this process, water is forced under pressure or by vacuum through a
uniformly thin layer of filtering material, typically diatomaceous earth. As with
granular media filtration, proper chemical conditioning of the water improves
the treatment efficiency of precoat filtration. In contrast, membrane filtration
removes microbial pathogens primarily by size exclusion (without the need for
coagulation), and is effective in removing microbes larger than the membrane
pore size.
    Oxidants may be added to water for a variety of purposes, such as control of
taste and odour compounds, removal of iron and manganese, control of zebra
mussel and removal of particles. For microbial pathogens, application of strong
oxidizing compounds such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide or ozone will act as
                               Executive summary                               xix

disinfectants, inactivating microbial cells through a variety of chemical
pathways. Principal factors that influence inactivation efficiency of these agents
are the disinfectant concentration, contact time, temperature and pH. In applying
disinfectants, it is important to take into account data on CT (disinfectant
concentration multiplied by the contact time) for the specific disinfectant.
Ultraviolet light (UV) inactivates microorganisms through reactions with
microbial nucleic acids and is particularly effective for control of
Cryptosporidium.
   For control of microbes within the distribution system, disinfectants must
interact with bacteria growing in pipeline biofilms or contaminating the system.
The mechanism of disinfection within the distribution system differs from that
of primary treatment. Factors important in secondary disinfection include
disinfectant stability and transport into biofilms, disinfectant type and residual,
pipe material, corrosion and other engineering and operational parameters.
   Performance models can help in understanding and predicting the
effectiveness of granular media filtration processes for removal of particles and
microbes. Similarly, equations can be useful in predicting microbial inactivation
by disinfectants. It is also useful to consider variability in processes and in
measurements to determine the overall effectiveness of treatment to control
microbial risk. At present, performance models cannot precisely define
microbial treatment effectiveness. This leads the operator back to the monitoring
and control of critical points within the treatment process. The combined effect
of these control measures ensures that the microbial water quality of the treated
water meets or surpasses risk goals for the potable water supply.
   A water safety plan combines elements of a “hazard analysis and critical
control point” (HACCP) approach, quality managment and the “multiple
barriers” principle, to provide a preventive management approach specifically
developed for drinking-water supply. It can provide a framework for evaluating
microbial control measures by helping to focus attention on process steps such
as coagulation, filtration and disinfection, which are important for ensuring the
microbial safety of water. Many current practices already employ some
elements of a water safety plan, and this type of approach is likely to become
more clearly defined in water treatment practices in the future.

Introduction




1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This publication is a critical review of removal and inactivation of microbial
pathogens by drinking-water treatment processes. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on
removal and inactivation processes respectively, in terms of their operational
principles, mechanisms and efficiency. Chapter 4 presents performance models
for granular filtration and disinfection, two of the most important barriers for
microbes, and illustrates how these models can be used to determine the effects
of process variables on treatment efficiency. Chapter 5 looks at measures of
process variation, including uncertainty in treatment effects and problems
associated with the use of surrogates. Finally, Chapter 6 illustrates how an
approach based on a water safety framework can be used to minimize microbial
hazards in water.

2                   Water treatment and pathogen control

   The review focuses on bacteria, viruses, protozoan parasites and microbial
toxins, and their removal from source water by various treatment processes. The
aim is help water utilities to:
    • choose appropriate treatment in relation to raw water quality
    • estimate pathogen concentrations in drinking-water
    • assess the ability of treatment processes to achieve health-based water
         safety targets
    • identify control measures in process operation.

   This review does not attempt to cite all the relevant literature; rather, it
highlights information that illustrates the performance of each treatment process.
Where possible, it provides quantitative information on the removal or
inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and toxins. Also, it considers (and,
where possible, quantifies) interactions between the effects of different
treatment processes.
   The information is given at different levels of detail:
    • The first level estimates the order of magnitude of the expected effect
        under typical process conditions and proper operating conditions. This
        level of detail allows simple decision trees for the choice of a treatment
        chain to be constructed.
    • The second level identifies the process parameters (both design and
        monitoring) that are most relevant to the treatment effect, and quantifies
        the effect of these parameters. Where possible, mathematical models are
        used to describe these relations. This level of detail allows control
        measures and their operational limits to be identified. There is an
        emphasis on physical and chemical parameters; microbiological

    • The third level identifies and quantifies any variability and uncertainty
        in the treatment effect that is not explained by the process parameters.
        This level of detail allows exposure to pathogens to be assessed within
        the framework of a formal risk assessment procedure.


1.2 MULTIPLE BARRIERS
For centuries, the process of providing safe drinking-water has relied on the
application of the ‘multiple barrier concept’. Hippocrates (460–354 B.C.), writes
in Air, Water and Places — the first treatise on public hygiene, that ‘qualities of
the waters differ from one another in taste and weight’. One should ‘consider the
waters which the inhabitants use, whether they be marshy and soft, or hard and
running from elevated and rocky situations, and then if saltish and unfit for
cooking …. for water contributes much to health’ (Baker, 1948).
                                   Introduction                                  3

   The concept of multiple barriers for water treatment is the cornerstone of safe
drinking-water production. The barriers are selected so that the removal
capabilities of different steps in the treatment process are duplicated. This
approach provides sufficient backup to allow continuous operation in the face of
normal fluctuations in performance, which will typically include periods of
ineffectiveness. Having multiple barriers means that a failure of one barrier can
be compensated for by effective operation of the remaining barriers, minimizing
the likelihood that contaminants will pass through the treatment system and
harm consumers. Traditionally, the barriers have included:
    • protection of source water (water used for drinking-water should
         originate from the highest quality source possible);
    • coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation;
    • filtration;
    • disinfection;
    • protection of the distribution system.

    If these conventional barriers are thought to be inadequate, it may be
advisable to consider adding multiple stages of filtration or disinfection.
    The benefit of multiple treatment barriers is illustrated by a recent
epidemiological study of a karstic groundwater system where one well was
filtered and chlorinated while a second was only chlorinated (Beaudeau et al.,
1999). Increases in sales of antidiarrheal drugs correlated strongly with lapses in
chlorination of the well that had disinfection as the only treatment. In contrast,
no effect could be traced to lapses in chlorination of the filtered well. The
combination of filtration and chlorination appeared to provide sufficient
duplication in removal of contaminants that temporary lapses in disinfection did
not generate a measurable adverse outcome (Beaudeau et al., 1999).


1.3 PROCESS CONTROL MEASURES
There are many different microbes that may be of concern in source waters or
within the distribution system. Developing a monitoring scheme for each would
be an impossible task; therefore, another approach is needed. The food and
beverage industry has used the “hazard analysis critical control point” (HACCP)
approach to determine the key points within the manufacturing chain where
contamination can be measured and prevented. A similar concept can be used by
water utilities, to prioritize the key contamination points within the treatment
and distribution system (Bryan, 1993; Sobsey et al., 1993). This approach
allows utilities to focus their resources on monitoring these points and
correcting any deviations from acceptable limits. The latest edition of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (WHO,
4                   Water treatment and pathogen control

2004) incorporates such an approach, providing guidance on the development of
a water safety plan. The plan is developed using a water safety framework,
which combines HACCP principles with water quality management and the
multiple barrier concept.

   Most microbiological monitoring programs for drinking-water have not been
designed using such a framework. However, many of the relevant concepts are
found in the overall process control of water treatment plants and distribution
systems. For example, maintaining a disinfectant residual within the distribution
system can be considered a control procedure.
   The water safety framework is not only applicable to microbial monitoring of
drinking-water treatment; it can also be applied to aspects such as turbidity,
disinfectant residuals, pressure and particle counts. A strength of the framework
is that it allows water utilities to allocate limited laboratory resources to
monitoring points within the water supply process where the results will provide
the greatest information and benefit.

Removal processes




This chapter considers various processes for removal of microbes from water. In
particular, it discusses:
    • pretreatment — broadly defined as any process to modify microbial
        water quality before, or at the entry to, a treatment plant;
    • coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation — by which small particles
        interact to form larger particles and settle out by gravity;
    • ion exchange — used for removal of calcium, magnesium and some
        radionuclides;
    • granular filtration — in which water passes through a bed of granular
        materials after coagulation pretreatment;
    • slow sand filtration — in which water is passed slowly through a sand
        filter by gravity, without the use of coagulation pretreatment.

2.1 PRETREATMENT
This section describes some of the processes that can be used in pretreatment of
water (roughing filters, microstrainers, off-stream storage and bank infiltration),
each of which has a particular function and water quality benefit. Applications
of pretreatment include removal of algal cells, high levels of turbidity, viruses
and protozoan cysts The various options for pretreatment may be compatible
with a variety of treatment processes, ranging in complexity from simple
disinfection to membrane filtration.

2.1.1 Roughing filters
A roughing filter is a coarse media (typically rock or gravel) filter used to
reduce turbidity levels before processes such as slow sand filtration,
diatomaceous earth (DE) or membrane filtration. The American Water Works
Association Research Foundation (AWWARF) has reviewed design variables
for roughing filters (Collins et al., 1994). Such filters typically have a filter box
divided into multiple sections containing gravel beds of decreasing particle size,
inlet and outlet structures, and flow-control devices. Examples of common
configurations are shown in Figure 2.1.
   Roughing filters have achieved peak turbidity removals ranging from 60 to
90%; generally, the more turbid the water initially, the greater the reduction that
can be achieved (Galvis, Fernandez & Visscher, 1993; Collins et al., 1994;
Ahsan, Alaerts & Buiteman, 1996). These filters can achieve similar reductions
of coliform bacteria. Pilot studies of various roughing filter configurations
(horizontal-flow, up-flow and down-flow) reduced faecal coliform bacteria by
93–99.5% (Galvis, Fernandez & Visscher, 1993). These filters were also
combined with a dynamic roughing filter (which contains a thin layer of fine
gravel on top of a shallow bed of coarse gravel, with a system of underdrains) to
pretreat high turbidity events, and achieved faecal coliform removal of 86.3%.
When followed by slow sand filtration, the removal reached 99.8%, with an
overall combined treatment efficiency of 4.9–5.5 log units. In a five-month pilot
study of a medium gravel (5.5 mm) horizontal roughing filter in Texas City,
United States of America (USA), the filter removed on average 47% of total
bacteria (as measured by epifluorescence microscopy), 37% of the source water
algal cells and 53% of the total chlorophyll (Collins et al., 1994). The
researchers found that the roughing filters removed clay particles more
effectively when the filter was ripened with algal cells. Addition of alum
coagulant before treatment with a horizontal roughing filter improved the filter’s
performance for turbidity, colour, organic carbon, head loss and filter run length
(Ahsan, Alaerts & Buiteman, 1996).

2.1.2 Microstrainers
Microstrainers are fabric meshes woven of stainless steel or polyester wires,
with apertures ranging from 15 to 45 µm (usually 30–35 µm). Such meshes are
useful for removing algal cells and large protozoa (e.g. Balantidium coli), but
have no significant impact on bacteria or viruses. Microstrainers generally
remove about 40–70% of algae and, at the same time, about 5–20% of turbidity
(Mouchet & Bonnelye, 1998). The performance of microstrainers for specific
applications varies, depending on the type of algae present, as summarized in
Table 2.1. Although microstrainers can reduce the amount of coagulant needed,
they do not remove smaller species or reproductive forms of algae.

2.1.3 Off-stream storage
In this discussion, off-stream storage refers to a storage reservoir that directly or
indirectly feeds a potable water intake. The effects of off-stream storage are
difficult to generalize because important physical, biological and chemical
processes are influenced by hydrological and limnological characteristics of the
reservoir. For example, ‘round’ reservoirs and lowland impoundments
influenced by strong winds can be represented as homogeneous biotypes
because they are mixed effectively. On the other hand, long reservoirs whose
depth increases with length are best represented as a series of interconnected
individual basins (Bernhardt, 1995). The characteristics of reservoirs created by
construction of a dam will differ from those of a natural or artificial lake.
   Oskam (1995) summarized the self-purification processes that improve water
quality in off-stream reservoirs (Table 2.2). The major factors that influence
these processes are the degree of compartmentalization, the hydraulic residence
time, the shape and flow through the reservoir, and the quality of the source
water. Certain processes can also degrade water quality; for example, poorer
quality of the impounded water can result from failure to:
    • manage algal growth;
    • control influx of nitrogen, phosphorus or other contaminants;
    • limit faecal contamination from run-off of surrounding areas or roosting
         birds.

                    hydrocarbons
Adapted from Oskam (1995)

    In a study by Bernhardt (1995), coliform bacteria in dammed reservoirs were
reduced by 80–99% when residence times were greater than 40 days, and
allochthonous bacteria were reduced by 90–99% when retention times exceeded
about 100 days. Kors & Bosch (1995) reported reductions of enteroviruses
(1.5 logs), Kjeldahl nitrogen (50%), total phosphorus (60%) and ammonium (70%)
for a pumped, off-stream reservoir after about 100 days retention time. Stewart et al.
(1997) examined storm events that washed high levels of Giardia cysts (up to
17 000 cysts/100 l) and Cryptosporidium oocysts (up to 42 000 oocysts/100 l) into
receiving reservoirs. Only one of 29 reservoir effluent samples was positive,
suggesting that the cysts and oocysts had become trapped in sediments that settled to
the bottom of the reservoir, because unattached organisms settle slowly (Medema et
al., 1998). Hawkins et al. (2000) reported complete elimination of Cryptosporidium
spikes (i.e. high concentrations) within three weeks in the 2 million megalitre Lake
Burragorang reservoir that provides source water for Sydney (Australia). The
authors calculated a settling rate of 5–10 metres/day and postulated that
sedimentation was accelerated by oocysts clumping with other suspended particles.
In a study of three reservoirs in Biesbosch (Netherlands), storage with long
residence times (average 24 weeks) resulted in reductions of 2.3 logs for Giardia,
1.4–1.9 logs for Cryptosporidium, 2.2 logs for Escherichia coli and 1.7 logs for
faecal streptococci (Ketelaars et al., 1995; van Breemen & Waals, 1998).
    The die-off kinetics for microbes can be modelled as a first-order reaction
dependent on the residence time and short-circuiting (i.e. the decrease in hydraulic
10                   Water treatment and pathogen control

residence time in a vessel) (Oskam, 1995). For relatively rapid removal rates (k-
values > 0.05/day), the degree of compartmentalization has a positive effect on
water quality. Therefore, a series of three or four smaller reservoirs would be better
than one large impoundment. With estimated k-values of 0.07/day for removal of
Giardia and Cryptosporidium, and 0.13/day for enteric viruses,
compartmentalization in three or four reservoirs would increase the removal effect to
15–230 times that achieved by a single basin (Oskam, 1995).
   For reservoirs with short retention times (and therefore limited self-purification),
the raw water pumping schedule can be used to improve water quality, by avoiding
periods of source water contamination. For example, in a study of the Delaware
River (USA), peak levels of microbial contaminants were associated with high
levels of turbidity following rainfall events (LeChevallier et al., 1998). By operating
the source water pumps to avoid these peak events, levels of Giardia and
Cryptosporidium 12–16 times higher than normal were avoided.

2.1.4 Bank infiltration
Bank infiltration refers to the process of surface water seeping from the bank or bed
of a river or lake to the production wells of a water treatment plant. During the
water’s passage through the ground, its quality changes due to microbial, chemical
and physical processes, and due to mixing with groundwater. The process can also
be described as ‘induced infiltration,’ because the well-field pumping lowers the
water table, causing surface water to flow into the aquifer under a hydraulic
gradient. Bank infiltration can be accomplished through natural seepage into
receiving ponds, shallow vertical or horizontal wells placed in alluvial sand and
gravel deposits adjacent to surface waters, and infiltration galleries.
    Bank infiltration has been widely used in European countries and is of increased
interest in many other countries. Variations on the underground passage concept
include soil aquifer treatment, injection of surface water for underground passage
and aquifer recharge.
    The advantages of bank infiltration are summarized in Table 2.3. The efficiency
of the process depends on a number of factors: the quality of the surface water
(turbidity, dissolved organic matter, oxygen, ammonia and nutrients), the
composition and porosity of the soil, the residence time of the water in the soil and
the temperature. This efficiency can vary over time, depending on the difference in
level between the source water (e.g. river stage) and groundwater. This difference
can influence the degree of groundwater mixing and the residence time of the
infiltrated surface water.

   Concern about groundwater under the direct influence of surface water has
caused some confusion about how to regard bank infiltration. Clearly, this
process is under the direct influence of surface water; however, in the USA, the
Surface Water Treatment Rule (USEPA, 1989a) does not consider the
infiltration process as contributing to water treatment.
   In a study of the Grand River in Ontario (Canada), removal of algae and
diatoms ranged from 4.8 to 7.2 logs when the quality of the collection well was
compared to the raw water (Clancy & Stendahl, 1997). No Giardia or
Cryptosporidium were detected in the collector wells, although these protozoa
were frequently detected in the river water. Figure 2.2 shows the relationship
between the concentration of algae and the theoretical flow-path distance for
wells along the Great Miami River at Cincinnati (USA), with approximately
1 log reduction for every 8.5 m (28 ft) of separation from the source water
(Gollnitz, Cossins & DeMarco, 1997). Schijven and Rietveld (1997) measured
the removal of male-specific coliphage, enteroviruses and reoviruses at three
infiltration sites, and compared the measured values to those predicted by a
virus transport model. They found a 3.1-log reduction of bacteriophage within
2 m (6.6 ft) and a 4.0-log reduction within 4 m (13.2 ft) of very fine dune sand.
Phage levels were reduced by 6.2 logs through riverbank infiltration over 30 m
(98 ft) of sandy soil. In all cases, enteroviruses and reoviruses were eliminated
to below detection limits (> 2.6 to > 4.8 log removals). The virus transport
model corresponded reasonably well with the measured results, producing
calculated removals ranging from 2.5 to 15 logs.
   In studies being conducted by the American Water Works Service Company
and the Johns Hopkins University, monitoring of three river bank infiltration
systems along the Wabash, Ohio and Missouri rivers (USA) have shown
complete removal of Clostridium and bacteriophage indicators (Table 2.4) and
substantial reductions in biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and
assimilable organic carbon (AOC), which can stimulate bacterial growth in
distribution system pipelines (Ainsworth, 2004). These data indicate that bank
infiltration can be highly effective for removal of microbial contaminants.

2.2 COAGULATION, FLOCCULATION AND
    SEDIMENTATION
Coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation are used in conjunction with
subsequent filtration. These processes are summarized below.
   • Coagulation promotes the interaction of small particles to form larger
       particles. In practice, the term refers to coagulant addition (i.e. addition
       of a substance that will form the hydrolysis products that cause
       coagulation), particle destabilization and interparticle collisions.
   • Flocculation is the physical process of producing interparticle contacts
       that lead to the formation of large particles.
   • Sedimentation is a solid–liquid separation process, in which particles
       settle under the force of gravity.

   Excellent reviews of these processes are available (Gregory, Zabel &
Edzwald, 1999; Letterman, Amirtharajah & O’Melia, 1999). With respect to
coagulation and flocculation, most bacteria and protozoa can be considered as
particles, and most viruses as colloidal organic particles.

2.2.1 Conventional clarification
Efficiency of conventional clarification
Conventional clarification typically refers to chemical addition, rapid mixing,
flocculation and sedimentation (usually in a rectangular basin). Removal of
particles depends mainly on the terminal settling velocity of the particles and the
rate of basin surface loading or overflow. The efficiency of the sedimentation
process may be improved by using inclined plates or tubes. For conventional
treatment processes, chemical coagulation is critical for effective removal of
microbial pathogens. In the absence of a chemical coagulant, removal of
microbes is low because sedimentation velocities are low (Medema et al., 1998).
A chemical coagulant destabilizes microbial particles (e.g. by neutralizing or
reducing their surface electrical charge, enmeshing them in a floc particle or
creating bridges between them) and allows particles to come into contact with
one another. Flocculation of microbial particles creates aggregates with
sufficient settling velocities to be removed in the sedimentation basin.
   When properly performed, coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation can
result in 1–2 log removals of bacteria, viruses and protozoa. However,
performance of full-scale, conventional clarification processes may be highly
14                  Water treatment and pathogen control

variable, depending on the degree of optimization. For example, in a report
summarizing the performance of treatment plants from various countries,
average microbial removals for coagulation and sedimentation ranged from 27
to 74% for viruses, 32 to 87% for bacteria (total coliforms or faecal
streptococci) and 0 to 94% for algae (Gimbel & Clasen, 1998). It is difficult to
interpret full-scale data for Cryptosporidium and Giardia because these
protozoa are found at very low levels, and methods for their detection have
limitations (LeChevallier et al., 1991).
    Factors that can result in poor clarification efficiency include variable plant
flow rates, improper dose of coagulant, poor process control with little
monitoring, shear of formed floc, inappropriate mixing of chemicals, poor
mixing and flocculation, and inadequate sludge removal (USEPA, 1991). In
addition to metallic coagulants (e.g. alum or ferric), it may be necessary to use
polymeric coagulation, filter aids or both to produce low turbidity levels
(< 0.1 nephelometric turbidity unit, NTU) especially for high-rate filtration
(> 2.71 l/m2s). Preoxidation with chlorine or ozone can improve particle
removal by sedimentation and filtration (Yates et al., 1997; Becker, O’Melia &
Croker, 1998). In some cases, treatment plants are being designed with
intermediate ozonation, specifically to aid in particle removal by sedimentation
and filtration (Langlais, Reckhow & Brink, 1991).
    Using jar tests, Bell et al. (2000) reported removal of bacteria (E. coli
vegetative cells and Clostridium perfringens spores) and protozoa (Giardia
cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts) as typically of 1–2 logs (Figure 2.3).
Overall, iron-based coagulants were slightly more efficient than alum
(aluminum hydroxide) or polyaluminium chloride (PACl); however, site-
specific water-quality conditions had a greater effect on removal efficiencies
than did the type of coagulant. Coagulation conditions (i.e. dose, pH,
temperature, alkalinity, turbidity and the level and type of natural organic
matter) affected the efficiency of removal, with slightly better overall microbial
reductions under pH conditions optimal for removal of total organic carbon (i.e.
pH 5–6.5).

Viruses
Figure 2.4 shows that different viruses may respond quite differently to
coagulation conditions. For example, the bacteriophage MS2 and human enteric
poliovirus are removed at a fairly high efficiency (2.6–3.4 logs), whereas the
phage PRD-1 and enteric echovirus are removed at a much lower rate (1.1–
1.9 logs). The differences in virus removal are most pronounced for alum.
Similar differences in virus adsorption have been observed in granulated gels
(Mouillot & Netter, 1977). It is evident that the effect of coagulation differs for
various viruses, and that it may be unwise to extrapolate the data on viruses to
other, untested viruses.

Protozoa
Haas et al. (2000) reviewed data from four bench-scale or pilot-plant studies for
coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The
authors selected data from studies where the coagulant type, coagulant dose, pH,
temperature and mixing conditions were described. Using 24 data points, they
found that oocyst removal depended on coagulant concentration, polymer
concentration and process pH. The model had an excellent fit to the data (R2 of
16                      Water treatment and pathogen control

0.94); however, the fit decreased when data from other studies were added to the
model. The authors concluded that additional data are needed, especially from
studies that fully describe coagulation and flocculation conditions.
    An optimal coagulation dose is the most important factor for ensuring
effective removal of cysts and oocysts by sedimentation and filtration (Logsdon
et al., 1985; Al-Ani et al., 1986; Logsdon, 1990; Bellamy et al., 1993). Impaired
flocculation was one of the factors in the 1987 outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in
Carrollton, Georgia (USA) (Bellamy et al., 1993). In a study of eight water
filtration plants, Hendricks et al. (1988) concluded:
     … without proper chemical pretreatment Giardia cysts will pass the filtration
     process. Lack of chemical coagulation or improper coagulation was the single
     most important factor in the design or operation of those rapid rate filtration plants
     where Giardia cysts were found in finished water … with proper chemical
     coagulation, the finished water should be free of Giardia cysts, have few
     microscopic particles and have turbidity levels less than 0.1 NTU [nephelometric
     turbidity units].

Algae
Coagulation and sedimentation can be effective for removal of algae, although
care must be taken to remove these organisms without disrupting the cells, as
this may release liver or nerve toxins. Generally, coagulation appears not to
cause the release of algal toxins, provided that oxidants are not added (Yoo et
al., 1995b). Coagulation and sedimentation are not very effective at removing
algal toxins; studies have shown removal levels ranging from 0 to 49%.
However, addition of powdered activated carbon to the clarification process can
increase removal levels to 90% or more, depending on the carbon dose, type of
carbon, toxin level and organic matrix (Yoo et al., 1995b). A natural coagulant
derived from shrimp shells (termed chitosan) was shown to be effective,
removing more than 90% of the algae Chlorella and Scenedesmus quadricuda at
neutral to alkaline pH conditions, using chitosan doses of more than 10 mg/l
(Chen, Liu & Ju, 1996).

2.2.2 High-rate clarification
High-rate clarification was first used in the 1930s, and it grew in popularity
during the 1970s and 1980s. It involves using smaller basins and higher surface
loading rates than conventional clarifiers, and is therefore referred to as high-
rate clarification. Processes include floc-blanket sedimentation (also known as
‘solids-contact clarification’), ballasted-floc sedimentation, and adsorption or
contact clarification.
   In floc-blanket sedimentation, a fluidized blanket increases the particle
concentration, thus increasing the rate of flocculation and sedimentation.
Ballasted-floc systems combine coagulation with sand, clay, magnetite or
carbon to increase the particle sedimentation rate. Adsorption or contact
clarification involves passing coagulated water through a bed where particles
attach to previously adsorbed material.
   High-rate clarifiers can be as effective as or even more effective than
conventional basins for removal of microbes. The choice of an appropriate
blanket polymer is important for optimal operation (Gregory, Zabel & Edzwald,
1999). Bell, Bienlien & LeChevallier (1998) reported turbidity removals of 98%
for a solids-contact, sludge blanket clarifier (raw water turbidity 20–50 NTU,
settled water 0.6–0.75 NTU), 89% for internal slurry recirculation (raw water
turbidity 4–10 NTU, settled water 0.5–0.9 NTU) and 61% for circular floc-
blanket purification unit clarification (raw water turbidity 1.2–16 NTU, settled
water average 0.97 NTU). Baudin & Laîné (1998) evaluated three full-scale
treatment plants and found complete removal (> 2–2.8 logs) of Giardia and
Cryptosporidium by pulsator clarifiers. The units produced a 1.0–2.7 log
removal of turbidity. Other investigators (Hall, Pressdee & Carrington, 1994)
18                 Water treatment and pathogen control

have reported similar efficiencies for floc-blanket clarifiers. A combination of
preozonation and use of a solids-contact sludge blanket reportedly improved
clarification of Giardia and Cryptosporidium-sized particles by about 1.5–
2.5 logs (Wilczak et al., 1991). Pilot plant studies of a sand ballasted-floc
system showed effective removal of turbidity and particle counts (Jeschke,
1998). In addition, microscopic particulate analysis of raw and settled water
showed an average 3.9-log removal of algae, and 4.5-log removal of diatoms
(Jeschke, 1998). Floc formed on magnetic particles can be rapidly removed by
using magnets within the sedimentation process (Gregory, Maloney & Stockley,
1988; Bolto, 1990; Anderson et al., 1993). The magnetic particles can be
collected and regenerated for reuse.

2.2.3 Dissolved air flotation
In dissolved air flotation (DAF), bubbles are produced by reducing pressure in a
water stream saturated with air. The rising bubbles attach to floc particles,
causing the agglomerate to float to the surface, where the material is skimmed
off (Gregory, Zabel & Edzwald, 1999). DAF can be particularly effective for
removal of algal cells and Cryptosporidium oocysts. It is most applicable to
waters with heavy algal blooms or those with low turbidity, low alkalinity and
high color, which are difficult to treat by sedimentation because the floc
produced has a low settling velocity.
    The effectiveness of DAF for treating algal-laden, humic, coloured water is
illustrated by the comments of Kiuru (1998), who indicated that the only type of
treatment plants built in Finland since the mid-1960s have been DAF plants. A
1.8-log removal of the algae Aphanizomenon and Microcystis was achieved by
pilot-scale DAF. Similar results (1.4–2.0 log removals) have been obtained in
full-scale studies (Mouchet and Bonnelye, 1998). DAF is also effective in the
removal of cell-associated algal toxins (Mouchet and Bonnelye, 1998).
    Plummer, Edzwald & Kelley (1995) reported that, depending on the
coagulant dose, DAF achieved 2–2.6 log removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts,
whereas conventional sedimentation resulted in 0.6–0.8 log removal. The
performance of DAF for oocyst removal depended on the pH, coagulant dose,
flocculation time and recycle ratio of the saturated water stream. Other
researchers have confirmed the effectiveness of DAF for oocyst removal,
particularly when polyelectrolyte coagulant aids are added to help stabilize the
floc (Hall, Pressdee & Carrington, 1994).

2.2.4 Lime softening
Precipitative lime softening is a process in which the pH of the water is
increased (usually through the addition of lime or soda ash) to precipitate high
concentrations of calcium and magnesium. Typically, calcium can be reduced at
pH 9.5–10.5, although magnesium requires pH 10.5–11.5. This distinction is
important because the pH of lime softening can inactivate many microbes at the
higher end (e.g. pH 10–11), but may have less impact at more moderate levels
(e.g. pH 9.5). In precipitative lime softening, the calcium carbonate and
magnesium hydroxide precipitates are removed in a clarifier before the water is
filtered. The microbial impact of lime softening can, therefore, be a combination
of inactivation by elevated pH and removal by settling.
    Logsdon et al. (1994) evaluated the effects of lime softening on the removal
and disinfection efficiency of Giardia, viruses and coliform bacteria. Coliform
bacteria in river water (spiked with raw sewage) were inactivated by 0.1 log at
pH 9.5, 1.0 log at pH 10.5 and 0.8–3.0 logs at pH 11.5 for 6 hours at 2–8°C.
Bacteriophage MS2 was sensitive to lime softening conditions, demonstrating
more than 4-log inactivation in the pH range of 11–11.5 within 2 hours.
Hepatitis A virus was reduced by 99.8% when exposed to pH 10.5 for 6 hours.
Poliovirus was the most resistant virus tested, requiring exposure to a pH level
of 11 for 6 hours to achieve a 2.5-log inactivation. Reductions were less than
1 log when exposed for 6 hours to a pH of less than 11. The viability of Giardia
muris cysts (measured by excystation) was not significantly affected by
exposure to pH 11.5 for 6 hours. Cryptosporidium viability (measured using dye
exclusion) was not affected by exposure to pH 9 for 5 hours (Robert, Campbell
& Smith, 1992).
    Jar tests of precipitative lime softening at pH 11.5 resulted in 4-log removal
of viruses and bacteria, and 2-log removal of Giardia and Cryptosporidium, due
to combined effects of removal by sedimentation and inactivation through high
pH (Bell et al., 2000). Limited full-scale data suggest that 2-log removal can be
achieved through sedimentation by precipitative lime softening (Logsdon et al.
1994).

2.2.5 In-line coagulation
In-line coagulation can be used with high-quality source waters (e.g. those
where turbidity and other contaminant levels are low). The coagulants are added
directly to the raw water pipeline before direct filtration. Typically, the
coagulants are added before an in-line static mixer, and it is not necessary to use
a basin for sedimentation. In-line coagulation permits the particle destabilization
20                  Water treatment and pathogen control

necessary for effective particle removal by filtration, but does not remove
microbes by sedimentation.


2.3 ION EXCHANGE
Ion exchange is a treatment process in which a solid phase presaturant ion is
exchanged for an unwanted ion in the untreated water. The process is used for
water softening (removal of calcium and magnesium), removal of some
radionuclides (e.g. radium and barium) and removal of various other
contaminants (e.g. nitrate, arsenate, chromate, selenate and dissolved organic
carbon). The effectiveness of the process depends on the background water
quality, and the levels of other competing ions and total dissolved solids.
Although some ion exchange systems can be effective for adsorbing viruses and
bacteria (Semmens, 1977), such systems are not generally considered a
microbial treatment barrier, because the organisms can be released from the
resin by competing ions. Also, ion exchange resins may become colonized by
bacteria, which can then contaminate treated effluents (Flemming, 1987;
Parsons, 2000). Backflushing and other rinsing procedures, even regeneration,
will not remove all of the attached microbes. Impregnation of the resin with
silver suppresses bacterial growth initially, but eventually a silver-tolerant
population develops. Disinfection of ion exchange resins using 0.01% peracetic
acid (1 hour contact time) has been suggested (Flemming, 1987).


2.4 FILTRATION
Various filtration processes are used in drinking-water treatment. Filtration can
act as a consistent and effective barrier for microbial pathogens. Figure 2.5
shows the most commonly used filtration processes in potable water treatment,
the pore size of the filter media and the sizes of different microbial particles.
These size spectra are useful for understanding removal mechanisms and
efficiencies, and for developing strategies to remove microbes by different
filtration processes.

2.5 GRANULAR HIGH-RATE FILTRATION
Granular media filtration is the most widely used filtration process in drinking-
water treatment. A comprehensive review of granular media filtration processes
is provided by Cleasby and Logsdon (1999). Under optimal conditions, a
combination of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and granular media
filtration can result in 4 logs or better removal of protozoan pathogens with
chlorine-resistant cysts. This section discusses granular filtration other than slow
22                   Water treatment and pathogen control

sand filtration (described in Section 2.6). Slow sand filtration is discussed
separately because the low filtration rate (< 0.4 m/h) used in this process means
that the design and operating criteria, and the mechanisms for removal of
microbes are considerably different from those of ‘rapid-rate’ granular filtration.

2.5.1 Design of granular filtration
In granular filtration, water passes through a filter consisting of a packed bed of
granular materials. Microbes or microbe-associated particles are removed as
they deposit on the filter medium. The removal occurs within the granular
medium (depth filtration) rather than on the top layer only (cake filtration).
After a period of operation, the head loss increases (i.e. the pressure increases)
or the effluent quality deteriorates to an unacceptable level. The filter then has to
be cleaned by backwashing, after which it performs poorly during a ‘ripening
period’ before achieving a stable level of performance. Passage of microbial
pathogens during the ripening period can be very high. Various strategies are
used to minimize this effect, including:
    • filter to waste — wasting the initial filtered water;
    • slow start — limiting the initial filtration rate until the filtrate quality is
         acceptable;
    • delayed start — leaving the filter inactive for a time following
         backwash, before bringing it into operation;
    • filter aid — adding a filter aid to the wash water supply.

Granular filters can be constructed as monomedium (e.g. silica sand), dual
media (e.g. anthracite coal and sand) and trimedia (e.g. coal, sand and garnet).
Granular activated carbon is used when both filtration of particles and
adsorption of organic compounds are desired. Depending on raw water quality,
granular filtration can be operated in three different modes:
   • conventional, which includes addition of coagulants (rapid mixing),
        flocculation (slow mixing), sedimentation and filtration;
   • direct filtration, in which the sedimentation step is omitted;
   • in-line filtration, in which both flocculation and sedimentation steps are
        omitted.

   Conventional treatment is appropriate for most source waters, whereas direct
and in-line filtration are used for raw waters with a consistently good quality
(low turbidity and colour).

2.5.2 Mechanism of action of granular filtration
Removal of microbial pathogens by granular filtration does not rely on
physical processes alone. Comparing the pore size of granular filters with
the size of most types of microbe (as in Figure 2.5), it is evident that
effective removal of microbes by granular filtration cannot rely on physical
straining alone, at least at the initial stage of a filter run. The removal of
particles by granular filtration is considered to involve two steps: transport
of particles from suspension to filter medium, followed by attachment of
particles to the medium (Yao, Habibian & O’Melia, 1971).
   The transport step depends on the physical and hydrodynamic properties
of the system. Transport mechanisms include diffusion, interception and
sedimentation. Factors such as size and density of microbes, size and depth
of filter medium, and filtration rate affect transport efficiency. In the case of
motile microorganisms, an additional mechanism is the active movement of
the cell (Hozalski & Bouwer, 1998). Attachment is determined by the
surface and solution chemistry of the system (Tobiason & O’Melia, 1988).
Unfavorable interactions between particles and the filter medium must be
avoided so that particles can attach to the medium. Chemical coagulation is
used before filtration to destabilize particles; this step is the single most
important factor in determining filtration efficiency. Without proper
chemical pretreatment, rapid rate filtration works as a simple strainer and is
not an effective barrier for microbial pathogens.

2.5.3 Importance of chemical coagulation pretreatment
The importance of chemical coagulation pretreatment for removal of
microbes by granular filtration has been emphasized by numerous studies.
Al-Ani et al. (1986) conducted a pilot-scale filtration study for low turbidity
waters (< 1 NTU). Without chemical pretreatment, the removal by filtration
averaged 69% (0.51 logs) for Giardia and 28% (0.14 logs) for turbidity.
Adding alum and polymer filter aids increased the removal efficiency to
more than 95% (1.30 logs) for Giardia, 99% (2 logs) for total coliform
bacteria and 70% (0.52 logs) for turbidity. Other process variables such as
filtration mode (direct and in-line filtrations), filter media (monomedium
with sand, and dual-media with sand and anthracite) and temperature (5°C
and 18°C) did not significantly affect the filtered water quality. Varying the
filtration rate from 5 to about 20 m/h had little effect on removal of Giardia,
total coliform bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria, but increased turbidity in
the filtered water.
24                 Water treatment and pathogen control

    Robeck, Clarke & Dostal (1962) reported that, when alum was used as a
coagulant, the removal of poliovirus type 1 by a pilot-scale dual-media filter
was more than 98% (1.70 logs). Ongerth (1990) conducted pilot studies for
conventional and in-line filtration. Without any chemical addition, removal
of Giardia cysts averaged 75% (0.60 logs) for conventional treatment and
64% (0.44 logs) for in-line filtration. With optimal chemical pretreatment,
the removal increased to 98% (1.70 logs) for conventional treatment and
93.6% (1.19 logs) for in-line filtration.
    Nieminski & Ongerth (1995) evaluated the removal of Cryptosporidium
oocysts and Giardia cysts over two years at pilot and full-scale filtration
plants, operated under direct filtration and conventional treatment modes.
Dual-media filters with anthracite and sand were used. Giardia and
Cryptosporidium were effectively removed when coagulation conditions
produced filtered water of low turbidity (0.1—0.2 NTU). Under optimal
coagulation conditions, the average removal of Giardia was 3.3 logs or
more, and the average removal of Cryptosporidium was 2.3 logs or more in
both pilot and full-scale plants, regardless of the treatment modes (direct
filtration or conventional treatment). The authors also investigated
correlations between the removal of cysts and surrogate parameters. A high
correlation was found between removal of cysts and particles of 4–7 µm and
7–11 µm (R2 ≥ 0.79). There was a lower correlation between removal of
Giardia and Cryptosporidium and removal of turbidity (R2 ≤ 0.64). Particle
counting was a better indicator of cyst and oocyst removal than turbidity.
Log removal of seeded cysts did not correlate with log removal of
heterotrophic bacteria (R2 ≤ 0.08), suggesting that heterotrophic plate counts
(HPCs) are not a good surrogate to use in evaluating cyst removal. A recent
WHO publication (Bartram et al., 2003) discusses the significance of HPCs
for water quality and human health.

2.5.4 Effect of filter media design
Swertfeger et al. (1999) evaluated the effect of filter media design on cyst
and oocyst removal. Designs included monomedium (sand with a depth of
750 mm), fine dual-media (anthracite and sand with depths of 900 mm and
300 mm, respectively) and deep dual-media (anthracite and sand with depths
of 1500 mm and 300 mm, respectively). The feedwater to the pilot systems
was taken from the effluent of a sedimentation unit in a full-scale water
treatment plant and was in optimal coagulation condition. The authors found
no statistical difference in the filtration performance for the different media.
Removal of Giardia was 4.4 logs or better, with greater removal efficiency
                              Removal processes                            25

in the summer than in the winter. Removal of Cryptosporidium was similar
in summer and winter, and averaged 2.7 logs or more.
   Payment et al. (2000) reported water-quality monitoring results for a full-
scale conventional water treatment plant using dual-media filters, with
coagulation provided by alum and activated silica. Prechlorination was
applied at 1 mg/l. The results confirmed that a properly operated
conventional treatment plant provided a substantial barrier to microbial
pathogens. Giardia cysts were detected in only 1 of 32 filtered water
samples, with a mean removal of 3.6 logs after filtration (including removal
by coagulation and sedimentation). Removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts
was lower than for Giardia. Oocysts were detected in 7 of 32 filtered water
samples, with a mean removal of 2 logs. Clostridium perfringens was
detected in 9 of 33 filtered water samples, with average removal of 4.4 logs.
No human enteric virus was detected in 32 filtered water samples, with
average removal of 3.1 logs (assuming that the concentration of humic
enteric virus in filtered water was equal to the detection limit). Somatic
coliphage were detected in 24 of 32 filtered water samples, with average
removal of 3.5 logs.

2.5.5 Importance of filter backwash
When solids accumulate within a filter bed, they create a resistance to flow.
This resistance is measured as loss of head (pressure increase) for the filter
bed. The filter is backwashed, usually with finished water, to remove the
accumulated particles. The need for backwashing may be determined using
various criteria — a terminal head loss, a fixed time interval, or a
breakthrough of solids (measured as turbidity or particle counts). Options
for disposal of the spent filter backwash water may include discharge to a
sewer or a receiving stream. Because backwash water may contain
disinfectants and other chemicals that may be harmful to the biological life
of a stream, direct discharge to streams may be restricted. Similarly,
discharge to sewers may be restricted, based on the constituents and total
quantity of the backwash water.
   For many water treatment plants, particularly in arid or water-scarce
areas with limited raw water resources, it is often necessary to reuse
backwash water. When the water is recycled, accumulation of microbial and
algal contaminants is a concern. For example, algal toxins may be released
from stored treatment sludges when the overlying water is recycled (Drikas
et al., 2001). Because of the resistance of oocysts to conventional
disinfectants, Cryptosporidium has been a major concern for the handling
and operation of recycled process streams. Table 2.5 summarizes data on the
26                 Water treatment and pathogen control

occurrence and concentration of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts
in filter backwash water. The level of treatment required for spent filter
backwash water before recycle will vary from site to site depending on the
treatment process and water-quality objectives. Equalization of the recycle
flow and sedimentation of the backwash solids, aided by the addition of a
polymer coagulant, is sufficient to reduce cyst concentrations to raw water
levels in most cases (Cornwell & Lee, 1993; Arora, Di Giovanni &
LeChevallier, 1999; McTigue et al., 2000).


2.6 SLOW SAND FILTRATION
The use of slow sand filtration to protect drinking-water consumers from
microbial risk was well established more than 100 years ago. Two of the
earliest successful cases were reductions in cholera in Altona (Germany) and
typhoid fever in Lawrence, Massachusetts (USA) in the 1890s (Bellamy et
al., 1985). Numerous disease outbreaks due to chlorine-resistant protozoan
pathogens in the past two decades have increased interest in slow sand
filtration because of its ability to remove parasites.

2.6.1 Design and action of slow sand filters
Slow sand filtration involves passing water through a sand filter by gravity
at a very low filtration rate, without the use of coagulation pretreatment. The
filter typically consists of a layer of sand supported on a layer of graded
gravel. Typical design criteria for slow sand filtration are given in Table 2.6.
Detailed design guidelines can be found in Hendricks (1991). As water
passes through the filter, microbes and other substances are removed. The
removal mechanisms are not well understood, although they are believed to
be a combination of biological, physical and chemical mechanisms (Weber-
Shirk & Dick, 1997ab). Specific mechanisms may include biological action
(e.g. ciliate protozoa acting as bacterial predators), attachment of microbes
to sand media (e.g. by electrochemical forces and through bridging by
microbial extracellular polymers) and physical straining.

    Removal of particles by slow sand filtration occurs predominantly, if not
entirely, in a thin layer on the top of the sand bed. This biologically active layer,
composed of living and dead microorganisms and macroorganisms, is termed
schmutzdecke. As operation progresses, deposited materials and biological growth
on the sand medium increase the head loss across the filter. When the head loss
reaches the operational limit (normally 1–2 m), the filter is removed from service.
It is then usually cleaned by scraping about 2 cm of accumulated material and
sand from the top layer of the sand bed, before being returned to service. A typical
filter run is from one to six months, depending on the raw water quality and
filtration rate. After the sand bed is reduced to a lowest acceptable depth by
repeated scrapings, it is necessary to replace the sand down to the gravel support
level.

2.6.2 Protection provided by slow sand filtration
Slow sand filtration can provide some degree of protection against microbial
pathogens. As coagulation pretreatment is not required, slow sand filtration has
little maintenance or chemical cost. If the raw water has a high concentration of
suspended particles or algae, physical pretreatment processes (e.g. roughing filter
or microstrainers) can be used to prevent clogging of the filter and maintain a
reasonable filter run period.

Removal of microbes
In a review by Ellis (1985), virus removal ranging from about 1 to 5 logs was
reported for bench and full-scale slow sand filters. Various studies have reported
the effective removal of bacteria and protozoa by slow sand filtration in pilot and
full-scale systems.
                                 Removal processes                                 31

    In a pilot-scale study, a new filter removed 0.82 logs of total coliform bacteria
and more than 1.7 logs of Giardia (Bellamy et al., 1985). Once a microbiological
population was established within the sand bed (after two weeks), the removal of
total coliforms increased to 4 logs and no Giardia was detected in the filtered water.
The calculated cyst reduction was more than 2.6 logs, depending on influent cyst
concentration. Similar results were found in another pilot study, where the removal
of total coliform bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and turbidity increased with the
biological activity of the schmutzdecke (Bellamy, Hendricks & Logsdon, 1985).
    In a full-scale study of a slow sand filter in Empire, Colorado (USA), Giardia
cysts were detected in almost half of the influent samples, but not in the effluent
(Seelaus, Hendricks & Janonis, 1986). In a full-scale study for three slow sand
filtration plants in Idaho (USA), no samples positive for Giardia were found in the
filtered water from two of the three treatment plants (Tanner & Ongerth, 1990). For
the one positive sample found in one plant, 1-log removal of Giardia was achieved.
In the same study, removal of total coliforms and faecal coliforms varied from 84.35
to 99.5% (0.81–2.30 logs) and from 48.1 to 70.0% (0.29–0.52 logs), respectively.
Removal of heterotrophic bacteria (as measured by HPC) varied from 65.8 to 91.0%
(0.47–1.05 logs). These differences in removal efficiency were influenced by raw
water quality, filtration rate, media size and depth. Removal of Cryptosporidium by
slow sand filtration is often more difficult than removal of Giardia. In a full-scale
study in British Columbia, Fogel et al. (1993) reported that the average removal of
Giardia was 93% (1.16 logs) but was only 48% (0.28 logs) for Cryptosporidium.

Removal of turbidity
Although the removal of microbes by slow sand filtration can be substantial,
reduction of turbidity may be site specific. In one pilot study, turbidity removal
was 97.8% (1.66 logs) or more after a filter-ripening period of about two days
(Cleasby, Hilmoe & Dimitracopoulos, 1984); similar to the removal of total
coliform bacteria (≥ 99.4%) and chlorophyll-a (≥ 95%). Another pilot study found
a 27–39% (0.14–0.22 log) removal of turbidity, whereas the reduction of Giardia
was up to 4 logs (Bellamy et al., 1985). The authors concluded that the low
removal of turbidity was due to the fine clay particles present in the raw water,
which penetrated the filter. In a full-scale study, turbidity removal was between 0
and 63% (0.43 logs), due to the fine particles present in the raw water and to the
large fraction (4% by weight) of fines in the new sand media used in the study
(Tanner & Ongerth, 1990). The fact that slow sand filtration can achieve effective
removal of microbial pathogens but not necessarily decreased turbidity indicates
that turbidity may not be a suitable surrogate for evaluation of the removal of
pathogens by slow sand filtration.

2.7 PRECOAT FILTRATION
Precoat filtration was developed by the US Army during World War II as a
portable unit for the removal of Entamoeba histolytica (a protozoan parasite
prevalent in the Pacific war zone) from drinking-water. The process involves
forcing water under pressure or by vacuum through a uniformly thin layer of
filtering material precoated onto a permeable, rigid, supporting structure (referred
to as a septum). Precoat materials include DE and perlite, with DE more
commonly used in drinking-water treatment. As water passes through the filter
media and septum, the precoat materials (filter cake) capture microbes and other
particles, mainly by physical straining. Often, a “bodyfeed” solution containing
the filter media slurry is added continuously to the system, to maintain the
permeability of the filter cake. As the cake becomes thicker due to the captured
particles, head loss increases until further filtration is impractical. The filter cake is
removed from the support septum and disposed of. The filter is then cleaned and
precoated with a new layer of coating materials, and a new filter cycle starts. A
detailed design and operating manual for precoat filtration has been published by
the American Water Works Association (AWWA, 1995).
    Because the major removal mechanism is physical straining, efficiency of
precoat filtration depends to a large extent on the grade (size) of the coating
materials and on the size of the microbes. Other factors influencing the removal
efficiency are chemical pretreatment of the filter media, filtration rate and
bodyfeed rate. Chemical pretreatment of the raw water is usually not necessary;
however, the raw water must be of high quality (low turbidity) to maintain a
reasonable filter run time.

2.7.1 Removal of microbes
Diatomite grades used for drinking-water treatment have a mean pore diameter of 7–
17 µm (Figure 2.5). Precoat filtration can remove protozoan parasites such as
Giardia very effectively. A pilot study showed complete removal of Giardia for
both coarse and fine grades of DE over a wide range of operating conditions (Lang
et al., 1986). Removal of Cryptosporidium can be significant, but because this
organism is smaller than Giardia, it is more difficult to remove. Removal of
Cryptosporidium oocysts by a bench-scale DE filter ranged from 3.60 to 6.68 logs,
depending on the media grade and the filtration rate (Ongerth & Hutton, 1997). In a
pilot-plant study, filtration with DE gave a consistently complete removal of Giardia
cysts and a 3-log removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts (Schuler & Ghosh, 1990).

2.7.2 Importance of chemical pretreatment
Precoat filters remove smaller microbial particles (e.g. bacteria and viruses) less
effectively than they do parasites, unless the coating materials are chemically
pretreated; for example, with aluminium or iron coagulants, or with cationic
polymers. In the pilot study by Schuler & Ghosh (1990) mentioned above,
removal of coliforms with untreated DE was about 0.36 logs, increasing to
0.82 logs with a coating of alum at 1 mg/g DE, and to 2 logs at 3 mg/g DE. This
increase was probably due to the trapping of bacteria by the alum. A similar
beneficial effect was observed using cationic polymers; at 3.5 mg/g DE, removal
of coliforms increased to 3.3 logs. The authors concluded that this increase in
removal could be due to an increased site density on the polymer-coated DE for
adsorption of negatively charged coliforms. A similar improvement in removal of
bacteria was reported for the pilot study conducted by Lang et al. (1986). Alum
coating of DE increased removal of total coliforms from 0.16 logs to 1.40 logs,
and of HPC bacteria from 0.36 logs to 2.30 logs. Removal of viruses also
increased with chemical pretreatment of filter cake (Brown, Malina & Moore,
1974). The removal of bacteriophage T2 and poliovirus was about 90% for an
uncoated filter, but increased to more than 98% (1.7 logs) when the filter cake was
coated with ferric hydrate or polyelectrolytes.


2.8 MEMBRANE FILTRATION
In membrane filtration, a thin semipermeable film (membrane) is used as a
selective barrier to remove contaminants from water. There are very few
contaminants that cannot be removed by membrane processes. For the past two
decades, the use of membrane filtration in drinking-water treatment (including
pathogen removal) has been growing, due to increasingly stringent drinking-water
regulations and decreasing costs of purchasing and operating membrane filters.
    The membrane processes most commonly used to remove microbes from
drinking-water are microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF)
and reverse osmosis (RO). Detailed descriptions of the fundamentals, design and
operation of these processes are available (AWWA, 1996; Taylor & Wiesner,
1999). Table 2.7 summarizes these processes, including operating pressure, pore
size, primary application and the type of microorganism that can be removed. Not
all of these processes are used primarily for removal of pathogens. For example,
RO is used mainly for desalination and NF for softening and for removal of
precursors of disinfectant by-products. Nevertheless, the ability to remove
pathogens broadens the application of these types of filter when used for these
other treatment objectives.

   Membrane filtration removes microbial pathogens mainly by size exclusion;
that is, microbes larger than the membrane pores are removed. Chemical
coagulation is not usually needed before membrane treatment for the removal of
microbes. However, some degree of pretreatment is usually employed to reduce
membrane fouling (caused by accumulation of chemicals, particles and
biological growth on membrane surfaces) and to avoid membrane degradation
from chemical attack (caused by hydrolysis and oxidation). Fouling reduces
membrane productivity, and membranes must be chemically cleaned to restore
productivity.
   Examples of pretreatment processes are microstraining, pH adjustment and
addition of biocides (chlorine or copper sulfate). If the source water is of poor
quality, advanced pretreatment systems (e.g. conventional coagulation–
sedimentation–filtration or other membrane processes) may also be necessary.
   Based on pore size, the order of effectiveness of microbial removal is RO,
NF, UF and MF, with RO being the most effective. However, this is not always
the case, because differences in membrane material or configuration, or failure

in the membrane can affect microbial removal. Discussion of the removal
efficiency of these different membrane processes follows.

2.8.1 Microfiltration
MF membranes have pores of 0.1 µm or more (Table 2.7). Theoretically, MF
can remove protozoa, algae and most bacteria very effectively, and this has been
confirmed in a number of studies, some of which are discussed below. However,
factors such as bacteria growing in the membrane systems can lead to poor
removal of bacteria. Viruses, which are 0.01–0.1 µm in size, can generally pass
through MF membranes, but may be removed by the membrane if they are
associated with large particles.
    Numerous pilot studies have directly evaluated the removal of Giardia,
Cryptosporidium and other specific microbial pathogens by MF. For example,
an extensive study using three MF membranes with pore sizes 0.08–0.22 µm
found that Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the filtered water were below
detection levels (< 1 cyst or oocyst/l) with two of the membranes
(corresponding to log removals of > 4.7 to > 7.0 for Giardia and > 4.4 to > 6.9
for Cryptosporidium) (Jacangelo, Adham & Laîné, 1995). No cysts or oocysts
were detected in the effluent, indicating that the difference in removal efficiency
was a function of the feeding concentration. In the case of the membrane where
cysts were detected in the filtered water, the membrane seal was defective, but
even so it achieved removal of 4.6 logs for Giardia and 4.2 logs for
Cryptosporidium. The authors concluded that MF could act as an absolute
barrier to protozoan cysts, provided that the membrane remained intact. As
expected, removal of MS2 bacteriophage by these MF membranes was less than
1 log, because the phage is 0.025 µm and the pore size of the membranes is
0.08–0.22 µm.
    In another pilot study, MF membranes with an average pore size of 0.2 µm
resulted in significant removal of cyst-sized particles (Karimi, Vickers &
Harasick, 1999). The removal of Giardia-sized (5–15 µm) particles averaged
3.3–4.4 logs. The removal of Cryptosporidium-sized (2–5 µm) particles was
lower, averaging 2.3–3.5 logs. These removals were a function of the spiking
particle concentration and were independent of the membrane flux used (114–
170 l/m2 per hour). Algae were also effectively removed; the feed water
contained 275–700 areal standard unit (asu) count of algae and 10–12.7 µg/l of
chlorophyll-a, but these were reduced to below detection (< 25 asu and
< 0.5 µg/l, respectively) in the filtered water. However, the HPCs from the
filtered water exceeded those of the feed water, probably due to the growth of
microorganisms in the pilot system.
36                    Water treatment and pathogen control

    A pilot study using two MF membranes with nominal sizes of 0.1 and 0.2 µm
also confirmed the complete removal of Giardia and Cryptosporidium by MF,
with neither of these organisms detected in the filtered water (States et al.,
1999). Hollow fibre membranes with a nominal pore size of 0.2 µm were used
in a pilot-scale study using MF membranes for treating filter backwash water
(Parker et al., 1999), pretreated in sedimentation tanks. The MF membranes
reliably produced water with turbidity below 0.1 NTU, compared to an influent
turbidity of 12.4–88 NTU. Average removal efficiency was 99.46% (2.27 logs)
for particles in the size range 3–15 µm and 91.3% (1.06 logs) for heterotrophic
bacteria. The MF membranes were also challenged with different microbes.
Removal efficiencies were 5.3 logs for Cryptosporidium parvum, 6.4 logs for
algae, more than 4.3 logs for total coliforms, 3.3 logs for heterotrophic bacteria,
more than 3.5 logs for aerobic spores, 2.7 logs for total culturable virus and
3.7 logs for male-specific coliphage.
    Excellent removal of turbidity, oocyst-sized particles and indicator bacteria
was found in a full-scale study of a 19 000 m3/day MF plant using 0.2 µm MF
membranes (Yoo et al., 1995a). Turbidity of up to 100 NTU was observed in the
raw water; however, the finished water was always 0.05 NTU or less. Removal
of oocyst-sized (4–10 µm) particles was greater than 3 logs. Neither total nor
faecal coliforms were detected in any of the finished water samples. During a
subsequent seeded challenge study, greater than 6-log removal was observed for
both Giardia and Cryptosporidium at a flux rate of 0.94 gpm/m2 (AWWARF,
1999).

2.8.2 Ultrafiltration
UF membranes have pores of 0.01 µm or more, small enough to remove some
viruses in addition to bacteria and protozoa (Table 2.7). In the bench and pilot-
scale studies discussed above, Jacangelo, Adham & Laîné (1995) found that UF,
like MF, could act as an absolute barrier to protozoan cysts as long as
membranes remained intact. Three UF membranes (with molecular weight cut-
offs of 100 000–500 000 daltons, corresponding to pore sizes of 0.01–0.05 µm)
were used in the studies. Neither Giardia nor Cryptosporidium were detected in
the filtered water (corresponding to log removals of > 4.7 to > 7.0 for Giardia
and > 4.4 to > 7.0 for Cryptosporidium). Removal of viruses by UF was
significantly better than removal by MF, and depended essentially on the pore
size of the membranes. The membranes with the lowest molecular weight cut-
offs achieved the highest removal efficiency (6 log or higher) for MS2
bacteriophage in both bench and pilot-scale studies. The authors also concluded
that, although physical sieving was the main mechanism for the removal of
                               Removal processes                               37

protozoan pathogens by UF and MF, cake layer formation and changes in the
fouling of the membrane also contributed to the removal of viruses.
    A pilot study to investigate the removal of particles and indicator bacteria
from two surface water supplies used a UF membrane with a molecular weight
cut-off of 100 000 daltons (Jacangelo et al., 1989). The membrane effectively
removed particles, turbidity, total coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria, and
produced filtered water with turbidity less than 0.04 NTU. Particle removal was
from 2.6 logs to greater than 4.6 logs, depending on influent particle
concentration. No coliforms were detected in the finished water. Influent HPCs
of 4–4500 cfu/ml were reduced to < 1–5 cfu/ml in the effluent. The authors
concluded that the heterotrophic bacteria in the filtered water were due primarily
to the regrowth of bacteria in the membrane system.
    A systematic pilot study to evaluate the use of UF to remove microbial
pathogens from four different source waters used membranes with a molecular
weight cut-off of 100 000 daltons (Jacangelo et al., 1991). Removal efficiencies
for Giardia muris, coliforms, heterotrophic bacteria and MS2 bacteriophage
were determined. Giardia muris, total coliform bacteria and MS2 bacteriophage
in the filtered water were below detection (corresponding to reduction
efficiencies of > 4 logs, > 7 logs and > 6.5 logs respectively). Differences in
water quality or changes in operating parameters did not affect the removal
capabilities of the process, but maintenance of membrane integrity was critical
to assuring process efficiency. Loss of membrane integrity (fibre breakage) was
associated with the detection of both Giardia muris and MS2 bacteriophage in
the permeate water. Heterotrophic bacteria were found in the permeate water,
but this was due to colonization of a section of the sample tap piping rather than
to penetration of the bacteria through the membrane.

2.8.3 Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis
The pore sizes of NF and RO membranes are smaller than those of UF
membranes. However, NF and RO alone are seldom used to remove microbial
pathogens because MF or UF are more cost-effective and can achieve a similar
degree of microbial removal. Not surprisingly, there is far less literature on the
removal of microbial pathogens by NF and RO than by MF and UF.
Representative examples are discussed below.

Bench-scale study
A bench-scale study evaluated virus removal by five different RO membranes
(Adham et al., 1998). MS2 bacteriophage was used as the model virus, seeded at
concentrations of 103–108 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml. Virus reduction was
from 2.7 logs to more than 6.5 logs. For the membrane with the highest removal
38                   Water treatment and pathogen control

efficiency, no MS2 was found in filtered water (detection limit < 1 pfu/ml). The
authors concluded that an RO membrane was not always an absolute barrier to
viruses, and that the levels of removal achieved by each membrane varied,
depending on the membrane type and manufacturer.

Pilot-scale study
A pilot study to investigate the efficiency of integrated membrane systems used
Bacillus subtilis endospores as a surrogate for Cryptosporidium and Giardia to
challenge eight different integrated membrane systems (Owen et al., 1999). The
systems included two different NF membranes with two different MF
membranes as pretreatment, with and without in-line coagulation pretreatment.
The systems did not completely remove spores, but gave overall cumulative
removals of 8.0–11.0 logs. There was no difference in spore removal with or
without in-line coagulation, but membrane configuration and membrane film
significantly affected spore removal. The MF membranes, configured as hollow
fibres, achieved 5.6–5.9 log removal of spores. The NF membranes, with an
average pore size two orders of magnitude less than the MFs and a spiral wound
configuration, achieved 2.2–4.5 logs removal.
    The authors concluded that a hollow fibre configuration, which simply seals
membrane fibres in a straight line, was unlikely to leak. In contrast, the spiral
configurations crease membrane envelopes, and include feed stream and
permeate stream spacers. The creases and spacers could compromise membrane
integrity. Spore removal by the composite thin film NF membrane exceeded that
of the cellulose acetate NF membrane by about 2 logs.

Full-scale studies
Full-scale studies to evaluate the removal of microbial pathogens by integrated
membrane systems using NF as the major treatment unit have been reported by
Lovins et al. (1999) and Gullick et al. (2000). Two composite thin film NF
membranes and one cellulose acetate NF membrane with molecular weight cut-
offs of 100–300 daltons were used. Protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts and
Giardia cysts), bacteria (Clostridium perfringens spores) and bacteriophage
(MS2 and PRD1) were used to challenge the different NF membranes. Similar
to the finding by Owen et al. (1999), the two composite thin film NF
membranes were significantly more effective than the cellulose acetate NF
membrane at removing microbes. Removals of about 5.5 logs were achieved
with the thin film membranes, with complete removal in more than half of the
tests. This compared to removals of about 2 logs with the cellulose acetate
membrane, which produced complete removal in less than 10% of the tests.

   The efficiency of a UF membrane with molecular weight cut-off of 100 000
daltons was also investigated in this study. The observed microbial removal
performance for the UF was similar to that of the two composite thin film NF
membranes, and significantly higher than that of the cellulose acetate NF
membrane. The authors suggested that this was due partly to the configurations
of the membrane (hollow fibre for UF and spiral wound for NF). Integrated
membrane systems with different configurations were tested in the study.
Pretreatment (before NF) included conventional coagulation followed by
sedimentation and sand filtration, hollow fibre MF with pore size 0.2 µm and
hollow fibre UF with a molecular weight cut-off of 100 00 daltons. As expected,
the highest pathogen removals were achieved by integrated membrane systems
with composite thin film NF and UF pretreatment, with 6.3–11.0 log removals.
However, some membranes did not remove microbes completely, even at
relatively low feed concentrations, indicating that integrated membrane systems
are not necessarily absolute barriers to pathogens.


2.9 BAG, CARTRIDGE AND FIBROUS FILTERS
A bag filter is one that has a non-rigid fabric medium for the filter. Water flow
is usually pressure-driven from the inside of the filter bag to the outside. A
cartridge filter is one that has a rigid fabric medium or membrane for the filter.
In this type of filter, water flow is usually pressure-driven from the outside of
the filter to the inside. Bag and cartridge filters are often developed for small
systems and for point-of-use filtration applications. They are also sometimes
applied as a pretreatment process for membrane filtration.
    Bag filters and cartridge filters remove microorganisms by physical straining.
The removal efficiency thus depends primarily on the pore size of the filter
medium and on the size of the microbes. A typical pore size range is from
0.2 µm to about 10 µm. The pore size of the filter medium is usually designed to
be small enough to remove protozoa such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia.
Submicron particles, including viruses and most bacteria, can pass through the
filters. As water passes through a bag or cartridge filter, pressure drop increases
to a level impractical for operation. The bag or cartridge is then replaced by a
clean one.
    Since the removal mechanism is physical straining, chemical pretreatment is
usually not required for bag filters and cartridge filters. Straining of large
compressible particles can blind the filters and reduce filter life. High turbidity
and algae can also clog these filters. These processes are therefore only
appropriate for high-quality waters. A prefiltration process may be employed to
remove large particles.
40                   Water treatment and pathogen control

    In principle, microbes larger than the pore size of the medium will be
captured by the filters. The nominal size of a filter medium reported by the
manufacturers represents an average size — there is often a pore size
distribution, meaning that some pores will be larger than the nominal size.
Furthermore, some biological particles such as cysts and oocysts do not have
hard shells. These microbes may deform slightly, especially under pressure,
allowing them to squeeze through small pores. Li et al. (1997) studied the
removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts using field-scale bag filtration. A bag filter
with a single layer of polypropylene fabric, with a nominal pore size of 1 µm,
removed an average of 0.42 log of Cryptosporidium. This means that 38% of
seeded Cryptosporidium oocysts passed through the filter, probably for the
reasons mentioned above. When the bag filter was changed to multiple layers,
the log removal increased to 1.41.
    Arora, Di Giovanni & LeChevallier (1999) evaluated the performance of
fibrous filters to treat recycled filter backwash water. Two filters, one made of
polybutylene terephthalate with a nominal sizing of 5 µm and the other made of
nylon with a nominal sizing of 2 µm, were used. The recycled backwash water
was pretreated in a sedimentation tank. Pilot runs with the polybutylene
terephthalate filter resulted in an average removal of 3 logs for
Cryptosporidium, 0.5 logs for Giardia and 1 log for Clostridium. The nylon
filter achieved an average removal of 3 logs for Cryptosporidium, 1.2 logs for
Giardia and 1.5 logs for Clostridium.

Inactivation (disinfection) processes




This chapter covers the various disinfection processes used in drinking-water
treatment to inactivate pathogenic microbes. It looks first at factors affecting the
efficiency of disinfection process, and then goes on to consider the following
disinfection processes:
    • pretreatment oxidation — in which oxidants are added to water early in
        the treatment process.
    • primary disinfection — a common component of primary treatment of
        drinking-water, and important because granular filter media do not
        remove all microbial pathogens from water
    • secondary disinfection — used to maintain the water quality achieved at
        the treatment plant throughout the distribution system up to the tap.


3.1 FACTORS AFFECTING DISINFECTION
The principal factors that influence disinfection efficiency are disinfectant
concentration, contact time, temperature and pH. Disinfectant concentration and

Safe Drinking Water. Edited by Mark W LeChevallier and Kwok-Keung Au. ISBN: 1 84339 069 8.

42                    Water treatment and pathogen control

contact time are integral to disinfection kinetics and the practical application of
the CT concept (CT being the disinfectant concentration multiplied by the
contact time). Development and derivations of this disinfection model are
discussed in the modelling section below. Temperature, over the range
appropriate for drinking-water, affects the rate of disinfection reactions
according to the Arrhenius equation, although this may not hold for certain
disinfectants at low temperatures. The pH of the disinfectant solution affects the
reaction kinetics. For example, the disinfection efficiency of free chlorine is
increased at lower pH values, whereas that of chlorine dioxide is greater at
alkaline pH levels. Monochloramine is formed within seconds in the pH range
7–9, at chlorine to ammonia nitrogen ratios of less than 5:1 and at 25°C; it is
also the predominant species when the pH is greater than 5.
   Other factors that influence microbial sensitivity to disinfection include
attachment to surfaces, encapsulation, aggregation and low-nutrient growth.
Increased resistance to disinfection may result from attachment or association of
microorganisms to various particulate surfaces, including:
    • macroinvertebrates (Crustacea, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes and Insecta)
         (Tracy, Camarena & Wing, 1966; Levy, Cheetham & Hart, 1984);
    • particles that cause turbidity (LeChevallier, Evans & Seidler, 1981;
         Ridgway & Olson, 1982);
    • algae (Silverman, Nagy & Olson, 1983);
    • carbon fines (LeChevallier et al., 1984; Camper et al., 1986);
    • glass (Olivieri et al., 1985).

   Ridgway & Olson (1982) showed that the majority of viable bacteria in
chlorinated water were attached to particles. Stewart & Olson (1986) reported
that aggregation of Acinetobacter strain EB22 increased its resistance to
disinfection, making the bacteria 100-fold more resistant to hypochlorous acid
(HOCl) and 2.3-fold more resistant to monochloramine. Several investigators
have isolated encapsulated bacteria from chlorinated water (Reilly & Kippin,
1983; Clark, 1984) and concluded that production of the extracellular capsule
helped protect bacteria from chlorine. Carson et al. (1972) reported that
Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown in distilled water was markedly more resistant
to acetic acid, glutaraldehyde, chlorine dioxide and a quaternary ammonium
compound than cells cultured on tryptic soy agar. Similarly, Berg, Matin &
Roberts (1981) and Harakeh et al. (1985) found that bacteria grown in a
chemostat at low temperatures and submaximal growth rates caused by nutrient
limitation (conditions thought to be similar to the natural aquatic environment)
were resistant to several disinfectants.

3.2 PRETREATMENT OXIDATION
Water utilities often add oxidants early in the treatment process to:
  • maximize the contact time with the oxidant;
  • oxidize compounds for subsequent removal by the treatment process
       (e.g. iron or manganese);
  • provide initial treatment in sufficient time for water to be further treated
       if necessary (e.g. oxidation of taste and odour compounds);
  • control growth of microorganisms and higher organisms (e.g. zebra
       mussels) on intake structures and in treatment basins;
  • improve particle removal in subsequent clarification and filtration
       processes.

   There are a number of potential problems with pretreatment oxidation.
Variable source water conditions mean that variable or high levels of oxidant
may be needed. This may lead to overdosing of pre-oxidants, which can result in
“pink coloured” water when potassium permanganate is misapplied. Also, the
process can produce oxidation by-products such as trihalomethanes (THMs),
haloacetic acids and bromate. For example, in using chlorine as a pretreatment
oxidant, chlorinated by-products can form rapidly. This often limits the
application of chlorine to a later stage of the treatment process, when precursor
material has been removed. A further problem is that oxidants can lyse algal
cells, releasing liver or nerve toxins, or creating objectionable tastes or odours.
(Yoo et al., 1995b; Chorus & Bartram, 1999).
   One concern with using pre-oxidants for disinfection is that particulate
material may interfere with microbial inactivation. Such material protects
bacteria and viruses from disinfectants by creating an instantaneous disinfectant
demand (preventing the maintenance of a disinfectant residual in subsequent
treatment steps) and by shielding the microbe from the oxidant (Hoff, 1978;
LeChevallier, Evans & Seidler, 1981; Berman, Rice & Hoff, 1988).
   The effect of particulate material on disinfection of cysts or oocysts has not
been widely evaluated. Di Giovanni & LeChevallier (2000) studied the effect of
turbidity on disinfection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by chlorine
dioxide or permanganate, and found that particulate material did not interfere
with disinfection once the increase in oxidant demand had been satisfied
(Figure 3.1). The authors hypothesized that protozoan cysts were too large to be
completely shielded from the disinfectant.

3.3 PRIMARY DISINFECTION
A disinfection barrier is a common component of primary treatment of water.
Primary disinfection is typically a chemical oxidation process, although
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and membrane treatment are gaining increased
attention. This section looks at different types of disinfectant — chlorine,
monochlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, UV light and mixed oxidants — in
terms of their effectiveness against various pathogenic microorganisms. Further
information on selecting a disinfection strategy for a piped distribution system
can be found in the WHO publication Safe piped water: Managing microbial
water quality in piped distribution systems (Ainsworth, 2004).

3.3.1 Chlorine
Mode of action
Chlorine gas and water react to form HOCl and hydrochloric acid (HCl). In turn,
the HOCl dissociates into the hypochlorite ion (OCl–) and the hydrogen ion
(H+), according to the following reactions:

     (1) Cl2 + H2O ⇔ HOCl + HCl
                      Inactivation (disinfection) processes                   45

   (2) HOCl ⇔ H+ + OCl–

   The reactions are reversible and pH dependent:
   • between pH 3.5 and 5.5, HOCl is the predominant species
   • between about pH 5.5 and 9.5, both HOCl and OCl– species exist in
        various proportions
   • above pH 8, OCl– predominates.

    The OCl– and HOCl species are commonly referred to as free chlorine, which
is extremely reactive with numerous components of the bacterial cell. HOCl can
produce oxidation, hydrolysis and deamination reactions with a variety of
chemical substrates, and produces physiological lesions that may affect several
cellular processes. Baker (1926) theorized that chlorine destroys
microorganisms by combining with proteins to form N-chloro compounds.
Chlorine was later found to have powerful effects on sulfhydryl groups of
proteins (Green & Stumpf, 1946, Knox et al., 1948; Venkobachar, Iyengar &
Rao, 1977) and to convert several Į-amino acids by oxidation into a mixture of
corresponding nitriles and aldehydes (Patton et al., 1972). The exact product of
the reaction depends on chlorine concentration and pH (Dakin 1916, 1917;
Wright 1936).
    Cytochromes, iron-sulfur proteins and nucleotides are highly vulnerable to
oxidative degradation by HOCl, suggesting that chlorine causes physiological
damage primarily to the bacterial cell membranes (Venkobachar, Iyengar &
Rao, 1977; Camper & McFeters, 1979; Haas & Engelbrecht, 1980; Albrich,
McCarthy & Hurst, 1981). Respiration, glucose transport and adenosine
triphosphate levels all decrease in chlorine-treated bacteria (Venkobachar,
Iyengar & Rao, 1977; Camper & McFeters, 1979; Haas & Engelbrecht, 1980).
Electron microscopy of chlorinated bacteria has demonstrated morphological
changes in the cell membrane (Zaske, Dockins & McFeters, 1980). In addition,
chlorination can kill microbes by disrupting metabolism (Wyss, 1961) and
protein synthesis (Pereira et al., 1973), or by modifying purine and pyrimidine
bases and thus causing genetic defects (Patton et al., 1972; Hoyano et al., 1973;
Haas & Engelbrecht, 1980).
    Nearly 100 years of chlorination for disinfection of drinking-water has
demonstrated the effectiveness of this process for inactivation of microbial
pathogens, with the notable exception of Cryptosporidium.

Effectiveness of chlorine against bacteria and viruses
Table 3.1 shows CT values for 99% (2-log) inactivation of bacteria for various
chlorine-based disinfectants. In general, the heterotrophic bacteria grown in
46                      Water treatment and pathogen control

drinking-water were more resistant to disinfection than the laboratory-grown
Escherichia coli.

   Certain bacteria show a high level of resistance to free chlorine. Spore-
forming bacteria such as Bacillus or Clostridium are highly resistant when
disseminated as spores. Acid-fast and partially acid-fast bacteria such as
Mycobacterium and Nocardia can also be highly resistant to chlorine
disinfection. One study showed that nearly all of the bacteria surviving chlorine
disinfection were Gram positive or acid fast (Norton & LeChevallier, 2000),
possibly because Gram-positive bacteria have thicker walls than Gram-negative
ones.
   Enteric viruses are generally more resistant to free chlorine than enteric
bacteria, with CT values for 99% inactivation ranging from about 2 to more than
30 mg/min l–1 (Figure 3.2). Viruses associated with cellular debris or organic
particles may require high levels of disinfection due to the protective nature of
the particle surface (Akin & Hoff, 1986; Hoff, 1992). Chlorination effectively
inactivates viruses if the turbidity of the water is less than or equal to
1.0 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). It requires a free chlorine residual of 1.0
or greater for 30 minutes, and a pH of less than 8.0. For groundwaters where
turbidities are generally low, or for filtered surface water, White (1999) suggests
the CT guidelines for the 99% virus inactivation shown in Table 3.2. These data
are based on conservative interpretation of inactivation data for Coxsackie A2.

Effectiveness of chlorine against protozoa
Protozoan cysts such as Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia are highly
resistant to chlorine disinfection and may require prolonged contact times at
high chlorine residuals (2–3 mg/l) to achieve 99.9% (3-log) inactivation. Clark,
Read & Hoff (1989) have described a mathematical model for Giardia
inactivation that is based on the infectivity data:
48                       Water treatment and pathogen control

      CT = 0.9847 C 0.1758 pH 2.7519 temp –0.1467


      where:

      C = the disinfectant residual concentration
      temp = the reaction temperature in degrees Celcius

   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has published
extensive CT tables for Giardia inactivation, for different temperature, pH,
chlorine residual and other factors (USEPA, 1989b). For example, at a
temperature of 25°C and pH 8.0, with a chlorine residual in the range of 1 to
2.6 mg/l, a contact time of 54–65 minutes is needed to achieve a 3-log reduction
in Giardia (Table 3.3). If the temperature is reduced to 10°C, the contact time
increases to 162–194 minutes (Table 3.4), and at 0.5°C it increases further, to
304– 368 minutes (Table 3.5).

   E. histolytica cysts were inactivated at pH 7.0 in 10 minutes at 25°C with a
residual of 3.5 mg/l (Chang, 1982). At pH 4, 30°C and 10 minutes of exposure,
2 mg/l of free chlorine produced a 99.9% reduction of cysts; however, if the pH
was increased to 10, a chlorine concentration of 12 mg/l was needed to achieve
the same 3-log reduction. Data on other emerging protozoan pathogens are
lacking, although a recent report indicated that the microsporidian
Encephalitozoon syn. Septata intestinalis was inactivated by more than 3 logs
when exposed to 2 mg/l chlorine for 16 min at pH 7 and 25°C (Wolk et al.
2000).
   Chlorine-based disinfectants are generally not effective at inactivation of
Cryptosporidium (Table 3.6) and early studies found that Cryptosporidium
oocysts were resistant to a variety of hospital disinfectants, including bleach
(Campbell et al., 1982). Chlorine disinfection has not been effective in
preventing outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium in
drinking-water and recreational water. Korich et al. (1990) reported that 80 mg/l
of free chlorine or monochloramine required 90 minutes to achieve 90%
inactivation of oocysts, and suggested that conventional disinfection practices
would do little to inactivate waterborne Cryptosporidium. However, Rasmussen
et al. (1994) examined the disinfection effectiveness of several biocides and
found that inactivation of oocysts required an oxidation/reduction potential of
about 800 mV, maintained for 30 minutes (Table 3.6). These authors suggest
that oxidation/reduction potential is more important than CT for oocyst
inactivation.

By-products of disinfection with chlorine
THMs and other halogenated compounds are the main by-products of
disinfection with chlorine. Factors affecting the formation of THMs are
discussed in Safe piped water: Managing microbial water quality in piped
distribution systems (Ainsworth, 2004).

3.3.2 Monochloramine
Mode of action
In dilute aqueous solutions (1–50 mg/l), chlorine reacts with ammonia in a
series of bimolecular reactions:

      HOCl + NH3  NH2Cl (monochloramine) + H20
      HOCl + NH2Cl  NHCl2 (dichloramine) + H20
                      Inactivation (disinfection) processes                  51

   HOCl + NHCl2  NCl3 (trichloramine) + H20

   These competing reactions are dependent upon pH and the relative chlorine
to nitrogen concentration (expressed as Cl2:N). To a lesser degree they are also
dependent upon temperature and contact time. The reaction of HOCl and
ammonia will convert all the free chlorine to monochloramine at pH 7–8 when
the Cl2:N ratio is equimolar (5:1 by weight) or less.
   Ingols (1958) examined the reaction of monochloramine with several amino
acids and tripeptides. Exposure of alanine, tyrosine and glycylgylcylgylcine to
the disinfectant for several hours at 25oC and pH 8.0 converted these
compounds to organic chloramines. The sulfhydryl groups of cystine were
oxidized to disulfides (by comparison, exposure of the same compounds to
HOCl produced a variety of oxidized, hydrolysed or deaminated reactants).
Reaction of monochloramine with hemin (an important component of enzymes
such as cytochromes, catalases and peroxidases) resulted in products that could
not be reactivated by reducing compounds. The author concluded that
monochloramine may kill bacterial cells by reacting primarily with membrane-
bound enzymes.
   Jacangelo & Olivieri (1985) examined the reaction of monochloramine with
amino acids, nucleic acids, nucleotides, nucleosides, purine and pyrimidine
bases, and ribose sugars. Monochloramine was most reactive with
sulfur-containing amino acids and tryptophan. When the sulfhydryl groups of
cysteine were in excess, 1 mol of monochloramine reacted with 2 mol of
cysteine to form 1 mol of the cystine disulfide. When monochloramine was in
excess, the reaction proceeded beyond the disulfide state.
   Watters et al. (1989) extended the observations of Jacangelo & Olivieri
(1985) by examining whole cells. They found that Enterobacter cloacae could
be reactivated after exposure to chloramine by addition of sodium sulfite, and
hypothesized that sodium sulfite could reduce oxidized disulfides, or result in
other types of oxidative injury. Interestingly, sodium sulfite had no effect on
organisms exposed to free chlorine. The results suggest that free chlorine and
chloramine react with different functional groups in the cell membrane.
   Jacangelo & Olivieri (1985) found that monochloramine reacted more slowly
with nucleic acids and free purine and pyrimidine bases than with amino acids.
These results support the observation that many viruses are inactivated more
slowly than bacterial cells. Berman & Hoff (1984) showed that simian rotavirus
SA11 required more than 6 hours contact with 10 mg/l preformed
monochloramine at pH 8.0 to achieve 99% inactivation. Shih & Lederberg
(1976) found that exposure of Bacillus subtilis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to
monochloramine induced single and double stranded breaks, reduced the
52                   Water treatment and pathogen control

transforming activity of DNA and enhanced the sensitivity of DNA to
endonuclease cleavage.

Effectiveness of monochloramine
Monochloramine is not recommended as a primary disinfectant because of its
weak disinfecting power (Table 3.1). This disinfectant is not effective for
inactivation of Cryptosporidium (Table 3.6). In systems using monochloramine,
free chlorine is usually applied for a short time before addition of ammonia, or
an alternative primary disinfectant is used (e.g. ozone, chlorine dioxide).

By-products of disinfection with monochloramine
Treatment to produce a monochloramine residual poses the risk of nitrite
formation in the distribution system, especially in low-flow stagnant areas,
because bacteria on surfaces and in deposits may nitrify any slight excess of
ammonia.

3.3.3 Chlorine dioxide
Chlorine dioxide is a strong oxidant that can be used to control iron, manganese
and taste and odour causing compounds. It has also been used as a secondary
disinfectant in many European countries.

Mode of action
Chlorine dioxide is highly soluble in water (particularly at low temperatures),
and is effective over a range of pH values (pH 5–10). Theoretically, chlorine
dioxide undergoes five valence changes in oxidation to chloride ion:

                          ClO2 + 5e– = Cl– + 2O2–

   However, in practice, chlorine dioxide is rarely reduced completely to
chloride ion (White 1999). Chlorine dioxide is thought to inactivate
microorganisms through direct oxidation of tyrosine, methionyl, or cysteine-
containing proteins, which interferes with important structural regions of
metabolic enzymes or membrane proteins (Gates 1998). In water treatment,
chlorine dioxide has the advantage of being a strong disinfectant, but not
forming THMs or oxidizing bromide to bromate.

Effectiveness of chlorine dioxide against bacteria and viruses
Chlorine dioxide is roughly comparable to free chlorine for inactivation of
bacteria and viruses at neutral pH (White, 1999), but is more effective than free
chlorine at pH 8.5 (Hoff & Geldreich, 1981).

Effectiveness of chlorine dioxide against protozoa
Chlorine dioxide is an effective disinfectant for control of Giardia lamblia; the
required CT values for 1-log inactivation (pH 6–9) range from 5 mg min/l at
20oC to 21 mg/min l–1 at 0.5oC (USEPA, 1989b; White, 1999). The 3-log
inactivation CT values (pH 6–9) range from 19 mg/min l–1 at 15oC to
63 mg/min l–1 at 0.5oC. These values are 3–14 times less than those required for
free chlorine, but approximately 20 times more than those required for ozone.
   Figure 3.3 summarizes results from various studies of Cryptosporidium
inactivation by chlorine dioxide. Peeters et al. (1989) reported 1.5 and 1.2-log
inactivation of Cryptosporidium, using an animal infectivity method, for CT
values of 3 and 9.8 mg/min l–1, respectively (average of initial and final
concentrations). Korich et al. (1990) reported a CT value of 78 mg/min l–1, with
an initial concentration of 1.3 mg/l and a contact time of 60 minutes, for a 90%
(1-log) inactivation of Cryptosporidium, based on mouse infectivity. The CT for
1-log inactivation was calculated to be 51 mg/min l–1 (average of initial and
final concentrations). Finch, Liyanage & Belosevic (1995) recalculated the
Korich data using a dose–response model developed for CD-1 mice, and
estimated a 99% (or 2-log) inactivation. Ransome, Whitmore & Carrington
(1993), employing the excystation viability method, reported Cryptosporidium
inactivation ranging from 0.14 to 1.4-log for average CT values ranging from
6.5 to 67.5 mg/min l–1, respectively. Based on results from 12 animal infectivity
experiments, Finch et al. (1997) reported Cryptosporidium inactivation ranging
from 0 to greater than 3.2-log for average CT values ranging from 12.5 to
212 mg/min l–1. Chlorine dioxide concentration decreased markedly at contact
times of more than 30 minutes, a factor that could result in low CT values.
LeChevallier et al. (1996) found that oocysts were more rapidly inactivated by
chlorine dioxide at pH 8.0 than at pH 6.0, and that effectiveness was reduced by
40% when temperature was reduced from 20oC to 10oC. This finding is
supported by other studies (Bernard et al., 1965; Owens et al., 1999; Ruffle,
Rennecker & Marinas, 1998). Chlorine dioxide inactivation rates using a cell
culture technique to determine infective oocysts were similar to rates generated
using animal infectivity tests.

Figure 3.3 Summary of Cryptosporidium inactivation by chlorine dioxide



By-products of disinfection with chlorine dioxide
The chlorine in chlorine dioxide exists in a +4 oxidation state, compared to an
oxidation state of +1 for chlorine in free chlorine (in hypochlorous and
hypochlorite ions). This means that chlorine and chlorine dioxide have different
pathways for disinfection and formation of by-products when used in drinking-
water treatment. For example, chlorine dioxide does not produce significant
levels of halogenated organic by-products.
   Chlorine dioxide forms undesirable inorganic by-products (chlorite and
chlorate ions) upon its reaction with constituents of water such as dissolved
organic carbon, microbes and inorganic ions. Therefore, a water utility may
need to provide additional treatment depending on the level of these inorganic
by-products and their specific regulatory requirements (Gordon & Bubnis, 1995;
WHO, 2000).

3.3.4 Ozone
Ozone has been used for more than a century for water treatment, mostly in
Europe, although its use is now spreading to other countries.

Mode of action
The mechanism by which ozone inactivates microbes is not well understood.
Ozone in aqueous solution may react with microbes either by direct reaction
with molecular ozone or by indirect reaction with the radical species formed
when ozone decomposes. Ozone is known to attack unsaturated bonds, forming
aldehydes, ketones or carbonyl compounds (Langlais, Reckhow & Brink, 1991).
Additionally, ozone can participate in electrophilic reactions, particularly with
aromatic compounds, and in nucleophilic reactions with many of the
components of the microbial cell. Carbohydrates and fatty acids react only
slightly with ozone, but amino acids, proteins, protein functional groups (e.g.
disulfide bonds) and nucleic acids all react very quickly with it (Langlais,
Reckhow & Brink, 1991). It is likely, therefore, that microbes become
inactivated through ozone acting on the cytoplasmic membrane (due to the large
number of functional proteins), the protein structure of a virus capsid, or nucleic
acids of microorganisms.
    Free radicals formed by the decomposition of ozone are generally less
effective for microbial inactivation than molecular ozone, because microbial
cells contain a high concentration of bicarbonate ions that quench the free
radical reaction, and many microbial cells also contain catalase, peroxidase, or
superoxide dismutase to control the free radicals produced by aerobic
respiration. In addition, some bacteria contain carotenoid and flavonoid
pigments that protect them from ozone. These factors can account for reports
that heterotrophic bacteria may be less susceptible to ozone inactivation than
Giardia (Wolfe et al., 1989). Studies of peroxone (a mixture of ozone and
hydrogen peroxide that promotes the generation of hydroxyl free radicals)
showed that peroxone was comparable to ozone, or slightly more potent, when
CTs were based on ozone residuals (Wolfe et al., 1989). These results suggest
that free radicals provide little benefit in terms of microbial destruction.

Effectiveness of ozone against bacteria and viruses
Of the vegetative bacteria, Escherichia coli is one of the most sensitive
(Table 3.7), while Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus and Streptococcus),
Gram-positive bacilli (Bacillus) and mycobacteria are the most resistant
(Langlais, Reckhow & Brink, 1991). Mycobacterium avium can be effectively
controlled by low doses of ozone (CT99.9 of 0.1–0.2 mg/min l–1), whereas the
56                         Water treatment and pathogen control

organism is highly resistant to free chlorine (CT99.9 of 551–1552 mg/min l–1 for
water-grown isolates) (Taylor et al., 2000).

Adapted from Hoff (1986)

   Viruses are generally more resistant to ozone than vegetative bacteria,
although phage appear to be more sensitive than human viruses (Langlais,
Reckhow & Brink, 1991).

Effectiveness of ozone against protozoa
For the protozoa Giardia lamblia and Naegleria gruberi, ozone inactivation
(Table 3.7) did not follow linear kinetics, due to an initial latent phase.
However, CT products could be reasonably estimated with a CT99 (a CT for
99% inactivation) of 0.53 and 4.23 mg/min l–1, respectively, at 5°C
(Wickramamayake, Rubin & Sproul, 1984).
   Ozone is effective for removal of Cryptosporidium (Table 3.8). Noticeable
for Cryptosporidium is the impact of the analytical method on the CT values.
Generally, excystation and vital staining are more conservative measures of
oocyst inactivation than animal infectivity. Reliance on excystation and vital
staining alone could greatly overestimate disinfection requirements for
Cryptosporidium. On average, 4.5 mg/min l–1 CT was required for 99% oocyst
inactivation (measured by mouse infectivity) by ozone at 20–25oC (Table 3.8).
However, Finch et al. (1993) indicated that the conventional method of
determining CT by using the final concentration of reactants at the end of the
contact time overestimates the CT needed for disinfection and unduly increases
treatment costs. The authors recommended the Holm disinfection model, which
integrates the disinfectant concentration and time throughout the reactor. Using
this alternative calculation, CT for Cryptosporidium inactivation were
6.9 mg/min l–1 at 7oC and 2.4 mg/min l–1 at 22oC.

    To date, there are no accepted CT values for ozone for inactivation of
Cryptosporidium, either for regulatory or operational application. Results of
disinfection studies vary widely between studies and even between replicate
trials. The USEPA is evaluating options for Cryptosporidium disinfection by
ozone and, for developmental and cost-estimating purposes, is using values that
encompass the range of experimental variability (Table 3.9). These values will
probably be replaced with consensus values eventually, but are presented here to
demonstrate the range of ozone CT values for different water temperatures and
levels of inactivation.

Effectiveness of ozone against algal toxins
Ozonation is an effective process for destruction of both intracellular and
extracellular algal toxins. Essentially complete destruction of microcystins,
nodularin and anatoxin-a can be achieved if the ozone demand of the water is
satisfied (Yoo et al., 1995b; Chorus & Bartram 1999).

3.3.5 Ultraviolet light
Mode of action
UV light can be categorized as UV-A, UV-B, UV-C or vacuum-UV, with
wavelengths ranging from about 40 to 400 nm. The UV light effective for
inactivating microorganisms is in the UV-B and UV-C ranges of the spectrum
(200–310 nm), with maximum effectiveness around 265 nm. Thymine bases on
DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are particularly reactive to UV light and form
dimers (thymine–thymine double bonds) that inhibit transcription and
replication of nucleic acids, thus rendering the organism sterile. Thymine dimers
can be repaired in a process termed ‘photoreactivation’ in the presence of light,
or ‘dark repair’ in the absence of light (Jagger, 1967). As a result, the strategy in
UV disinfection has been to provide a sufficiently high dosage to ensure that
nucleic acid is damaged beyond repair.

Effectiveness of UV against bacteria and viruses
Table 3.10 shows that UV is an effective disinfectant for bacteria and viruses
(USEPA, 1986; Wolfe, 1990; Battigelli, Sobsey & Lobe, 1993). Bacillus subtilis
spores are commonly used as a bioassay organism because of their resistance to
inactivation, requiring about 31 mW-sec/cm2 for a 4-log inactivation of spores
(Qualls & Johnson, 1983). MS-2 is an F-specific single-stranded RNA virus
                         Inactivation (disinfection) processes                        59

about 20 nm in diameter that can be used as a viral surrogate (Braunstein et al.,
1996). Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses and are very resistant to
UV inactivation. Typical doses used for drinking-water disinfection would not
be effective for treatment of adenoviruses.

Effectiveness of UV against protozoa
Most of the early work on UV disinfection of Giardia (Rice & Hoff, 1981;
Karanis et al., 1992) and Cryptosporidium (Lorenzo-Lorenzo et al., 1993;
Ransome, Whitmore & Carrington, 1993; Campbell et al. 1995) relied upon
excystation or vital staining to determine viability and found that UV
inactivation was not effective for Giardia cysts or Cryptosporidium oocysts.
However, more recent work (Clancy et al., 1998ab; Bukhari et al., 1999;
USEPA, 2003) using mouse infectivity or cell culture showed that low or
medium-pressure mercury vapour UV lamps, or pulsed UV technology can
achieve 3-log inactivation of Cryptosporidium oocysts at UV doses less than
10 mW-sec/cm2 (Figure 3.4). Similar sensitivities to UV inactivation have
recently been shown for Giardia (Craik et al., 2000).

Guidelines and standards relating to the use of UV
Recently, guidelines have been developed to evaluate the effects of reactor
design, selection of UV lamps, performance standards for lamp ageing and
fouling, and the accuracy of UV sensors (DVGW, 1997; ÖNORM, 2001;
USEPA, 2003). Standards for the installation and operation of UV systems are
important because the effectiveness of UV disinfection can be impaired by the
transmittance of the water, colour and the presence of particulate material.

3.3.6 Mixed oxidants
The use of mixtures of oxidants for microbial inactivation has gained attention
as a way to maximize the efficiency of current disinfectants. The chemistry of
mixed oxidant production is complex, resulting in a solution of free chlorine,
chlorine dioxide, ozone and various oxidation states of chlorine. The oxidants
can be produced from a sodium chloride brine in an electrolytically generated
cell. Venczel et al. (1997) examined the inactivation of Cryptosporidium oocysts
and Clostridium perfringens spores in oxidant demand-free water at pH 7 and
25°C using a disinfectant dose of 5 mg/l and contact times up to 24 hours. Free
chlorine produced no measurable inactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum
oocysts after exposure for 4–24 hours, although Clostridium perfringens spores
were reduced by 1.4 logs after 4 hours. In contrast, a mixed oxidant solution
resulted in more than 3-log inactivation of both oocysts and spores with 4 hours
exposure. Other researchers, however, have found the mixed oxidant process
equivalent to free chlorine for inactivation of biofilm samples (Crayton, Camper
& Warwood, 1997). Additional research is needed to better understand the
chemistry of seemingly incompatible oxidants within the mixed oxidant
reaction.

Sequential disinfection
Other approaches to combining the advantages of various oxidants have used
sequential disinfection. Finch, Kathleen & Gyurek (1994) reported that the
sequential combination of free chlorination followed by monochloramination
produced superior oocyst inactivation compared to the sum of both disinfectants
examined separately. The combination of free chlorine (1 mg/l for 60 min) and
chloramines (2 mg/l for 240 min) are typical values that might be found in
conventional treatment plants. Similar synergies have been seen for ozone and
chloramines, free chlorine and chlorine dioxide, and chlorine dioxide followed
by free chlorine or chloramines (Liyanage, Finch & Belosevic, 1997; Corona-
Vasquez, Rennecker & Marinas, 1999; Li, Finch & Belosevic, 1999). Sequential
disinfection has been proposed, to lessen or eliminate the inactivation lag phase
62                   Water treatment and pathogen control

(Corona-Vasquez, Rennecker & Marinas, 1999). Combinations of disinfectants
require further investigation, and may provide important insights into
inactivation mechanisms and disinfection theory.


3.4 SECONDARY DISINFECTION
This section looks at the use of secondary disinfection to maintain water quality
in distribution systems. The publication Safe piped water: Managing microbial
water quality in piped distribution systems (Ainsworth, 2004) provides more
detail on this topic.

3.4.1 Maintenance of water quality in the distribution system
The purpose of a secondary disinfectant is to maintain the water quality
achieved at the treatment plant throughout the distribution system up to the tap.
Secondary disinfection provides a final partial barrier against microbial
contamination and serves to control bacterial growth. The practice of residual
disinfection has become controversial, with some opponents arguing that if
biological stability is achieved and the system is well maintained, the
disinfectant is unnecessary. These positions are presented in a series of papers
published in Water Supply (Vol. 16(3/4), 1998).

3.4.2 Factors affecting microbial occurrence

Disinfectant residual and disinfectant level
The growth of bacteria and occurrence of coliforms depend on a complex
interaction of many factors including water temperature, disinfectant type and
residual, pipe material, corrosion and other engineering and operational
parameters (Berger, LeChevallier & Reasoner, 1992; LeChevallier et al., 1991,
1993; LeChevallier, Welch & Smith, 1996). Recent research has indicated that
various disinfectants differ in their ability to interact with biofilm bacteria
(LeChevallier, 1991; De Beer, Srinivasan & Stewart, 1994). Monochloramine,
although a much less reactive disinfectant than free chlorine, is more specific in
the type of compounds that it will react with. Therefore, monochloramine can be
more effective than free chlorine at penetrating and inactivating certain types of
biofilm, particularly those containing corrosion products (LeChevallier, Lowry
& Lee, 1990; LeChevallier et al., 1993; Norton & LeChevallier, 1997). A study
of 30 distribution systems showed a difference in the density and occurrence of
coliform bacteria between systems using free chlorine and those using
chloramines (LeChevallier et al., 1996). Modelling indicates that the penetration
                       Inactivation (disinfection) processes                    63

of free chlorine into a biofilm is limited by its fast reaction rate (De Beer,
Srinivasan & Stewart, 1994). Free chlorine is essentially consumed before it can
react with the bacterial components of the film (Chen & Stewart, 1996).
Chloramines, on the other hand, are slower reacting; they can diffuse into the
biofilm and eventually inactivate attached bacteria, a mechanism that has been
demonstrated using an alginate bead model (Chen and Stewart, 1996). Stewart,
McFeters & Huang (2000) showed that free chlorine did not effectively
penetrate alginate beads containing bacterial cells, but chloramines did penetrate
into the alginate material and reduced bacterial levels nearly one million-fold
over a 60 minute interval (2.5 mg/l chloramines, pH 8.9). Kool, Carpenter &
Fields (1999) reported that hospitals supplied with water containing a
chloramine residual were 10 times less likely to have water-associated legionella
infections. Similarly, Heffelfinger et al. (2003), in a study of 166 hospitals,
found that nosocomial legionellosis was five times less likely in the hospitals
served with chloraminated water. The authors attributed the effectiveness of
chloramines for legionella control to the ability of the disinfectant to penetrate
biofilms.
   In addition to the type of disinfectant used, the residual maintained at the end
of the distribution system was also related to coliform occurrences
(LeChevallier, Welch & Smith, 1996). Systems that maintained dead-end free
chlorine levels of less than 0.2 mg/l or monochloramine levels of less than
0.5 mg/l had substantially more coliform occurrences than systems maintaining
higher disinfectant residuals. Systems with high assimilable organic carbon
(AOC) levels needed to maintain high disinfectant residuals to control coliform
occurrences. Therefore, maintenance of a disinfectant residual alone does not
ensure that treated waters will be free of coliform bacteria.

Biostability
The presence of biodegradable organic matter in water will promote bacterial
growth, and may be related to the occurrence of coliform bacteria in distribution
systems (Bourbigot, Dodin & Lheritier, 1984; Camper et al., 1991; Geldreich &
Stevens, 1987; LeChevallier, Babcock & Lee, 1987; LeChevallier et al., 1991).
Biodegradable organic matter is commonly measured as AOC or biodegradable
dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). Van der Kooij (1987) showed that AOC
concentrations increased in water samples treated with increasing chlorine
doses. Similarly, Hambsch & Werner (1993) reported higher biodegradability of
humic substances after chlorination. LeChevallier et al. (1992) found that
chlorination may increase AOC levels, depending on the point of chlorine
application.
64                    Water treatment and pathogen control

Corrosion control and pipe materials
Corrosion of iron pipes can influence the effectiveness of chlorine-based
disinfectants for inactivation of biofilm bacteria (LeChevallier, Lowry & Lee,
1990; LeChevallier et al., 1993; Ainsworth, 2004). Free chlorine is affected to a
greater extent than monochloramine, although the effectiveness of both
disinfectants is impaired if corrosion rates are not controlled (LeChevallier,
Lowry & Lee, 1990; LeChevallier et al., 1993). Improving corrosion control can
improve the ability of residual disinfectants to control bacterial growth (Norton
& LeChevallier, 1997).
   The pipe surface itself can influence the composition and activity of biofilm
populations. Biofilms develop more quickly and support a more diverse
microbial population on iron pipe surfaces than on plastic polyvinylchloride
(PVC) pipes, even with adequate corrosion control, biological treatment of
water to reduce AOC levels and consistently maintained chlorine residuals
(LeChevallier et al., 1993; Camper, 1996).

Pressure, cross-connection control and maintenance
Microbial quality of drinking-water cannot depend only on maintenance of a
residual disinfectant. The extensive nature of the distribution system, with many
kilometres of pipe, storage tanks, interconnections with industrial users and the
potential for tampering and vandalism, provides opportunities for
contamination. Cross-connections are a major risk to water quality. Although
the risk can be reduced by vigilant control programs, complete control is
difficult to achieve and water utilities worldwide face challenges in maintaining
an effective cross-connection control program.
   Despite the best efforts to repair main breaks using good sanitary procedures,
main breaks provide an opportunity for contamination to enter the distribution
system. Utilities typically isolate the affected section and repair, superchlorinate
and flush the repaired pipe. However, it may be difficult to achieve flushing
velocities sufficient to remove all contaminated debris; also, microbiological
tests to check the final water quality may not detect contaminating organisms.
McFeters, Kippin & LeChevallier (1986) reported high levels of damaged
coliform bacteria, not detectable by standard coliform techniques, following the
repair of a main break. Resampling of the site one week later showed
persistence of high levels of the coliform bacteria, detectable only using m-T7
agar, a medium specially designed to recover chlorine-damaged coliforms.
   Backflow devices to prevent the entry of contaminated water are important as
a distribution system barrier. Because of high costs, backflow devices are
installed mainly on service lines for facilities that use potentially hazardous
substances (e.g. hospitals, mortuaries, dry cleaners and industrial users). It is not
                      Inactivation (disinfection) processes                    65

common for all service connections to have backflow devices, so the possibility
of back-siphonage exists at certain points. Also, installation of backflow devices
for all service connections would make routine checking of the devices nearly
impossible and, without routine inspection, the proper functioning of the units
cannot be assured. Even when backflow devices have been installed,
contamination events have occurred. For example, the failure of a backflow
check valve allowed water stored for fire protection to enter the distribution
system in Cabool, Missouri (USA) (Geldreich, 1996). A broken vent in the
storage tank allowed birds to enter and contaminate the water with Salmonella.
Three people died from Salmonella infection.
   Recent research is focusing on transient pressure waves that can result in
hydraulic surges in the distribution system (Kirmeyer et al., 2001). These waves
have both a positive and negative amplitude, meaning that they can create
transient negative pressures (lasting only a few seconds) in a distribution
system, which may be missed by conventional pressure monitoring. Because
these waves travel through the distribution system, any point where water is
leaking out of the system is a potential entry point for microbes during the brief
period of negative pressure.

3.4.3 Other non-chlorine disinfectants
Non-chlorine disinfectants include other halogens (iodine, bromine) and a
variety of metals. Various authors (Hsu, 1964; Sharp, Floyd & Johnson, 1975;
Alvarez & O’Brien, 1982; Pyle, Broadaway & McFeters, 1992) have proposed
these alternative disinfectants for use in drinking-water supplies, although
currently none have gained widespread acceptance. A combination of copper
and silver ions can inactivate bacteria and viruses, although contact times may
be long (hours to days) (Derby, 1947; Thurman and Gerba, 1989; Pyle,
Broadaway & McFeters, 1992). Low levels of chlorine (0.1 mg/l) combined
with silver (38 µg/l) and copper (380 µg/l) resulted in more than 5-log
inactivation of E. coli in tap water within 120 seconds (Thurman and Gerba,
1989). Silver (30 µg/l) and hydrogen peroxide (30 µg/l) together provided a
long-lasting residual effect capable of more than 5-log inactivation of E. coli in
phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) after one hour exposure (Pedahzur et al., 1995).
Photocatalytic titanium dioxide has also been examined for disinfection of water
(Wel et al., 1994).

Performance models




This chapter describes two models for microbial removal or inactivation by
water treatment processes. Section 4.2 describes a model for removal of
particles by granular filtration, and shows how it can be used to predict the
effect of process variables on the removal of microbial pathogens. Section 4.3
discusses a number of different models used to describe experimental
disinfection data.


4.1 REMOVAL PROCESS MODELS
The removal process model described here is based on a mechanistic
performance model that was first developed and applied in water filtration by
O’Melia and co-workers (O’Melia & Stumm, 1967; Yao, Habibian & O’Melia,
1971). Substantial modifications have been made by Fitzpatrick & Spielman
(1973), Rajagopalan & Tien (1976) and others. An extensive review of these
theoretical models is available (Elimelech et al., 1995). The version described
here is that of Rajagopalan & Tien (1976). It considers particle removal by

68                    Water treatment and pathogen control

granular filters to involve two steps: transport and attachment. This section
describes these two steps, and then considers each of the process variables in
terms of their effect on the removal of microbial pathogens.

4.1.1 Transport
In the removal process, particles are first transported from suspension to a
nearby media grain. The transport step, which is physical–hydrodynamic in
nature, involves three main mechanisms:
   • interception — particles following the streamline of fluid flow come
         into contact with a media grain (this mechanism is affected by the size
         of the particle);
   • sedimentation — particles with density greater than that of water
         deviate from the streamline of fluid flow by gravity and come into
         contact with a media grain;
   • diffusion — particles subjected to random motion by their thermal
         energy come into contact with a media grain.

   Single collector efficiencies (defined as the ratio of the number of successful
collisions between particles and a filter media grain to the total number of
potential collisions in the projected cross-sectional area of the media grain) have
been well developed to describe these transport mechanisms.

4.1.2 Attachment
To be removed, a particle must not only come into contact with a media grain,
but must also attach to it. Not all contacts between particles and media lead to
attachment; an attachment efficiency (α) is used to represent the fraction of
successful contact. The value of α varies from one (all contact results in
attachment) to zero (no contact results in attachment). In drinking-water
treatment, chemical coagulation pretreatment promotes attachment efficiency,
with optimized coagulation conditions increasing the value of α. A predictive
equation for removal efficiency can be derived from single collector efficiency,
attachment efficiency and the total number of media collectors.

4.1.3 Effects of process variables on removal efficiency
Variables that can affect the efficiency of removal of microbial contaminants by
granular filtration include coagulation conditions, filtration rate, diameter of
medium, filter depth and water temperature. Figure 4.1 illustrates the effects of
these variables, as a function of particle size, and Table 4.1 shows the
                              Performance models                               69

parameters used in these simulations. The theoretical results give some
indication of removal of microbial pathogens by granular filtration, but the
model has limitations. First, it was developed for a clean bed and a
monodisperse suspension, and thus does not take into consideration temporal
variation in filter performance. Second, it was developed for passive (nonmotile)
particles; however, some microbes (e.g. some species of coliform bacteria) are
motile. Cell motility may change both transport mechanism and removal
efficiency. Little is known of the effects of cell motility on filter performance,
and the model does not take this factor into account. Finally, the model has been
successfully tested for nonmicrobial particles but has yet to be systematically
tested with microbes. Each of the process variables, and its effect on removal
efficiencies, is considered in detail below.

Particle size
Model calculations indicate that particle diameter has a dramatic effect on
removal mechanisms and efficiency (Figure 4.1a). Microbes that are submicron
in size (e.g. viruses) are transported to media particles by molecular diffusion
(Brownian motion). For such particles, removal efficiency decreases as particle
size increases, because small particles diffuse faster than large ones. Assuming
that microbes do not change in size before entering the filter, and that
coagulation conditions are optimal (α = 1.0), model predictions suggest the
filter could remove 6.38 logs of MS2 bacteriophage (2.5 × 10–8 m diameter),
3.21 logs of rotavirus (7.0 × 10–8 m) and 2.53 logs of PRD1 bacteriophage
(10–7 m).
    Microbes with a diameter larger than about a few microns (e.g. protozoan
cysts, algae and some bacteria) are removed by interception (Figure 4.1a).
Removal efficiency of such particles increases as microbial size increases,
because larger particles are more easily intercepted by the filter medium. When
the filter is operated under optimal chemical coagulation, the predicted removal
efficiencies are 1.44 logs for Cryptosporidium oocysts (5 × 10–6 m) and 4 logs
for Giardia cysts (10 × 10–6 m). Numerous studies (e.g. Nieminski & Ongerth,
1995; Swertfeger et al., 1999) show that Giardia cysts are removed more
efficiently than Cryptosporidium oocysts. Removal by gravity is never a
dominant mechanism in these simulations; even for large microbes such as
Balantidium coli cysts (6 × 10–5 m), the density of the particles (1.05 g/cm3) is
similar to that of water. The effect of gravity is insignificant for most
microorganisms in the influent to filters, unless they are associated with dense
particles.

   Removal efficiency is lowest for microbes with a diameter of about 1 µm
(Figure 4.1a). Particles of about this size are too large for diffusion to be
effective and too small for interception to be effective. Thus, even with optimal
coagulation conditions (α = 1.0), the model predicts that the filter removes only
0.64 logs of coliform bacteria (1.0 × 10–6 m). Some bacteria in this size range
will be motile, which will influence their removal, but the model does not take
this into account.

Pretreatment with chemical coagulants
The calculations shown in Figure 4.1b illustrate the significant effect on
filtration performance of pretreatment with chemical coagulants. When
coagulation conditions change from optimal (α = 1.0) to poor (α = 0.05), log
removals deteriorate from 6.38 to 0.20 for MS2 bacteriophage, from 0.64 to
0.03 for coliform bacteria, from 1.44 to 0.07 for Cryptosporidium oocysts, and
from 4.00 to 0.20 for Giardia cysts. These simulated effects of chemical
coagulation on filtration performance are qualitatively consistent with many
experimental results (e.g. Al-Ani et al., 1986; Ongerth, 1990).

Filtration rate
The effect of filtration rate on filter performance depends on the size of the
particle (Figure 4.1c). For microbes greater than a few microns in diameter, with
a density close to that of water, removal is mainly by interception, and is
therefore not strongly affected by filtration rate. Thus, increasing the filtration
rate from 5 m/h to 20 m/h decreases the modelled removal efficiency only
72                    Water treatment and pathogen control

slightly. For example, the removal of Giardia cysts reduces from 4.03 logs at a
filtration rate of 5 m/h, to 3.58 logs at 10 m/h and to 3.22 logs at 20 m/h. A
similar result has been observed experimentally by Al-Ani et al. (1986).
However, the effects of filtration rate on removal efficiency are much more
pronounced for submicron microbes, where removal is mainly due to diffusion,
which is strongly affected by filtration rate. For example, the modelled removal
of rotavirus decreases from 3.21 logs at a filtration rate of 5 m/h to 1.27 logs at
20 m/h.

Filter medium size and depth
Filter medium size (Figure 4.1d) and depth (Figure 4.1e) strongly affect
microbial removal by filtration. Decreasing the size of the medium or increasing
the depth of the filter increases the removal efficiency. This is in part because
the number of filter media collectors increases, favouring the capture of
particles. Decreasing the medium size also enhances the contact opportunity
between particles and media grains due to diffusion and interception.

Temperature
Temperature has some effect on the removal of submicron microbes, but almost
no effect on the removal of those larger than 1 µm (Figure 4.1f). When the
modelled temperature was reduced from 20oC to 5oC, the removal efficiency of
MS2 bacteriophage decreased from 6.38 logs to 4.66 logs, although the removal
of Cryptosporidium oocysts was only reduced from 1.44 logs to 1.31 logs. This
is partly because particle removal by diffusion (important for removal of
submicron microbes) is strongly dependent on temperature, with an increase in
temperature decreasing water viscosity and thus increasing the rate of diffusion.
Particle removal by interception (important for larger microbes) is, on the other
hand, not affected by temperature.


4.2 DISINFECTION MODELS
A number of researchers have used models to describe experimental disinfection
data (Haas & Karra, 1984; Haas et al., 1995). The simplest disinfection model
(Equation 1) is a combined one proposed by Chick (1908) and Watson (1908).
In the Chick–Watson model, the rate of inactivation of a microorganism is
dependent upon the concentration of the disinfectant and contact time.
Equation 2 represents the integrated form of Equation 1, and simplifies to CT
(the disinfectant concentration multiplied by contact time) when n (the
coefficient of dilution) is equal to 1.
                                Performance models                             73

   (1) r = –kCn N

   (2) ln (N/No) = –kCnt

   where:
   r = rate of microorganism inactivation
   k, n = empirical constants
   C = disinfectant concentration, M/V
   N = microorganism concentration at time t, #/V
   No = microorganism concentration at time t, #/V

    Another disinfection model, represented in equations 3 and 4, was proposed
by Hom (1972). It provides for a relationship between disinfectant concentration
and contact time, and empirical constants m and n. The Hom model successfully
described the disinfection of Giardia (Haas et al. 1995) and Cryptosporidium
(Finch et al., 1993), and converts to the Chick-Watson model when m is equal to
1. In a typical disinfection experiment, disinfectant concentration decreases with
time and a first order decay rate is generally assumed (Equation 5). Haas et al.
(1995) presented the integrated form (Equation 6) after substitution of Equation
5 into Equation 3.

   r = -kmNCntm–1                                                        (3)

   ln (N/No) = - kCntm                                                   (4)

   C = Co e–k’t                                                          (5)

   ln(N/No) = -(m/nk’)m*kCon*[1-e(–nk’t/m)]m                             (6)

   where:
   k’ = first order decay rate of disinfectant, 1/t
   Co = initial disinfectant concentration, M/V
   k, m, n : empirical constants for Hom model
   t = contact time

   Variations on these disinfection models are possible but are rarely used. The
simple Chick-Watson model was the most appropriate model for comparing
Cryptosporidium disinfection data from a number of research groups, because of
the inherent variation in experimental data (unpublished data, International
Cryptosporidium CT Workshop, Washington, DC, January 12–14, 1998).
74                    Water treatment and pathogen control

4.2.1 Integrated disinfection design framework
The integrated disinfection design framework (IDDF) model incorporates
disinfection kinetics into a hydraulic model of the treatment process (Bellamy,
Finch & Haas, 1998). The four steps in implementing the framework are:

     1.   Determine the contactor hydraulics.
     2.   Determine the disinfectant characteristics.
     3.   Determine the inactivation kinetics.
     4.   Develop a disinfection model.

   The advantage of the IDDF model is that it more accurately predicts
microbial inactivation because it accounts for basin hydraulics, the decay of the
disinfectant within the basin and non-linear disinfection kinetics. The model can
be run as a spreadsheet calculation or with an easy-to-use operator interface.
Because of the need to balance disinfection efficiency with disinfection by-
product formation, a variation of the IDDF model will probably be used to
estimate Cryptosporidium inactivation under future regulatory scenarios.
5
Treatment variability




Maintaining reliable treatment performance is critical for minimizing microbial
risk, because health effects associated with microbial contaminants tend to be
due to short-term, single dose exposure rather than long-term exposure.
However, drinking-water treatment is a dynamic process and the treatment
efficiency for removal or inactivation of microbial pathogens is variable. This is
illustrated by an on-site survey of 100 water treatment plants across the USA,
which found that the removal efficiency of particles greater than 2 µm ranged
from 0.04 to 5.5 logs, with a median value of 2.8 logs (McTigue et al., 1998).
The study also found significant variation in the removal efficiencies of
Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts, although the removal of these
pathogens did not necessarily correlate directly with the removal of particles.
    Some process variation is normal and expected; however, too much
variability can result in treatment failures, leading to waterborne disease
outbreaks. It is the objective of drinking-water standards, therefore, to keep
process variability within acceptable limits.

   This chapter looks at the possible effects of treatment process variability,
how changes in one unit process can affect the efficiency of other processes, the
dynamic nature of treatment processes, the effects of changes in raw water
quality and the variation that can arise from process measurements.


5.1 EFFECTS OF PROCESS VARIABILITY
Treatment efficiency for removal of microbes may vary between treatment
plants, between unit treatment processes and between microbes. The net result is
that removal efficiency may some sometimes be low. Figure 5.1 shows
hypothetical log removals of a microbe by the conventional water treatment
processes of coagulation and clarification, filtration and disinfection, as a
cumulative frequency distribution function. An average removal of, for
example, 1 log by coagulation and clarification, 2 logs by filtration and 3 logs
by disinfection would result in an average removal of 6 logs for the combined
processes. However, because of the variability associated with each unit
process, the removal efficiency may be as low as 3.4 logs for 10% of the time.
   Although it may be possible to offset the reduced performance of removal
processes (e.g. coagulation and clarification, and filtration) with increased
disinfection, often the failure of one process affects the performance of other
processes. This is because unit processes in water treatment plants are
interrelated, as described below.


5.2 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TREATMENT
    PROCESSES
The performance of a treatment unit can affect the efficiency of downstream
treatment units. For example, the presence of suspended solids increases the
resistance of most microbes to disinfection (LeChevallier, Evans & Seidler,
1981). Therefore, a failure in the removal efficiency of turbidity or particles by
granular filtration processes can decrease the inactivation efficiency of
disinfection processes. Similarly, clarification affects filter performance.
Clarification removes suspended solids, thus reducing the solid loading to the
filters and improving filter performance. If an incorrect dose of coagulant is
used and floc is carried over from a sedimentation tank, head loss develops more
rapidly, shortening the filter run.
    A further example of how treatment processes are related is the effect of pre-
oxidation on the removal of particles and microbes by granular filtration. By
affecting the surface properties of particles and microbes, pre-oxidation can
improve the performance of granular filters (Au et al., 2002). However, many
                                Treatment variability                                77

water utilities are considering delaying or omitting the addition of oxidants such
as chlorine and ozone before filtration, in an attempt to reduce the formation of
disinfectant by-products. These strategies must be carefully considered because
of possible adverse effects on filtration performance (Au & LeChevallier, 2000).
Possible impacts (either positive or negative) on other unit processes must be
evaluated when considering modification of any unit process to achieve a
particular microbial goal.




Figure 5.1 Hypothetical example of log removal as function of per cent occurrence.



5.3 DYNAMIC NATURE OF TREATMENT PROCESSES
Variation in the efficiency of water treatment processes can be due to the
dynamic nature of the processes. For example, removal efficiency of granular
media high-rate filtration varies throughout a filter run, which may last from a
few hours to several days. As described in Chapter 2 (Section 2.5.1), after a
filter is cleaned by backwashing, it performs poorly during the ripening period,
before achieving a stable level of performance, which will eventually be
followed by degradation and breakthrough of microbes at the end of the run.
The effect of the variable performance of an individual filter on the final quality
of the filtered water can be reduced by using multiple filters. This concept is
78                    Water treatment and pathogen control

similar to that of multiple barriers, where sufficient overlap in treatment systems
ensures a reliable finished water quality.


5.4 EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN RAW WATER QUALITY
Changes in raw water quality can affect the efficiency of treatment processes.
Depending on local and seasonal situations, each water treatment plant
encounters different ranges of raw water quality. Data from 67 surface water
treatment plants in the USA showed that the variation in particles greater than
3 µm in raw water followed a log-normal distribution pattern; particle
concentrations ranged from 28/ml to 11 × 107/ml, with a geometric mean of
22 800/ml (Arora et al., 1998). Factors influencing raw water quality are
discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.2). A change of any water quality parameter in
the source water may affect apparent treatment efficiency, as discussed in
Section 5.3. For example, in their study of 67 surface water treatment plants in
the USA, Arora et al. (1998) found that the removal efficiency (based on the
difference in particle concentrations between raw and filtered waters) increased
with increasing particle concentration in raw water. For raw water particle
concentrations from 103–25 × 103/ml, the median removal efficiency was
2.08 logs; whereas, when concentrations increased to 106–107/ml, the median
removal efficiency increased to 3.2 logs. The greater removal efficiency at
higher particle concentrations was due primarily to more efficient clarification.
This is to be expected because removal of particles by clarification depends
significantly on aggregation efficiency, which is a second-order process with
respect to particle concentration (i.e. a higher particle concentration means that
particles will collide more frequently and thus be more likely to aggregate).


5.5 VARIABILITY DUE TO PROCESS MEASUREMENTS
With respect to removal of microbes, treatment reliability relates to the expected
variation in treatment performance. Monitoring of process performance must
include assessment of variability. However, uncertainties in analytical
measurements may make this process more complex, particularly when few
analyses are performed (Frey et al., 1998). Direct measurements of treatment
performance for microbial removal may be difficult due to the time it takes to
perform the analysis and the low concentrations of microbes in raw waters.
Surrogate measures such as turbidity, particle counts or total coliforms may be
used, but these also have limitations (Nieminski & Bellamy, 2000).
   These difficulties and limitations create uncertainties in estimating treatment
performance, meaning that observed (apparent) treatment performance and
variability may not reflect the actual (intrinsic) performance. For example, a
                                Treatment variability                           79

treatment plant may show 2 logs of particle count removal, resulting in an
effluent count of 10 particles/ml. If the source water particle count increases due
to a storm event, so that the difference between the source water level and the
treated count (which is still 10 particles/ml) is now 4 logs, without any change
in treatment parameters, has treatment improved? Using the apparent measure of
performance (i.e. particle counts), the conclusion would be that it has improved.
However, the apparent improvement of the performance of the treatment
process was influenced by changes in the source water; the intrinsic capability
of the plant to provide 4 logs of microbial protection may have been present all
along!
    A study by McTigue et al. (1998) illustrates this point (Table 5.1). In pilot
plant experiments, the level of Cryptosporidium was varied from 26 to
4610 oocysts/l. Monitoring of the plant effluent showed a consistent removal of
approximately 4 logs. Turbidity and particle count data, which were limited
because of relatively low levels in source water, showed an apparent removal of
1.0–1.6 logs. A plot of Cryptosporidium levels in raw water versus detection of
oocyst in filtered effluent suggests that breakthrough occurs at a treatment plant
performance level of approximately 4–5 logs (Figure 5.2).

Process control




To assure optimal finished water quality, control programs should be
comprehensive, and should include multiple barriers and adequate process
design and operation. As discussed in Chapter 1, the third edition of the World
Health Organization’s (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality provides
guidance on the development of a water safety plan, based on a water safety
framework (WHO, 2004). Such control programs are the basis for maintaining
reliable treatment performance. Multiple barriers should provide a consistent
level of protection, and adequate design and operation should ensure that
performance meets specifications. Even so, treatment performance is likely to
vary, mainly because of the dynamic nature of each individual treatment
process, the interrelationship between different processes and changes in raw
water quality, as discussed in Chapter 5.
    This chapter looks at process control, in the context of a risk management
approach, from source water to the distribution system.

6.1 RISK ASSESSMENT AND PROCESS CONTROL
Use of risk assessment techniques as a tool for process control in the water
industry has received increased attention in the past decade. Examples of such
techniques include “hazard analysis critical control point” (HACCP) and
“failure mode and effects analysis” (FMEA) (Hall, Watts & Egerton, 2000). In
FMEA, risk is quantified (ranked) in terms of the frequency of specific failure
events and the consequences of those failures, as illustrated in Table 6.1.
Selection of appropriate failure events, such as a high concentration of particles
or coliforms, is directly correlated with microbial risk. Using the rankings, risk
can be quantified for individual elements of the treatment process or for whole
treatment works.

effects analysis

1        Very unlikely (< 1/100 years)
2        Unlikely (> 1/100 years)

4        Frequent (> 1/year)
5        Very frequent (>1/month)
Rank     Consequence of failure

         report)

4        Severe (regulatory exceedance, adverse publicity)
5        Catastrophic (life or health threatening, environmental damage)

  The water safety plan described in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water
Quality (WHO, 2004) provides a common framework for applying risk
management techniques in the water industry. The procedure has three main
components:
• System assessment to determine whether the drinking-water supply chain as
   a whole (up to the point of consumption) can deliver water of a quality that
   meets identified targets. It includes assessment of design criteria for new
   systems.
• Identification of control measures in a drinking-water system that will
   collectively control identified risks and ensure that the health-based targets
   are met. For each control measure identified, an appropriate means of
                                 Process control                                83

    monitoring should be defined, to ensure that any deviation from required
    performance is rapidly detected.
•   Management plans describing actions to be taken during normal operation
    or incident conditions, and documenting the system assessment (including
    upgrade and improvement), monitoring and communication plans, and
    supporting programmes.

   This common framework quantifies hazards or risks within the whole
treatment process, and identifies important monitoring and remedial actions at
designated hazard control points. The rest of this chapter discusses hazard
control process in a conventional water treatment plant.


6.2 SOURCE WATER PROTECTION
Table 6.2 summarizes the main elements of a hazard control strategy for source
waters. Understanding variations in raw water quality is important because such
variations affect the treatment efficiency (as discussed in Chapter 5, Section 5.4)
and thus the health risk associated with the finished water. In general, raw water
quality is influenced by both natural and human factors. Important natural
factors include wildlife, climate, topography, geology and vegetation. For
example, beavers and other mammals are potential sources of Giardia
intestinalis, and migratory geese have caused seasonal increases in coliform
bacteria in some north-eastern water supply watersheds in the USA (Robbins et
al., 1991). Human factors include point sources (e.g. discharges of municipal
wastewater and industrial wastewater) and nonpoint sources (e.g. urban runoff,
livestock or recreational activities). Municipal wastewater can be a major source
of microbial pathogens, urban runoff and livestock can contribute a substantial
load of coliform bacteria, and recreational activities involving body contact can
be a source of faecal contamination.

    Protection of source water can help to minimize microbial risk associated
with the water entering a drinking-water treatment plant. Possible control
measures to protect source water include land acquisition, watershed inspection
programmes, reservoir-use restrictions and riparian buffers. Few water utilities
own all or even most of the land within their watersheds; thus, it may be
difficult for water utilities alone to control or reduce the risk from identified
hazards. Competition for water and pressure for increased development in a
catchment may appear to limit the extent to which potentially polluting activities
can be reduced. However, it is often possible to contain hazards without
substantially restricting activities. Collaboration between stakeholders can allow
pollution to be reduced without reducing beneficial development.
    From a water utility perspective, developing a monitoring programme and
carrying out corresponding actions at the early stage of the treatment process are
sometimes the most effective ways to minimize microbial risk from raw water.
Examples of methods to reduce the risk include determining the vulnerability of
the intake to microbial contaminants, managing the raw water pumping schedule
and applying pretreatment oxidants.
    Hydrological events can increase microbial levels in source water. For
example, rainfall can wash microbes into receiving streams and increased
stream flow can resuspend microbes settled in streambed sediments. Figure 6.1
demonstrates a peak in Cryptosporidium levels associated with rainfall, and
subsequent increases in river flow and turbidity levels (Atherholt et al., 1998).
Similar increases in total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and
staphylococci have been seen in other studies (e.g. Davis, Casserly & Moore,
1977). Changes in flow may also be due to release of water from upstream
dams, reservoirs or other impoundments. Turnover of lakes and reservoirs
following seasonal stratification can release microbes or other factors that
increase disinfectant demand, which may interfere with treatment operations.

   A watershed-monitoring network can be useful for detecting contamination
events and alerting downstream users of the pending plume. For example, the
Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO1) is a network of
users of water from the Ohio River. ORSANCO monitors daily for a variety of
contaminants, and serves as a centralized clearing house for data analysis and
interpretation. By pinpointing the source of the contamination, violators can be
identified and prosecuted. The result is a greater attention to minimizing
contamination reaching the river and an overall improvement in water quality.
Similar networks are present for some of the major rivers in Europe and Asia
(e.g. the Rhine River in Germany, Holland and Switzerland; the Llobregat River
in Spain; and the River Han in Korea) (Grayman, Deininger & Males, 2000).


6.3 COAGULATION, FLOCCULATION AND
    CLARIFICATION

Coagulation
Chemical coagulation pretreatment is the most important factor in ensuring
efficient removal of microbes by coagulation, flocculation and clarification and
by granular media filtration. It also indirectly affects the efficiency of the
disinfection process. Although the coagulation process itself is unlikely to cause
any microbial hazard or risk to finished water, a failure or inefficiency in the
coagulation process could result in a high microbial risk to drinking-water
consumers. Hazard control strategies for the coagulation process are outlined in
Table 6.3.

                         Effective sludge removal
                         Settled water turbidity or other process indicator



   The first step is to choose an appropriate coagulant (and coagulant aid if
necessary) and dose. Next, it is important to ensure that the chemical feed rate is
appropriate for the plant flow, because changes in flow rate could result in an
over or under-dose of coagulant, impairing performance. Water chemistry and
temperature can affect the performance of many coagulants, and adjustment of
pH may be necessary for optimal performance.
   Commonly used approaches for determining appropriate coagulation
chemistry and for monitoring coagulation include jar tests, streaming current
detectors, zeta potential, pilot filters, historical dosage charts, visual
observations, pH, alkalinity, temperature and ultraviolet (UV) absorbance (for a
review, see Logsdon, Hess & Chipps, 2000). Typically, coagulation efficiency is
evaluated using one or more of these approaches and the process parameters
adjusted accordingly. The choice of approach depends on the site. For example,
streaming current potential may be appropriate when charge neutralization is the
main destabilization mechanism, but may not be suitable when enmeshment in a
precipitate (sweep-floc) is the main mechanism.

Flocculation
Critical to the performance of effective flocculation is gentle mixing to promote
particle aggregation. The calculation of the velocity gradient necessary for
proper flocculation can be estimated by the G value, as shown below:
88                     Water treatment and pathogen control

            P ½
     G=   (—)
           Vµ

     where:
     P = the power input to the fluid
     V = the volume of the flocculator
     µ = the absolute viscosity of the water

   If the G value is too high, the floc may be sheared; if it is too low,
sedimentation may occur within the flocculation basin. In water treatment,
typical G values are 10–100/sec (Weber 1972). Although this calculation has
many flaws, it is useful for flocculator design and scale-up (Letterman,
Amirtharajah & O’Melia, 1999).

Clarification
Factors influencing clarification performance include the surface loading rate
(expressed as flow rate per unit surface area of the clarification basin), the size
and shape of the tank, flow velocity, adequate sludge removal and
physicochemical characteristics of the water (USEPA, 1991; Gregory, Zabel &
Edzwald, 1999). Recommended surface loading rates vary widely, depending on
the type of clarification process. Conventional sedimentation basins may have
surface loading rates of 0.6–2.0 m/h (0.25–0.8 gpm/ft2). High-rate clarifiers may
have surface loading rates of 7 m/h (2.9 gpm/ft2) or greater. Adequate sludge
removal is important because sludge accumulation reduces the volume of the
clarification basin and can increase the velocity of the flow through the basin.
To prevent the formation of currents and breakage of floc, the overflow rate
should be as low as possible. Adjustable V-notched weirs provide operational
flexibility.


6.4 FILTRATION
Granular media filtration is an important barrier to microbes (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.5). It may be the only barrier in some cases; for example, for
removing Cryptosporidium oocysts by direct filtration when chlorine is used as
the sole disinfectant. Hazard control elements for operating granular media
filters to reduce microbial risk are outlined in Table 6.4.
    Filter performance can be evaluated by various methods, such as on-line
measurement of effluent turbidity (from individual and combined filters) and
counting of particles or other surrogates for microbes. To provide
                                    Process control                                      89

comprehensive process control for filtration, it may be useful to measure other
operational parameters related to filter performance (e.g. rate of head loss).
    The riskiest operations to perform with a granular media filter are starting a
filter after backwashing, and increasing the filtration rate (Logsdon, Hess &
Chipps, 2000). Filters typically perform poorly at first after backwashing, and
passage of microbial pathogens during this ripening period can be formidable.
Methods to minimize such problems include various start-up strategies (e.g.
filtering to waste, allowing the filters to settle after backwashing and starting
slowly) and adding a filter aid to the backwash water supply during the final
minutes of the backwash process. Passage of particles and microbes at the end
of a filter run can be avoided by taking the filters out of service before head loss
becomes terminal, or turbidity or particle counts increase. In many systems,
backwash of filters is simply based on the filter run time, to avoid any decrease
in water quality at the end of a filter cycle.

Effective backwash cleaning         Proper bed expansion
                                    Media agitation by air or mechanical washers



    Changes in the filtration rate are often unavoidable; for example, when one
filter is taken off-line for backwashing. An increase in filtration rate can be
detrimental to filtered water quality (Cleasby, Williamson & Baumann, 1963;
Fitzpatrick, Campbell & Cable, 1999). The impact can be minimized in various
ways; for example, by slowly increasing the filtration rates for the filters
remaining in service, or by decreasing plant production while a filter is
temporarily out of service.
    Also critical to the functioning of granular media filters is the cleaning of the
filters during backwash. If not performed correctly, cleaning can lead to
90                       Water treatment and pathogen control

clumping of the filter media (formation of mud balls), improper distribution of
the media (formation of mounds), destratification of the multimedia layers or
media washout. To clean the media grains properly, the filter bed must be
fluidized as well as scoured (either mechanically or by air).


6.5 DISINFECTION
In most conventional treatment processes, an adequate level of disinfection is
critical for reducing microbial risk to acceptable levels (Table 6.5). Microbial
pathogens include highly diverse groups and it is impossible to monitor the
survival of all pathogens. Estimating the level of inactivation of more resistant
microbial pathogens, by applying the CT concept (disinfectant concentration
and contact time) for a particular pH and temperature, ensures that more
sensitive microbes are also effectively controlled. The CT concept can
sometimes be as simple as providing a certain disinfectant residual for a
prescribed contact time.

Indirect monitoring                 Disinfectant dose and/or residual
                                    Contact time
                                    pH, temperature
Direct monitoring                   Coliform, Escherichia coli and/or other treatment
                                    indicators
                                    Surrogates: bacteriophage, spore-forming bacteria



   The use of indirect monitoring methods depends on the type of disinfectant
used (Haas, 1999). For example, control of chlorination systems is often based
on measurements of residual chlorine; control of systems using ozone can be
based on off-gas ozone monitors or measurements of the dissolved ozone
residual; and control of UV systems can be based on continuous monitoring of
light absorption and control of lamps to deliver a particular energy intensity.
   To assess the inactivation efficiency of the disinfection process, indicator
organisms are often used. Typical indicators include total coliforms, faecal
coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria, as measured by heterotrophic plate count
(HPC). Other indicators may include bacteriophage, aerobic spore-forming
bacteria or Clostridium oocysts.

6.6 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Protection of the distribution system is the last and one of the most important of
the multiple barriers necessary for provision of safe drinking-water. Any
microbial contamination at this point has a high probability of resulting in
public health risk, even if previous control steps have been applied effectively.
Because of the extensive nature of the distribution system, with many
kilometres of pipe, storage tanks, interconnections with industrial users and the
potential for tampering and vandalism, opportunities for microbial risk do occur
(Geldreich 1996; Geldreich & LeChevallier, 1999; Ainsworth, 2004). Hazard
control strategies should focus on three essential elements:
    • maintaining the quality of the treated water by adequate maintenance of
        the distribution system;
    • minimizing bacterial growth;
    • preventing recontamination of the water during distribution (Table 6.6).

   Fundamental to the quality of the treated water is the proper operation and
maintenance of the pipe system. The WHO publication Safe piped water:
Managing microbial water quality in piped distribution systems (Ainsworth,
2004) provides comprehensive guidance on the management of distribution
system operation and maintenance. It includes guidance on development of a
monitoring program for water quality and other parameters, such as pressure in
the distribution system. Control measures include using a more stable secondary
disinfecting chemical than is used in primary treatment (e.g. chloramines instead
of free chlorine), reducing the time that water spends in the system (e.g.
avoiding stagnation in storage tanks and looping dead-end sections), replacing
pipes, flushing and relining, and maintaining positive pressure in the distribution
system.
   Critical factors for controlling the replication of bacteria in finished drinking-
water are:
    • maintenance of a disinfectant residual
    • limitation of biodegradable organic material
    • control of corrosion.

   Other parameters, such as temperature, construction materials and detention
time are also important, but may not be easily controlled. In the absence of a
disinfectant residual, the permissible level of biodegradable organic carbon may
be very low.
   Preventing recontamination of the treated water is the primary focus of a
cross-connection control program. Devices to control backflow and back-
siphonage should be installed at any location that may pose a risk to the treated
92                       Water treatment and pathogen control

water (e.g. industrial users, mortuaries, hospitals, tanker trucks and street
cleaners). Hydraulic surges caused by rapid changes in pump or valve
operations may cause transient negative pressures that are not recorded by
conventional pressure monitors (LeChevallier, 1999). Detecting and controlling
leaks can limit the opportunities for entry of microbes during negative pressure
events.
