water systems involved in the collection, storage, treatment or distribution
of potable water. The rules do not apply to systems that are not public water
systems , including irrigation, industrial or similar systems where the water
is used for nonpotable purposes.

B. For the purposes of this article:

1. A public water system is a water system that:

(a) Provides water for human consumption through pipes or other
constructed conveyances.

(b) Has at least fifteen service connections or regularly serves an average of
at least twenty-five persons daily for at least sixty days a year.

2. A public water system as described in paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and
(b) of this subsection includes any collection, treatment, storage and
distribution facilities that are under the control of the operator of a public
water system and that are used primarily in connection with the system and
any collection or pretreatment storage facilities that are not under the
control of the operator of a public water system and that are used primarily
in connection with a public water system.

3. A service connection does not include a connection to a system that
delivers water by a constructed conveyance other than a pipe, if any of the
following applies:

(a) The water is used exclusively for purposes other than residential uses
consisting of drinking, cooking or bathing or other similar uses.

(b) The department determines that alternative water is provided for
residential or similar uses for drinking and cooking and that the water
achieves a level of public health protection that is equivalent to the
applicable national primary drinking water regulations.

or similar uses for drinking, cooking and bathing is centrally treated or is
treated at the point of entry by the water provider, a pass-through entity or
the user to achieve the level of public health protection that is equivalent to
the applicable national primary drinking water regulations.

4. An irrigation district in existence before May 18, 1994 and that provides
primarily agricultural service through a piped water system with only
incidental residential or similar use is not a public water system if the
system or the residential or other similar users of the system comply with
paragraph 3, subdivision (b) or (c) of this subsection.

5. Persons who receive water through connections that are not service
connections pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection are not included in
the computation of the number of persons prescribed by paragraph 1,

be multiplied by the ratio of the wetted surface area of that component to
the total wetted surface area of the entire product to arrive at the weighted
percentage of lead of the component.

2. The weighted percentage of lead of each wetted component shall be added
