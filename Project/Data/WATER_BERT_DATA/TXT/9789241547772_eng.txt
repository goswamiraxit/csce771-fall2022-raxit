The update of this guide was made possible with the support and collaboration of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency; the International Air Transport Association; Health
Canada; the United States National Science Foundation; the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare, Japan; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; the Federal
Ministry of Health, Germany; and the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources,
Singapore.

No conflict of interest was declared.

The development of the third edition of the guide to hygiene and sanitation in aviation was
motivated by the update of the International Health Regulations 2005. It involved a large
number of experts and WHO staff (see names above).

An informal meeting took place in April 2006 in Baltimore, USA, and brought together a
number of key international experts. This meeting was to discuss the content of the existing
version, define additional contributions, agree on next steps and define key contributors.

A meeting of the Expert Network engaged in the development of the Guide to Hygiene and
Sanitation in Aviation, Third Edition, was held in Toronto, Canada, on 24–26 March 2008.
The meeting was facilitated by Health Canada.

Once the contents of the update were completed and agreed to by the expert group, the update
was shared for peer review with a large number of international experts. Comments were
integrated, and the final version was consolidated.

GLOSSARY

Accessible          Capable of being exposed for cleaning and inspection with the use of
                    simple tools, such as a screwdriver, pliers or an open-end wrench.
Adequate hygiene Level of hygiene sufficient for the prevention of public health risk.
Aircraft water      Water service panel, filler neck and the onboard water storage tanks and all
system              of the plumbing and fixtures on the aircraft.
Airport water       On-site airport distribution system and possibly water treatment facilities if
system              the airport is a producer of potable water.
Backflow            Flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution
                    pipes of a potable supply of water from any source or sources other than the
                    potable water supply. Back-siphonage is one form of backflow. See also
                    Back-siphonage.
Backflow            Approved backflow prevention plumbing device that would typically be
preventer           used on potable water distribution lines where there is a direct connection
                    or a potential connection between the potable water distribution system and
                    other liquids, mixtures or substances from any source other than the potable
                    water supply. Some devices are designed for use under continuous water
                    pressure, whereas others are non-pressure types.
Back-siphonage      Backward flow of used, contaminated or polluted water from a plumbing
                    fixture or vessel or other source into a water supply pipe as a result of
                    negative pressure in the pipe.
Biohazard bag       Bag used to secure biohazard waste that requires microbiological
                    inactivation in an approved manner for final disposal. Such bags must be
                    disposable and impervious to moisture and have sufficient strength to
                    preclude tearing or bursting under normal conditions of usage and handling.
Cleaning            Removal of visible dirt or particles through mechanical action, normally
                    undertaken on a routine and frequent basis. The cleaning process and some
                    products used for cleaning also result in disinfection. See also Disinfection.
Communicable        Illness caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites
disease             that can be directly or indirectly transmitted from an infected person to
                    others. Sometimes the illness is due not to the organism itself, but rather to
                    a toxin that the organism produces after it has been introduced into a human
                    host.
Competent           Authority responsible for the implementation and application of health
authority           measures under the International Health Regulations (2005).
Control measures Those steps in the drinking-water supply that directly affect drinking-water
                    quality and that collectively ensure that drinking-water consistently meets
                    health-based targets. They are activities and processes applied to prevent
                    hazard occurrence.
Corrosion resistant Capable of maintaining original surface characteristics under prolonged
                    influence of the use environment, including the expected food contact and
                    the normal use of cleaning compounds and sanitizing solutions. Corrosion-
                    resistant materials must be non-toxic.

                  solution, including liquids that contain chemicals in solution.
Smooth metal      • Corrosion-resistant alloys would typically have at least a No. 4 mill
surfaces              finish, properly applied.
                     •   Cast iron, cast and forged steel and cast nickel alloys, in the food area,
                         would typically have a surface roughness not exceeding American
                         Standard No. 125 (or equivalent).
                     •   Galvanized metal surfaces, where acceptable, would typically have the
                         smoothness of good-quality commercial hot dip.
                     •  Other metals would typically be at least as smooth as commercial-grade
                        rolled sheet steel and free of loose scale.
Smooth surfaces      Surfaces having the following finishes:
                    •    A food contact surface that is free of pits and inclusions with a

Splash contact      Surfaces that are subject to routine splash, spillage or other soiling during
surfaces            normal use.
Transfer point      Site of intermittent connection for water transfer between the hard-plumbed
                    airport water distribution system and the aircraft water system. Sometimes
                    referred to as Watering point.
Traveller           A person in transit between locations.
Turbidity           Light-scattering cloudiness or lack of transparency of a solution due to the

                    eye.
Validation          Investigative activity to identify the effectiveness of a control measure. It is
                    typically an intensive activity when a system is initially constructed or
                    rehabilitated. It provides information on reliably achievable quality
                    improvement or maintenance to be used in system assessment in preference
                    to assumed values and also to define the operational criteria required to
                    ensure that the control measure contributes to effective control or hazards.
Verification        Final monitoring for reassurance that the system as a whole is operating
                    safely. Verification may be undertaken by the supplier, by an independent
                    authority or by a combination of these, depending on the administrative
                    regime of a given country. It typically includes testing for faecal indicator
                    organisms and hazardous chemicals.
Watering point      See Transfer point.
Water safety plan   Documented comprehensive strategy for managing and operating a water
                    supply system.
Water supply        Continuous and vigilant public health assessment and review of the safety
surveillance        and acceptability of drinking-water supplies. There are two types of
                    approaches: audit-based approaches and approaches relying on direct
                    assessment. In the audit approach, assessment activities, including
                    verification testing, are undertaken largely by the supplier, with third-party
                    auditing to verify compliance. In direct assessment, the drinking-water
                    supply surveillance agency carries out independent testing of water
                    supplies.

1.     INTRODUCTION
1.1    General issue and concern

Health and sanitation aspects of international traffic have been of concern to the World
Health Organization (WHO) since 1951, when the Fourth World Health Assembly
recommended that all governments should “improve sanitary and environmental conditions,
especially in and around ports and airports” (resolution WHA4.80); at the same time, the
need for “the sanitary protection of populations in mass movement” was also expressed
(resolution WHA4.8l). Subsequent resolutions of both the World Health Assembly and the
Executive Board emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and
sanitation in international traffic (particularly in relation to the provision of safe water and
food and the correct procedures for the collection and disposal of wastes).

The annex to the first report of the WHO Expert Committee on Hygiene and Sanitation in
Aviation (WHO, 1960a) was published in 1960 as a Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in
Aviation (WHO, 1960b). Its use was recommended by the Twelfth World Health Assembly
to guide health administrations in “fulfilling their obligations under the existing International
Sanitary Regulations, especially the provisions of Article 14, in providing safe food for
international air traffic, and in maintaining satisfactory control of, and protection from,
malaria vectors at airports” (resolution WHA12.18).

The reports of the Committee on International Surveillance of Communicable Diseases, as
adopted by the World Health Assembly, also emphasized the importance of preventing
disease through the improvement of sanitary conditions. The relevant articles of the
International Health Regulations (1969) (WHO, 1969) laid down sanitation requirements at
airports. The provision of criteria and guidelines for the use of administrations in fulfilling
their obligations under the International Health Regulations forms an essential part of WHO’s
functions.

In 1974, the Twenty-seventh World Health Assembly, “believing that, in view of the growth
of international traffic, continuous attention should be given to the safety of food and water
and the handling of wastes in such traffic”, stressed “the need for each Member State to
clarify the ultimate responsibility for the safety of food and water and the proper handling of
wastes in international traffic” and, furthermore, recommended that “Member States
coordinate and ensure the close and active participation in such a responsibility of health
authorities, port and airport management, aircraft operators, shipping companies, tourist
associations, and any other service or agency concerned with international traffic” (resolution
WHA27.46). At the same time, the Director-General of WHO was requested to maintain
close contact with representatives of international organizations concerned with international
traffic with a view to promoting the implementation and coordination of activities aimed at
improving the safety of food and water and the handling of wastes and to prepare appropriate
guidance for the use of health professionals. The outcome of these activities was the
publication of a second edition of the Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation, in 1977
(WHO, 1977).

The basic principles of hygiene have not changed significantly since 1977; however, the
magnitude of air transport operations has grown tremendously. The number of passengers
flying on scheduled airlines rose from 438 million in 1975 to over 2 billion in 2006 (ICAO,
2006), figures that do not take into account charter flight passengers and global corporation


                                                                                               1

business jet passengers, whose numbers are in the millions and increasing every year.
Furthermore, the current trend in international civil aviation is towards aircraft of larger
passenger-carrying capacity and greater range. The introduction of air services into areas with
inadequate public health infrastructure, such as food handling and storage, water supply and
waste disposal, creates a challenge for aircraft operators. To protect public health, the
application of high standards of hygiene should form an integral part of airport and aircraft
operations.

Although hygiene standards have improved during the last few decades, there remains a need

(2005) (WHO, 2005),2 hereafter referred to as IHR (2005), WHO found it appropriate to
revise the second edition of the Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation.

1.2     Scope, purpose and objective

The third edition of the Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation (hereafter referred to as
“the Guide”) addresses water, food, waste disposal, cleaning and disinfection of facilities,
vector control and cargo safety, with the ultimate goal of assisting all types of airport and
aircraft operators and all other responsible bodies in achieving high standards of hygiene and
sanitation, to protect travellers and crews engaged in air transport. Each topic is addressed
individually, with guidelines that provide procedures and quality specifications that are to be
achieved.

The guidelines in this document apply to domestic and international air travel for all
developed and developing countries.

2008a).

  Whereas the IHR (2005) refer to the 194 States to which they apply (including all 193 WHO Member States)
as “States Parties”, for ease of reference, this document refers to these as either “States” or “countries”.

Although aircraft and airport operators should have a plan to respond to deliberate acts that
may threaten public health, this issue is not within the purview of the Guide. The Guide does
not address cabin air quality at this time, as this issue is covered extensively elsewhere
(WHO, 2008a, 2008b). Finally, the Guide will not address the epidemiological aspects of
illnesses related to the topics covered.

1.3    Roles and responsibilities

In addition to the responsibilities of the individual stakeholders (aircraft and airport operators,
ground service providers, etc.), several international bodies, such as the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the
Airports Council International (ACI), play an important role in protecting the health of
passengers and crew.

Aircraft operators are involved at many levels in the chain of events that provide a hygienic
and sanitary environment for air travellers and crew. For example, aircraft operators obtain
potable water from numerous sources, and they have to ensure that each source provides
drinking-water of acceptable quality. Water transfer is a key aspect of loading water onto the
aircraft from the mains supply. The aircraft operator has the responsibility, in concert with the
airport and relevant health authority, to ensure that proper transfer procedures are observed.

The safety of the potable water supply at the airport (including for provision to aircraft) is
generally under the operational responsibility of the airport operator. The airport operator is
generally subject to surveillance by the governmental authority responsible for regulating or
licensing environmental health standards for facilities open for public use.

The airline has full responsibility for the management of water on board the aircraft; proper
water system operation and maintenance procedures are essential to ensure that all of the
intended potable water on board is safe. Cleaning of the aircraft water tanks at regular
intervals is part of the aircraft maintenance process.

Airlines are responsible for the food they serve on board aircraft, whether it is prepared in an
airline-owned “flight kitchen” or obtained from an independently owned catering company.
The steps involved—including food preparation, transport to the aircraft, storage and, finally,
serving on the aircraft—need to be well coordinated in order to avoid contamination.

Routine cleaning and disinfection are also important aspects of aircraft and airport operations.
In addition, aircraft disinfection procedures following transport of a suspected case of
communicable disease are a particularly difficult issue that needs to be addressed by many
stakeholders in a cooperative approach; not all effective disinfectants are suitable for use on
board aircraft, as they may cause corrosion or other damage to the aircraft structure and
contents, or their fumes may be noxious to inhale in an unventilated space. WHO, IATA,
aircraft manufacturers and ICAO are the main organizations involved in determining a
suitable disinfection process at the international level.

Liquid and solid waste disposal is a shared responsibility of the airlines, the airport operators
and the ground service providers. Under supervision of the health authority, they must use an
effective system for the removal, transport and disposal of solid and liquid waste.




                                                                                                 3
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

Human populations, livestock and crops must be protected against the spread of disease by
insects and rodents that may be inadvertently transported by air. The range of responsibility
for this aspect is wide and extends from the site selection of a future airport (away from
mosquito breeding zones) to extermination of insects and rodents by airport and aircraft
operators. The issue of aircraft disinsection is particularly controversial and will be covered
in detail.

Cargo operations, especially with regard to animal transport and hazardous material, are an
important concern mainly for aircraft operators. Ensuring compliance of the shippers and
maintaining cleanliness of cargo areas are two of the main responsibilities of aircraft
operators.

ICAO’s primary role has been the prevention of aircraft accidents. However, in 2004, the
Assembly of ICAO, its governing body, stated that the “protection of the health of passengers
and crews on international flights is an integral element of safe air travel”, and ICAO’s
activities in this area have since increased.

Aircraft and airport operators should cooperate with public health authorities in public health
surveillance. Public health surveillance, defined as the ongoing, systematic collection,
analysis and interpretation of data about specific environmental hazards, exposure to
environmental hazards and health effects potentially related to exposure to environmental
hazards, for use in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health programmes,
must be implemented in the aviation sector, including airports and aircraft. The purpose of
conducting public health surveillance is to identify outbreaks of disease and other health
issues and trace the cause or causes in order to control, and possibly even to eliminate or to
eradicate, the health risks under surveillance. Public health surveillance that involves air
travellers can be particularly challenging, as this population is exposed to many different
potential sources of contagion, including fellow travellers, and it typically disperses quickly
upon arrival at an airport. The cooperation of airport and aircraft operators in providing
information to the public and to public health authorities is essential in these situations.

1.4    Structure of the Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

The Guide is structured into seven chapters:
• Chapter 1—Introduction
• Chapter 2—Water
• Chapter 3—Cleaning and Disinfection of Facilities
• Chapter 4—Food
• Chapter 5—Waste Disposal
• Chapter 6—Vector Control
• Chapter 7—Cargo.

Chapter 1, the Introduction, sets the Guide in its legal context, considering the IHR (2005)
and describing the relationship between the Guide and other international documents. It also
describes the roles, responsibilities and relationships among the relevant stakeholders.

Each of chapters 2–7 follows the same structural approach, consisting of two sections:
“Background” and “Guidelines”.

The “Background” section describes critical issues and supporting health evidence, as well as
an overview of the public health significance of aircraft, both with respect to the specific
topic of the chapter.

The “Guidelines” section in each chapter of the Guide provides user-targeted information and
guidance applicable to the topic of the chapter, identifying responsibilities and providing
examples of practices that can control risks. This section contains a number of specific
Guidelines (situations to aim for and maintain), each of which is accompanied by a set of
Indicators (measures for whether the guidelines are met) and Guidance notes (advice on
applying the guidelines and indicators in practice, highlighting the most important aspects
that need to be considered when setting priorities for action).

1.5     Importance of the modular approach

To properly manage the wide scope of this Guide, a “modular” (i.e. chapter by chapter)
approach to its development has been adopted. The modular structure of the Guide will
simplify subsequent updating as well.

This Guide includes the chapters on water and cleaning and disinfection of facilities. Future
publications will include the remaining chapters.

1.6     Harmonization with the International Health Regulations (2005)

The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) are to prevent, protect against, control and provide
a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate
with and restricted to public health risks and that avoid unnecessary interference with
international traffic and trade (Article 2).

Table 1.1 illustrates public health functions related to points of entry and the mechanisms
behind the implementation of the IHR (2005), which are applicable to aviation as well as to
other types of international transport.

The IHR (2005) are a legally binding agreement for all WHO Member States. Relevant
aspects of IHR (2005) implementation include strengthening the use of scientific principles to
prevent, detect, reduce or eliminate the sources of infection and contamination, to improve


                                                                                                            5

sanitation in and around international ports, airports and ground crossings, to prevent the
international dissemination of vectors and to mandate national and international actions to
prevent the international spread of disease. The IHR (2005) also provide a framework within
which international harmonization may be fostered and a reference for appropriate public
health measures applied to conveyances and at international ports, airports and ground
crossings.

The revision and update of the Guide support this function. The aim is to provide specific
technical guidance on the application of the IHR (2005) to aviation, in the interest of
providing safe drinking-water and food services to travellers as well as enabling sound
hygiene and sanitation practices while mitigating infectious disease vectors.

1.7    Development of the Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

The Guide has been developed through an iterative series of drafting and peer review steps.
These have included expert network meetings, the first being held in Geneva, Switzerland, on
7–8 June 2007, the second in Montreal, Canada, on 22–24 October 2007, and the third and
last in Toronto, Canada, on 24–26 March 2008. Draft material was presented, and comments
were captured and collated to reach a consensus on structure and content.

A complete list of contributors to the Guide can be found in the Acknowledgements section.

2.     WATER
2.1    Background

Travel can facilitate the transfer of communicable disease. The volume and rapidity of travel
can have an international impact on disease. This is particularly true for aircraft, as the global
span of the aviation industry requires the loading and rapid transport of people and supplies
from many locations all over the world. With the 21st-century potential for millions of people
to have access to air travel on a global scale come the added problems encountered by aircraft
operators that transit both into and out of disease-affected areas or areas with variable and
sometimes inadequate standards of general hygiene and sanitation.

One risk is posed by the potential for microbial contamination of aircraft water by animal or
human excreta. This contamination may originate from source waters or may occur during
transfer operations or while water is stored on board the aircraft. Waterborne disease burdens
in many parts of the world include cholera, enteric fevers (Salmonella), bacilliary and
amoebic dysentery and other enteric infections. These diseases are not unique to water; food
may actually be the dominant risk vector in some environments, and, in fact, most airlines
have a good record with respect to known contamination incidents. However, any location is
at risk if proper procedures and sanitation practices are not continuously followed to ensure
the safety of water that is used for drinking and food processing and preparation.

2.1.1 Water supply and transfer chain
Even if the water at the airport is safe, that does not ensure that it will remain safe during the
transfer to the aircraft and storage activities that follow. An understanding of the aircraft
drinking-water supply and transfer chain will help to illustrate the points at which the water
can become contaminated en route to the tap on board the aircraft.

Generally, the aircraft drinking-water supply and transfer chain consists of four major
components:
1. the source of water coming into the airport;
2. the airport water system, which includes the on-site distribution system. It may also
   include treatment facilities if the airport produces its own potable water;
3. the transfer point (sometimes referred to as the watering point), including the water
   transfer and delivery system. It is typically a temporary interconnection between the hard-
   plumbed distribution system of the airport (e.g. at a hydrant) and the aircraft water
   system, by means of potable water vehicles and carts, refillable containers or hoses. This
   water transfer process provides multiple opportunities for the introduction of
   contaminants into the drinking-water;
4. the aircraft water system, which includes the water service panel, the filler neck of the
   aircraft finished water storage tank and all finished water storage tanks, including
   refillable containers/urns, piping, treatment equipment and plumbing fixtures within the
   aircraft that supply water to passengers or crew.

Figure 2.1 is a flow diagram of a typical aircraft potable water supply and transfer chain. It
depicts the water path from potable water source to the aircraft’s galley and lavatory taps
serving passengers and crew.

   2.1.2 Water requirements
   The water storage capacity required for all purposes on board aircraft is based on the number
   of occupants (passengers and crew) and the duration of the flight, while being limited by
   weight, aircraft design and other practical considerations.

   In practice, the capacity of aircraft water systems varies considerably. Examples of the
   potable water carrying capacities of different aircraft are given in Table 2.1.

2.1.3 Health risks associated with water on aircraft

2.1.3.1 Water quality
The importance of drinking-water as a vehicle for the transmission of infectious disease
microorganisms in water supplies has been well documented in public and private water
supplies.

 The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO,     The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-
 2004) (GDWQ) identify the broad spectrum of             water Quality (GDWQ) (WHO,
 contaminants, including microorganisms, inorganic and
 synthetic organic chemicals, disinfection by-products   2004)     provide     comprehensive
 and radionuclides, that can reach hazardous             guidance to ensure the quality and
 concentrations in potable water supplies and describe   safety of drinking-water. Most of
 systematic approaches to risk management. As a          the concerns involving the safety of
 general definition, safe drinking-water, as defined by the
                                                         drinking-water on board aircraft
 GDWQ, does not represent any significant risk to health
 over a lifetime of consumption, including different     focus on acute risks because of the
 sensitivities that may occur between life stages.       short-term and limited exposure
                                                         conditions. Thus, microbial risks
are the principal concerns, although a few risks associated with acutely toxic chemicals also
exist.

Significant microbial risks are associated with ingestion of water that is contaminated with
human and animal excreta, although exposure through food preparation and direct human
contact are probably more significant contributors to overall microbial disease risks.

Studies that highlight the aircraft water safety concern have been conducted by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Health Canada and the United
Kingdom’s Association of Port Health Authorities (APHA) (see Box 2.1). Total coliforms,
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci and clostridia were detected in one
or more studies. Most total coliforms are not pathogens per se, but a positive test is an
indicator of inadequate sanitation practices; E. coli are indicative of recent faecal
contamination, and some E. coli are human pathogens; P. aeruginosa are considered to be
opportunistic pathogens, particularly from external contact with, for example, open wounds;
enterococci are found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals, so they are indicators of
faecal contamination; and Clostridium bacteria are found in the intestines of some humans
and, more so, in dogs, which again points to faecal contamination (WHO, 2004).

 Box 2.1. Studies on aircraft water safety

 Random testing of water on aircraft by Health Canada in June 2006 found that 15.1% of the aircraft
 tested positive for total coliform bacteria and 1.2% tested positive for E. coli. Most contamination
 was found in water from lavatory taps or faucets, indicating the possibility of localized
 contamination rather than general water contamination (Health Canada, personal communication,
 2008).

 During a USEPA study conducted in 2004, 327 passenger aircraft were randomly tested at 12
 airports that served both domestic and international routes. The USEPA analysed the drinking-
 water samples from galleys and lavatories for total coliforms (in the case of a positive result for total
 coliforms, the sample was tested for E. coli/faecal coliforms), total residual chlorine, heterotrophic
 plate count, and total nitrate and nitrite. In regard to the presence of microorganisms, 15% (49/327)
 of the aircraft tested positive for total coliforms in one or more sampling sites, and 4.1% (2/49) of
 these total coliform–positive aircraft also tested positive for E. coli/faecal coliforms. Twenty-one per
 cent of the aircraft tested had a non-detectable chlorine residual (USEPA, 2008).



                                                                                                             9
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

 The APHA study conducted in 1999 examined 850 samples of water from mains, bowser and
 aircraft sources from 13 airports in the United Kingdom. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in
 27% of all samples, total coliforms in 7.8%, E. coli in 0.4%, enterococci in 1.2% and sulfite-reducing
 clostridia in 0.4%. Of the samples with coliform contamination, 7.9% had contamination with faecal
 indicators, compared with 1.3% of samples without coliforms (APHA, personal communication,
 2008).


There are no known reports of illness associated with drinking contaminated water on
aircraft. Nevertheless, the potential for serious illness exists, particularly for those with
compromised health (e.g. individuals with chronic illness).

The water quality guidelines directly applicable to water on aircraft focus on acute risks from
contamination that may be incurred during transfer from the airport, through the transfer
point or on board the aircraft. The focus on acute risks is because the exposure that would
occur during a flight and be experienced by passengers and crew would be intermittent and of
short duration (hours) rather than long term or lifetime, which is the basis for most of the
guidelines in the GDWQ. Typically, the GDWQ assume the consumption of 2 litres of
drinking-water per day by an average 60-kg adult for a lifetime (70 years), 1 litre per day for
a 10-kg child and 0.75 litre per day for a 5-kg bottle-fed infant.

Besides microbial organisms, a few inorganic chemical substances, such as nitrate and nitrite
(which can enter the source water from agricultural activity, sewage inflow or sewage cross-
contamination in plumbed systems) and copper (which may leach into drinking-water from
copper piping), may also be of health concern due to subpopulations that may be at risk from
excess short-term exposures. For instance, methaemoglobinaemia may be caused by the
temporary exposure of infants to nitrate and nitrite, among other contributing factors; and
gastric irritation may result from short-term exposure to copper (WHO, 2004).

Potentially significant cumulative effects of repeated short-term exposures to chemical
hazards should not be overlooked, as they may lead to long-term consequences.

2.1.3.2 Water quantity
An insufficient or non-existent quantity of potable water under pressure on board the aircraft
for drinking, culinary purposes and personal hygiene can have an impact on the health and
welfare of not only the passengers but also the crew.

There may not be enough water for the safe use of lavatories, which may lead to
malfunctioning of some types of toilets, unpleasant odours, contaminated surfaces and an
inability to wash hands. It may also lead to an inability to prepare or serve food in a sanitary
manner, thereby impacting on the provision of safe food to passengers.

Adequate water intake during flight is also important to maintain health and well-being,
although there is no need to drink more than usual (WHO, 2008b). The humidity in aircraft
cabins gradually decreases on long-distance, high-altitude flights, sometimes reaching below
10% (optimum comfort is at approximately 50% humidity). While this low relative humidity
does not cause central dehydration (Stroud et al., 1992; WHO, 2008b), it can cause
discomfort for passengers and crew. Dry, itchy or irritated eyes, dry or stuffy nose, dry throat
and skin dryness are among the most common complaints of cabin crew (Lee et al., 2000).
Regular water intake and use of a skin moisturizer will minimize these symptoms, but it is
possible that some individuals may become intolerant of contact lenses and have to revert to
spectacle use.

The amount of water required for hand washing and other sanitation needs should be
adequately dealt with in typical passenger aircraft designs.

2.1.4 Bottled water and ice
Bottled water is considered as drinking-water by some regulatory agencies and as a food by
others (WHO, 2004). For many airlines, bottled water is the primary or exclusive source of
water used for direct consumption on board aircraft, with the exception of hot beverages.
International bottled water quality specifications exist under the Codex Alimentarius
Commission (FAO/WHO, 2001) and are derived from the GDWQ. Since it is commonly
designated as a food product, bottled water will not be considered further in this chapter, and
the reader is referred to chapter 4 on food.

For the purposes of this Guide, ice supplied to aircraft for both drinking and cooling has been
classified as “food”. Guidance pertaining to ice used on aircraft is contained in chapter 4 on
food. The GDWQ apply to both packaged water and ice intended for human consumption
(WHO, 2004).

2.1.5 Uses of potable water on board aircraft
Potable water is used in a variety of ways on board commercial transport aircraft, including
direct human consumption, food preparation and sanitation/hygiene activities. Potential uses
include:
• preparation of hot and cold beverages, such as coffee, tea and powdered beverages;
• reconstitution of dehydrated foods, such as soups, noodles and infant formula;
• direct ingestion from cold water taps and water fountains;
• reconstitution and/or ingestion of medications;
• brushing of teeth in lavatories;
• hand washing in lavatories and galleys;
• cleaning of utensils and work areas;
• preparation of hot, moist towels for hand and face washing;
• direct face washing in lavatories;
• onboard showering facilities;
• emergency medical use.

Although some of these uses do not necessitate consumption, they involve human contact and
possibly incidental ingestion (e.g. tooth brushing).

2.1.6 International Health Regulations (2005)
Annex 1 B 1 (d) of the IHR (2005) requires every airport specifically designated by a State to
have or develop within a limited period the capacity to provide safe potable water supplies
for travellers using airport facilities.

In accordance with Article 24 (c) of the IHR (2005), all States are required to take all
practicable measures to ensure that international conveyance operators keep their
conveyances free of sources of contamination and infection, which should include drinking-
water. However, it is the responsibility of each aircraft operator to ensure that no sources of
infection and contamination are found on board, including in the water system. For this
purpose, it is important that these standards are being upheld on the aircraft, in terms of both




                                                                                             11
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

the quality of the water taken on board from the source of supply on the ground and
maintenance of water quality on board.

For all States, their competent authorities are required to ensure, as far as practicable, that the
facilities at international airports are in sanitary condition and kept free of sources of
infection and contamination, as per Article 22 (b). This includes providing potable water
from a uncontaminated source that should be approved by the competent authority.

2.1.7 Overview of water safety plans
Water safety plans (WSPs) are the most effective management approach for consistently
ensuring the safety of a drinking-water supply. A potable water source at the airport is not a
guarantee of safe water on board the aircraft, as the water may be contaminated during
transfer to or storage or distribution in the aircraft. A WSP covering water management
within airports from receipt of the water through to its transfer to the aircraft, complemented
by measures (e.g. safe materials and good practices in design, construction, operation and
maintenance of aircraft water systems) to ensure that water quality is maintained on the
aircraft, provides a framework for water safety in aviation. A general overview of WSPs
follows; their specific application to the safety of drinking-water on board aircraft will be
described in section 2.2.

A WSP has three key components, which are guided by health-based targets and overseen
through drinking-water supply chain surveillance. They are:
1. system assessment, which includes
    • description of the water supply system in order to determine whether the drinking-
       water supply chain (up to the point of consumption) as a whole can deliver water of a
       quality that meets health-based targets;
    • identification of hazards and evaluation of risks;
    • determination of control measures, reassessment and prioritization of risks;
    • development, implementation and maintenance of an improvement plan;
2. operational monitoring, which includes identification of control measures that will
    control hazards and risks and verification (to determine whether the system meets health-
    based targets);
3. management and communication, including preparation of management procedures and
    developing supporting programmes to manage people and processes (including upgrade
    and improvement).

The various steps involved in designing and implementing a WSP are illustrated in Figure
2.2.

For more information on general principles of WSPs, see section 6.7.1 of the GDWQ (WHO,
2004) and the Water safety plan manual (WHO, 2009).

2.1.8 Applicability of the GDWQ to the Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation
The GDWQ describe reasonable minimum requirements for safe practices to protect the
health of consumers and derive numerical guideline values for constituents of water or
indicators of water quality. Neither the minimum requirements for safe practices nor the
numerical guideline values are mandatory limits, but rather health-based guidance to national
authorities to establish their own enforceable standards, which may also consider other
factors. In order to define such limits, it is necessary to consider the GDWQ in the context of
local or national environmental, social, economic and cultural conditions.

Nevertheless, given the global nature of air travel and the need for aircraft to board water
from areas with variable and possibly inadequate standards of general hygiene and sanitation,
the GDWQ or national standards should be followed, whichever are more stringent. This
approach will provide passengers and crew with consistent reliable protection from the
potential risks posed by contaminated drinking-water.

2.2    Guidelines

This section provides user-targeted information and guidance, identifying responsibilities and
providing examples of practices that can control risks. Six specific Guidelines (situations to
aim for and maintain) are presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of Indicators
(measures for whether the guidelines are met) and Guidance notes (advice on applying the
guidelines and indicators in practice, highlighting the most important aspects that need to be
considered when setting priorities for action).

The guiding principle for this section is ensuring that water is safe for intended use. Five
of the guidelines that fall under this principle deal with water quality, and one deals with
water quantity.

Guidelines 2.2–2.5 can all be considered components under the umbrella Guideline 2.1.
However, their importance in ensuring safe water quality in aviation warrants that they have
additional detailed elaboration.

2.2.1 Guideline 2.1: Water safety plans

 Guideline 2.1—Water safety plans are in place for each component of the water supply
 chain.

Indicators for Guideline 2.1
1. Design and implement a water safety plan for the airport water source.
2. Design and implement a water safety plan for the airport.
3. Design and implement a water safety plan for the transfer point.
4. Design and implement a water safety plan for the aircraft.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.1
A WSP is an effective means of achieving consistency in ensuring the safety of a drinking-
water supply. The entity responsible for each component of the drinking-water supply chain

                                                   Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

(i.e. water source, airport, transfer point or aircraft) should also be responsible for the
preparation and implementation of a WSP for that part of the process. General roles and
responsibilities for each such component are as follows:

•   Source water supplier (public or private): Role is to provide to the airport a safe water
    supply of sufficient quantity and quality. Responsibilities are to monitor the water system
    by sampling water and providing sampling results to the airport competent authority on
    request, advising the airport authority of any adverse results and action to be taken, and
    advising the airport authority when the water supply has or may become contaminated
    and of action taken.
•   Airport authority: Role is to maintain the integrity of the water supplied and to provide
    safe water to the occupants, travellers, visitors, workers, water haulers and transfer points
    to the aircraft within the airport grounds. Responsibilities are to monitor the water system
    by sampling water and sharing sampling results with authorities and also stakeholders on
    request and to advise not only the water supplier but all concerned parties who use their
    water of any adverse results and corrective actions. In some circumstances, the airport
    may be both the source water supplier and provider of treated drinking-water.
•   Water haulers (transfer point): Role is to provide water to the aircraft. Responsibilities
    are to maintain a safe water supply from the transfer point to the aircraft, to maintain the
    equipment in good working order, to monitor the water system by sampling water and
    sharing sampling results with stakeholders on request and to report adverse results and
    action to be taken to the aircraft operator and airport authority.
•   Aircraft operator: Role is to provide a safe water supply to the passengers and crew for
    drinking, culinary purposes and personal hygiene. Responsibilities are to maintain their
    onboard water tank(s) clean and free of harmful microbial contamination, to monitor the
    water system by sampling water, to share sampling results with stakeholders, to report
    adverse results to the competent authority and take corrective actions, and, when and
    where required, to advise the crew and passengers of the adverse results.

The WSP for an airport source water supplier and drinking-water provider may be fairly
detailed owing to the size and complexity of the facilities, whereas WSPs may be relatively
basic for transfers and on board aircraft. The WSP should be reviewed and agreed upon with
the authority responsible for protection of public health to ensure that it will deliver water of
a quality consistent with the health-based targets.

WSP objectives are met through:
• development of an understanding of the specific system and its capability to supply water
  that meets health-based targets;
• identification of potential sources of contamination and how they can be controlled;
• validation of control measures employed to control hazards (see Figure 2.3 for examples
  of hazards);
• implementation of a system for monitoring the control measures within the water system;
• timely corrective actions to ensure that safe water is consistently supplied;
• verification of drinking-water quality to ensure that the WSP is being implemented
  correctly and is achieving the performance required to meet relevant national, regional
  and local water quality standards or objectives;
• provision (to include development, assessment and overall management, as necessary) of
  appropriate training for all personnel involved in installing, maintaining, operating and
  monitoring all components of the water supply and delivery chain identified in the WSP.

      Figure 2.3. Examples of hazards in the aircraft potable water supply and transfer chain

1. Airport water source
Airports should be supplied with the safest water available from the water provider. The
condition of the municipal supply source water provided to the airport should be known and
controlled. Piped water supply delivered to airports should be obtained from well operated
and maintained systems that conform to GDWQ or national standards monitored by
competent authorities. If the water provided at the airport does not meet the GDWQ or
national requirements, the airport will need to either utilize a higher-quality source or provide
water treatment to meet those quality goals.

2. Airport
The airport authority has the responsibility to ensure the availability of a sufficient quantity of
appropriate quality water. An airport may receive potable water from either a
municipal/public or private supply, or the airport operator itself may be the water supplier
responsible for producing the water that it uses. In the latter case, the airport would be almost
identical to a public water supplier in its operations and responsibilities. The potable water is
delivered to potable water cabinets, water trucks, carts, filling stations and airport buildings
through the airport’s distribution system. The delivery of the potable water to the aircraft is
by designated filling hoses connected to the airport water system either directly or indirectly
through water trucks and carts.

Improperly managed drinking-water can be an infectious disease transmission route at
airports just as it is in municipal supplies. Most municipal waterborne outbreaks have
involved ingestion of water contaminated with pathogens derived from human or animal
excreta, which could be either from water that is supplied from the source or from
contamination by cross-connection in the distribution system. The aircraft is a closed system,
and post-loading contamination should not readily occur with a properly designed system. At
an airport, the transfer procedure between the airport water system and the aircraft is another
significant potential contamination opportunity.

Another possible cause of waterborne outbreaks is cross-contamination within the airport
distribution system. Airports should ensure that water in the airport is potable through
operational monitoring and should implement rigorous programmes to control cross-
contamination during loading, distribution and treatment (e.g. having a cross-connection and
backflow prevention programme).

Periodic self-audits or inspections should be carried out in addition to routine water quality
measurements; these may differ in complexity from audits performed on the transfer point or
aircraft. Corrective actions or procedures should be established and implemented should
contamination be shown or if improper practices are suspected. Communication of this
information to public health authorities and other affected individuals, such as persons served
in the airport or those with responsibility over the water transfer points, is essential.

An example of a WSP for an airport can be found in Annex A.

3. Transfer point
The water transfer points between the airport source and the aircraft onboard storage and
distribution system present significant opportunities for contamination. Common equipment
used to transfer water includes (but is not limited to) piping, hoses, potable water cabinets,
bowsers, tanks, filling stations, refillable urns and jugs, and hydrants (including taps/faucets).
Equipment should be constructed of appropriate materials (e.g. corrosion-resistant materials)
certified for this application, properly designed, operated, labelled and maintained, and used
for no other purpose that might adversely affect the quality of the water. Assumptions and
manufacturer specifications for each piece of equipment need to be validated to ensure that
the equipment is effective.

Potable water should be obtained from those transfer points approved by the competent
authority. The lines’ capacity should be such as to maintain positive pressure at all times to
reduce the risk of backflow. There should be no connections between the potable water
system and other piping systems. Backflow of contaminated water into the potable water
system needs to be prevented by proper installation of piping, backflow prevention devices
and plumbing. Water for drinking and culinary use on aircraft should not be taken from water
closets, washrooms or other places where danger of contamination exists or may develop.

Post-type or wall-type hydrants are preferred, but ground-level-type hydrants can be
acceptable when necessary. Where hoses are used for loading potable water on aircraft, the
hydrant outlet should have a type of coupling that will permit quick attachment and removal
of the hose. For a hose permanently attached to the hydrant outlet, a threaded fitting will be
acceptable. Outlets to all hydrants should terminate in a downward direction or gooseneck,
except that ground-level-type hydrants may discharge horizontally. When the hydrant is of


                                                                                               17
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

the ground-level type or is located in a pit, precautions should be taken in the construction of
the transfer point to ensure that drainage from the hydrant area and from the hydrant box are
adequate to prevent flooding. In new servicing areas, hydrants with weep holes are not
recommended. Hoses should have smooth interior surfaces, be free of cracks, be checked on
a regular basis and be sufficiently durable to withstand hard usage. The nozzle on the end of
the hose should be constructed so as to permit a tight connection with the filling connection
of the aircraft and should be of a different size from that of any waste connections on the
aircraft. All hose connections should be of the quick-coupling type, unless the hose is
permanently attached to a water cart or hydrant. Water hose nozzles and the hose ends should
not touch the ground or any contaminating materials, such as pools of water on the ground.
Hose guard systems are designed in many forms. Guards, discs, balls or other devices, which
will protect the nozzle end of the hose from contamination, should be provided and properly
maintained. Valves at the filling end of such a hose should not be located on the nozzle side
of the disc or protective device. The hose should be stored well away from wastewater
equipment and on special reels or in lockers or cabinets that are used for no other purpose.
Nozzles, fittings and linkages should be covered so as to avoid contamination. The hose
should be flushed thoroughly before being used and periodically sanitized, and it should be
immediately sanitized after any observed contamination from ground operations. Transfer
procedures should be developed to ensure that contact with the ground and other
contaminated surfaces is avoided.

The tanks should be designed so that they can be disinfected and flushed and should be
provided with a drain that permits complete drainage of the tank. They should be labelled
“DRINKING WATER ONLY”. The inlet and outlet to the tank should terminate in a
downward direction or gooseneck and should be provided with caps or closures with keeper
chains for protection against contamination. The inlet and outlet should be equipped with
couplings of a type that permits quick, easy attachment and removal of the hose. When hoses
are transported on the water cart, storage facilities should be provided on the cart to protect
the hoses from contamination.

Potable water provided in refillable urns or jugs for use at water transfer points between the
airport source and the aircraft onboard storage and distribution system should meet relevant
international standards. In such cases, the filling area should be dedicated for this purpose
only and should be free of food manufacturing waste and by-products, general waste and
cleaning agents and should be constructed and maintained in accordance with health
regulations.

Appropriate personal hygiene for employees handling water at the transfer point cannot be
overemphasized, and responsibilities for potable water transfer should be considered
exclusive and separate from wastewater handling to avoid cross-contamination. Under no
circumstances should employees be tasked simultaneously with both wastewater handling
and potable water transfer. Other issues to consider include the development of transfer
procedures to ensure that contact of hose nozzles with the ground and other contaminated
surfaces is not permitted and procedures to ensure that water trucks and carts are not parked
directly adjacent to sewage equipment.

The above lists of equipment and processes are by no means exhaustive. It is essential that,
given the wide range of transfer equipment and processes, the WSP is informed by a
fundamental understanding of the specific transfer processes obtained through hazard and
risk analysis of each system and each type of aircraft and developing standard operating


18
                                                    Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

procedures when appropriate (e.g. when coupling/decoupling from transfer point and
aircraft). Periodic self-audits or inspections should be carried out and can complement routine
water quality measurements; these may differ in complexity from audits performed on the
airport or aircraft. Corrective actions or procedures should be established and implemented if
contamination is shown or improper practices are suspected. Communication of this
information to public health authorities and other affected individuals, such as those with
responsibility over the aircraft, is essential (USFDA, 1995).

An example of a WSP for a transfer point can be found in Annex B.

4. Aircraft
If WSPs at the airport and transfer points have been developed and implemented correctly,
the water provided to the aircraft should be of acceptable quality. If the available water being
provided to the aircraft does not meet the GDWQ or national requirements, then the aircraft
operator must take measures to ensure that water on board is safe. These may include, for
example, a decision not to board water at that location or to obtain water from an alternative
source, such as a contract provider.

Aircraft water systems include the water service panel, the filler neck of the aircraft water
storage tank and all water tanks, refillable containers/urns, piping, treatment equipment and
plumbing fixtures within the aircraft that supply water for use by passengers or crew. In
modern aircraft, water is generally stored in tanks. These should be constructed of welded
stainless steel or reinforced fibreglass. They feed, either by pressure or by gravity, all aircraft
water outlets (i.e. hand-washing basins, galley taps, drinking fountains and water heaters).
Tanks should be designed to drain completely. If the aircraft has only one tank or if several
tanks are located together, there should be a single fill/overflow point; if, on the other hand,
the tanks are located in different parts of the aircraft, each should have its own fill point. In
all cases, the fill points should be separated from the toilet servicing panels to avoid cross-
contamination. Drinking-water access points should be sited outside lavatories. If
appropriate, the water should be cooled by passing through automatic coolers. All
components in the water system should be corrosion resistant and suitable for use with
hyperchlorinated water. On some aircraft, carbon filters are used to neutralize the chlorine in
the drinking-water at the tap for taste purposes. On occasion, these are incorrectly described
as purifying filters. If they are not serviced regularly, the cartridges may proliferate bacteria
or even disintegrate. Also, once the chlorine content has been removed, the water has no
protection against bacteria introduced downstream from the filter, and heterotrophic plate
count (HPC) regrowth may also occur. Such filters should therefore be fitted at each water
outlet. If desired, point-of-use treatment devices exist with the capability of removing,
inactivating or killing microorganisms in drinking-water. Careful testing and selection are
necessary to determine the appropriateness and performance characteristics of candidate
devices. Point-of-use devices are intended not to replace disinfection of the bulk water, but to
provide an extra safety measure, if it becomes necessary.

In some aircraft, potable water is stored in refillable urns or jugs or the aircraft tank supply is
supplemented by an extra quantity in flasks. This practice is not recommended—particularly
in the case of drinking-water—because of the great risk of contamination of flasks, since
these are offloaded at all airports and may not always be properly disinfected before being
refilled. However, in the case where refillable urns or jugs are used, suppliers of refillable
urns or jugs installed as part of the aircraft onboard water storage and distribution system
should meet appropriate international standards. Aircraft onboard water distribution systems


                                                                                                19
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

incorporating refillable urns or jugs should be maintained using the original manufacturer’s
guidance or approved bottle change/cleaning procedures.

Manufacturer specifications and assumptions for proper use of each piece of equipment
should be validated to ensure that the equipment is effective. Periodic self-audits or
inspections should be carried out and can complement routine water quality measurements;
these may differ in complexity from audits performed on the airport or transfer point.
Corrective actions or procedures should be established and implemented if and when
contamination is shown or improper practices are suspected. Communication of this
information to public health authorities and other affected individuals, such as passengers and
crew on board the aircraft, is essential (USFDA, 1995).

An example of a WSP for an aircraft can be found in Annex C.

2.2.2 Guideline 2.2: Drinking-water quality standards

 Guideline 2.2—All water on board aircraft intended for human contact meets GDWQ
 or national standards, whichever are more stringent.

Indicators for Guideline 2.2
1. E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms are not detectable in any 100-ml sample.
2. A disinfectant residual is detectable in water samples at the airport, at the transfer point
   and on the aircraft.
3. All samples meet GDWQ or national standards for chemicals of acute significance or for
   chemicals with potentially significant cumulative effects from repeated short-term
   exposures.
4. Temperature, pH, ionic composition and alkalinity are controlled within appropriate
   ranges for the particular water type to minimize corrosivity and potential leaching of
   metals, such as copper, lead and iron.
5. Turbidity is monitored, and increases in turbidity are investigated to ensure that water has
   not been subjected to post-treatment contamination.
6. No undesirable tastes, colours or odours are present in the drinking-water.
7. All airport and aircraft hand-washing facilities supply potable, hot and cold running water
   or warm running water. Each drinking-water tap supplies running water at room
   temperature or colder. The temperature of the water is comfortable for its intended use,
   but not so scalding as to discourage use or inflict injury. Water pressure is sufficient for
   the intended purpose.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.2
All of the water on the aircraft intended for drinking, food preparation or human contact
should be potable and meet the GDWQ specifications or national standards, whichever are
more stringent. Specific requirements applicable to water on aircraft are provided in
Guideline 2.2. If the water provided at the airport, at the transfer point or on the aircraft does
not meet the GDWQ or national requirements, the appropriate responsible entity must take
measures to ensure that water on board will be safe. These may include, for example,
providing water treatment, deciding not to board water at that location and/or obtaining water
from an alternative source, such as a contract provider.

More detailed discussions can be found in the GDWQ (WHO, 2004).

                                                  Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation


1. E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms
By far the greatest risks in drinking-water are associated with microbial contamination from
human excreta sources. Escherichia coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms are utilized as
the indicators of potential contamination with pathogens associated with human excreta.
Total coliforms are not necessarily indicators of faecal contamination, but may reflect lack of
general cleanliness. Escherichia coli and thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms should be
measured using generally accepted analytical techniques.

In some instances, local source water contamination may indicate the potential for presence
of protozoan pathogens such as Cryptosporidium or viruses, whose presence may not be well
indicated by E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms and that require more stringent
treatment. Based upon the findings of the WSP, additional controls and measurements may
be necessary.

Heated water utilized for beverage and food preparation adds additional protection of
pasteurization if the water is heated to sufficient temperatures for sufficient times. Some
organisms, such as certain viruses, are more resistant and require more stringent conditions of
time and temperature for inactivation, so water should be managed to ensure their absence.

2. Disinfectant residual
The presence of a measurable disinfectant residual in the water at the point of use provides
valuable information that contributes to the assurance that the water is microbially safe for
the intended use. First, it demonstrates that the water has been disinfected; then it indicates
that some level of protection is being provided during transport and storage and that some
control of bacterial growth is being provided. The most common disinfectant used is usually
a form of chlorine; in that case, the residual could be free chlorine, hypochlorite or
chloramine.

Chlorine disinfection of low-turbidity water with appropriate contact time and pH will control
bacteria and viruses. However, some protozoa are resistant to chlorine disinfection, and their
control requires other disinfectants or efficient filtration. If present, protozoa should be
controlled by source water treatment (e.g. filtration or ultraviolet light for some organisms).
The presence of the residual will be affected by the original dose, the disinfectant demand of
the water, the type of disinfectant being utilized, the temperature, the time since application
of the disinfectant and whether contamination has occurred since application of the
disinfectant. A “free chlorine” residual is more biocidal than a “combined chlorine” residual,
but combined chlorine will last longer and will suppress HPC regrowth. Disappearance of a
free chlorine residual may also indicate post-treatment contamination. Other disinfectants,
such as chlorine dioxide, are sometimes used; each has its strengths and weaknesses.
Chlorine is a potent disinfectant, but its high chemical reactivity leads to a short life in the
system. Chloramines are less potent disinfectants but are more stable in water for longer
times. The disinfectant residual for chlorine should be no less than 0.2 mg/l and no more than
5 mg/l. As the concentration increases, the likelihood of taste detection increases.

3. Chemicals of acute significance
Because of the intermittent and short-term exposure to potential contaminants in drinking-
water on board aircraft, the main concern, aside from microbial contamination, is associated
with acutely toxic chemicals. A few inorganic chemical substances, such as nitrate and nitrite
(which can enter the source water from agricultural activity, sewage inflow or sewage cross-
contamination in plumbed systems) and copper (which may leach into drinking-water from


                                                                                             21
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

copper piping) may be of health concern to certain subpopulations. For instance,
methaemoglobinaemia may be caused by the temporary exposure of infants to nitrate and
nitrite, among other contributing factors; and gastric irritation may result from short-term
exposure to copper (see also No. 4 below). Potentially significant cumulative effects of
repeated short-term exposures to chemical hazards (for frequent flyers or crew members, for
example) should not be overlooked, as they may lead to long-term consequences. Water on
board aircraft should meet the GDWQ or national standards, whichever are more stringent,
for such chemicals.

4. Corrosion-related contaminants
Corrosion in plumbing systems is a function of the stability and aggressiveness of the water
towards the surfaces and fixtures that the water will contact during transport and storage.
Metals such as copper, lead and iron can be leached from some materials into the water and
contribute adverse taste or, in some cases, health concerns. Excess copper or iron can cause
metallic taste; copper can cause gastrointestinal upset; excess lead can cause cognitive
deficits from long-term high-level exposure in young children. The GDWQ guideline value
for copper is 2 mg/l; iron can be detectable by taste at about 0.3 mg/l and above; and the lead
guideline is 0.01 mg/l. In lieu of or in addition to monitoring for metals, appropriate
management could be achieved through a corrosion control programme. The materials used
in the construction of all of the surfaces (hoses, couplings, pipes, tanks, fixtures, soldered
joints) that the water may contact during production, transfer and storage should be approved
for water contact by an appropriate authority (regulatory or independent third party) and meet
appropriate standards. The water that is being provided should not be corrosive to those
surfaces and fixtures. Factors such as temperature, pH, ionic composition and alkalinity need
to be controlled within appropriate ranges for the particular water type (see WHO, 2004).

5. Turbidity
Turbidity (cloudiness) is caused by light being diffused by particulate matter that may be
present in the water. However, it may not be obvious just from visual observation. Turbidity
present in groundwater is usually of no sanitary significance if it is caused by inorganic
matter. It can also be caused by sloughing of biofilms. Excess turbidity in water from the
treatment plant can be an indicator of insufficient water filtration or inadequate control of
coagulant dosing and sedimentation, and it could indirectly indicate inadequate removal of
filterable microorganisms. Disinfectants function more effectively in low-turbidity water
because microorganisms are often aggregated on particles rather than freely suspended in the
water. Turbidity may increase slightly during transit through pipes due to particle agitation. A
turbidity increase in the aircraft water after transfer from the airport to the aircraft could
indicate that foreign matter has entered the system during the transfer. The GDWQ do not set
a health-related turbidity guideline but recommend 0.1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) as
a process performance parameter for effective disinfection (WHO, 2004). However, this
value is for water leaving the treatment plant rather than for water in distribution.

6. Aesthetic parameters (odour/colour/taste)
Aesthetic parameters such as undesirable taste, colour or odour that appear after water
treatment may be indicative of corrosion or cross-contamination, cross-connections,
contamination by foreign substances during transfer to aircraft or inadequate plumbing
conditions on board the aircraft. They signify the need to determine their cause and to take
corrective actions so that the water on the aircraft is both potable and palatable.




22

7. Temperature
Cool water is generally more palatable than warm water, and temperature will impact on the
acceptability of a number of other inorganic constituents that may affect taste. High water
temperature enhances the growth of microorganisms and may increase taste, odour, colour
and corrosion problems (WHO, 2004) (see also No. 4 above).

2.2.3 Guideline 2.3: Monitoring

 Guideline 2.3—Critical water quality parameters are monitored.

Indicators for Guideline 2.3
1. Monitoring at airport water taps is carried out at locations to ensure that persons served
   by the airport are provided safe water. Recommended parameters that should be
   monitored at the entrance to the transfer point are E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal)
   coliforms, disinfectant residual, chemicals of acute significance, corrosion-related
   contaminants, turbidity and aesthetic parameters.
2. Monitoring at the transfer point takes place to ensure that water boarded on aircraft is
   safe. Recommended parameters that should be monitored at the transfer point to the
   aircraft (includes bowsers, trucks, carts, hoses, refillables) are E. coli or thermotolerant
   (faecal) coliforms, disinfectant residual and, if required, turbidity.
3. Monitoring on aircraft is carried out at locations to ensure that persons on board the
   aircraft are provided safe water. It is recommended that E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal)
   coliforms be monitored at representative taps (e.g. galley, lavatory, drinking fountains).
   The monitoring should take place at each major servicing, in addition to regular E. coli
   spot checks while in service. Complaints about aesthetic parameters (odour/colour/taste)
   will trigger further investigations into the water quality and may indicate the need to
   monitor for turbidity. Additional parameters to be monitored include chemicals of acute
   significance and corrosion-related contaminants. Disinfectant residuals are also measured
   after the aircraft has been disinfected and flushed.
4. All critical parameters are monitored at a sufficient frequency to ensure safe water.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.3
In addition to the GDWQ or national standards applicable to a particular component of the
water supply chain:

1. Monitoring at the airport
The piped water supply delivered to airports should be suitable for distribution and
consumption without further treatment, except as necessary to maintain water quality in the
distribution system (e.g. supplemental disinfection, addition of corrosion control chemicals).
In the event of contamination of the water provided to the airport, the airport should complete
corrective action and notify the party responsible for transfer of water to the aircraft as soon
as possible so it can take mitigation measures or prevent the boarding of contaminated water
on the aircraft. Documentation (recordkeeping) of monitoring should be kept for assurance
and analysis in the event of an incident.

No E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms should be detected in any 100-ml sample of
the water. A positive test may be an indication of potential pathogenic (primarily bacterial)
microorganisms associated with human excreta.



                                                                                             23
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

The presence of a measurable disinfectant residual contributes to assurance that the water is
microbially safe for the intended use. The presence of the residual will be affected by the
original dose, the disinfectant demand of the water, the type of disinfectant being utilized, the
temperature, the time since application of the disinfectant and whether contamination has
occurred since application of the disinfectant. Disappearance of a disinfectant residual may
also indicate post-treatment contamination.

Provided that water entering the airport conforms to acceptable standards as described above,
the principal concern for chemicals of acute significance would be nitrate/nitrite
contamination at the airport from cross-connections with the liquid waste system and copper
leaching.

Corrosion in plumbing systems is a function of the stability and aggressiveness of the water
towards the surfaces and fixtures that the water will contact during transport and storage.
Metals such as copper, lead and iron can be leached from some materials into the water and
contribute adverse taste or, in some cases, health concerns.

Turbidity that increases in the airport could indicate that dirt has entered the system during
the transfer.

Detection of aesthetic parameters (odour/colour/taste) may indicate cross-connections with
the liquid waste system.

2. Monitoring at the transfer point
Potable water for aircraft, including bowsers, water trucks, water carts, filling stations and
potable water cabinets, needs to be obtained only from those water sources and water
supplies that provide potable water of a quality in line with the standards recommended in the
GDWQ (WHO, 2004), especially in relation to microbial, chemical and physical
requirements. In the event of contamination of water at the transfer point, the party
responsible for transfer of water should notify the airline as soon as possible so it can take
mitigation measures or prevent the boarding of contaminated water on the aircraft.
Documentation (recordkeeping) of monitoring should be kept for assurance and analysis in
the event of an incident.

No E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms should be detected in any 100-ml sample of
the water. A positive test may be an indication of potential pathogenic (primarily bacterial)
microorganisms associated with human excreta.

The presence of a measurable disinfectant residual contributes to the microbial safety of
water for the intended use. The presence of the residual will be affected by the original dose,
the disinfectant demand of the water, the type of disinfectant being utilized, the temperature,
the time since application of the disinfectant and whether subsequent contamination has
occurred since application of the disinfectant. Disappearance of a disinfectant residual may
also indicate post-treatment contamination.

Turbidity that increases in the aircraft water after transfer from the airport to the aircraft
could indicate that dirt has entered the system during the transfer.

3. Monitoring on the aircraft
Potable water should be obtained from those transfer points approved by the competent
authority. In the event of contamination of water on the aircraft, the airline should notify
persons on board as soon as possible and take mitigation measures or arrange for an
alternative water supply. Documentation (recordkeeping) of monitoring should be kept for
assurance and analysis in the event of an incident.

No E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms should be detected in any 100-ml sample of
the water. A positive test may be an indication of potential pathogenic (primarily bacterial)
microorganisms associated with human excreta.

Detection of aesthetic parameters (odour/colour/taste) may indicate cross-connections with
the liquid waste system. On some aircraft, carbon filters are used to neutralize the chlorine in
the drinking-water at the tap for taste purposes. On occasion, these are incorrectly described
as purifying filters. If they are not serviced regularly, HPC growth will occur, and cartridges
may disintegrate. Also, once the chlorine content has been removed, the water has no
protection against bacteria introduced downstream from the filter. If used, such filters should
therefore be fitted at each water outlet. Complaints about aesthetic parameters may indicate
the need to monitor for turbidity or HPC and/or take corrective action. Turbidity that
increases in the aircraft water after transfer from the airport to the aircraft could indicate that
dirt has entered the system during the transfer.

The principal concern for acutely toxic chemicals in water on board the aircraft would be
nitrate/nitrite contamination from cross-connections with the liquid waste system and copper
leaching from the distribution system. Other metals, such as lead and iron, can also be
leached from some materials into the water and contribute adverse taste or, in some cases,
health concerns.

Disinfectant residual should also be measured after the aircraft has been disinfected and
flushed as per the aircraft manufacturer’s specifications with a test kit that is specific to the
disinfectant and used as per the manufacturer’s specifications. The disinfectant residual for
chlorine (the most common disinfectant) should be no less than 0.2 mg/l and no more than 5
mg/l. Testing of the disinfectant residual should be done at the cold water faucet of galley(s),
fountains and some lavatories and prior to the filters being reinserted, where applicable.
Results should be recorded. Should the disinfectant residual be above 5 mg/l, the flushing
process should be repeated and disinfectant residual remeasured and recorded. It should be
noted that monitoring of water in lavatories may detect contamination from the surroundings
rather than from the water per se.

4. Frequency of monitoring
Regular monitoring of each parameter is necessary to ensure that safe water quality is
maintained, as each step in the water transfer chain provides an opportunity for
contamination. Documentation (recordkeeping) of monitoring should be kept for assurance
and analysis in the event of an incident.

In certain situations, the frequency of monitoring should be increased for a period necessary
to determine appropriate corrective action and/or assurance that measured parameters have
returned to safe levels. Examples of situations warranting increased monitoring are positive
E. coli or thermotolerant (faecal) coliform results, excessively humid conditions, during or



                                                                                                25
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

after natural disasters affecting source water quality and immediately after maintenance
activities that have the potential to affect water quality.

Aesthetic parameters such as odour, colour or taste are typically “measured” through
customer complaints, although the crew may also wish to do an independent periodic check.
This is a subjective parameter, as individuals have different sensitivities.

Some countries may request additional monitoring for parameters over and above those
suggested by the GDWQ within their jurisdiction for operational or regulatory reasons.
Airports, water haulers and aircraft operators should verify with their local competent
authority if additional monitoring is required and what parameters the competent authority
within their jurisdiction is requesting. These should be included in the WSP.

2.2.4 Guideline 2.4: Corrective action

 Guideline 2.4—Appropriate response is ensured when the water safety plan is not
 properly implemented or a public health risk is detected.

Indicators for Guideline 2.4
1. Investigative action and response procedures are established and documented.
2. Investigative action and response procedures are implemented in a timely manner.
3. Follow-up is performed to ensure that corrective action was effective and water quality is
   no longer of concern.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.4

1. Establishment and documentation of procedures
Investigative action and response could be as basic as reviewing records or could include
more comprehensive corrective action. Corrective action should involve remedying any
mechanical, operational or procedural defect in the water supply system that has led to
guideline values being exceeded or when other improper practices are suspected. In the case
of mechanical defects, remedies should include maintenance, upgrading or refurbishment of
facilities. In the case of operational defects, actions should include changes to supplies and
equipment. In the case of procedural defects, such as improper practices, standard operating
procedures and training programmes should be evaluated and changed, and personnel should
be retrained. Any such changes should be incorporated accordingly into the WSP.

When there is evidence of contamination, appropriate action should be taken immediately to
eliminate the public health threat of such contamination. Appropriate action may include
additional treatment or flushing and disinfection of transfer equipment or aircraft water tanks.

In addition, emergency/contingency actions may need to be taken, such as the provision of
water from alternative sources. During periods when corrective action is being taken,
increased monitoring may be advisable.

2. Implementation of procedures
Investigative action and response could be as basic as reviewing records or could include
more comprehensive corrective action. Oversight should be provided to ensure that corrective
actions are implemented in accordance with written procedures and quickly enough to


26
                                                   Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

minimize exposure of the travelling public, employees, visitors, etc. Such oversight could be
performed by the responsible party for that segment of the supply chain or by an independent
party, such as a regulatory authority.

3. Verification of procedures
Verification steps should be adequate to provide assurance that water quality has been
restored to safe levels. At a minimum, monitoring as described in Guideline 2.3 should be
performed.

2.2.5 Guideline 2.5: Water quantity

 Guideline 2.5—Potable water is available in sufficient quantities, pressures and
 temperatures for all uses at the airport, at the water transfer points and on the
 aircraft.

Indicators for Guideline 2.5
1. Potable water quantities at the airport are sufficient to ensure adequate pressure at all taps
   to minimize the potential for contamination.
2. Potable water quantities at transfer points are sufficient to ensure adequate pressure to
   minimize the potential for contamination and to replenish water supplies on board
   aircraft.
3. Potable water quantities on board aircraft are sufficient to meet foreseeable needs for
   consumption, cooking and cleaning (e.g. food preparation, sanitation and hygiene
   activities) and to achieve sufficient water pressure at each tap to minimize the potential
   for contamination.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.5
The amount of water required for all purposes on board an aircraft should be adequately dealt
with in typical passenger aircraft designs. Quantities of water at all points in the water supply
and transfer chain also need to be sufficient to ensure adequate water pressure in order to
minimize the potential for contamination.

1. Water quantity at the airport
To achieve minimum pressures, a variety of water pumps or air pressure is used, while
pressure-reducing valves are used when the system pressure is too great for the application.

2. Water quantity at transfer points
To achieve minimum pressures, a variety of water pumps or air pressure is used, while
pressure-reducing valves are used when the system pressure is too great for the application.

3. Water quantity on the aircraft
Water supplies on aircraft must be sufficient to operate sanitary systems on the aircraft (e.g.
vacuum toilet bowl rinsing rings). Additionally, food service fixtures, coffee makers,
drinking taps and hand-washing sinks in the lavatories must have sufficient supply under
adequate pressure to operate as designed. Water supply tanks on aircraft must be correctly
sized and pressurized for these systems to work and serve passengers and crew, and they
must be filled with sufficient frequency that meets expected use.




                                                                                              27
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

Water at sufficient pressure is required to operate fixtures and equipment on the aircraft.
Most fixtures are rated to operate at certain minimum/maximum pressures. To achieve
minimum pressures, a variety of water pumps or air pressure is used, while pressure-reducing
valves are used when the system pressure is too great for the application.

2.2.6 Guideline 2.6: Independent surveillance

 Guideline 2.6—Independent surveillance of drinking-water safety is performed by a
 competent authority.

Indicators for Guideline 2.6
1. Audit/inspection procedures are put in place by a competent authority.
2. Documentation of a water safety plan and its implementation are reviewed, and feedback
   is provided.
3. An independent competent authority responds following reports of incidents with the
   potential to adversely affect public health.

Guidance notes for Guideline 2.6
Aviation water quality surveillance is an ongoing investigative activity undertaken to identify
and evaluate potential health risks associated with the use and consumption of potable water
in airports and on board aircraft. Surveillance contributes to the protection of public health by
promoting the improvement of the quality, quantity, accessibility and continuity of potable
water supplies. This guideline addresses surveillance of these factors only and does not
address surveillance relating to monitoring of or response to outbreaks or other disease events
(i.e. public health surveillance).

The levels of surveillance of drinking-water quality differ widely, just as economic
development and provision of community water supplies vary. Surveillance should be
developed and expanded progressively, by adapting the level to the local situation and
economic resources, with gradual implementation, consolidation and development of the
programme to the level ultimately desired. When accepting a WSP, the competent authority
in a given jurisdiction may take responsibility for surveillance of the programme, which may
include performing random water sampling and the auditing of the WSP programme.

Although this guideline addresses surveillance by oversight authorities, many of the concepts
discussed here could be employed by the water supplier to ensure that the WSP is being
implemented effectively.

1. Establishment of procedures
In most cases, surveillance consists primarily of sanitary inspections based on the WSP of
airports, transfer points or airlines. Sanitary inspection is a tool for determining the state of
the water supply infrastructure and the identification of actual or potential faults and should
be carried out on a regular basis.

A surveillance agent should have the authority to conduct independent inspections and verify
the reliability of the supplier’s information. This does not normally need to be as frequent as
the continuous control performed by airports/airlines.




28
                                                   Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

Surveillance should be accomplished by authorized and trained officers from public health
authorities, or the services of qualified independent auditors and inspectors may be utilized.

Specifications for qualifications of the inspectors should be established, and inspectors should
undergo adequate training, including periodic updates and recertification. Independent
auditors and inspectors should meet the same requirements as those from the public health
authorities.

Annex D provides an example of a format that can be used by on-site inspectors in evaluating
the sanitation status of the airline service area or transfer point. It can be adapted to specific
circumstances and situations that may exist in various countries and airports.

2. Review of documentation and plan implementation
WSPs should be provided by the airport authority, water haulers (transfer points) and airlines,
and all documentation pertaining to the WSPs should be reviewed. The independent review
of the WSPs should include a systematic approach, based upon the components of the WSPs,
by external auditing of the documentation, implementation and monitoring of critical control
points.

Some of the components of the independent review include inspection of employee personal
hygiene through demonstration of employees following procedures, inspections and the
recording of these inspections of equipment and environmental conditions to ensure that
dedicated equipment is used and stored in sanitary conditions, and water sampling through
on-site or laboratory tests. Periodic microbiological surveillance of the entire water supply
system from the source to the aircraft’s galley and lavatory taps or fountains should be a key
priority because of the acute risk to health posed by pathogens in contaminated drinking-
water. Verification of compliance with water standards should start at the source and extend
throughout the water distribution system. Each water point source, transfer point/critical point
in the distribution system and end-point should be monitored. If this is not possible, at a
minimum end-points should be monitored, but it should be possible to trace back when an
unsatisfactory result is found.

Inspection of procedures or control systems should be adequate to provide assurance that
responsible parties in the water supply chain are able to implement timely corrective
measures. Supporting programmes should be reviewed to ensure that management procedures
and training are adequate to ensure a safe supply of water.

Risk communication procedures by and to the water supplier, airport authority, water haulers
(transfer points), airlines and the public should also be reviewed. A notification system
should be established that integrates all parties within the water supply and transfer chain.

3. Response to incidents
Response to incidents may include written reports from the responsible party or parties or
independent inspectors or written or verbal reports from affected individuals or their
representatives.

The competent authority should investigate reports of incidents by interviewing reporters,
responsible parties and other affected individuals and independently verifying water quality
and relevant process parameters (maintenance checklists, training records, etc.) through on-
site inspections and other means.


                                                                                               29
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation



The competent authority should coordinate with and advise the responsible parties on
appropriate corrective actions (modifications to water safety, management, training and
maintenance plans, notification of potentially affected individuals, etc.) and ensure that
remedial action plans are effective and implemented and that completion is verified.

3.     CLEANING AND DISINFECTION OF FACILITIES

3.1    Background

This chapter covers cleaning and disinfection procedures for both airports and aircraft.

Cleaning refers primarily to the removal of visible dirt or particles; however, the cleaning
process and some products used for cleaning also result in disinfection. Cleaning is normally
undertaken on a routine and frequent basis. In this chapter, the primary process of removal of
visible dirt and particles is referred to as “cleaning”, even if some disinfection occurs at the
same time.

Disinfection refers to specific measures taken to control, deactivate or kill infectious agents,
such as viruses and bacteria. Disinfection is normally undertaken on an infrequent basis,
during periodic maintenance checks or after a public health event, such as the suspected
carriage of an infectious passenger. Disinfection is usually preceded by cleaning of the
affected area, and this is assumed to occur when “disinfection” is referred to in this chapter.

In 2006, over 2 billion passengers were carried by airlines operating scheduled flights (ICAO,
2006). This fact indicates that commercial air transport is potentially an efficient means for
spreading communicable disease widely by surface contact and proximity to infected persons.

Possible routes of infection transmission that might occur on board aircraft fall into three
categories:
1. directly inhaled respiratory droplets, suspended airborne particles, or both;
2. direct contact with faecal matter, blood or other body fluids;
3. contact with respiratory secretions, faecal matter or body fluids deposited on surfaces or,
    for maintenance crews, entrained in ventilation systems.

The main source of infection for other travellers is from an infected person, and proximity to
an infected person is an important risk factor for airborne infection. Once an infected person
has left the scene, most of the risk from droplet exposure will have been removed. The
residence time of suspended airborne particles may be longer and will depend on the
particles’ mass and on the ventilation rate/air circulation patterns in the cabin
(ANSI/ASHRAE, 2008).

Airborne exposure aside, there is a concern that the agent of disease (pathogen) can remain in
the airport or aircraft environment by contaminating common surfaces (e.g. fomites) after the
infected traveller has departed. However, the guidance in this chapter is directed primarily at
the second and third possible routes of transmission. The cause of illness for an individual
traveller may not be known immediately and possibly not for some time afterwards; in many
cases, the diagnosis may never be known. This guidance therefore adopts a “universal
precaution” approach that treats all respiratory secretions, faeces, blood and other body fluids
as potentially infectious.

Sometimes, a case of communicable disease is known only several days (or longer) after the
infected person has travelled and may have deposited pathogens on surfaces in the airport or
on the aircraft. The risk of infection upon contact with such contaminated surfaces will
depend on the viability of the organism, the number of organisms, whether the surface has
been properly cleaned and/or disinfected, whether the pathogen is touched and transferred


                                                                                             31
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

and also the susceptibility of the traveller. Frequent hand washing reduces the risk. As time
passes and as a result of routine cleaning activities, the risk that any transmissible pathogens
remain in place reduces, even without specific disinfection procedures.

There may be epidemiological information available to guide the public health response, such
as an outbreak occurring at the origin of the flight (e.g. the 2003 episode of SARS). In such
instances, public health experts recommend specific measures targeted at a particular
pathogen.

To reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens from an infected person to others via surfaces or
inanimate objects on the aircraft or in the airport, it is necessary for aircraft and airport
operators and ground handling agents to have a coordinated plan in place to deal with the
arrival of an affected1 aircraft having carried such a traveller or the presence of a person with
a communicable disease in the airport. For aircraft, the plan needs to take into account the
unusual features of the aircraft cabin in comparison with a ground-based facility. For airports,
the plan should address the challenge of managing potential contamination in a large public
space, such as the terminal building. Such plans should also address potential contamination
of an aircraft or airport with an infectious agent that is not transmitted person to person.
Considering that it may be difficult to identify an aircraft carrying an infected person, the
focus should be on (a) the assumption that all aircraft are periodically occupied by infected
travellers and therefore require routine and frequent cleaning and disinfection and (b) the fact
that certain events (e.g. persistent coughing on board) may increase the risk of disease
transmission and that such incidents should be investigated so that, if a case of communicable
disease is suspected, it leads to specific disinfection measures.

Disinfectants tend to be oxidizers, and the interior of an aircraft contains many materials
susceptible to damage from cleaning products and disinfectants. Metals used in the
construction of the aircraft may corrode upon exposure to such products, safety-critical cables
and wires may deteriorate on exposure and aircraft furnishings may have their fire resistance
properties reduced. It is therefore necessary to exercise caution in selecting suitable products
and before applying these products in aircraft. It is important to protect the health of the
cleaning personnel and to ensure effective action; therefore, manufacturer’s instructions must
be followed carefully.

It is essential to provide a hygienic environment for travellers. Areas where food is prepared,
stored and served, any surfaces commonly touched by people and washroom facilities, among
others, should be kept free from contaminants that might compromise human health, even
when there is no identified outbreak of disease. Prevention or mitigation of disease
transmission is the goal. Hygienic conditions also minimize the likelihood of infestation by
rodents, as vectors of disease.

3.1.1 International Health Regulations (2005)
According to the IHR (2005), States (competent authorities) must ensure, to the extent
practicable, that traveller facilities at their international airports and on aircraft are kept free
of sources of infection and contamination. In addition, capacity to adopt control measures,
such as cleaning and disinfection, should be in place, with oversight by the competent
authority, to prevent the spread of disease and its agents at airports and on aircraft.
1
  An affected aircraft refers to one that carries sources of infection or contamination, so as to constitute a public
health risk (see IHR (2005) Definitions). Aircraft affected due to criminal activity are outside the scope of the
Guide.


32
                                                           Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation



If indications of a public health risk, including sources of infection and contamination, are
found on board an international aircraft, the aircraft may be required to undergo health
measures, such as disinfection, disinsection or decontamination, as appropriate, that are
necessary to control risk and to prevent spread of disease (Article 27).

Health measures “shall be carried out so as to avoid injury and as far as possible discomfort
to persons, or damage to the environment in a way which impacts on public health, or
damage to baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods or postal parcels” (Article 22) and
“initiated and completed without delay, and applied in a transparent and non-discriminatory
manner” (Article 42).

3.1.2 Critical aspects and rationale of cleaning and disinfection programmes
The critical aspects of cleaning and disinfection programmes include the availability of
cleaning schedules and procedures for timely and effective airport and aircraft routine
cleaning by designated personnel; procedures for disinfecting after an event; effective
cleaning and disinfecting agents that are not detrimental to aircraft materials; appropriate
personal protective equipment; and adequate training for designated personnel.

There are several reasons why cleaning and disinfection programmes are critical to ensuring a
sanitary environment in airports and on aircraft, which, in turn, ensures that air travellers are
exposed to minimum risk. Schedules and procedures for routine, effective airport and aircraft
cleaning (and disinfection measures in higher-risk areas, when necessary) are vital in
maintaining a hygienic environment. The availability of procedures for disinfecting after an
event1 is also critical, as body fluids, such as respiratory secretions, blood, vomit and faeces,
may contain infectious agents that could be transmitted, if not properly contained.

Cleaning and disinfection on aircraft require special attention, as it is necessary to use agents
that are not corrosive or otherwise detrimental to aircraft components. For this reason, not all
effective cleaning and disinfecting agents can be used in the aircraft cabin.

Cleaning crews2 need to be adequately trained so they understand and respect the procedures
that will ensure effectiveness of the cleaning and disinfecting agents, use the proper personal
protective equipment, prevent contamination of other areas and minimize occupational health
and safety risks to personnel.

Unlike the routine procedure, post-event disinfection is not a frequent practice, and the
requirements are likely to differ. It is therefore particularly important that the training
emphasizes these “event-driven” procedures for the cleaning crew, because they will not be
as familiar as routine cleaning procedures.

As noted above, competent authorities have responsibilities to ensure that international
airports and aircraft are kept free of sources of infection and contamination (Article
22.1(a,b,c,d,e,g)). The competent authority needs to exercise oversight over cleaning and
disinfection programmes so that its obligations under the IHR (2005) are fulfilled. Under the
IHR (2005), the competent authorities are responsible for supervising service providers

1
  An “event” means a “manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease” (IHR
(2005), Article 1). This may include, for example, the presence in an airport, or carriage by air, of a suspected
case of communicable disease.
2
  “Cleaning crew” refers to designated personnel that may undertake cleaning and/or disinfection.


                                                                                                             33
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

relating to travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances and goods at points of entry,
including with inspections and medical examinations, as necessary. They are also responsible
for supervision of disinfection, disinsection and decontamination of conveyances, as well as
baggage, cargo, containers and goods under the IHR (2005). Finally, they are responsible for
the supervision of the removal and safe disposal of any contaminated water or food, human or
animal dejecta, wastewater and any other contaminated matter from a conveyance (Article
22.1(c,e–f)). In the context of conveyances (as well as baggage, cargo and goods) arriving
from affected areas, the competent authorities are responsible for monitoring them so that
they are free of sources of infection or contamination (Article 22.1(a)).

3.2      Guidelines

This section provides user-targeted information and guidance, identifying responsibilities and
providing examples of practices that can control risks. Six specific Guidelines (situations to
aim for and maintain) are presented, each of which is accompanied by a set of Indicators
(measures for whether the guidelines are met) and Guidance notes (advice on applying the
guidelines and indicators in practice, highlighting the most important aspects that need to be
considered when setting priorities for action).

3.2.1 Airports: Routine cleaning and disinfection

3.2.1.1 Guideline 3.1: Sanitary condition of airports


 Guideline 3.1—Airports are kept in a sanitary condition at all times.

Indicators for Guideline 3.1
1. A documented, tested and updated routine cleaning programme exists, ensuring that
   premises are regularly and hygienically cleaned.
2. An appropriate number of trained personnel are available, in relation to the volume and
   complexity of the airport facilities and cleaning procedures.
3. Personal protective techniques and equipment are used by personnel: related equipment
   and information (operational procedures for its use) are available.
4. Cleaning equipment and supplies are available in relation to the volume and complexity
   of the airport facilities and cleaning procedures.
5. Cleaning equipment is properly identified and satisfactorily maintained and stored in a
   designated storage area.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.1
Several aspects of routine cleaning should be taken into account:

•     Programmes for routine cleaning should take into account the volume of passengers (e.g.
      peak periods, heavily used areas) and the complexity of activities at the airports (e.g. hair
      salons and spas, food establishments and washroom facilities) and personnel using the
      terminal and other facilities.
•     Airport operators should be prepared to adjust their routine cleaning programmes if a
      public health risk is detected and/or if advised to do so by public health authorities.
•     The routine cleaning programme should be conducted by, or be under the oversight of,
      the competent authority.



34
                                                   Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation


•   During high-volume periods within the airport, increased frequency of cleaning should be
    considered to remove excessive accumulation of waste and debris resulting from the
    increased use of the airport facilities, especially washrooms.
•   Precautionary cleaning, including the use of disinfectant products, of certain targeted
    areas of the airport may be advised if diseases of concern (e.g. norovirus or cholera) are
    prevalent in the airport community or at the departure points of a significant number of
    travellers.
•   A routine cleaning programme should consider aspects that are specific to particular areas
    of an airport. Guidance can be found in Annex E.
•   A routine cleaning programme should be periodically reviewed and updated, as needed.

3.2.1.2 Guideline 3.2: Design and construction of airports


 Guideline 3.2—Airports are designed and constructed in a manner that facilitates
 proper cleaning and disinfection.

Indicator for Guideline 3.2
1. Facilities are designed and constructed of suitable materials (e.g. impervious, smooth and
   without seams) to facilitate cleaning and to reduce the risk of harbouring insects, rodents
   and other vectors.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.2
Several aspects of airport design and construction should be taken into account:

•   Proper design will minimize the amount of accumulated debris and waste and reduce
    opportunities for survival of vectors and reservoirs of disease, such as rodents and insects.
•   Washrooms designed without doors and with automatic faucets (taps) using “electronic
    eyes” (which automatically control the flow of the water to the faucet) are preferable, as
    they will reduce contact with hands/fingers.
•   Providing paper wipes for hand drying will reduce the risk of cross-contamination,
    especially when dispensed using “electronic eyes” (hand dryers can promote spread of
    pathogens).

3.2.2 Airports: Disinfection after an event

3.2.2.1 Guideline 3.3: Post-event disinfection procedures for airports


 Guideline 3.3—Post-event disinfection procedures are in place to prevent the spread of
 disease and contain contamination at the source.

Indicators for Guideline 3.3
1. Standard operating procedures are documented and in place for timely disinfection after
   an event, according to technical requirements, and are subject to periodic revision based
   on emerging evidence of efficacy.
2. An appropriate number of trained personnel are available, in relation to the volume and
   complexity of the airport facilities and need for post-event cleaning/disinfection
   procedures.



                                                                                              35
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

3. Personal protective equipment and techniques are used by personnel, and related
   equipment and information (operational procedures for its use) are available.
4. Adequate equipment and supplies are available in relation to the volume and complexity
   of the airport facilities and disinfection procedures that may be needed after an event.
5. Disinfecting equipment is identified, properly maintained and stored in a designated
   storage area for post-event use.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.3

1. Standard operating procedures
The disinfection procedure for flat surfaces (e.g. floors, tables, sinks) should be as follows:
• If required, control pedestrian traffic through the area by directing people away from the
   site, posting a sign or putting up barrier tape.
• Put on protective gloves.
• Wear eye protection if a danger from splashing exists.
• Prepare the sanitizing solution of bleach according to product specifications.
• Open a biohazard bag, and put it near the spill site. If a biohazard bag is not available,
   label the regular waste bag as “biohazard”.
• Using paper towels or an absorbent material, clean up the soiled material and excess
   liquid and place into the biohazard bag.
• Change gloves if they become visibly soiled.
• Clean the area (remove solids and soak up liquid waste). Pour detergent solution around
   the spill site, and use paper towels to move the liquid into the dirty area. Once the area is
   wet, use the paper towels to clean the area and discard into the biohazard bag.
• Cover the site with clean paper towels, and pour the bleach solution onto the paper
   towels. Wait an appropriate time, as indicated in the product instructions.
• Remove the paper towels to the biohazard bag.
• Rinse with water, and dry the surface. Put all paper towels into the biohazard bag.
• Remove gloves, and place them into the biohazard bag.
• Seal used biohazard bag, and ensure proper transport and final disposal.
• Wash hands.

3. Personal protective equipment
Those responsible for cleaning up vomit, human excreta and other potentially infectious
materials should protect themselves with appropriate personal protective equipment, such as
gloves and protective clothing, according to standard operating procedures.

4. Equipment and supplies
The following materials should be preassembled in a spill cleanup kit:
• garbage bags and masking tape;
• disposable gloves;
• eye protection;
• mop;
• paper towel and/or absorbent material;
• detergent solution;
• water;
• sanitizing agent, such as bleach tablets (Presept, 0.5 g sodium dichloroisocyanurate
   tablets) or 5% domestic liquid bleach;
• signs, barrier tape (optional).

3.2.3 Aircraft: Routine cleaning and disinfection

3.2.3.1 Guideline 3.4: Sanitary condition of aircraft


 Guideline 3.4—Aircraft are kept in a sanitary condition at all times.

Indicators for Guideline 3.4
1. A documented, tested and updated routine cleaning programme is available, ensuring that
   aircraft are regularly and hygienically cleaned.
2. An appropriate number of trained personnel are available, taking into account cleaning
   procedures, the type of aircraft (e.g. passenger or cargo), the aircraft size and the ground
   time (stopover time) of the aircraft.
3. Personal protective techniques and equipment are used by personnel, and related
   equipment and information (operational procedures for its use) are available.
4. Cleaning equipment and supplies are available, taking into account the type (e.g.
   passenger or cargo), size and ground time (stopover time) of aircraft and cleaning
   procedures.
5. For aircraft safety and to protect aircraft equipment, the operator’s engineering
   department is consulted on cleaning procedures and agents used.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.4

1. Routine cleaning programme
The following factors should be considered when designing a programme for routine
cleaning:
• Programmes for routine cleaning should take into account the type (e.g. passenger or
    cargo), size and ground time (stopover time) of aircraft.
• An example of an aircraft routine cleaning schedule can be found in Annex F; the
    physical areas for which cleaning is specified in Annex F should be so included in the
    aircraft operator’s cleaning programme.
• Aircraft operators should be prepared to adjust their routine cleaning programmes if a
    public health risk is detected and/or if advised to do so by public health authorities.
• Information concerning aircraft cleaning and disinfection should be available to those
    concerned, upon request.
• Precautionary cleaning of certain targeted areas of the aircraft, including the use of
    disinfectant products, may be advised by the public health authority if certain diseases of
    concern (e.g. norovirus or cholera) are prevalent at the departure points.

5. Cleaning procedures and agents
The operator’s engineering department provides a technical review of each cleaning and
disinfecting product used, based on manufacturer’s recommendations (approved products are
normally listed in the aircraft maintenance manual). The use of methods and materials
recommended by the operator’s engineering department should be mandatory, and public
health authorities should consider the aviation aspects when developing specific national
standards and technical guidance, to avoid safety-related issues.




                                                                                            37

3.2.3.2 Guideline 3.5: Design and construction of aircraft


 Guideline 3.5—Aircraft are designed and constructed in a manner that facilitates
 proper cleaning and disinfection.

Indicator for Guideline 3.5
1. Aircraft interiors are designed and constructed of suitable materials (e.g. impervious,
   smooth and without seams) to facilitate cleaning and to reduce the risk of harbouring
   insects, rodents and other vectors.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.5

1. Design and construction of aircraft interiors
Several aspects of aircraft design and construction should be taken into account:
• Proper design will minimize the amount of accumulation of debris and waste and reduce
    opportunities for survival of vectors and reservoirs of disease, such as rodents and insects.
• Lavatories designed with automatic faucets (taps) using “electronic eyes” (that
    automatically control the flow of the water to the faucet) will reduce contact with
    hands/fingers.
• Provide disposable paper wipes for hand drying to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.

3.2.4 Aircraft: Disinfection after an event

3.2.4.1 Guideline 3.6: Post-event disinfection procedures for aircraft


 Guideline 3.6—Aircraft disinfection procedures are in place to prevent the spread of
 disease and contain infection and contamination at the source.

Indicators for Guideline 3.6
1. Standard operational procedures are documented and in place for timely application of
   disinfection procedures, according to technical requirements, and are subject to periodic
   revision based on emerging evidence of efficacy.
2. An appropriate number of trained personnel are available, taking into account the type
   (e.g. passenger or cargo), size and ground time (stopover time) of aircraft and disinfection
   procedures.
3. Personal protective equipment and techniques are used by personnel, and related
   equipment is available.
4. Disinfection equipment and supplies are available, taking into account the type (e.g.
   passenger or cargo), size and ground time (stopover time) of aircraft and disinfection
   procedures.

Guidance notes for Guideline 3.6
In general, routine cleaning of contaminated surfaces with soap or detergent and water (after
use of a spill cleanup kit, if necessary) to remove soil and organic matter, followed by the
proper use of disinfectants to inactivate any remaining organisms, constitutes effective
environmental management of suspected agents. Reducing the number of infectious agents on
a surface by these steps minimizes the chances of transferring them via contaminated hands.
The agents that cause the communicable diseases of public health concern are susceptible to


38
                                                  Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

inactivation by a number of chemical disinfectants readily available from consumer and
commercial markets. However, care must be taken when using disinfectants on board aircraft
because of the potentially harmful effects of such agents on aircraft components. The
recommended attributes for post-event aircraft disinfectants are listed in Annex G.

Only disinfectants (including detergent/disinfectants) that are nationally approved for use on
aircraft against any of the agents of concern and that have been approved by the original
equipment (aircraft) manufacturer should be used.

Body fluids/substances (e.g. vomit from the ill traveller) should first be taken up from overtly
contaminated surfaces by using an absorbent material, which should then be disposed of.
Large areas contaminated with body fluids/substances (e.g. covering most of a tray table)
should be treated with disinfectant after removal with absorbent material, then cleaned and
given a final disinfection. Since disinfectants are not registered for use on porous surfaces,
seat covers and carpeting with a significant contaminated area should be removed carefully,
placed in a labelled, sealed plastic bag and laundered in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions, or they should be destroyed. In case of seat contamination that has penetrated the
seat cover, the underlying seat upholstery may need to be removed for adequate disinfection.

1. Standard disinfection procedures
A disinfection procedure should include the following steps:
• Put on protective gloves.
• Wear eye protection if a danger from splashing exists.
• Open a biohazard bag, and place it near the site of contamination. If a biohazard bag is
    not available, label a regular waste bag as “biohazard”.
• The following surfaces should be cleaned and then disinfected at the seat of the suspected
    case(s), adjacent seat(s) in the same row, adjacent row(s) and other areas, as noted below:
         Seat area
        - armrests
        - seatbacks (the plastic and/or metal part)
        - tray tables
        - seatbelt latches
        - light and air controls, cabin crew call button and overhead compartment handles
        - adjacent walls and windows
        - individual video monitor
     Lavatories
        - lavatory or lavatories used by the sick traveller: door handle, locking device, toilet
            seat, faucet (tap), washbasin, adjacent walls and counter.
• Clean the area of soil (remove solids and soak up liquid waste). Apply the disinfectant
    (see below) according to procedures approved by the original equipment manufacturer
    and as instructed on the disinfectant manufacturer’s label. Once the area is wet, use paper
    towels to clean the area, and discard paper towels into the biohazard bag.
• Use a suitable disinfectant. Studies of hydrogen peroxide–based disinfectants containing
    additives such as surfactants and chelators have shown good results in scientific studies,
    and some industries already using these products are reporting excellent results. Ethanol
    has also been found to be an effective and suitable disinfectant for aircraft. However,
    other materials could be considered if they are approved or registered for surface
    disinfection and sanitization on aircraft by an appropriate government or independent
    organization.



                                                                                             39
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation


•    Ensure adequate contact time between the disinfectant and the surface for destruction of
     microorganisms. Adhere to any safety precautions as directed (e.g. ensure adequate
     ventilation in confined areas such as lavatories, and avoid splashing or generating
     unintended aerosols).
•    Change gloves that become visibly soiled.
•    Remove any affected portion of carpet.
•    Rinse the surface with water, and dry. Put all paper towels into the biohazard bag.
•    Remove gloves, and place them into the biohazard bag.
•    Seal the used biohazard bag, and ensure its proper transport and final disposal.
•    When cleaning and disinfecting are complete and gloves have been removed,
     immediately clean hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. Avoid
     touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands.
•    Do not use compressed air and/or water under pressure for cleaning, or any other methods
     that can cause splashing or might reaerosolize infectious material. Vacuum cleaners
     should be used only after proper disinfection has taken place.
•    Operation of the aircraft’s environmental control system at least until the suspect traveller
     has disembarked or until the disembarkation process is complete may also contribute to
     interrupting transmission of infectious material and should be performed if consistent
     with safety factors. Otherwise, ventilation should be provided from a ground source.

3. Personal protective equipment
Those responsible for cleaning up vomit, human excreta and other potentially infectious
materials should protect themselves with appropriate personal protective equipment, such as
gloves and protective clothing, according to standard operating procedure requirements.

4. Disinfection equipment and supplies
The following materials should be preassembled in a spill cleanup kit:
• biohazard bags; if a biohazard bag is not available, label the regular waste bag as
    “biohazard”;
• disposable gloves (non-latex materials to avoid risk of allergic reaction can be
    considered);
• eye protection;
• paper towels;
• detergent solution;
• water;
• disinfectant;
• signs as necessary to isolate the area.

Note: For the duration of the flight, used airsickness bags should be stored in the waste bin of
one lavatory. They should not be flushed down the toilet, and a notice to this effect should be
placed in the lavatory. They should be removed from the aircraft by the toilet servicing team
and disposed of along with the aircraft toilet wastes. If a specific receptacle is used on the
aircraft for storage of used airsickness containers, it should be thoroughly cleaned, washed
and disinfected after each use and treated in the same manner as portable toilet containers.

ANNEX F: Routine aircraft cleaning schedule
The information provided in this annex is an example of a cleaning schedule for aircraft,
written to assist those responsible for routine cleaning immediately after a flight or during a
night stop. Although routine cleaning usually includes the use of disinfectants, as components
of general-purpose aircraft cleaners, their routine application differs from that of an aircraft
that needs disinfection after transporting a suspected case of communicable disease, for
which separate guidance is provided in the text of chapter 3.

Cleaning and disinfection schedule

The aircraft operator’s engineering department shall grant technical approval for each type of
cleaning product used. Approved cleaning products are usually listed in the aircraft
maintenance manual. Alternative cleaning products must be approved by the operator’s
engineering department prior to use.

1. General

1.1 Aircraft contamination

Should aircraft contamination be noticed (insects, liquids, etc.), inform the airline station
manager. If an infective source is suspected, the source of infection (e.g. passenger) should
be contained in order to minimize the risk of infection to others.

1.2 Handling of flight irregularities

The specifics of each flight irregularity situation will determine the course of action to be
taken. However:

    Never compromise on safety.
    Coordinate actions taken with the airline station manager.

2. Interior cleaning

2.1 Classification of interior cleaning types

There are different types of interior cleaning, depending on time available; the following
schedule is only an example, which may have to be adjusted to more specific operations. For
operations having short flights, minimum service and short turnaround time, the requirement
for cleaning between sectors is limited to very few of the procedures mentioned in the chart
below.

2.2 Cabin cleaning

Cabin cleaning shall start immediately after passenger disembarkation is completed.

If transit passengers remain on board, cabin cleaning shall be performed so as to minimize
passenger disturbance.

                                                       Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation

Cleaning of cabin windows inside shall be done only with an approved cleaning product and
a non-abrasive cloth. Once the window is cleaned, rinse with water using a cloth and dry the
surface.

Cloth-covered seats shall be vacuumed. Sticky objects shall be removed with a spatula prior
to vacuuming. Stains shall be removed only with an approved stain removal product.

Leather-covered seats shall be cleaned using only an approved dusting product. Stains shall
be removed only with an approved stain removal product.

Passenger seat control unit panels shall be cleaned using only approved cleaning materials
and non-abrasive paper towels.

In-seat monitors shall be cleaned using only approved cleaning materials and a microfibre
cloth.

Carpet stains shall be removed only with an approved stain removal product.

2.3 Interior cleaning chart

The following chart shows applicable cleaning and disinfection activities required for each
type of interior cleaning.

“On request” cleaning activities shall be performed if requested by the operator flight crew,
cabin crew or airline station manager.

Ashtrays require emptying and cleaning only if not permanently blocked.

If time does not permit completion of all of the above tasks, priority should be given to the
removal of waste and cleaning where indicated, especially of galleys and toilets. To expedite
cleaning procedures and to reduce the amount of equipment required, disposable swabs
impregnated with effective and appropriate cleaning agents can be purchased or prepared in
advance, stored in polyethylene bags and used for all wiping operations.

Galleys are extremely difficult to clean satisfactorily at times other than during maintenance
checks, since they have many almost inaccessible areas in which foods and beverages—
particularly the latter—can penetrate. The introduction of modules in wide-bodied aircraft is
an improvement, but much more could be done to design a galley that would be easier to
clean than the present type.

Problem areas
Aircraft cleaners need to pay particular attention to the following dirt traps and make sure
that they are thoroughly cleaned out:
• catering equipment runners
• bar box recesses


                                                                                                    57
Guide to Hygiene and Sanitation in Aviation


•    floor of catering container compartments
•    sink drain pipes (frequently blocked)
•    drinking-fountain wastes and bottle top remover recesses
•    lavatory cupboards
•    first-aid stowage holds.

ANNEX G: Recommended attributes for aircraft disinfectant
1) Safety of active ingredients for humans: In spite of best practices in the decontamination
   of environmental surfaces, human exposure to microbiocidal chemicals cannot be
   prevented altogether; this is particularly the case in confined spaces such as aircraft
   cabins. Therefore, formulations with the safest possible ingredients must be selected for
   such use, and proper ventilation should be provided.
2) Environmental safety: Chemicals used virtually anywhere eventually end up in the water
   environment, where they may prove unsafe for the ecology. Persistent chemicals can be
   particularly undesirable in this regard, as they tend to accumulate in the food-chain with
   the potential for long-term damage. In view of this, chemicals that can perform the task of
   decontamination when/where applied and then break down into harmless by-products are
   preferred.
3) Spectrum of microbiocidal activity: Cleaning alone provides some level of improvement
   and risk reduction. However, many commercially available disinfectants are active
   against easy-to-kill vegetative bacteria only, while several types of spores, viruses and
   fungi also have the potential to spread on environmental surfaces. Since in field settings
   the target pathogen is often unknown, chosen formulations should have demonstrated
   activity not only against bacteria, but also against viruses and fungi.
4) Materials compatibility: This is crucial when choosing disinfectants for decontamination
   of hard environmental surfaces in aircraft cabins. Any formulation selected for use in
   such settings must be safe for repeated applications and, as far as possible, must not reach
   other more sensitive and vital areas of the aircraft. Advice from the equipment
   manufacturer or aircraft operator’s engineering department should be followed.
5) Transport, storage and inventory control: Ideally, one type of ready-to-use formulation
   can eliminate issues with inventory control and dealings with different manufacturers.
   The product to be selected must also be packaged for safe storage on board the aircraft.
6) Directions for use: The label directions must be as simple and easy to understand as
   possible to avoid misuse of the product.
7) Speed of activity: In most cases, the contact time between the targeted environmental
   surface and the applied product lasts from a few seconds to perhaps a minute or so.
   However, many commercial products sold for such use claim microbiocidal activity with
   a contact time of at least 10 minutes. This obvious disparity between label directions and
   actual field use has the potential to generate a false sense of security in the mind of the
   user. Further, the application of a relatively weak formulation for a shorter than
   recommended contact time could result in the spread of microbial contamination over a
   wider area during the wiping of environmental surfaces. Therefore, products that can
   achieve decontamination in as short a time as possible are preferred.
8) Freedom from off-gassing and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs): Pungent odours are
   obviously undesirable, but addition of even strong scents/perfumes to disinfectants is now
   discouraged because of increasing numbers of individuals with multiple chemical
   allergies. Formulations that may release corrosive gases (e.g. chlorine) and VOCs must be
   avoided because of potential exposure of sensitive and vital components of the aircraft.
   Advice from the equipment manufacturer or aircraft operator’s engineering department
   should be followed. Appropriate ventilation during cleaning is also important.
