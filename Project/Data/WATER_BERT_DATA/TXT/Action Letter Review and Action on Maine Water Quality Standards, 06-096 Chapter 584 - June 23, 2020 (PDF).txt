Re: Review and Action on Maine Water Quality Standards, 06-096 Chapter 584

Dear Mr. Reid:

By letter dated April 24, 2020, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
submitted new and revised Water Quality Standards (WQS) in accordance with Section 303(c) of
the Clean Water Act (CWA). Public notice of this rulemaking was published on October 2, 2019
and October 30, 2019. The Maine Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) held a public
hearing on the proposed rulemaking on November 21, 2019. The public comment period closed
on December 6, 2019. The BEP voted on, and approved, the Chapter 584 WQS revisions on
February 6, 2020. They were filed with the Maine Secretary of State and became effective on
February 16, 2020. On April 22, 2020 the Attorney General certified that the 06-096 Chapter
584, Surface Water Quality for Toxic Pollutants amendments were duly adopted as WQS
pursuant to State law.

The new and revised provisions in Chapter 584 include human health criteria (HHC), aquatic life
criteria (ALC) and site-specific criteria (SSC) for three specific river segments. This letter
addresses only the HHC provisions in Chapter 584. EPA will address new and revised ALC and
SSC in a separate action letter. As detailed in Attachment 1, EPA has determined that DEP’s new
and revised HHC provisions in Chapter 584 are consistent with the requirements of the CWA
and applicable federal regulations. EPA therefore approves the new and revised HHC provisions
in Chapter 584.

We look forward to continued cooperation with Maine in the development, review, and approval
of water quality standards pursuant to our responsibilities under the CWA. If you have any
questions, please contact Dan Arsenault (617 918-1562) or Michael Knapp (617 918-1053).

                                        Attachment 1
    Supporting Discussion of EPA’s Approvals of Maine’s New and Revised Human Health
                             Criteria (HHC) for Toxic Pollutants

Revisions to Maine’s HHC for toxic pollutants are set forth in DEP’s regulations at 06-096 CMR
Chapter 584.5.C, and in Appendix A to Ch. 584. There are two sets of HHC in Tables 1 and 2 of
Appendix A (see Attachment 2). One set protects the statewide “fishing” designated use, and the
other set protects the State’s new “sustenance fishing” designated use subcategory that applies to
specifically identified waters. The underlined criteria values in Tables 1 and 2 represent the
new/revised criteria; strike-out criteria values represent deletions to this chapter.

EPA reviewed these HHC for consistency with the Clean Water Act (CWA) and federal
implementing regulations at 40 CFR Part 131. EPA’s 2000 Human Health Methodology
provides guidance for deriving HHC for toxic pollutants. 1 For each variable used in the criteria
calculation, the 2000 Methodology provides a default value that may be used by states and
guidance on adjustments that may be appropriate to reflect local conditions and/or protect
identifiable populations or subpopulations. Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. §131.11(a), EPA must ensure
that new or revised criteria are based on sound scientific rationale and that they protect
designated uses, including subcategories of uses.

A. HHC Applicable to Waters Subject to the Sustenance Fishing Designated Use
   Subcategory Established by 38 M.R.S. §466(10-A), and Specified Under 38 M.R.S. §§
   465-A(1)(D), 467(7)(A)(B)(D), 467(13), 467(15)(C), 467(15)(A)(E)(F), 468(8), and 469(7).

In 2019, Maine adopted, and EPA approved, 38 M.R.S. § 466(10-A), which establishes and
defines a “sustenance fishing designated use” as “a subcategory of the applicable fishing
designated use that protects human consumption of fish for nutritional and cultural purposes and
applies only to those water body segments that are identified in this article as subject to a
sustenance fishing designated use.” Maine adopted the sustenance fishing designated use
subcategory (SFDU) for waters “where there is or may be sustenance fishing or increased fish
consumption by members of the Indian tribes in Maine or other Maine citizens.” 2 These waters
are specifically identified in 38 M.R.S. §§ 465-A(1)(D), 467(7)(A)(B)(D), 467(13), 467(15)(C),
467(15)(A)(E)(F), 468(8), and 469(7).

As noted above, DEP’s new and revised HHC for toxic pollutants include criteria to protect the
SFDU in specifically identified waters. EPA evaluated whether the HHC applicable to waters
subject to the SFDU protect the sustenance fishing use.

     1. HHC Other Than Arsenic

        a. Maine’s Revised Criteria


1
  USEPA. 2000. Methodology for Deriving Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Washington, D.C. EPA 822-B-00-004.
2
  See L.D. 1775, original text of the legislative document, summary section, at page 9-129LR2522(01)-l, May 23,
2019, available at http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/bills_129th/billtexts/HP126201.asp

                                                        3
Chapter 584.5.C states that for waters subject to the SFDU, HHC “will be determined assuming
consumption of 2.4 Liters of water, by a person weighing 80 kg, and a fish consumption rate of
200 grams per day, except for those parameters that did not change with EPA’s criteria
recommendations referenced in EPA 820-F-15-001 for which the human health criteria will be
determined assuming consumption of 2 Liters of water by a person weighing 70 kg, a fish
consumption rate of 200 grams per day, and a cancer risk level of one in 1,000,000 [1x10-6]
(except for… inorganic arsenic [discussed below]…).” The corresponding HHC values are set
forth in Chapter 584, Appendix A, Tables 1 and 2.

        b. Basis for EPA Approval

Maine based its HHC to protect the SFDU on a fish consumption rate (FCR), 3 body weight,
drinking water intake, toxicity factors (reference dose or cancer slope factor), bioaccumulation
factors, relative source contribution values, and cancer risk level for carcinogens that are at least
as stringent for each pollutant as the inputs used in EPA’s nationally recommended CWA
Section 304(a) HHC (with the exception of arsenic, discussed below).

The purpose of these HHC is to protect human health of sustenance fishers in the identified
waters. The exposure pathway for these constituents is through consumption of aquatic life and
drinking water. Maine considered both toxic and carcinogenic effects when developing the HHC
to protect the SFDU. The new and revised HHC reflect the latest scientific information and are
consistent with EPA's most recent CWA Section 304(a) recommended HHC for each pollutant.
As such, Maine's revisions are consistent with 40 C.F.R. § 131.6 (b) and (c); are based on a
sound scientific rationale and protect the designated use in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 131.11
(a) and (b)(i); and EPA hereby approves these new and revised criteria.

    2. HHC for Arsenic

        a. Maine’s Revised Criteria

For waters subject to the SFDU, Chapter 584.5.C revisions provide that the HHC for inorganic
arsenic will be based on the FCR of 200 g/day and the cancer risk level (CRL) specified by 38
M.R.S. § 420(2)(J), which is 1 in 10,000 (1x10-4). The water consumption and body weight
parameters for arsenic did not change with EPA’s criteria recommendations referenced in EPA
820-F-15-001 (2015); therefore, as described above, Chapter 584.5.C requires the HHC for
arsenic to be based on an assumed consumption of 2 Liters of water per day by a person
weighing 70 kg.

Maine’s revised HHC for inorganic arsenic applicable to the sustenance fishing waters are 1.1
µg/L for water and organism exposure and 2.6 µg/L for organism-only exposure, using a 1x10-4

3
  In a previous action, EPA approved pursuant to Section 303(c)(2) of the CWA and 40 C.F.R. Part 131, the
revisions to Maine’s WQS at 38 M.R.S.A. § 466-A, which mandated that Maine use a FCR of 200 g/day when
developing HHC to protect the SFDU. EPA concluded that 200 g/day is a reasonable FCR, based on available
information, for Maine to use to protect a contemporary sustenance level of consumption. For details on this prior
action and EPA’s rationale, see November 6, 2019 letter from Water Division Director Ken Moraff, EPA Region 1
to Commissioner Gerald Reid, Maine DEP.


                                                         4
CRL and a FCR of 200 g/day, a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 26 L/kg, a cancer slope factor
(CSF) of 1.75 per mg/kg/day, an inorganic fraction (IF) of 30%, a body weight (BW) of 70 kg,
and drinking water rate (DW) of 2 L/day. See Appendix A of Chapter 584, Table I, footnote
aME. 4

        b. Basis for EPA Approval

As noted above, HHC are calculated from toxicological assessment values (reference dose,
cancer slope factor) and exposure factors (drinking water ingestion rate, FCR, BCF/BAF, IF (for
arsenic), BW), and a CRL. States may use risk management decisions to establish values for
calculating the HHC, as long as the resulting HHC are based on sound science and protective of
designated uses.

EPA’s national CWA Section 304(a) recommended HHC for arsenic are 0.018 µg/L and 0.14
µg/L for combined drinking water and fish/shellfish consumption exposure (i.e., water and
organisms), and for consumption of organisms only, respectively (based on a BW of 70 kg, DW
rate of 2 L/day, FCR of 6.5 g/day, CSF of 1.75, BCF of 44, an IF of 100%, and CRL of 10-6).
Maine’s revised arsenic HHC are based on certain input values that differ from the inputs in
EPA’s national CWA Section 304(a) recommended HHC for arsenic, but the resulting HHC are
nonetheless based on sound science and are protective of the designated use. EPA has
determined that the resulting HHC protect the SFDU for the following reasons.

             i. Approval Rationale for Maine’s Organism-Only Arsenic HHC for Waters Subject
                to the SFDU

The revised HHC are based on a 200 g/day FCR as required by 38 M.R.S. §466(10-A). As noted
above, EPA approved Maine’s use of a 200 g/day FCR in November 2019.

Maine also used a CRL of 1x10-4 for the arsenic HHC as required by state law. 5 In waters subject
to the SFDU, the HHC are intended to protect sustenance fishers. EPA evaluated whether the
arsenic HHC for consumption of organisms-only protects sustenance fishers at a risk level
consistent with EPA’s 2000 Methodology (i.e., between 1x10-5 and 1x10-6). As discussed below,
EPA concludes that it does.

There is substantial uncertainty surrounding many components of the arsenic HHC, notably the
CSF and the characterization of bioconcentration/bioaccumulation. With respect to the arsenic
CSF, in November 2015, EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) announced its plan
to review the toxicological assessment of arsenic with respect to human health effects. EPA's
current plan for addressing the scientific uncertainties with arsenic is described in the
Assessment Development Plan for the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Toxicological
Review of Inorganic Arsenic (EPA/630/R-14/101 November 2015). 6

  Although footnote aME in Table 1 is only included in the column for the arsenic criteria applicable to the non-
SFDU waters, the footnote text makes it clear that it also applies to the arsenic criteria applicable to the SFDU
waters.
5
  Other HHC submitted by Maine use a CRL of 1x10-6. There is no federal requirement that HHC for all constituents
be based on the same calculation inputs.

                                                       5
Current data indicate that the bioaccumulation rates for arsenic are variable, bioaccumulation of
arsenic may be dependent on the ambient water concentration, and concentrations of inorganic
arsenic in fish are low relative to concentrations of organic arsenic (organic forms of arsenic
typically found in fish are not as toxic as inorganic arsenic).

EPA compiled and published available information on arsenic bioconcentration and
bioaccumulation in 2003 and did not reach any conclusion regarding an appropriate single input
for use in HHC derivation. A related input parameter, the IF anticipated in fish, also varies
considerably between fresh and marine waters and among different classes and species of
organisms. Maine’s selection of a BCF of 26 and IF of 30% reflects values within the range of
reasonable possibilities as reflected in current data. Other scientific data would support a BCF of
14 and IF of 4% 7. If these alternative inputs are considered, then Maine’s organism only arsenic
criterion for SFDU provides greater protection than a 1 x 10-5 CRL.

             ii. Approval Rationale for Maine’s Water + Organisms Arsenic HHC for Waters
                 Subject to the SFDU

Maine’s inorganic arsenic criterion to protect human health for the consumption of water plus
organisms (1.1 µg/L) is based on a drinking water rate of 2 L/day, along with the same input
parameters as the criterion to protect for consumption of organisms-only, discussed above.

The water-plus-organisms criterion is intended to protect both the SFDU and the drinking water
designated use. As described above, Maine’s criterion of 2.6 µg/L is protective of sustenance
fishers from fish consumption exposure. For the same reasons, a criterion of 1.1 µg/L is also
protective of the SFDU (it is even more protective than 2.6 µg/L).

Maine’s WQS state that Classes AA and A waters must be suitable for drinking water supply
after disinfection, and Class B waters must be suitable for drinking water supply after treatment.
See 38 M.R.S. § 465 sub-§§.1.A, 2.A, and 3.A. States have significant discretion in how they
express drinking water supply uses, and many choose to express them as “after treatment,” which
implies ensuring protection of the finished water supply provided at the tap. Protection of the
finished water supply provided at the tap is the province of the Safe Drinking Water Act
(SDWA). 8 Maine’s criterion of 1.1 µg/L is more protective than the MCL. On this basis, EPA
approves Maine’s water + organism criterion as protective of the (post-treatment) drinking water
use.


7
  For example, ODEQ (2011) reported a geometric mean BCF of 14 using four representative freshwater studies that
ranged from 4-27 (see Table 6 on page 12 in Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. 2011. Draft Report
Water Quality Standards Review and Recommendations: Arsenic). The BCF value of 14 is also within the range
reported in USEPA (2003) for freshwater BAFs (see Table 3-9 on page 24 of USEPA. 2003. Technical Summary of
Information Available on the Bioaccumulation of Arsenic in Aquatic Organisms. EPA-822-R-03-032). USEPA
(1997) provides a review of IF data for arsenic and identifies 4% as a maximum value for a mixed fish and shellfish
diet (see page 10 of USEPA. 1997 Arsenic and Fish Consumption. EPA-822-R-97-003).
8
  One way to protect the post-treatment drinking water use is to set the water + organism instream water quality
criterion to be as stringent as the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 µg/L required by the SDWA for finished
water.

                                                        6
B. Revised HHC to Protect the Statewide Fishing Designated Use

Maine revised many of its HHC in Chapter 584, Appendix A to protect the statewide fishing
designated use. The revisions result in HHC that are as stringent as, or more stringent than,
EPA’s recommended HHC, published pursuant to CWA Section 304(a). Maine’s HHC reflect
the latest scientific information and are protective of the designated use. The revised criteria are
based on Maine’s statewide FCR of 32.4 g/day, updated BW, DW intake, health toxicity values,
BAFs, and RSCs. For carcinogens, Maine based these criteria on an incremental CRL of 1x10-6,
which is consistent with EPA’s 2000 Methodology.

Maine’s revisions are consistent with 40 C.F.R. §§ 131.6(b), (c), and 131.11 (a) and (b)(i), and
EPA hereby approves these revised criteria. 9


C. Other Statewide HHC Applicable to Certain Waters in Indian Lands

On May 27, 2020, EPA took three actions relevant to statewide HHC for toxics that are also
applicable to waters in Indian lands: EPA withdrew its February 2, 2015, interpretations and
approvals of a sustenance fishing designated use for all waters in Indian lands in Maine;
withdrew its associated disapproval of the application of Maine’s statewide HHC for those
waters; and approved Maine’s statewide fishing designated use without EPA’s interpretation that
it means sustenance fishing for waters in Indian lands in Maine. Because Maine had recently
adopted revised HHC for most toxics in February 2020, EPA decided that it would review those
HHC once they were submitted to EPA, rather than review Maine’s 2006 and 2013 HHC that
were previously submitted to EPA but have been superseded by the 2020 HHC. That review
resulted in the approvals discussed above.

In its 2020 revisions, Maine did not update its 2006 and 2013 statewide HHC that are applicable
to waters not subject to the SFDU, including some waters in Indian lands, for the following
pollutants: antimony, arsenic, heptachlor epoxide, manganese, nickel, nitrosamines, N-
nitrosodibutylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodi-n-
propylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), selenium, thallium,
zinc, and 2,3,7,8-TCDD (dioxin). 10 Because EPA withdrew its 2015 disapprovals of these
statewide HHC for application in waters in Indian lands, and because they were not superseded
by Maine’s 2020 revised criteria, EPA has evaluated Maine’s 2006 and 2013 HHC for these
pollutants (as set forth in Tables 1 and 2) to determine whether they protect the general fishing
use for waters in Indian lands that are not in the SFDU subcategory. EPA approves these HHC
for the reasons discussed below.



9
  EPA also notes that these criteria, based on the FCR of 32.4 g/day and CRL of 1x10-6, will protect sustenance
fishers in the non-SFDU subcategory waters (including waters in Indian lands) at an effective CRL of approximately
6.17x10-6, assuming a sustenance level FCR of 200 g/day.
10
   In addition, Maine did not revise its HHC in 2020, for asbestos, barium, copper, iron, manganese, nitrates, and N-
nitrosodipyrrolidine. However, EPA previously approved the HHC for asbestos, barium, copper, iron, manganese,
and nitrates for waters in Indian lands on January 19, 2016 and the HHC for N-nitrosodipyrrolidine for waters in
Indian lands on April 11, 2016.

                                                         7
     1. HHC Other Than Arsenic

             a. Maine’s Criteria

Maine’s 2006 HHC for antimony, heptachlor epoxide, manganese, nickel, nitrosamines, N-
nitrosodibutylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodi-n-
propylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), selenium, thallium,
zinc, and 2,3,7,8-TCDD (dioxin) are all equal to or more stringent than EPA’s national
recommended HHC for those pollutants.

             b. Basis for EPA Approval

The science supporting EPA's national CWA Section 304(a) recommended criteria supports
EPA's conclusion that Maine's criteria are protective of human health and the fishing designated
use. As such, Maine's criteria are consistent with 40 C.F.R. §§ 131.6(b) and (c), and 131.11 (a)
and (b)(i), and EPA hereby approves these HHC for the waters in Indian lands that are not
covered by the SFDU subcategory. 1112

     2. HHC for Arsenic

             a. Maine’s Criteria

Maine’s HHC for inorganic arsenic applicable to waters in Indian lands not covered by the
SFDU subcategory are 1.3 µg/L for water and organism exposure and 3.7 µg/L for organism-
only exposure, using a 1x10-4 CRL and a FCR of 138 g/day , a BCF of 26 L/kg, a CSF of 1.75
per mg/kg/day, an IF of 30%, a BW of 70 kg, and DW of 2 L/day. See Appendix A of Chapter
584, Table I, footnote aME.

             b. Basis for EPA Approval

                 i. Approval Rationale for Maine’s Organism-Only Arsenic HHC for Waters in
                    Indian lands Not Subject to the SFDU

In 2011, Maine’s legislature enacted LD 515, which required DEP to revise Maine’s HHC for
arsenic by basing it on a CRL of 1 in 10,000 (1x10-4) rather than the previous CRL of 1 in
1,000,000 (1x10-6). DEP adopted new criteria based on the 10-4 CRL, and a revised FCR of 138

11
   EPA did not update the national CWA Section 304(a) recommended criteria for thallium and dioxin in 2015
because further analysis was necessary to develop scientifically sound recommendations. Nevertheless, under the
CWA, EPA has an obligation to act on Maine’s HHC for thallium and dioxin. Because DEP used existing EPA data
on the toxicity of thallium and dioxin and relied on the derivation methodology from EPA guidance and 304(a)
recommendations, EPA approves these HHC for waters in Indian lands outside of the SFDU subcategory waters. As
new information becomes available from IRIS, EPA encourages the State to consider revisions, if necessary, to
incorporate the latest scientific knowledge for dioxin and thallium.
12
   EPA also notes that these criteria, based on the FCR of 32.4 g/day and CRL of 1x10-6, will protect sustenance
fishers in the non-SFDU subcategory waters (including waters in Indian lands) at an effective CRL of approximately
6.17x10-6, assuming a sustenance level FCR of 200 g/day.


                                                        8
g/day (compared to 32.4 g/day FCR used for other toxic HHC) in order to protect highly exposed
state subpopulations at the new 1x10-4 CRL. DEP submitted the revised arsenic HHC on January
14, 2013 to EPA for review and approval, and EPA approved the revised arsenic criteria for
waters outside of Indian lands on May 16, 2013. EPA is now approving the statewide 3.7 µg/L
organism-only criterion for application to waters in Indian lands that are not subject to the
SFDU, on the same basis as set forth in the 2013 approval for waters outside of Indian lands.
EPA also notes that, as discussed above in Section A.2.b.i, there are a number of scientific
uncertainties associated with the HHC for arsenic. 13

                 ii. Approval Rationale for Maine’s Water + Organisms Arsenic HHC for Waters
                 in Indian Lands Not Subject to the SFDU

Maine’s inorganic arsenic criterion to protect human health for the consumption of waters plus
organisms (1.3 µg/L) is based on a drinking water rate of 2 L/day, along with the same input
parameters as the criterion to protect for consumption of organisms-only.

The water-plus-organisms criterion is intended to protect both the fish consumption use and the
drinking water designated use. The criterion of 1.3 µg/L is more protective of fish consumption
than the 3.7 µg/L organisms-only criterion approved above. As discussed above in Section
A.2.b.ii, to protect the post-treatment drinking water use, the water + organism criterion may be
set equivalent to the MCL of 10 µg/L required by the SDWA. Maine’s criterion of 1.3 µg/L is
nearly ten times more protective than the MCL. On this basis, EPA approves Maine’s water +
organism criterion for the waters in Indian lands that are outside of the SFDU subcategory waters
as protective of the (post-treatment) drinking water use.




13
  EPA notes that this criterion, based on the FCR of 138 g/day and CRL of 1x10-4, will protect sustenance fishers in
the non-SFDU subcategory waters (including waters in Indian lands) at an effective CRL of approximately 1.04 x
10-5, assuming a sustenance level FCR of 200 g/day, if the alternative exposure inputs of BCF of 14 and IF of 4% as
described in footnote 7 are considered.

Footnotes to Table I:
A.     This recommended water quality criterion was derived from data for arsenic (III), but is applied here to total arsenic, which might imply that arsenic (III) and
       arsenic (V) are equally toxic to aquatic life and that their toxicities are additive. In the arsenic criteria document (EPA 440/5-84-033, January 1985), Species
       Mean Acute Values are given for both arsenic (III) and arsenic (V) for five species and the ratios of the SMAVs for each species range from 0.6 to 1.7. Chronic
       values are available for both arsenic (III) and arsenic (V) for one species; for the fathead minnow, the chronic value for arsenic (V) is 0.29 times the chronic
       value for arsenic (III). No data are known to be available concerning whether the toxicities of the forms of arsenic to aquatic organisms are additive.
B.     This criterion has been revised to reflect The Environmental Protection Agency’s q1* or RfD, as contained in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) as of
       May 17, 2002. The fish tissue bioconcentration factor (BCF)from the 1980 Ambient Water Quality Criteria document was retained in each case.
E.     The freshwater criterion for this metal is expressed as a function of hardness (mg/L) in the water column. The value given here corresponds to a hardness of 20
       mg/L. Also see part 7 below. under “Additional Notes” after Table II.
                                                                                  21
F.   Freshwater aquatic life values for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows: CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.869);CCC =
     exp(1.005(pH)-5.134). Values displayed in table correspond to a pH of 7.0.
G.   This Criterion is based on 304(a) aquatic life criterion issued in 1980, and was issued in one of the following documents: Aldrin/Dieldrin (EPA 440/5-80-019),
     Chlordane (EPA 440/5-80-027), DDT (EPA 440/5-80-038), Endosulfan (EPA440/5-80-046), Endrin (EPA440/5-047), Heptachlor (440/580-052),
     Hexachlorocyclohexane (EPA440/5-80-054), Silver (EPA 440/5-80-071). The Minimum Data Requirements and derivation procedures were different in the 1980
     Guidelines than in the 1985 Guidelines. For example, a “CMC” derived using the 1980 Guidelines was derived to be used as an instantaneous maximum. If
     assessment is to be done using an averaging period, the values given should be divided by 2 to obtain a value that is more comparable to a CMC derived using the
     1985 Guidelines.
H.   No criterion for protection of human health from consumption of aquatic organisms excluding water was present in the 1980 criteria document or in the 1986
     Quality Criteria for Water. Nevertheless, sufficient information was presented in the 1980 document to allow the calculation of a criterion, even though the
     results of such a calculation were not shown in the document.
I.   This criterion for asbestos is the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) developed under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
J.   These values are not applicable to bleach karft kraft pulp mills. See 38 M.R.S.A., section 420(2)(I).
K.   This recommended criterion is based on a 304(a) aquatic life criterion that was issued in the 1995 Updates: Water Quality Criteria Documents for the Protection
     of Aquatic Life in Ambient Water, (EPA-820-B-96-001, September 1996). This value was derived using the GLI Guidelines (60FR15393-15399, March 23,
     1995; 40CFR132 Appendix A); the difference between the 1985 Guidelines and the GLI Guidelines are explained on page iv of the 1995 Updates. None of the
     decisions concerning the derivation of this criterion were affected by any considerations that are specific to the Great Lakes.
L.   The CMC = 1/[(f1/CMC1) + (f2/CMC2)] where f1 and f2 are the fractions of total selenium that are treated as selenite and selenate, respectively, and CMC1 and
     CMC2 are 185.9 µg/l and 12.83 µg/l, respectively.
M.   EPA is currently reassessing the criteria for arsenic.
N.   This criterion applies to total PCBs (e.g. the sum of all congener or all isomer or homolog or Aroclor analyses).
O.   The derivation of the CCC for this pollutant did not consider exposure through the diet, which is probably important for aquatic life occupying upper trophic
     levels.
P.   Although a new RfD is available in IRIS, the surface water criteria will not be revised until the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Stage 2
     Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule (Stage 2 DBPR) is completed, since public comment on the relative source contribution (RSC) for chloroform is
     anticipated.
Q.   This recommended water quality criterion is expressed as µg free cyanide (as CN)/L.
R.   This value for Selenium was announced (61FR58444-58449, November 14, 1996) as a proposed GLI 303(c) aquatic life criterion. EPA is currently working on
     this criterion and so this value might change substantially in the near future.
S.   This recommended water quality criterion refers to the inorganic form only.
U.   The organoleptic effect criterion is more stringent than the value for priority toxic pollutants. Also see Part 6.
V.   This value was derived from data for heptachlor and the criteria document provides insufficient data to estimate the relative toxicities of heptachlor and
     heptachlor epoxide.
W.   Although EPA has not published a final criteria document for this compound, it is EPA’s understanding that sufficient data exist to allow calculation of aquatic
     criteria. It is anticipated that industry intends to publish in the peer reviewed literature draft aquatic life criteria generated in accordance with EPA Guidelines.
     EPA will review such criteria for possible issuance as national WQC.
X.   There is a full set of aquatic life toxicity data that show that BEHP is not toxic to aquatic organisms at or below its solubility limit.
Y.   This value was derived from data for endosulfan and is most appropriately applied to the sum of alpha- endosulfan and beta-endosulfan.
Z.   A more stringent MCL has been issued. Also see part 6 below.
                                                                                  22
aa    This criterion is based on a 304(a) aquatic life criterion issued in 1980 or 1986, and in one of the following documents: Aldrin/Dieldrin (EPA 440/5-80-019),
      Chlordane (EPA 440/5-80-027), DDT (EPA 440/5-80-038), Endrin (EPA 440/5-80-047), Heptachlor (EPA 440/5-80-052), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (EPA
      440/5-80-019), Toxaphene (EPA 440/5-86-038). The CCC is currently based on the Final Residual Value (FRV) procedure. Since the publication of the Great
      Lakes Aquatic Criteria Guidelines in 1995 (60FR15393-15399, March 23, 1995), the Agency no longer uses the FRV procedure for deriving CCCs for new or
      revised 304(a) aquatic life criteria. Therefore, the Agency anticipates that future revisions of this CCC will not be based on the FRV procedure.
bb    This water quality criterion is based on a 304(a) aquatic life criterion that was derived using the 1985 Guidelines (Guidelines for Deriving Numerical
      NationalWater Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses, PB85-227049, January 1985) and was issued in one of the following
      criteria documents: Arsenic (EPA 440/5-84-033), Cadmium (EPA 440/5-84-032), Chromium (EPA 440/5-84-029), Copper (EPA 440/5-84-031), Cyanide (EPA
      440/5-84-028), Lead (EPA 440/5-84-027), Nickel (EPA 440/5-86-004), Pentachlorophenol (EPA 440/5-86-009), Toxaphene, (EPA 440/5-86-006), Zinc (EPA
      440/5-87- 003).
cc    When the concentration of dissolved organic copper is elevated, copper is substantially less toxic and use of Water- Effects Ratios might be appropriate.
dd    The selenium criteria document (EPA 440/5-87-006, September 1987) provides that if selenium is as toxic to saltwater fishes in the field as it is to freshwater
      fishes in the field, the status of the fish community should be monitored whenever the concentration of selenium exceeds 5.0 µg/L in salt water saltwater because
      the saltwater CCC does not take into account uptake via the food chain.
ff    This recommended water quality criterion was derived in Ambient Water Quality Criteria Saltwater Copper Addendum (Draft, April 14, 1995) and was
      promulgated in the Interim final National Toxics Rule (60FR22228-222237, May 4, 1995).
gg    EPA is actively working on this criterion and so this recommended water quality criterion may change substantially in the near future.
ii    This criterion applies to DDT and it metabolites (i.e. the total concentration of DDT and its metabolites should not exceed this value).
jj.   This criterion is expressed as total cyanide, even though the IRIS RfD used to derive the criterion is based on free cyanide. The multiple forms of cyanide that
      are present in ambient water have significant differences in toxicity due to their differing abilities to liberate the CN-moiety. Some complex cyanides require
      even more extreme condition the refluxing with sulfuric acid to liberate the CN-moiety. Thus these complex cyanides are expected to have little or no
      ‘bioavailability’ to humans. If a substantial fraction of the cyanide present in water body is present in a complex form (e.g. Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3), this recommended
      criterion mat may be over conservative.
ll.   This criterion has been revised to reflect the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancer slope factor (CSF) or reference dose (RfD), as contained in the Integrated
      Risk Information System (IRIS) as of (Final FR Notice June 10, 2009). The fish tissue bioconcentration factor (BCF) from the 1980 Ambient Water Quality
      Criteria document was retained in each case.
aME   As noted in 06-096 CMR 584.4 and CMR 584.5.C, when calculating ambient water quality (human health) criteria for inorganic arsenic, a 10-4 risk level and a
      state-wide consumption value of 138 grams of organisms per day shall be utilized. In waters subject to a designated use of sustenance fishing as specified under
      38 MRS §465-A(1)(D), 38 MRS §467(7)(A)(B)(D), 38 MRS §467(13), 38 MRS §467 (15)(C), 38 MRS §467(15)(A)(E)(F), 38 MRS §468(8), 38 MRS §469(7),
      a fish consumption rate of 200 grams per day shall be used. Other values specific to inorganic arsenic shall include a bioconcentration factor of 26 L/kg, a cancer
      slope (potency) factor of 1.75 mg/kg/day, and an inorganic factor of 30%.
mm.   When calculating acute and chronic permit limits for the Androscoggin River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 1.3 for acute and 3.0 for chronic for cadmium.
      Rationale for the WERs is provided in Androscoggin River Water Effect Ratios (Integral Consulting Inc., April 13, 2015). WER is defined as an appropriate
      measure of the toxicity of a material obtained in on site water divided by the same measure of the toxicity of the same material obtained simultaneously in
      laboratory dilution water.

      When calculating acute permit limits for the St. Croix River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 1.2 for acute for cadmium. Rationale for the WERs is provided
      in St. Croix River Water-Effect Ratios (Integral Consulting, Inc., July 2019). WER is defined as an appropriate measure of the toxicity of a material obtained in
      onsite water divided by the same measure of the toxicity of the same material obtained simultaneously in laboratory dilution water.
                                                                                  23
nn.   When calculating acute and chronic permit limits for the Androscoggin River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 2.5 for acute and 2.5 for chronic for copper.
      The final WER for chronic copper was determined to be 3.5, however, 2.5 is used to prevent the chronic criteria from exceeding the acute criteria. Rationale for
      the WERs is provided in Androscoggin River Water Effect Ratios (Integral Consulting Inc., April 13, 2015). WER is defined as an appropriate measure of the
      toxicity of a material obtained in on site water divided by the same measure of the toxicity of the same material obtained simultaneously in laboratory dilution
      water.

      When calculating acute permit limits for the St. Croix River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 3.0 for acute for copper. Rationale for the WERs is provided in
      St. Croix River Water-Effect Ratios (Integral Consulting, Inc., July 2019). WER is defined as an appropriate measure of the toxicity of a material obtained in
      onsite water divided by the same measure of the toxicity of the same material obtained simultaneously in laboratory dilution water.

oo.   When calculating acute and chronic permit limits for total copper in the Little Androscoggin River from the outfall of the Paris Utility District in Paris, to the
      confluence of the Little Androscoggin River with the main stem Androscoggin River in Auburn, the ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for acute exposure
      must be 10.85 micrograms per liter (µg/L) and the chronic AWQC must be 6.78 µg/L. Rationale for the previously noted AWQCs is based on the Biotic Ligand
      Model (BLM) that is summarized in the Board of Environmental Protection (BEP) Final Order for the Paris Utility District dated November 20, 2014. As stated
      in the aforementioned Final Order “The copper BLM calculates metal toxicity to aquatic organisms as a function of simultaneous concentrations of chemical
      constituents in water that can either compete with copper and render it biologically unavailable, or compete with copper for binding sites at the point of entry into
      a vulnerable organism.”

qq.   Human Health Ambient Water Quality Criteria: 2015 Update. EPA 820-F-15-001. It should be noted that EPA used a fish consumption rate of 22 g/day to
      calculate their 2015 values, however the criteria listed here are calculated using a fish consumption rate of 32.4 g/day, generally, and 200 g/day for waters subject
      to a designated use of sustenance fishing. It should also be noted that antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium (III or VI), copper,
      manganese, nickel, nitrates, nitrosamines, N-nitrosodibutylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosodipyrrolidine, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodi-n-

      update due to ongoing research.

rr.   When calculating acute and chronic permit limits for the St. Croix River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 3.0 for acute and 4.8 for chronic for lead. Rationale
      for the WERs is provided in St. Croix River Water-Effect Ratios (Integral Consulting, Inc., July 2019). WER is defined as an appropriate measure of the toxicity
      of a material obtained in onsite water divided by the same measure of the toxicity of the same material obtained simultaneously in laboratory dilution water.

Footnotes to Table II:
A This human health criterion is the same as originally published in the Red Book (EPA 440/9-76-023, July 1976) which predates the 1980 methodology and did not
  utilize the fish ingestion BCF approach. This same criterion value is now published in the Gold Book (Quality Criteria for Water: 1986. EPA 440/5-86-001).
B The organoleptic effect criterion is more stringent than the value presented in the non priority pollutant table.
C A more stringent Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) has been issued by EPA under the Save Drinking Water Act. Refer to drinking water regulations 40CFR141
  or Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791) for values. Also see part 6 below.
                                                                                  27
D Total Ammonia Nitrogen Aquatic life criteria are pH, temperature and/or salinity dependent. See part 7(C) for fresh water and reference document for marine waters.
  The values presented in the table are based on pH of 7.0 and temperature of 25oC in fresh waters; and pH of 8.0, temperature of 20oC and salinity of 30 parts per
  thousand in marine waters.
E This criterion has been revised to reflect The Environmental Protection Agency’s q1* or RfD, as contained in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) as of
  May 17, 2002. The fish tissue bioconcentration factor (BCF) used to derive the original criterion was retained in each case.
F The derivation of this value is presented in the Red Book (EPA 440/9-76-023, July, 1976).
G This value is based on a 304(a) aquatic life criterion that was derived using the 1985 Guidelines (Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria
  for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and Their Uses, PB85-227049, January 1985) and was issued in one of the following criteria documents: Aluminum (EPA
  440/5-86-008); Chloride (EPA 440/5-88-001); Chloropyrifos (EPA 440/5-86-005).
J This value is based on a 304(a) aquatic life criterion that was issued in the 1995 Updates: Water Quality Criteria Documents for the Protection of Aquatic Life in
  Ambient Water (EPA-820-B-96-001). This value was derived using the GLI Guidelines (60FR15393-15399, March 23, 1995; 40CFR132 Appendix A); the
  differences between the 1985 Guidelines and the GLI Guidelines are explained on page iv of the 1995 Updates. No decision concerning this criterion was affected by
  any considerations that are specific to the Great Lakes.
L There are three major reasons why the use of Water-Effect Ratios might be appropriate. (1) The value of 87 µg/l is based on a toxicity test with the striped bass in
  water with pH= 6.5-6.6 and hardness <10 mg/L. Data in “Aluminum Water-Effect Ratio for the 3M Plant Effluent Discharge, Middleway, West Virginia” (May
  1994) indicate that aluminum is substantially less toxic at higher pH and hardness, but the effects of pH and hardness are not well quantified at this time. (2) In tests
  with the brook trout at low pH and hardness, effects increased with increasing concentrations of total aluminum even though the concentration of dissolved aluminum
  was constant, indicating that total recoverable is a more appropriate measurement than dissolved, at least when particulate aluminum is primarily aluminum hydroxide
  particles. In surface waters, however, the total recoverable procedure might measure aluminum associated with clay particles, which might be less toxic than
  aluminum associated with aluminum hydroxide. (3) EPA is aware of field data indicating that many high quality waters in the U.S. contain more than 87 µg
  aluminum/L, when either total recoverable or dissolved is measured.
N This value was announced (62FR42554, August 7, 1997) as a proposed 304(a) aquatic life criterion. Although EPA has not responded to public comment, EPA has
  published this as a 304(a) criterion as guidance for States and Tribes to consider when adopting water quality criteria.
O When calculating acute and chronic permit limits for the Androscoggin River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 1.3 for acute and 3.7 for chronic for aluminum.
  Rationale for the WERs is provided in Androscoggin River Water Effect Ratios (Integral Consulting Inc., April 13, 2015).
P When calculating acute and chronic permit limits for the St. Croix River, use a Water Effect Ratio (WER) of 6.1 for aluminum. Rationale for the WER is provided in
  Aluminum Water-Effect Ration for Georgia-Pacific Corporation Woodland, Maine Pulp & Paper Operations Discharge and St. Croix River prepared by AScI
  Corporation/AScI-Duluth dated November 1996, and summarized in the letter from William R. Beckwith of EPA Region 1 to Barry Mower, DEP, dated March 2,
  1998.
