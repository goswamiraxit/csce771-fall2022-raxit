INTRODUCTION

S
      afe water for all without discrimination is a human right, officially recognized by the United Nations (UN)
      in 2010. The global commitment to safe water for all is further demonstrated through the Sustainable
      Development Goal (SDG) 6 target to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
drinking-water for all. However, many people cannot yet claim their fundamental right to water, and this lack
of access is felt disproportionately by those who are disadvantaged socially, economically, demographically
or geographically (WHO & UNICEF, 2014; WHO & UNICEF, 2017). Equitable access to safe drinking-water will
therefore only be achieved if particular attention is paid to vulnerable and marginalized groups to understand
and address disparities.

Water safety plans (WSPs) represent an important opportunity to contribute to the realization of the SDGs
and to the human right to water, provided that equity is duly considered. Described in the WHO Guidelines for
drinking-water quality as the most effective way to ensure the safety of drinking-water supplies, WSPs have
been implemented in at least 93 countries worldwide, with 69 countries reporting to have policy instruments
either in place or under development that promote or require WSPs or an equivalent (WHO & IWA, 2017).
Water safety planning policy support and
practice are expected to continue to grow
through the SDG period due to an increased          Equity 1 is the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among

supplies. Water safety plans, therefore,            demographically or geographically (WHO, 2019a). For WSPs, this means
provide a well-established and widely               that all groups should have the opportunity for meaningful participation in,
accepted framework that can be applied to           and equitable benefit from, water safety planning.
ensure social inclusion in the improvement
                                                    Equality is a term sometimes used interchangeably with equity, however
of drinking-water supplies.
                                                        there is an important difference. Equality is a legally defined term and
                                                        a binding principle under human rights law, whereas equity is a moral
                                                        imperative open to interpretation. In this guidance, the term equity is used,
                                                        as the focus is primarily on taking steps to meet differential needs rather
                                                        than claiming rights from duty bearers. (See Tool A for further explanation

    HOW A WSP CAN                                       of equality, equity and other related terms used throughout this guidance.)

                                                            Gender considerations are included within the term “equity”.

    WATER FOR ALL
Water safety planning provides a practical framework to identify and address the needs of diverse groups.
With relatively modest efforts, the WSP approach can bring tangible improvements in water quality and
availability for disadvantaged groups. For example:

[   Prioritizing the participation of women in the WSP process gives greater voice to those with first-hand
    knowledge of priority risks and appropriate control measures.
[   Explicitly considering informal settlement dwellers when assessing risks reveals vulnerabilities that are
    unique to these water users and highlights the need for additional control measures.




                                                                                                                           Introduction   1
      [     Recognizing the need to compensate farmers adversely impacted by surface water protection measures
            avoids inadvertent harm and helps ensure that the measures will be observed in practice.
      [     Considering geographically remote consumers when reviewing operational monitoring data ensures
            sufficient chlorine residual in the most vulnerable areas of the distribution network.
      [     Emergency response planning that considers the needs of different groups, e.g. minority groups or those
            without radios or television, allows for more equitable access to essential information.

      WSPs contribute to positive equity outcomes by creating opportunity for meaningful participation and by
      facilitating the identification and mitigation of inequities in access to safe water. In addition, considering
      equity through the WSP process will result in stronger WSPs that address a greater range of social and
      technical hazardous events and identify more effective and sustainable control measures.



      PURPOSE AND SCOPE
      This guidance document describes how to systematically integrate equity considerations into WSP
      programming and practice for both urban and rural water supply systems in order to:



            contribute to equitable              minimize any (inadvertent)                 strengthen WSP
          realization of the benefits of a       discrimination through the             effectiveness through an
           WSP and access to safe water                 WSP process                      inclusive WSP approach

      This document is designed to be used in conjunction with existing WSP guidance materials, offering guidance
      on applying an “equity lens” to the established WSP steps described in other publications (and summarized
      in Section 1).



      TARGET AUDIENCE
      This document provides guidance for two groups of stakeholders who are already familiar with the WSP
      process:

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDANCE
TO TRAIN AND GUIDE WSP TEAMS
This document can be used directly by WSP teams as they develop and implement their WSPs, ideally
following sensitization and training on the principles and steps presented. To this end, the document has
been designed to serve as a convenient training resource. For example, Tool A can be photocopied and
provided as a handout during a training event, and Tool F provides example training materials demonstrating
where and how to address equity considerations within established WSP steps.

TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF WSP PROGRAMMES AND RESOURCES
This document can be used by those supporting WSPs at all levels to design and deliver WSP programmes
that promote equity. Wherever possible, those supporting WSPs should incorporate the recommendations
in this document directly into customized WSP guidance materials and tools used in their own settings, e.g.
national WSP training materials. This approach will support WSP teams in understanding how to practically
incorporate equity considerations within the local context, and it will help ensure that WSP teams are not
overburdened with multiple WSP resources.

TO ENCOURAGE STEPWISE IMPROVEMENT IN THE SYSTEMATIC CONSIDERATION OF EQUITY
Full integration of equity considerations into WSPs will likely be a gradual process, as explicit consideration
of social inclusion in water safety planning will be an unfamiliar concept to many initially. Efforts made to
implement any portion of this guidance will bring equity benefits and contribute to a culture of inclusion,
which can be strengthened over time. Just as water safety planning is a process of continuous improvement,
an incremental approach can be taken to applying this guidance to achieve positive equity outcomes.




                                                                                                     Introduction   3
      SECTION 1:
      INTEGRATING EQUITY INTO THE STEPS OF A WSP


      T
           his section explains how to consider equity through the steps of the WSP process and why this is of
           value to the WSP and for achieving equity outcomes. This section is relevant for those developing and
           implementing WSPs (i.e. WSP teams) as well those who support WSP programmes and can directly
      incorporate this guidance into relevant WSP resources. The integration of the guidance in this section into
      national or regional WSP guidance and training materials, for example, will greatly influence and facilitate
      uptake by WSP teams.

      This section includes numerous supporting examples from water supply systems of different sizes and
      resource levels around the world. Many of these examples have been drawn from experiences in Bangladesh,
      Nepal and the Philippines considering equity through WSP development and implementation (see the case
      studies at the end of the document for further details).

      This guidance for equity integration into the WSP process is meant to supplement existing WSP guidance, not
      replace it. The guidance aligns with the Water safety plan manual (WHO & IWA, 2009) and with Water safety
      planning for small community water supplies (WHO, 2012). Guidance is presented according to the five stages
      of a WSP, namely:


                   1.    PREPARATION
                   2.    SYSTEM ASSESSMENT
                   3.    MONITORING
                   4.    MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION
                   5.    FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENT
      These five WSP stages relate to the various steps (tasks or modules) of WSP development as shown in Fig. 1.
      Not all WSP steps shown in Fig. 1 are addressed in this document. Rather, this document addresses only those
      WSP steps that provide a clear opportunity to integrate equity considerations into the process.

      INTEGRATION AT A GL ANCE

       TIP  Aim for stepwise improvement
      Thinking about the social context of a community and the equity outcomes of the WSP process may at first feel unfamiliar
      to WSP team members, but it will get easier with practice. Even if only parts of this guidance can be applied initially due
      to limitations related to time, skill or resources, the WSP team should work towards the progressive implementation of
      additional recommendations over time.




      Equity integration starts with the WSP preparation stage. If the WSP team has ensured equitable and
      meaningful participation of different genders and disadvantaged groups and received appropriate training on
      equity issues, then equity consideration through the process will be more natural and not overly burdensome.

      After WSP preparation, fundamental equity issues can be identified in the second stage of the WSP – system
      assessment. System assessment should include identification of all the different users. Understanding
      diverse water user (and non-user) groups will help the WSP team to identify all hazardous events and
      appropriate control measures, and to develop a comprehensive and equitable improvement plan.

      During the monitoring stage, the WSP team should check whether the control measures are benefiting all
      users equitably and think about how to monitor the satisfaction and water quality of diverse users, particularly
      different genders and disadvantaged groups.

      During the management and communication stage, it will be important for the WSP team to consider what
      actions might be necessary for the emergency response plan and education programmes to meet the diverse
      needs of different genders and disadvantaged groups in particular.

      Finally, the feedback and improvement stage provides an opportunity to review and confirm that equity has
      been integrated into the WSP process, aiming for incremental improvements over time.

      Fig. 2 summarizes how the WSP team can integrate equity considerations into the WSP process. Detailed
      guidance is provided in the following sections.

      ASSEMBLING THE WSP TEAM

      1a. Seek meaningful participation of women, men and disadvantaged groups

      Why is this important?
      Meaningful participation means that all users, particularly women and disadvantaged groups, have choice
      and ability to influence decisions and contribute in ways that are effective and empowering (Halcrow et al.,
      2010). If different genders and disadvantaged groups meaningfully participate in the WSP team, integrating
      equity into the rest of the WSP process will be easier and more effective. Hazards, hazardous events, risks
      and control measures are experienced differently by different groups and are better understood by those
      people that experience them first hand.

      There is evidence that water initiatives are improved through considering different roles, responsibilities
      and equality of men and women (Carrard et al., 2013; Fisher, 2008; O’Reilly, 2010; Van Wijk-Sijbesma, 1998;
      Willetts et al., 2010). Women are often primarily responsible for water management, not only in rural settings,
      but also in urban areas where the water supply system requires active management at the household level,
      e.g. where an intermittent piped supply necessitates storage and/or treatment at home. Therefore, women
      often have first-hand knowledge of issues related to water in the community and/or the household, and their
      participation will help to ensure that all hazardous events are identified and that proposed control measures
      are appropriate.

      Representation of disadvantaged groups, such as people living with disability (PLWD), ethnic minorities or
      informal settlement dwellers, provides access to information on the particular experiences of water for these
      users. This helps ensure that the WSP will meet the needs of all the different user groups.




8   A guide to equitable water safety planning
How to do this?
To ensure meaningful participation in the WSP process, particularly among women and representatives of
disadvantaged groups, the WSP team can:

[    Consult those supporting WSPs nationally or other government staff for information on national
     policies and laws that provide guidance on equitable participation in water service delivery.
[    Remember that meaningful participation begins with awareness; use available tools and
     mechanisms to raise awareness on the WSP and opportunities to participate, e.g. mass media,
     posters/notice boards, community meetings and school curricula.
[    Consider inviting certain groups or individuals to participate in the WSP process, either as a WSP
     team member or an advisor to the team (see tip below). For example, consider reaching out to:
          ~    representatives of existing civil society groups, e.g. women’s groups, PLWD, youth groups,
               the elderly, ethnic groups, or representatives of informal settlements;
          ~    specific individuals who represent different, especially disadvantaged, user groups; and
          ~    representatives of user groups revealed through exploration of community diversity (see Step 2a).
[    Enable all team members to contribute by ensuring the training, mentoring and coaching needed
     for them to feel confident and competent to influence decisions.
[    Ensure times and locations of meetings are appropriate for all members, and ensure the benefits
     of participation outweigh any risks or unnecessary burdens that people may experience as WSP
     team members.

See Boxes 1 and 2 for examples of meaningful participation drivers and practice.




TIP  Consider WSP team advisory roles
Remember that sustained WSP implementation depends on having an active WSP team with appropriate roles and
responsibilities clearly defined. Poorly defined roles and/or unrealistic expectations for member contributions will
adversely impact WSP implementation over time. It is therefore valuable to consider engaging some stakeholders as
advisors to the WSP team for targeted inputs rather than expecting all participants to necessarily support all WSP team
activity over the long term. Advisors’ inputs can be sought at select points during WSP development and implementation
without putting undue demands on participants’ time.




BOX 1  National policy driver for meaningful participation
Reviewing national policy can provide guidance to integrate equity considerations into water safety planning. For example,
the Nepal Rural Water Supply Policy (2004) requires that “the participation of gender, caste and disadvantaged ethnic
groups will be made essential to all decision-making processes regarding water supply…and special emphasis will be
given for their meaningful participation.” Water committees should ensure proportional representation of gender, caste and
disadvantaged ethnic groups, including 50% representation of women.




                                                                       Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   9
       BOX 2  Meaningful participation in practice
       A WSP in Bangladesh involved women in decision-making and, as a result, developed appropriate fixes for tap stands,
       which the women were able to install themselves with minimal tools. As women were the primary water collectors, it
       was important to ensure that women could identify issues with tap stands and fix them quickly. On a WSP team in Nepal,
       half the members were women with direct links with mothers’ groups in the community. The women WSP team members
       passed along information about safe water management to mothers’ group members, who played an important role in
       water management in the community, thereby improving the reach and impact of community education for the WSP.




       1b. Seek training on the importance of considering equity

       Why is this important?
       For many practitioners in the water sector, particularly those with a technical background, engaging with
       the ideas of equity integration into water supply system initiatives may be quite new. Awareness raising and
       training for WSP teams will be important for developing the commitment and skills necessary to implement
       the guidance in this document.

       Ideally, the WSP training initially provided to WSP teams (e.g. by those supporting WSP teams who apply the
       guidance in Section 2) should include basic training on equity considerations. Where this is not the case, or
       where further equity training is needed, WSP teams should proactively request equity training.

       How to do this?
       Training can usually be organized with specialists on equity, including gender and social inclusion, found in:

       [    national government;
       [    national and international NGOs; and
       [    women’s and disadvantaged groups.

       WSP teams, those supporting WSP teams and equity specialists may find the supporting resources listed
       here (see next page) to be useful. In addition, Tool F provides example training materials that may be useful
       in building capacity on integrating equity considerations into water safety planning. The resources listed as
       further reading at the end of this document may also be of value.

       See Box 3 for examples of equity training.




       BOX 3  Raising awareness of equity issues
       As part of a WSP in Bangladesh, WSP programme coordinators conducted training with the WSP team on the importance
       of educating different groups about how to achieve safe water and how to tailor messages and education methods to be
       appropriate for different groups. With knowledge from this training and support from the WSP programme coordinators, the
       WSP team developed safe water management and hygiene promotion messages and approaches for different water user
       groups in the community, also recognizing the specific interests and needs of women and men within these groups (see
       Box 12).

      DESCRIBING THE SYSTEM

       2a. Identify diverse user (and non-user) groups

       Why is this important?
       Both urban and rural communities are made up of a range of diverse water users, and possibly non-users,
       as shown in Fig. 3. For example, there may be wealth disparities, health inequities, gender inequalities and/
       or other forms of disadvantage. This diversity needs to be understood to ensure that all users benefit from
       the WSP. Where community diversity is not explicitly considered as an early activity in the WSP process,
       hazardous events impacting certain disadvantaged groups may be inadvertently overlooked during the risk
       assessment (see Box 4).

       Water initiatives in the past may have focused on engaging with the most easily accessible parts of the
       community or with the more vocal/influential users, for example. Those experiencing pre-existing inequities
       are therefore often left out and left behind while the situation improves for others. Where diversity in the
       community has not been explicitly considered in the design of a water initiative, disadvantaged groups often
       do not receive equal benefits. Furthermore, the water initiatives may not succeed, as they are not appropriate
       or meaningful for all of the community (Halcrow et al., 2010; Willetts et al., 2010; Carrard et al., 2013).

       Identifying the diverse community members, including disadvantaged groups, means that the many different
       ways in which users experience water can be understood. Where the entire community is not served by the
       water supply system, it is important to consider non-users of the system as well as users in order to prompt
       exploration of barriers to access.

       See Box 4 for examples that highlight the importance of considering community diversity.

BOX 4  The need to consider community diversity
A water supplier serving approximately 575 000 consumers in the Philippines inadvertently neglected to consider informal
settlements served by their water supply system when they originally developed their WSP. Rather, the WSP team focused
on the 97% of the population receiving piped water inside the home and did not consider those receiving service to
shared tap stands within informal settlements, where the poorest in the community lived. The particular user experience
associated with this type of service delivery and the associated risks were therefore not addressed by the WSP until
explicit consideration of community diversity brought attention to these system users (over 17 000 people). (Boxes 5
and 6 describe how the informal settlement residents’ unique experiences with water were subsequently identified and
addressed in the WSP.)

In the United States of America, research involving nearly 13 000 drinking-water utilities serving populations of 10 000
or more found significant disparities in Safe Drinking Water Act health violations related to class, ethnicity and race
of populations served (Switzer & Teodoro, 2017). These findings make a clear case for demographic and economic
consideration when prioritizing communities for interventions such as WSPs.




                                                                         Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   13
       How to do this?
       To ensure that no group is inadvertently excluded from the WSP process and its benefits, the WSP team
       should explicitly consider community diversity as part of describing the system. The WSP team will then be
       positioned to consider different experiences with water among these diverse groups (see Step 2b).

       A partial picture of diversity within the community can be initiated through WSP team discussions, as WSP
       team members will likely have some knowledge of areas that are unserved by the water supply; areas with
       higher and lower levels of income; informal settlements; different ethnicities, languages and religions in the
       community; and the like. Ensuring that WSP team members or advisors reflect community diversity (see Step
       1a) will support these early discussions.

       The WSP team should then draw on other sources of information to validate and supplement initial discussions
       on community diversity. Certain information should be readily available through the water supplier, e.g. the
       percentage of the community served by the water supply system. Additional information may be available
       through a recent government census or the work of an NGO. Where WSP team capacity is sufficient, the WSP
       team can supplement and/or validate priority information through a household survey (see Step 2b).

       Information that will contribute to WSP team understanding of community diversity and potential disadvantage
       includes:

       [    Water supply connection: What percentage of the community is served? Who is and is not served?
            What are the reasons for non-use or potential exclusion?
       [    Poverty: How many people live close to or below the poverty line?
       [    Land tenure: How many people live in areas of informal settlements or without housing?
       [    Differently abled: How many people living with a disability are in the community?
       [    Head of household: How many children-, women- or elderly headed households are in the community?
       [    Literacy/education: What are the literacy and education levels in the community?
       [    Other: What other types of community sub-sets exist that may contribute to disadvantage?
       [    Sex: How many males and females or other diverse gender or sexual identity groups are in the
            community?
       [    Age: How many people are, for example, less than 10 years old, between 10 and 50, and older than 50?
       [    Ethnicity and social class: What are all the ethnicities and social classes (where applicable)?
       [    Language: What languages are spoken in the community and how many speakers are there of each?
       [    Religion: What religions exist in the community and how many people identify with each?


       2b. Investigate different user experiences with water

       Why is this important?
       Some water supply system users may be more likely than others to experience unsafe water because of
       their location within the water supply network, type of collection point infrastructure or water use and
       management practices. Perceptions of water quality and/or other aspects of water service delivery (see next
       page) may also differ within a community, impacting the way water is used.




14   A guide to equitable water safety planning
 WATER SERVICE DELIVERY
 The UN human right to water explains and addresses various factors which impact the level of water service delivery and
 are appropriate to consider when exploring different user experiences with water:

 [    Quality/safety: Can the water be consumed over the long term without risk to health?
 [    Accessibility: Is the water supply physically accessible within the vicinity of each household?
 [    Availability: Is the water supply available when needed and in sufficient quantity?
 [    Acceptability: Are all users comfortable with the taste, odour and appearance of the water supply?
 [    Affordability: Are all users able to pay for water connection and service without undue financial burden?




 Knowledge of the diverse range of water user groups (see Step 2a) allows for exploration of diverse
 experiences with water, which will help the WSP team to systematically identify all hazards and hazardous
 events, develop more appropriate and successful control measures, and determine which improvements
 to prioritize to ensure equitable benefit from a WSP. If the experience of access to and management of
 water is not explored for all different groups, hazardous events experienced by disadvantaged users may go
 unnoticed, and the WSP may only benefit part of the community.

 How to do this?
 When describing the water supply system, the WSP team should consider the complete water supply chain
 for different user groups (see Fig. 4), as this will influence users’ experience with water.

 Fig. 4. EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT WATER SUPPLY CHAINS FOR DIFFERENT WATER USERS

 The WSP team should also endeavour to understand diverse users’ experiences with water according to the
 categories shown in Fig. 5. For all diverse groups identified in Step 2a, the WSP team should investigate:

 [    Types of collection point infrastructure (e.g. communal tap stands versus private household
      connections), their locations and operations and maintenance activities.
 [    Water quality at different locations and different types of collection point infrastructure, as well as
      different perceptions of quality, accessibility, availability, acceptability and affordability.
 [    Water practices, which may include collection, transport, household treatment, storage and/or use.
 [    Barriers to participation in ensuring water safety and how they can be overcome.

       Explore these questions for all user groups to identify different or inequitable experiences of water
       and water management. Pay attention to groups such as different ethnicity, social class, religion, income
       level, land tenure, gender, age, PLWD.


       The WSP team members and advisors should begin this investigation by reflecting on their own observations,
       experiences and knowledge related to the questions in Fig. 5. The WSP team should then consult other
       sources to confirm, complete and map (see tip below) the picture of diverse user experiences with water. The
       water supplier should be able to provide information to support this investigation, e.g. data on infrastructure
       and water quality. The health authority or other water supply regulatory agency may also be able to provide
       information.

       Where WSP team capacity is sufficient, the team can supplement and verify available information on diverse
       user experiences by undertaking a household survey designed to explore the topics outlined in Fig. 5.
       Tool D provides an example of a household survey that WSP teams can use to collect information on different
       user experiences with water (and potentially use to validate or supplement the demographic information
       gathered in Step 2a). Household surveys are also an opportunity to inform users about the WSP process,
       share the goals of the WSP, explain how the community can help, and provide information on service levels
       the community should expect so the community can help monitor implementation and outcomes of the WSP
       in later stages.



       TIP  Mapping user experiences
       The WSP team should add the information gathered on user experiences to the water supply system map. This is a useful
       way to record the information, as the pictorial representation of diverse experiences can offer clues on systemic reasons
       for differences and how they can be overcome.




16   A guide to equitable water safety planning
To the extent feasible, the WSP team should disaggregate information gathered on user experiences with
water by appropriate social stratifiers (e.g. land tenure, head of household) and analyse the data to look
for areas of difference. Inequity may exist where one group is experiencing less favourable collection point
infrastructure, has poorer water quality (or perceptions of water quality), is engaging in riskier water practices,
or is experiencing barriers to participation.

See Box 5 for examples of considering diverse user experiences with water to inform water safety planning.




BOX 5  Exploring diverse user experiences with water
To better understand informal settlement water users’ experiences to inform the WSP, an urban WSP team in the Philippines
(see Box 4) designed and conducted a household survey in the informal settlements. The survey revealed several issues
relevant to water safety planning, including:

[    concerns related to affordability of water service, resulting in illegal connections to the piped system;
[    service delivery to shared tap stands marked by heavy use and degrading infrastructure;
[    user practices that included collecting, transporting and storing water at home; and
[    perceptions of poor water quality resulting in the use of unhygienic home filtration or buying bottled water, creating
     an economic burden on poor people who could least afford this extra expense.

In Nepal, a WSP team completed a household survey across all nine wards of their community as part of the system
assessment. They identified the differing demographic situation in the community as well as diverse water user groups and
water use practices across the nine wards. The survey identified several threats to safe water that needed to be addressed
by the WSP. Learnings included differences in the source of drinking-water in different parts of the community and different
practices of water treatment, as shown in the figures below.


     Where do you get your drinking-water ?                                                               Do you treat your water ?

2c. Consider all user experiences when identifying hazardous events

Why is this important?
If the WSP team takes care to consider the full range of user experiences with water for all diverse user groups
when listing hazards and hazardous events, it is likely that additional issues will be identified, including
issues specific to disadvantaged groups that may otherwise have been inadvertently overlooked.


                                                                                                         Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   17
       How to do this?
       The WSP team should systematically think through the various user experiences with water (see Step 2b) (e.g.
       collection point infrastructure, perceived and/or actual water quality and service delivery, water collection
       and storage practices) and consider which hazardous events are associated with that particular user
       experience (see Table 1). The hazardous events identified through this exercise should then be incorporated
       into the WSP’s main table of hazards and hazardous events for subsequent assessment and management
       planning through the WSP process.

       Table 1. EXAMPLES OF HAZARDOUS EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT USER EXPERIENCES


           USER EXPERIENCE                    HAZARDOUS EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EXPERIENCE
                                              Potential contamination from poorly maintained and unsanitary collection area
           Collecting water from a
           public tap stand
                                              Potential contamination from containers used for collecting and storing water

                                              Exposure to contamination when less safe alternative water sources are used
           Perception that the water
           is unsafe
                                              Potential contamination through unsafe household water treatment practices


       Seeking meaningful participation of different genders and disadvantaged groups when building the WSP
       team (Step 1a) will support this activity by ensuring that those with relevant perspectives and experiences
       are included.

       See Box 6 for an example of identifying additional hazardous events through explicit consideration of different
       users’ experiences with water.




       BOX 6  Identifying additional hazardous events specific to certain		
                        user experiences
       When an urban WSP team in the Philippines considered the experience of water users in an informal settlement (see
       Box 5), several hazardous events were added to the WSP that had been inadvertently overlooked during the WSP’s initial
       development. The additional issues identified generally related to the use of public tap stands (rather than the private
       household connections) and difficulties paying water supply system connection fees. The table below lists some of the
       hazardous events that were added to the WSP.


           LOCATION                  HAZARDOUS EVENT
                                     Illegal connections may result in contaminant ingress into the pipe network

                                     Water collection and transport in open containers may result in contamination

                                     Storage of water in open containers or poor hygiene practices in dispensing water (e.g.
           Household
                                     dipping a dirty cup or hand into the container) may result in contamination




18   A guide to equitable water safety planning
                                                                    IMPROVEMENT PLANNING

2d. Consider prioritizing improvements that benefit disadvantaged groups

Why is this important?
Impacts of unsafe water are greater on the most disadvantaged in the community, such as the poorest, PLWD,
children, elderly or pregnant women. For example:

[    When the poor experience unsafe water, it may lead to a relatively greater financial burden or lost
     economic opportunity and/or medical expenses.
[    Children, elderly and PLWD may have less resilient health, leading to higher levels of illness or
     premature mortality associated with contaminated water.

Therefore, hazardous events that disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups should be identified and
prioritized as appropriate to ensure equity outcomes are achieved. Considering and prioritizing disadvantaged
groups during improvement planning can help uncover and address discrimination through the WSP process.

How to do this?
After all hazardous events have been identified and associated risks assessed, the WSP team will need to
take action to manage significant risks. In many cases, limited resources will not allow all significant risks to
be addressed immediately, and it will be necessary to prioritize.

Among the various factors considered when determining priority improvements, the WSP team should consider
which user groups are impacted by the various hazardous events and, as appropriate, consider prioritizing
actions that will benefit the most disadvantaged user groups. For example, the WSP team should ask:

[    Who are the most disadvantaged user groups?
[    Which significant hazardous events affect the most disadvantaged?
[    Are disadvantaged groups disproportionately impacted by the hazardous event?
[    Can improvement actions that will benefit disadvantaged groups be prioritized?

See Box 7 for an example of considering disadvantage when prioritizing improvement actions.




BOX 7  Prioritizing improvements that benefit vulnerable groups
When a community-based organization (CBO) in Bangladesh developed and implemented a WSP in their community,
the first step was to map the water collection points (which were all shared tap stands) and the levels of income in the
community. Community members that were “hard-core poor” (as defined by national policy) were identified through the
mapping process.

Two hazardous events identified through the WSP process were the degradation of the tap stands and the lack of sanitation
facilities in homes near the tap stands. The CBO considered the hard-core poor to be more vulnerable to contamination
resulting from these hazardous events, and funds available for associated improvements were prioritized for this group.
Members of the CBO were proud that their WSP prioritized the needs of the most disadvantaged, noting that the practice
also provided a benefit to everyone in their community: “It is important for the poorer people, as they get more sick. If they
are targeted, their income and wealth and health increases…if certain groups have more income, the overall situation will
improve.” (WSP team member)


                                                                          Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   19
       2e. Identify control measures that address root causes of hazardous events

       Why is this important?
       Investigating and addressing systemic causes of the hazardous events will increase the likelihood that control
       measures address the fundamental issues that contribute to the hazardous event and to discrimination of the
       most disadvantaged. Examples of systemic causes include:

       [    Socioeconomic: People living in poverty, low levels of literacy, no land tenure.
       [    Political: Lack of citizenship or rights as a legal resident.
       [    Institutional: No functioning organizational structures that regulate water supply and ensure access.
       [    Cultural: Ethnicity or caste.

       While it will not always be feasible to address underlying causes of hazardous events within the scope
       of the WSP, root causes should be identified and considered through the WSP process in order to design
       effective control measures. Further, the WSP team can contribute to addressing broader disadvantage by
       raising awareness of the issues, highlighting water safety risk implications and encouraging action.

       How to do this?
       For each hazardous event, the WSP team should:

       [    Explore patterns of exposure to hazardous events across different user groups in order to determine
            underlying or systemic causes.
       [    Identify control measures that address these systemic causes, mitigating any embedded inequity or
            discrimination.

       See Box 8 for an example of addressing systemic disadvantage through water safety planning.




       BOX 8  Identifying and addressing underlying causes of hazardous
                         events
       When an urban WSP team in the Philippines identified hazardous events associated with illegal connections and unsafe
       piping materials in an informal settlement (see Box 6), the WSP team identified and addressed systemic causes.

       While the water supplier is responsible for piping up to the water meter, piping beyond the meter is the responsibility of
       householders. In the informal settlement area, the distance between the meter and the tap was around 100 m or greater,
       whereas in the more affluent areas the distance was significantly less (e.g. 3 m). Households in the informal settlement
       were therefore responsible for installing and maintaining more pipework. In addition, these users tended to use improper
       materials for the piping beyond the meter, resulting in greater risk of contamination.

       Understanding the root cause of exposure to these hazardous events allowed the WSP team to design effective and
       equitable control measures. The WSP team proposed placing the meters closer to the points of water use, thereby reducing
       the pipeline installation and maintenance burden and the risk of poorer households using low-quality materials for piping
       to the home. The team also suggested offering a service to users for repair of household piping with a fee to be included
       as part of bill payment.




20   A guide to equitable water safety planning
2f. Assess proposed control measures for positive or negative equity outcomes

Why is this important?
Some control measures have the potential to directly impact people, particularly control measures related
to the catchment level or the consumer level of the water supply system. Assessing the human impact of
proposed control measures, especially for the most disadvantaged, is important because:

[    Control measures may cause unintentional harm or discrimination, particularly to those most
     disadvantaged. For example, removing illegal connections without exploring alternative connection
     options may present a burden to poor householders unable to afford service fees.
[    Equitable control measures contribute to WSP effectiveness, as people are more likely to follow
     control measures that do not contribute to disadvantage. For example, restricting farming activity
     within a catchment without considering and addressing impacts on livelihoods may result in non-
     compliance with the control measure and ineffective risk management.

How to do this?
If the WSP team considers the potential impact of relevant control measures (see tip below) on different
stakeholder groups, the WSP team can anticipate when a control measure may cause harm or disadvantage.
The WSP team can then pursue an alternative control measure, modify the control measure or consider
compensation measures to avoid any unintentional discrimination.




TIP  Recognize relevant control measures
Not every control measure will need to be assessed for equity impacts. This guidance is especially relevant for control
measures that directly impact people, e.g. those applied in the catchment or at the consumer level. An equity assessment is
unlikely to be necessary for technical control measures, such as those applied at the treatment plant or main distribution lines.




For each relevant control measure proposed, the WSP team should ask:

[    Will the control measure provide equitable benefit?
[    Are there any potential negative consequences of the control measure to any stakeholder group?
[    Are there alternatives, modifications or compensation measures for any control measure that is
     expected to cause harm or inequitable benefit?
[    Are different control measures needed for different users based on their unique needs?

Table 2 presents examples of equity assessment questions. See Box 9 for examples of designing equitable
and effective control measures.




                                                                           Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   21
       Table 2. EXAMPLE QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE AND ENSURE EQUITABLE CONTROL MEASURES

         CATCHMENT
         Some catchment control measures will directly impact people and would thus benefit from an equity assessment.
         For example, if restricting farming operations near a water intake is proposed, the following equity questions could
         be explored: How can disadvantage to farmers be avoided? Is there a form of compensation that could be offered to
         farmers? Can farming practices be changed to reduce hazards? Are different control measures needed to account for
         any diversity within the group of farmers, depending on their gender, age, etc.?

         CONSUMER
         Most control measures associated with hazardous events at the consumer level will benefit from an equity
         assessment. For example, if removal of illegal connections is proposed, an equity assessment could ask: What is
         driving the illegal connections? What will be the impact of removing the illegal connections on those who have
         connected illegally? Can solutions be found in which those needing water can still access water?




       BOX 9  Designing equitable and effective control measures
       In Australia, cattle grazing near a river offtake was identified through the WSP process as a high risk to source water quality.
       The WSP team identified the need for additional fencing to protect the riparian buffer zone. Recognizing the potential adverse
       impact of the fencing on ranchers whose cattle were dependent on access to the river, the water supplier also provided an
       off-stream watering system to fill troughs for the livestock. In China, the impact of rice farming on source water quality was
       identified as a critical threat to water quality and quantity. Recognizing that imposing restrictions on rice farming would
       significantly impact livelihoods, farmers were offered compensation to change their crop from rice to corn – a lower impact
       crop. Cost savings related to increased water yield and improved water quality exceeded the costs of compensating the farmers.
       In Brazil, where sedimentation from eroding catchment areas impacted surface water supplies, farmers were compensated to
       reforest and terrace their fields using revenue from water tariffs. In Germany, water suppliers and farmers commonly engage
       in cooperation agreements to manage pesticide and nitrate levels in source waters. Topics covered under these agreements
       include consultations on water-protective application of fertilizers and financial support for intercropping.

       Source: Protecting surface water for health (WHO, 2016a).

       A WSP team in Nepal determined that contaminated water collection containers, unhygienic user practices at tap stands and
       contamination by human waste represented significant risks and required action. The team identified possible control measures
       and assessed which control measures would have more positive, equitable outcomes in the community, as shown below.

2g. Ensure equitable communication and participation in control measure
selection and implementation

Why is this important?
The success and sustainability of some control measures will depend on the awareness, support and/or
participation of different stakeholders, particularly those control measures applied at the catchment or
consumer levels of the water supply system. Developing appropriate communication methods and facilitating
meaningful participation for all appropriate groups will increase the success of these control measures. It
will also help ensure that no group is discriminated against by being denied access to information or the
opportunity to participate.

How to do this?
Communication: Where proposed control measures depend on community awareness, buy-in and/or
participation, the WSP team should seek feedback from the community on the most appropriate control
measures. The WSP team should also ensure that control measures are communicated to all groups equally.
This involves informing all different stakeholders about the control measures that are being implemented and
why they are important in ways that are meaningful and accessible to each group.

For each control measure, the WSP team should consider what needs to be communicated to the community
and how to best communicate it to diverse groups, e.g. those with different languages, education levels,
mobility and places to access the information.

Participation: The WSP team should consider what opportunities there are for diverse groups to participate
in control measure implementation.

For each control measure, the WSP team should consider if the community can be involved in its
implementation. If an opportunity exists for community participation, consider how to offer this role to
different groups equitably, particularly thinking about gender and disadvantaged groups. Consider if any
education activities need to be conducted to enable participation.

See Box 10 for an example of an inclusive approach to control measure implementation.




BOX 10  Inclusive participation in control measure implementation
Through WSP implementation in Bangladesh, the education of tap stand caretakers was identified as a way to prevent
collection point contamination. Both male and female caretakers were trained to create equal opportunity for participation.
Trainers recognized that many women were not experienced in public roles in the community and were not as knowledgeable
or comfortable with the technical aspects of tube well maintenance. The training aimed to address this gap to ensure that
both women and men developed the skills and confidence needed to carry out the role. Also, and importantly, care was
taken to ensure that the requirements of managing the tap stands did not place an unfair burden on women in terms of
time required or uncomfortable status in the community (which depends very much on the individual). The approach taken
served to optimize WSP effectiveness and contribute to improved gender equality in the community.

To facilitate wider community participation in the management of the tap stands, visual monitoring tools were created to
reflect the community’s diverse literacy levels.

       OPERATIONAL MONITORING

       3a. Monitor control measure effectiveness to ensure equitable benefit

       Why is this important?
       By monitoring control measure effectiveness for all intended beneficiaries, the WSP team can ensure that
       the benefit of control measures is achieved for all. If the WSP team does not consider all user groups during
       monitoring, the benefit may be limited to certain user groups only, while others may continue to experience
       unsafe water.

       How to do this?
       By this stage in the WSP process, the WSP team will be aware of the diverse user groups, especially the
       disadvantaged, and how control measures may impact different user groups. When developing and
       implementing the operational monitoring programme, the WSP team should:

       [    Note the intended beneficiaries of each control measure.
       [    Confirm that the control measures are in place and experienced equally by all the intended
            beneficiaries.

       The scenarios described (see next page) are intended to illustrate the importance of monitoring for equitable
       control measure benefit.

SCENARIOS HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO CONSIDER EQUITY IN
OPERATIONAL MONITORING
REMOTE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED BY CHLORINE
A water supplier ensures microbial safety of the water supply by maintaining a chlorine residual throughout the pipe
network of at least 0.2 mg/L, which is confirmed through regular operational monitoring. However, explicit consideration
of diverse groups in the community reveals that water quality monitoring locations have not been established at certain
remote locations in the network that serve low-income housing. Subsequent monitoring at these locations reveals
inadequate chlorine levels due to the distance from the water treatment plant and highlights a need for chlorine booster
stations to ensure equitable protection from microbial hazards.

EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS DO NOT REACH ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
A WSP team implements a community awareness campaign on safe water practices using posters and pamphlets.
However, monitoring of user practices reveals little or no behaviour change in some neighbourhoods. By asking questions
of community members, the WSP team learns that low levels of literacy have prevented many from reading the pamphlets
and posters. WSP team members are advised to present at neighbourhood meetings and engage teachers to deliver
water safety messages instead of disseminating pamphlets in order to ensure that all groups benefit from the community
education efforts.




                                                   VERIFYING WSP EFFECTIVENESS

3b. Monitor water quality and consumer satisfaction for all user groups

Why is this important?
As part of verifying the effectiveness of the WSP, the WSP team should regularly undertake compliance
monitoring of water quality as experienced by each user group and communicate results to ensure that:

[    All users have access to safe water.
[    All users are aware of their water quality to inform their water practices, e.g. household treatment.

In addition to compliance monitoring, regular assessment of consumer satisfaction among all user groups will
help the WSP team understand perceptions of water quality and service delivery throughout the community.
If the WSP team only monitors the satisfaction of those who represent the majority of users or have easy
access to the WSP team, the concerns of the most disadvantaged may go unnoticed.




                                                                      Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   25
       How to do this?
       Where WSP team capacity is limited, monitoring to verify WSP effectiveness can be undertaken by the
       surveillance authority or other supporting agency.

       Compliance monitoring: Regular water quality testing to confirm compliance with drinking-water quality
       standards should be conducted across sites representative of all different collection point infrastructure
       types and all diverse user groups, ensuring that the most vulnerable areas and users of the system are
       included. The results should be communicated back to all diverse users in ways accessible to all.

       Consumer satisfaction: Consumer use of, and satisfaction with, the water supply is also an important
       indicator of WSP effectiveness. Consumer complaints should be investigated equitably. The WSP team should
       regularly survey all different user groups on perceptions of water quality and satisfaction with service. The
       household survey presented in Tool D can be used to monitor consumer satisfaction.

       Satisfaction surveys should be designed to collect demographic data on users (e.g. gender, age, PLWD,
       ethnicity, location, income level), and the WSP team should disaggregate survey responses by gender and
       other social stratifiers and analyse the data to look for areas of difference in user perceptions. Inequity may
       exist where one group has more concerns and/or is less satisfied with the water quality or service. Questions
       the WSP team could consider to help ensure an equitable experience of safe water include:

       [    What did lower income users think verses higher income users?
       [    What did the women think? How was that different from what the men thought?
       [    What did the young think? How did that compare with the views of the elderly or middle-aged?

       See Box 11 for examples of inclusive compliance monitoring and assessment of user satisfaction.




       BOX 11  Inclusive monitoring of water quality and user satisfaction
       In Portugal, when a structured process was introduced to allow all water supply system users to register complaints,
       consumer feedback increased significantly. Prior to these changes, an average of just 45 complaints were received per
       year. Once users had access to a low-cost and user-friendly mechanism to share their concerns and claim their rights, the
       number of complaints grew to more 3000 in a year, highlighting the importance of giving all water users a voice.

       Source: No one left behind (United Nations, 2012).

       A consumer survey conducted in an informal settlement area by an urban water supplier in the Philippines found that
       one third of those surveyed were buying bottled water for drinking due to a perception that tap water was unsafe. This
       practice placed a financial burden on those in the informal settlement, who could least afford the extra cost of bottled
       water. Informed by the survey results, the WSP team decided to begin a compliance monitoring programme in the informal
       settlement to assure users of the water quality. The results of this monitoring were to be shared with the community so that
       users would feel comfortable consuming tap water where its safety could be confirmed.

                                     SUPPORTING PROGRAMMES

 4a. Consider all groups when developing communication plans

 Why is this important?
 Considering different user groups is critical when developing emergency response plans. For example,
 plans to advise consumers to boil water during a contamination event should consider how to effectively
 communicate with people who speak a different language, do not have a television or radio, have lower
 literacy levels or have a hearing or seeing disability. Without due consideration of diversity among users,
 critical safety messages may fail to reach everyone.

 Communication and education programme development more broadly should also take into account the
 specific needs and interests of different stakeholder groups. For example, the content and method of delivering
 education materials on catchment protection or safe household water practices must be accessible to all
 relevant stakeholders to ensure effectiveness and equitable benefit.




                                                                  Section 1 | Integrating equity into the steps of a WSP   27
       How to do this?
       When developing emergency response plans, consider:

       [    How will critical messages be delivered to consumers during an emergency situation?
       [    Are there any user groups who may be excluded from this communication method, and how could they be
            reached?
       [    Which users are the most vulnerable to water supply system emergencies, and what is the best way to
            communicate with them?
       [    Can the proposed remedial actions (e.g. boiling) be implemented by all user groups?
       [    If alternative water supplies will be provided, will they be accessible to all user groups?

       When developing communication and education programmes more broadly, consider:

       [    How best to communicate to different stakeholders, e.g. women, men, boys, girls, elderly, different
            ethnicities and PLWD? For example, are graphics needed for members of the community with lower
            literacy levels, or larger fonts for those with poor vision?
       [    What are the languages and levels of literacy among stakeholders?
       [    What are all the different mechanisms for communicating (e.g. word of mouth, text message, meter
            reader, community leaders, local radio, television, individual notices, posters)? Who has access to
            these mechanisms and who might be missing out? How can those missing out be reached?

       See Box 12 for examples highlighting the importance of inclusive communication plans.



       BOX 12  Inclusive and effective communication plans
       During an outbreak of Escherichia coli in Canada, a boil water advisory was issued via local AM and FM radio only; no television
       advisory was released and door-to-door notification was not pursued. This limited communication approach proved ineffective
       at promptly reaching all community members with critical water safety messages, and it contributed to the outbreak reaching
       tragic proportions. Ultimately, seven deaths and 2300 cases of gastrointestinal illness (dozens with potentially lifelong health
       implications) were reported among the community’s 5000 residents. Consumers made more vulnerable by age (children
       and the elderly) were disproportionately affected. A more inclusive and effective communication plan that included special
       consideration for particularly vulnerable consumers would likely have helped to control the public health impact of this
       contamination event.

       Source: Water safety plans – training package (WHO & IWA, 2012).

       A WSP team in Bangladesh considered the reasons for exclusion experienced in their community in order to address them
       when designing community education programmes: “We ask … what is the root of exclusion? We have to work from there first.
       … We then target different groups differently … We used loud speakers travelling in the community, discussion groups in the
       mosque, and rallies and those sorts of things to ensure no one is excluded”.

       The WSP team recognized different ways to raise awareness among men and women. In order to engage men, the WSP team
       trained tea stall owners to deliver safe water messages to the men who visited daily. In addition, a survey was conducted to
       find the most disadvantaged tea stall owners and prioritize their engagement with the WSP behaviour change communication.
       Safe water education for women was undertaken at tube wells and in the home, where women are primarily responsible for
       water management. Women caretakers of the tube wells promoted safe water management amongst their neighbours.

       Education materials tailored for specific stakeholder groups included cartoon books for school students, cups and posters for
       (male) tea stall holders, pictorial monitoring checklists for (female) tube well caretakers, and a simple five-point message mass
       awareness campaign for safe water management. Education materials used simple pictures to reach all in the community,
       especially those with lower literacy levels.

                                             REVIEWING AND REVISING THE WSP

5a. Strengthen equity integration during ongoing review and revision

Why is this important?
A WSP is a living document that should undergo continuous review and improvement. Each cycle of review
and revision provides an opportunity for the WSP team to strengthen the WSP and its implementation in
practice, including the effective integration of equity considerations.

As explicit consideration of social inclusion in water safety planning may be unfamiliar to many WSP teams
initially, addressing all of the guidance in this document during a WSP’s original development may not be
feasible. Rather, WSP teams will often need to take an iterative approach, addressing equity to the extent
feasible with available resources and capacity, and continuing to strengthen equity integration and outcomes
over time through the WSP review process.

How to do this?
Continuous strengthening of equity integration into water safety planning can be achieved by including a
simple equity assessment as part of the regular WSP review process. Refer to Table 3 for an example checklist
to assess equity integration into the WSP. This checklist can be modified to reflect the particular equity
guidance and targets adopted in the local context, as illustrated in Tool C.

ADDRESSING EQUIT Y IN BROADER WSP
PROGRAMME ACTIVITIES


T
     hose who promote or support WSPs globally, regionally, nationally and subnationally have an essential role
     to play in mainstreaming equity considerations into WSP programmes. Examples of how these stakeholders
     can encourage and support equity consideration in water safety planning are provided below.


GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ACTIVITIES
Those supporting WSPs globally or regionally can foster more equitable and sustainable WSP outcomes by:

[    Ensuring that global and regional WSP guidance materials, tools and training workshops promote
     good equity practice as described in Section 1. (See Boxes 13 and 14. Also refer to Tool F for training
     materials that can be used to integrate equity into a WSP training workshop.)
[    Encouraging monitoring of equity practice and outcomes by promoting appropriate indicators,
     tools and mechanisms to monitor equity inputs to and outcomes of water safety planning. Monitoring
     should collect data disaggregated by appropriate social stratifiers. (See Box 15. Also refer to Tool D
     for an example of a household survey that can be customized to include priority indicators and collect
     disaggregated data.)




BOX 13  Standardized WSP training package to address equity
A general WSP training package is currently under development by WHO (anticipated for publication in 2020). The
standardized WSP training materials, which will apply globally and are intended to be adapted and used directly by national
or subnational WSP trainers, will include messages to prompt trainers to consider equity at key points in the WSP process.




BOX 14  Promoting equity consideration in regional and global WSP
                  training workshops
At a South-East Asia regional WSP master trainer workshop convened in Thailand in 2014, equity experts were engaged
to prepare and present general equity awareness-raising material as well as specific suggestions for equity integration
into relevant WSP steps. The objective was to sensitize national WSP trainers from the seven participating countries on the
importance of explicit consideration of equity in urban water safety planning and to demonstrate where and how equity
could be systematically addressed. The training materials presented in Tool F are based on the materials developed for this
regional training event.

In 2017, an urban WSP training-of-trainers workshop was held to strengthen the WSP training skillset of a group of WSP
experts from countries around the world. The event was attended by WSP experts from 19 countries representing Africa,
Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Central and South-East Asia, and North and South America. Based on guidance
provided by equity experts, the training materials delivered by the workshop facilitators highlighted the importance of
identifying all different types of users (and non-users) of water supply systems at the start of the WSP process to ensure
equitable WSP outcomes and benefits for all.


                                                          Section 2 | Addressing equity in broader WSP programme activities   31
         BOX 15  Monitoring tools that address equity
         The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) 2018 survey – a global WASH
         monitoring instrument – includes numerous indicators that address equity in WASH. For example, the monitoring instrument
         explores the extent to which disadvantaged groups are addressed in WASH programme planning and delivery and allows
         for disaggregation by various potential contributors to disadvantage (e.g. poverty, ethnic minority status, geographic
         remoteness, physical disabilities, health vulnerabilities).

         The equitable access score-card (United Nations, 2013) was developed under the United Nations Economic Commission
         for Europe (UNECE)/WHO Regional Office for Europe Protocol on Water and Health for adaptation and use by countries in
         the pan-European region. The score-card was designed to support a process of country self-assessment of progress in
         achieving the human right to water and sanitation. It includes indicators on mechanisms to identify and address water and
         sanitation needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups, as well as indicators on budget allocations to address these needs.




         NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL ACTIVITIES
         To ensure the integration of equity into WSP programmes within a country, those supporting WSPs nationally
         or subnationally should focus on the seven key areas summarized in Fig. 6. Good practice examples related
         to these focus areas are presented in Box 16.

BOX 16  Good practice examples for those supporting national and
                   subnational WSP programmes
POLICY 
Understanding government laws and policies related to equity in water service provision: National (or international)
laws and policies can provide significant guidance, impetus and even resources for integrating equity into water safety
planning. For example, in the pan-European region, all Parties to the UNECE/WHO Regional Office for Europe Protocol on
Water and Health are legally committed to provide equitable access to water for all members of the population, especially
those who suffer disadvantage or social exclusion (United Nations, 2012). Through the Magna Carta of Women 2009
(Philippines Gender Law), the Philippines Government requires all government agencies to designate 5% of their annual
budget for gender and development activities, which provides a great opportunity for supporting equity integration. The
Framework for Monitoring Realization of the Rights to Water and Sanitation in Kenya notes the need to demonstrate
progressive allocation of funding for highly disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, with the aim of making up for long-
standing marginalization of these groups (Government of Kenya, 2017). Nepal’s Rural Water Supply Policy (Government
of Nepal, 2004) recognizes the different roles and responsibilities of women and men in relation to water collection,
time availability of individuals based on their gender roles, vulnerability of the poor in relation to water access, and
appropriate methods of raising awareness based on differences within the community. The Republic of the Marshall
Islands’ National Water and Sanitation Policy has a monitored objective to target the disadvantaged, defined as “those
living in or with extreme poverty, severe disability due to age, disease, injury or other causes, disaster or conflict-affected
households, significantly adverse ground conditions (necessitating expensive construction), or lack of space for private
facilities” (Kohlitz et al., 2016). (See Tool B for an example of a national legal/policy analysis intended to leverage support
for prioritizing equity in water safety planning.)


KNOWLEDGE 
Seeking knowledge and experience on equity, including gender and social inclusion: Engaging with relevant local
experts can help ensure due consideration of equity in water safety planning. Ethiopia’s One WASH National Program notes
that the Women’s Affairs Directorate is responsible for conducting orientation sessions to support gender equity in WASH
programmes, and a Gender Mainstreaming Guideline has been developed to support equity training (Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia, 2013). Bangladesh rolled out its rural WSP programme in collaboration with a development partner
due to the partner’s knowledge of and commitment to equity outcomes, including those related to gender and poverty. In
Nepal, staff responsible for gender and social inclusion in the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation were included
in WSP training teams.


MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION 
Encouraging the influence of women, men and disadvantaged groups in decision-making for WSP coordination
and within the broader water sector: To improve water service delivery, those supporting WSPs should encourage
more qualified female professionals and professionals from disadvantaged groups to participate in decision-making (ADB,
DFID, WB, 2012; ADB, 2014). Existing national laws and policies may provide impetus to prioritize meaningful participation.
For example, to track progress of professional women and disadvantaged groups, the Nepal WASH sector reports on
workforce diversity in the government department responsible for water service delivery (Government of Nepal, 2011). In
the Philippines, the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973 requires the district boards of directors to include at least one
female representative on each five-person panel.


GUIDANCE/TRAINING 
Ensuring local WSP guidance and training programmes integrate equity considerations: Tailoring the
recommendations in this document to the specific country context and incorporating recommendations into local WSP
guidelines and training programmes is essential to mainstreaming equity integration into water safety planning. This
process might involve using local terms for gender and equity. In Nepal, equity is referred to as GESI – gender equality and
social inclusion. Tool C provides an example of a WSP equity guide from Nepal, which has tailored the general guidance in




                                                           Section 2 | Addressing equity in broader WSP programme activities      33
        BOX 16 (continued) 
        this document to reflect the steps and structure of Nepal’s particular WSP approach and guidelines. Nepal’s equity guide
        can be easily printed and provided to WSP team members as part of local WSP training and support activities. It can also
        be used to inform the modification of WSP training programmes to incorporate equity considerations. See Tool F for example
        training materials on equity in water safety planning.


        SITE SELECTION 
        Site selection that supports equitable access: An important consideration in deciding where to implement WSPs is
        the potential for the WSP to improve access to safe water for those most disadvantaged. In Bangladesh, equity was a
        core criterion in selecting sites for rural WSPs. WSP programme coordinators specified that NGO partners supporting WSP
        activities should select areas with hard-to-reach populations in addition to areas with a lack of access to safe water. In
        Nepal’s Rural Water Supply Policy (Government of Nepal, 2004), a commitment is made to provide a basic level of water
        supply to all on a priority basis, especially targeted to remote and ethnic groups. National government site selection criteria
        for any water supply project in Nepal includes poverty, availability and condition of existing water supply, incidence of
        diarrhoea and prevalence of water-related diseases. Elsewhere, national water quality assessments have been undertaken
        that provide a sound basis for prioritizing sites for WASH interventions.2 In Serbia, for example, a national assessment of
        small-scale water supplies in rural areas found one third of systems to be non-compliant with microbiological standards.
        By comparison, urban water supply systems showed a compliance of 96% for microbiological parameters during the same
        year, highlighting a significant urban-rural disparity and a need for targeted attention to rural sites for WASH interventions
        (WHO, 2017). In the Republic of Moldova, a study of all schools found that 50% of pupils were exposed to drinking-water
        that did not meet microbiological and chemical standards, indicating a critical need for improved WASH in schools (WHO,
        2016b).


        BUDGET 
        Budget allocation that includes equity considerations: WSP effectiveness and equitable outcomes can be optimized by
        making budget decisions that reflect an understanding of the practical barriers posed by financial disadvantage in WSP
        implementation. When allocating budgets for WSP development and implementation, national WSP programme coordinators
        in Nepal made specific budget allocations for rural WSPs, recognizing relative disadvantage in poorer rural areas. A budget
        of US$ 1000 was provided for system improvements at each rural WSP. Similarly, the Government of Scotland instituted a
        small-scale water supply systems grant scheme to assist with capital improvements required to ensure safe water delivery
        in order that rural consumers were not disadvantaged by financial barriers (WHO, 2016c).


        MONITORING 
        Monitoring and evaluation that includes equity outcomes: Monitoring equity inputs to and outcomes from WSPs will
        serve to highlight successes and opportunities to strengthen equitable water safety planning. Nepal’s Rural Water Supply
        Policy (Government of Nepal, 2004) articulates how community-based monitoring (e.g. participatory monitoring and
        community self-monitoring) will be actively supported to ensure equitable access to services and to ensure involvement
        in water and sanitation management and decision-making by people disadvantaged on the basis of gender, caste and
        ethnicity. In addition, project impact will be measured through pre- and post-project assessments using sex-disaggregated
        indicators. Ethiopia’s One WASH National Program indicates that gender disaggregated indicators will be used where
        relevant to track gender equity in WASH programme roles and benefits (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 2013). In
        Kenya, a national WASH monitoring framework includes indicators on: the implementation of pro-poor water policies; and
        operationalizing policies encouraging participation of local communities in water and sanitation management (Government
        of Kenya, 2017).


        2
         Data presented in WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) reports can also be used to identify
        areas critically lacking in safely managed drinking-water to broadly inform site selection for WASH interventions (WHO & UNICEF, 2017; UNICEF &
        WHO, 2018).

        Below is an overview of equity-related concepts and terms for readers of this guidance. These pages can also
        be reproduced and shared with participants of training events that are based on this guidance.

        HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER AND SANITATION
        The human right to water and sanitation means providing services that are safe, affordable, acceptable,
        accessible and available to all different users, without discrimination. In water safety planning, this means
        ensuring that equitable
        benefits are experienced by            Non-discrimination: The legal principle of non-discrimination prohibits the
        all, including women, men,             less favourable treatment of individuals or groups or the detrimental impact on
        and people of different ages,          such individuals or groups based on ethnicity, sex, religion or other status. In

        VULNERABLE, MARGINALIZED AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS
        The terms vulnerable, marginalized and disadvantaged are often used interchangeably, and in many cases
        they do overlap. However, there are important distinctions:

        Vulnerable indicates a trait or characteristic of a person which             Marginalized describes people who
        makes that person at risk to harm or injury (physical and/or                 lack access to services, in this case

        Both vulnerability and marginalization can result in disadvantage. A person who is vulnerable has special
        needs. A person who is marginalized experiences inequality. This guidance describes how to identify
        disadvantaged groups as part of the WSP process.

        EQUITY, EQUALITY AND GENDER EQUALITY
        Equity is the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups
        are defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically (WHO, 2019a). For WSPs, this means
        that all groups should have the opportunity for meaningful participation in, and equitable benefit from, water
        safety planning.

        Equity seeks to ensure that everyone receives safe drinking-water, while recognizing existing differences in
        the community. Treating everyone the same will not necessarily result in safe water being provided to all,
        since not all start from the same place and their needs and interests are different. Equity, as described in this
        guidance, takes these differences into account.

        Equality is a term sometimes used interchangeably with equity, however there is an important difference.
        Non-discrimination and equality are fundamental principles of human rights law, and therefore “equality” is
        a legally defined term and a binding principle under law. By contrast, “equity” is a moral imperative open to
        interpretation, and its lack of legal clarity can reduce the potential for accountability from duty bearers who
        are responsible for ensuring equality and human rights for all. There is growing use of the term “equality”
        in place of “equity” in relation to the human right to water, since it emphasizes the legal obligation of

progressively realizing this human right. In this guidance, the term “equity” is used, as the focus is primarily
on taking steps to meet differential needs rather than claiming rights from duty bearers.

Gender equality is the absence
of discrimination on the basis of a         Sex: Female and male biological and physiological characteristics.

benefits, or in access to services
(WHO, 2019b).

Gender equality means that rights and opportunities will not depend on gender. In water safety planning and
other drinking-water initiatives, gender equality requires promoting participation and outcomes that address
the different but equally important needs and hopes of people of different genders.


This document includes gender considerations within its use of the term “equity”. Explicit mention of gender or
gender equality is selectively included to draw attention where consideration of gender equality is particularly important,
but it is implied throughout the document.




SOCIAL INCLUSION AND MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION
Social inclusion involves thinking about ways of involving representatives of all groups in a community,
whether rural or urban, and encouraging their meaningful participation in the WSP process. This includes
women, men, boys, girls and disadvantaged groups. Different members of a community have different
needs, priorities and knowledge because of factors such as their status, age, health or gender roles and
responsibilities.

Participation is more than providing labour or attending meetings (Halcrow et al., 2010). Meaningful
participation in a WSP requires all different members of a community, especially disadvantaged groups, to
have a choice and ability to contribute to decision-making for WSP development and implementation in ways
that are effective and empowering.

        TOOL B: EXAMPLE EQUIT Y POLICY REVIEW
        It is important to understand laws and policies related to equity in water service provision as they may
        provide important guidance, impetus and even resources for integrating equity into water safety planning.
        For example, laws and policies that reflect a national commitment to the human right to water and sanitation
        can provide a legal foundation to support the integration of equity considerations into WSPs.

        Below is an example of such an analysis. Outcomes from a review of national laws and policies in the
        Philippines highlight the commitment to equity which can be leveraged to promote equity in water safety
        planning.

            LEGAL/POLICY INSTRUMENT AND RELEVANT PROVISIONS
            THE MAGNA CARTA OF WOMEN 2009 (PHILIPPINES GENDER LAW)
            [   Comprehensive law encompassing numerous aspects relevant to promoting the rights of women and gender
                equality in the Philippines – based on internationally agreed human rights principles.
            [   Contains a section on institutional mechanisms for gender mainstreaming which includes the provision that
                agencies (including local government) must allocate 5% of their budget to gender and development (GAD)
                programmes.
            [   Specifies that investment in GAD should be annually monitored and evaluated in terms of its success in
                influencing the gender-responsive implementation of agency programmes funded by the remaining 95% budget.
            [   Refers to the Women in Development and Nation Building Act (1991) requirement that 5–30% of official
                development assistance should be directed to GAD activities.
            [   Requires the creation and/or strengthening of GAD focal points by all departments “to catalyse and
                accelerate gender mainstreaming within the agency or local government unit”.
            [   Requires all agencies to implement a GAD focal point system involving senior staff, an executive and a
                technical working group comprising representatives from across the agency.

            WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT AND NATION BUILDING ACT 1991
            An Act administered by the National Economic and Development Agency that preceded the Philippines Gender Law,
            establishing the high-level objective to achieve “fundamental equality before the law of women and men”. The Act
            aims to achieve three primary policy outcomes:
            [   A “substantial portion” of official development assistance funds be invested in programmes and activities for
                women.
            [   All government agencies ensure women benefit from, and participate directly in, development programmes.
            [   All government agencies revise regulations and related policy instruments to remove gender bias.

            PROVINCIAL WATER UTILITIES ACT - PD 198 OF 1973, SECTION 8
            Requires that women are represented on boards of directors: “The Board of Directors of a district shall be composed
            of five citizens of the Philippines who are of voting age and residents within the district. Board members are to
            be representatives of (1) civic-oriented service clubs, (2) business, commercial, or financial organizations, (3)
            educational or religious institutions, (4) professionals and (5) women’s organizations” (emphasis added).

            MAGNA CARTA FOR DISABLED 1992
            Details state commitments to support the total well-being of disabled persons and their integration into mainstream
            society. There is no specific mention of water or sanitation services.

            PHILIPPINES’ 1976 WATER CODE
            Exempts basic water uses (drinking, cooking, bathing, and other domestic or household uses) from requiring any
            form of permit, and in doing so implicitly recognizes the fundamental right to water for all.

            1997 INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS ACT
            Recognizes customary water rights of indigenous communities.

        TOOL D: EXAMPLE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY
        A household survey can be utilized for multiple purposes in development, implementation, monitoring and
        evaluation of a WSP. In terms of equity integration, household surveys can help to:

        [     identify diverse groups within the community;
        [     identify opportunities for all different types of water users to participate and influence decisions in
              relation to the provision of safe water;
        [     investigate different user groups’ experiences with water, including exposure to hazardous events;
        [     monitor consumer satisfaction; and
        [     monitor equity outcomes over time.

        The example household survey below combines aspects of customer satisfaction, system assessment and
        impact assessment. The survey gathers experiences of diverse water user groups in relation to collection
        point infrastructure, water quality and service delivery, water practices and participation.

        This example survey should be adapted and revised for use in other contexts, bearing in mind the household
        survey tips provided in Tool E.

        TOOL E: HOUSEHOLD SURVEY TIPS
        These simple tips are intended to inform the process of designing and carrying out household surveys, as
        appropriate, to collect information on diverse groups within a community and their experiences with water.
        This guidance is not comprehensive and is intended to provide basic considerations and tips as a starting
        point only. The topics covered are:


            how to design an effective                 who to include in                 good practice tips for the

        HOW TO DESIGN AN EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE SURVEY
        It may not be necessary to design a household survey from scratch. A good starting point, therefore, is to
        explore relevant survey instruments already available that can be reviewed and adapted for use.

        When designing (or adapting) the household survey, consider the particular objectives, for example:

        [     identify diverse groups within the community;
        [     identify opportunities for all different types of water users to participate and influence decisions in
              relation to the provision of safe water;
        [     investigate different user groups’ experiences with water, including exposure to hazardous events;
        [     monitor consumer satisfaction; and
        [     monitor equity outcomes over time.

        It is important to prepare a survey that is appropriate for the community, ensuring that the questions are clear
        and relevant and use appropriate language for the local context. Take care to avoid questions that are overly
        personal or sensitive in order to ensure a comfortable and positive experience for interviewees. Appropriate
        questions will vary according to the local context.

        WHO TO INCLUDE IN THE SURVEY
        A community is made up of different water users with different needs and interests. The survey should gather
        information on all of these different perspectives.

        Planning
        [     With the survey team, identify if there are different types of people living in the community. Ensure
              that the survey is conducted in all different parts of the community and includes different types of
              people. Consider differences such as:
                   ~     distance from the centre of town            ~     sexual and gender minorities
                   ~     income levels                               ~     religion
                   ~     ethnicity                                   ~     land ownership
                   ~     social class                                ~     types of water supply connection.
        [     An easy way to plan the survey process is to use local government structures (e.g. villages/wards) to
              assign the survey team to different parts of the community.
        [     Collect information on population served in various areas, number of connections, type of coverage, etc.
              to make sampling decisions and allocate survey teams to different areas.


44   A guide to equitable water safety planning
[   Ideally, 10% of the total population served should be included in the survey. It is important that the
    survey is representative of the differences between the areas and user groups served.
[   Allocate survey teams to different locations and agree on the number of surveys to be completed.
[   Brief the survey team on the questions and how to conduct the survey (see below).

Conducting the survey
[   It is best to choose households that are not side by side. Walk a little to find different types of
    households. Visit poorer and richer houses. Or count three houses between interview respondents.
[   Try to interview both men and women.
[   Try to interview a range of age groups, but do not interview children; the interviewee should be able to
    respond to the questions.
[   Ensure that you reach your target number of survey respondents in each defined location.

GOOD PRACTICE TIPS FOR THE SURVEY TEAM
[   Ensure that the survey team understands the intent of each question prior to beginning field work.
[   It is best to work in small teams of two or three people to visit each household. Larger teams may
    intimidate householders.
[   Be respectful of each person’s views. Do not comment or judge. The purpose of the survey is to listen to
    different perspectives and record information only.
[   Be sensitive to the comfort level of the interviewee at all times, moving past any questions that appear
    to cause discomfort.
[   Guidance for the survey team member asking the questions, i.e. the interviewer:
        ~    Seek permission/consent for the interview. Explain the purpose of the interview, what the
             information will be used for, and how long the interview will take. Make sure the individual
             agrees to participate.
        ~    Ensure that the interview is conducted in a safe and comfortable place for the interviewee.
        ~    Sit directly near the interviewee to facilitate a nice conversation.
        ~    Ask the questions and ensure that responses are provided for each question.
        ~    Make sure that the interviewee is the one answering questions! If there are other people
             gathered nearby, ask them to please remain silent and explain that only the interviewee should
             be answering the questions. As required, move locations if the interviewee is having problems
             answering the questions with a big crowd.
[   Guidance for survey team member(s) recording the information provided by the interviewee, i.e. the
    note taker(s):
        ~    Become fully familiar with the survey form, e.g. which questions involve tick box versus fill-in
             responses, where one versus multiple answers may be recorded, etc.
        ~    Where interviewees are answering open question such as “why/why not” or “please describe”,
             take care to record the interviewee response in detail.
        ~    Record responses on the survey form in writing that is neat and clear for others to read.
        ~    Assist the interviewer in making sure that all questions are responded to, and help if the
             interviewer gets stuck or has trouble asking a question.

        TOOL F: EXAMPLE WSP TRAINING MATERIALS
        INCORPORATING EQUIT Y
        The following training materials are included in this guidance document as an illustrative example of how
        and where equity considerations can be integrated into a standard WSP training programme.

        These example training materials provided in this section are based on materials that were developed by
        WSP trainers in collaboration with equity experts from ISF-UTS and incorporated into an international WSP
        training workshop. The materials provided are:

        [     a three-day WSP training programme with points of equity inputs flagged; and
        [     PowerPoint (PPT) slides on equity for presentation at appropriate points in the training.

        These training materials are structured according to the 11 modules of a WSP as presented in the Water safety
        plan manual (WHO & IWA, 2009), but they can be readily modified according to the six tasks of a WSP as
        presented in the manual on Water safety planning for small community water supplies (WHO, 2012) (refer to
        Fig. 1).

 Continuous equity strengthening
 Each cycle of WSP review and revision provides an
 opportunity for the WSP team to strengthen equity
 consideration and outcomes.

 To do this, the WSP team should:

 üDevelop a simple equity checklist outlining
   opportunities for equity integration in each WSP module
 üUse the checklist to assess equity integration each time

Equity is the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically,
demographically or geographically. Every water initiative has an equity impact, whether intentional or not. This means a WSP process can
either increase or decrease existing disadvantage within communities. To ensure WSPs have a positive impact for all groups of people and to
realize the human right to safe water for all, equity outcomes should be considered when developing and implementing a WSP.

Considering the needs and interests of different groups, especially women, the poor and the most vulnerable, will also make the WSP more
effective. Engaging all different groups will help WSP teams identify a greater range of both social and technical hazards and develop more
effective and sustainable control measures.

     3. Recognizing the most disadvantaged users in
        the community
     The WSP team believed the most disadvantaged group in Nordash
     was the poor. They recognized that the very poor are more vulnerable
     to the consequences of unsafe water, for example, because of their
     lack of resources to receive medical attention or the consequences
     of missing work. Therefore, as part of mapping the water supply
     system, the WSP team identified and mapped the income level of
     water users using a scale: very rich – rich – moderate – poor – very
     poor. The WSP team developed its own locally relevant definition for
     wealth ranking, informed by national pro-poor government policy.

       National government policy often provides guidance and
       standards to achieve equity in the provision of safe water.

understand and value equity integration in the WSP process.


Equity is the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically,
demographically or geographically. Every water initiative has an equity impact, whether intentional or not. This means a WSP process can
either increase or decrease existing disadvantage within communities. To ensure WSPs have a positive impact for all groups of people and to
realize the human right to safe water for all, equity outcomes should be considered when developing and implementing a WSP.

Considering the needs and interests of different groups, especially women, the poor and the most vulnerable, will also make the WSP more
effective. Engaging all different groups will help WSP teams identify a greater range of both social and technical hazards and develop more
effective and sustainable control measures.

   impact improves control measure design
During the workshop, the WSP team was asked to discuss the
benefit of conducting an “equity assessment” of proposed control
measures, which entailed:
~    Identifying possible control measures to address the hazardous
     event.
~    Assessing each control measure for different user groups
     (such as women, men, boys, girls, old, young, persons with
     disability, poor, etc.) to determine if there are any potential
     negative consequences from the control measure.

     Equity is the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically,
     demographically or geographically. Every water initiative has an equity impact, whether intentional or not. This means a WSP process can
     either increase or decrease existing disadvantage within communities. To ensure WSPs have a positive impact for all groups of people and to
     realize the human right to safe water for all, equity outcomes should be considered when developing and implementing a WSP.

     Considering the needs and interests of different groups, especially women, the poor and the most vulnerable, will also make the WSP more
     effective. Engaging all different groups will help WSP teams identify a greater range of both social and technical hazards and develop more
     effective and sustainable control measures.

        Example of user survey questions:
        These are example user survey questions. Practitioners can draw on these and other questions as appropriate for their context to
        develop survey tools. Questions like these can be asked across the community and then analysed to reveal different experiences with
        water for different demographic groups in a community.

        ~ What is your age, sex, caste, ethnicity?
        ~ Is there any member of the family who is a senior citizen or person with a disability?
        ~ Where do you get your water supply for general household use? For drinking-water?
        ~ If you rely on public faucets, who usually collects the water?
        ~ Are there any challenges for your family members in accessing water?
        ~ Within your household, do you take any steps to keep water safe? If so, what steps?
        ~ How often do you pay your water bill? Is it ever hard to pay?
        ~ What do you do if the system ever needs repairs or maintenance?
        ~ How do you contact the water supplier if you want to let them know of a concern or feedback?
        ~ How do you get information from the water service provider about any service issues?
        ~ Do you ever have any concerns about your water supply?
        ~ Have you ever seen water quality testing results from the area where you live? If yes, do you know the results of the testing?
