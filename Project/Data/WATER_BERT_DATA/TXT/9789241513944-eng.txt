vi   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
1 Target audience, purpose
  and scope
This guidance document is intended for those agencies in countries with limited
resources that are responsible for developing, implementing and enforcing national
or subnational drinking-water quality regulations and standards.1 These agencies can
vary from country to country but would generally be the ministry of health, ministry
of environment, ministry of water supply and/or a separate drinking-water regulatory
agency. In some countries, the agency (or agencies) setting the standards is different
from the agency (or agencies) that implements and enforces the standards (see
Box 1.1). However, the principles noted in this document are broadly applicable to
all countries and all regulatory arrangements.

This document provides simple, practical guidance to assist the development or
revision of drinking-water quality regulations and standards using the WHO Guidelines
for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) (WHO, 2017a). This guidance should always be
read and used in conjunction with the GDWQ.

The GDWQ present a framework for ensuring the safety of drinking-water, which
comprises:
• Health-based targets, including water quality targets typically expressed as numeric
  guideline values (concentrations) for substances of concern.
• Water safety plans (WSPs) to be developed and implemented by water suppliers
  to support effective management of their systems.
• Independent surveillance to ensure that WSPs are effective and that health-based
  targets are met.

Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards based on this guidance
will ensure that these three elements of the GDWQ’s Framework for Safe Drinking-
water are addressed.

    The term “standard” is commonly used to describe a mandatory numerical value in a table of parameters and limits (such as 10 µg/l of arsenic).
    However, it is also used to describe technical standards and policy documents designed to help achieve improved water quality. Regulations are
    requirements that can include or refer to a table of parameters and limits. Regardless of how a country defines “standards” or “regulations”, both
    are interdependent.


                                                                                            Target audience, purpose and scope                           1

2   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
2 Why countries need
  customized regulations
  and standards
The GDWQ are not a substitute for customized national or subnational drinking-
water quality regulations and standards that take into account local needs, priorities
and capacities, as well as the economic and health benefits resulting from improved
drinking-water supplies.

Rather, the GDWQ support customized regulations and standards by presenting good
practice related to water supply risk management and surveillance, and by providing
health-based targets. These health-based targets include numeric guideline values
which define drinking-water that does not represent any significant risk to health,
and they are generally based on lifetime consumption. The health-based targets in the
GDWQ are based on the best available scientific evidence, as well as expert advice
and opinion, for approximately 200 individual parameters.

The GDWQ are not intended to be mandatory and the guideline values included are
not designed to be adopted as a complete set in national or subnational regulations
and standards. As it is not possible for the GDWQ to account for the wide range
of issues or conditions that may influence the significance of individual parameters
in a particular country, not all parameters included in the GDWQ will be important
for every country. The GDWQ should therefore be adapted to account for local
circumstances, such as current hazards, environmental conditions, industrial and
agricultural activities, and available resources.

Customized regulations and standards based on the GDWQ will help to:
• Protect public health associated with the consumption of drinking-water.
• Complement other national or regional drinking-water management policies (e.g.
  water resource management).
• Achieve balance in overall health objectives between health-related drinking-water
  issues and other health-related priorities.
• Ensure drinking-water management strategies are based on current scientific
  knowledge and proven good practice.
• Allow resources (of regulators, suppliers and communities) to be targeted appropriately.




                               Why countries need customized regulations and standards       3
    3 When to revise existing
      regulations and standards
    Drinking-water quality regulations and standards may be prepared as a new process
    or as a revision to existing regulations and standards. Both situations provide an
    opportunity to contribute to progressive improvements in drinking-water quality. It
    is therefore important to make allowance for gradual improvement in drinking-water
    quality and in strengthening the regulations and standards.

    Regulatory agencies should consider revising regulations and standards in any of the
    following situations:
    • There is information about hazards which indicates that the current regulations and
      standards are clearly inadequate to protect health or ensure acceptability.
    • An evaluation of the existing regulations and standards shows they are insufficient
      or inappropriate.
    • Current regulations and standards are deemed out of date due to improvements
      in scientific understanding (e.g. new information on the health impact of a chemical
      currently regulated results in a change in the GDWQ).
    • There is a significant change in available drinking-water treatment technology that
      allows for better control of certain contaminants.
    • There is a significant change in the analytical methods available for measuring
      contaminants (e.g. allowing the use of remote monitoring technologies in lieu of
      on-site monitoring).
    • There is a significant change in the country context impacting the risk to public health
      (e.g. change in agriculture or industry that increases the potential for microbial or
      chemical contamination of drinking-water sources and the need for regulations to
      control contamination).
    • There is a need to establish or upgrade regulations and standards due to requirements
      of legislation.
    • Resources permit incremental expansion and/or strengthening of the regulations
      and standards (e.g. in terms of parameters included, limits set and/or types of water
      supply systems covered).




4   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Occasionally, there are major policy changes to the GDWQ, such as the incorporation
of WSPs into the GDWQ in 2004. These changes are infrequent but important. In
these cases, changes to regulations and standards should be considered (see Box 3.1).

The decision on how often regulations and standards should be revised is a matter for
individual jurisdictions. As new regulations and standards are developed, the inclusion
of a “review” clause will provide a formal mechanism to ensure reviews occur regularly.
Adopting a review date establishes a defined lifespan for the regulations and standards
that triggers a review after a specified period (e.g. after 5 to 10 years), unless an earlier
review is undertaken by a relevant national body.

    4 Key principles
    Box 4.1 presents the key principles to consider during the development or revision
    of drinking-water quality regulations and standards to ensure they are contextually
    appropriate and successfully contribute to the achievement of safe and acceptable
    drinking-water supplies.


      BOX 4.1   Key principles
      Take a risk-based    This document presents three ways in which regulations and standards can
               approach    follow a risk-based approach:
                           1. Promote risk management
                           A water supplier’s primary responsibility is to provide safe drinking-water. This
                           is best achieved by adopting a preventive risk management approach, such as
                           a WSP. Regulations and standards should make clear that this responsibility
                           is paramount by recommending or requiring WSPs rather than focusing only
                           on numerical compliance with parameter limits. Numerous publications are
                           available on WSPs, as outlined in Water safety planning: A roadmap to supporting
                           resources (WHO, 2017b).
                           2. Prioritize parameters according to the risk posed
                           The guidance in this document on selecting parameters for inclusion in regulations
                           and standards is grounded in the principle that parameters should be prioritized
                           according to the actual risks posed in the local context (see Section 7).
                           3. Allow risk-based monitoring programmes
                           Regulations and standards may allow individual suppliers to request deviations
                           from established water quality monitoring requirements on the basis of system-
                           specific risk assessments (see Section 9).

            Be realistic   Local considerations need to be allowed for in the development or revision of
                           regulations and standards, including resource availability. Issues to consider
                           include:
                              local staff (e.g. personnel required to undertake surveillance activities);
                              laboratories (e.g. location, number, equipment, testing capacity);
                              logistics and seasonal constraints in collecting, storing, transporting and
                              testing samples; and
                              realistic budgets for monitoring and surveillance.
                           If regulations and standards are too complex, detailed or demanding, it will
                           inevitably lead to non-compliance. Little is achieved by establishing regulations
                           and standards that look good on paper, unless they can be implemented and
                           enforced. Being realistic increases the likelihood that the regulations and
                           standards can achieve the desired public health outcomes.
                           The regulations and standards must be realistic in terms of the parameters
                           chosen, the limits set and the monitoring frequencies established. In practice,
                           this means establishing a balance between the resources available and those
                           that are obtainable, without being excessively optimistic.

           Be selective    Inevitably, regulations and standards must be limited in what they include. The
                           most important issues should be identified, particularly those with potential
                           public health impacts. The selection of parameters should rely as much as
                           possible on data from the country or region and reflect the best scientific data
                           available, including those presented in the GDWQ.




6   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
BOX 4.1   Key principles (continued)
         Enable     Improving drinking-water quality takes time. For example, it may require
    incremental     investment and technical resources that may not be immediately available,
                    or infrastructure that will require time to install and make operational. It is
  improvements      therefore necessary to accommodate gradual improvement. Regulations and
                    standards should follow a stepwise approach to addressing the immediate
                    and greatest threats to public health (e.g. microbial pathogens) and ultimately
                    achieving long-term water quality targets, while maximizing the use of available
                    resources and balancing other national priorities. Activities at each stage
                    should demonstrate the benefits of the regulations and standards. As each
                    step is successfully implemented, and as additional resources and capacity
                    are gained, the regulations and standards can be increased in complexity
                    and/or scope over time.

          Ensure    To ensure regulations and standards are well supported, it is important to seek wide
 regulations and    participation and maintain ongoing communication with key stakeholders. This is
                    especially important when establishing a regulations and standards committee
   standards are    (see Section 5.1) responsible for developing and/or revising the regulations
  well supported    and standards. It is also important to have political and legislative support for
                    regulations and standards (e.g. from politicians/lawmakers, government officers,
                    local health agencies, technical staff and the public) to ensure success. Ideally,
                    supporting legislation needs to define roles and responsibilities, and should allow
                    for the development, enforcement and, when necessary, revision of regulations
                    and standards. Requirements can be specified in acts, regulations, decrees or
                    other instruments.

     Be aware of    Consider the practical and financial implications of the proposed regulations
    implications    and standards, including:
                      Will laboratories need more support or validation?
                      Will new treatment plants be needed?
                      Will the surveillance agency need more staff?
                      Is enforcement practical?
                    For example:
                      If there is insufficient laboratory capacity to conduct testing, or insufficient
                      or only unskilled staff to carry out monitoring activities, consider developing
                      less ambitious regulations and standards focusing on the highest priorities.
                      If new infrastructure (e.g. treatment processes or plumbing materials) is
                      likely to be required to comply with the regulations and standards, time may
                      need to be allowed for these upgrades (see Box 4.5).

   Get drinking-    Care should be exercised that the regulations and standards do not unnecessarily

                    It is appropriate to consider the health benefits from drinking-water relative
      in context    to other interventions (e.g. sanitation, hygiene, health care). In addition, it is
                    important to consider the various sources of exposure (e.g. food, air) for various
                    contaminants and the benefits and costs of controlling levels in drinking-water
                    versus other sources of exposure.




                                                                                        Key principles     7
    In keeping with the principles presented in Box 4.1, it is possible for drinking-water
    quality regulations and standards to accommodate local needs as follows:
    • In time: A period of grace can be allowed before either the whole or part of the
      regulations and standards come into effect (see Box 4.2).
    • By exceptions/exemptions: This means that a particular component of the regulations
      and standards may not apply to a certain area or type of supply. Exceptions/exemptions
      may be temporary, permanent or phased and may be granted on the basis of a lack
      of significance or insufficient resources to address a problem (e.g. funding to treat
      the water) (see Box 4.3).
    • By derogations: This means that a water supplier can be temporarily authorized
      to supply drinking-water with an exceedance for a parameter. Derogations may
      be useful when the public health risk of the exceedance is minor and where it may
      take time or resources to remedy the exceedance. Derogations are particularly
      important to consider where there are no alternative water sources. As drinking-
      water is a fundamental requirement of life, the risks of not having a drinking-water
      supply need to be balanced against the risk posed by the exceedance (see Box 4.4).
    • By the parameters chosen: This means focusing attention on those issues relevant
      to local circumstances and not attempting to develop regulations and standards for
      every possible contaminant, particularly those that do not occur within the jurisdiction.
    • By the limits of parameters: This is a common way to address the need to be
      realistic. It could be achieved by setting more than one limit for a parameter (e.g.
      ideal and mandatory) or by setting an interim limit. For example, if controlling a
      substance in a water supply will take time to achieve, it is possible to initially set
      an interim limit that is a higher value than the GDWQ guideline value (e.g. justified
      by using a smaller margin of safety than the value in the GDWQ; see Annex 2 for
      more information), while still being protective of public health. This approach should
      involve setting a suitable timeframe for improvements that will allow achievement
      of the guideline value in due course (e.g. within one to two years) (see Box 4.5).
    • By the frequency of monitoring: It is important to get started. Initially a modest
      but realistic monitoring schedule should be implemented. This can be expanded as
      resources become available.
    • By consideration of resources: For example, it may be appropriate to require
      more from providers that have better resources and less from those with fewer
      resources (see Box 4.6).
    • By a combination of the above.

BOX 4.2          Example of grace periods
In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the 2014 national drinking-water quality standards allow a
period of grace before WSP requirements are enforceable. In the case of urban water supply systems,
for instance, the national standards require water suppliers to arrange to receive WSP training within
five years of the standards taking effect and to develop their WSPs within one year of the said training.

BOX 4.3          Example of exemptions
In Cambodia, urban water suppliers may apply for exemptions, in part or in full, for the starting date to
comply with the provisions of the 2015 national drinking-water quality standards, or for some treatment
system types or network areas to which the national standards apply. All exemptions must be parameter
and location specific. The water suppliers must justify the basis of the exemption and provide a timed
improvement programme to rectify the problems that make it unfeasible to comply with the national
standards. Such applications, if granted by the regulator, must stipulate a time period by which the
exemption will cease. Exemptions may state the conditions under which the exemption is granted.

BOX 4.4          Examples of derogations
In Morocco, water suppliers can, in certain circumstances, ask the Ministry of Health to approve a
derogation to continue water distribution while exceeding the limit for certain parameters. This type of
request should not concern the “health parameters” identified as such in the national standard. Water
suppliers must support their application by:
  specifying the particular location to which the derogation will apply;
  justifying derogation of that parameter;
  providing water quality data for a minimum of two previous years;
  describing the measures and actions that will be implemented to return to the normal situation; and
  giving a time period within which the situation will be improved so that the derogation will no longer
  be required.

Estonia faced challenges with naturally occurring fluoride above the limit specified in the 1998 European
Union Drinking Water Directive (DWD). Following a health risk assessment, the country was allowed

with a review after the first three years.

       BOX 4.5          Examples of limits of parameters
       Interim limits
       Due to the significant health risk associated with lead, a series of actions undertaken in Europe focused
       on a general reduction of population exposure to lead. Accordingly, the DWD set strict maximum lead
       occurrence levels to control lead in the drinking-water system. As the main cause of lead in drinking-
       water is from leaching from household plumbing, decreasing the lead limit in drinking-water from 50
       to 10 µg/l was approached by setting an interim limit of 25 µg/l for the period between five and 15
       years after the DWD took effect to allow sufficient time to implement the necessary actions (i.e. replace
       lead service connections) to comply with new standards.

       Ideal versus mandatory limits
       The United States Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG)
       for each contaminant. The MCLG is the maximum level of a contaminant in drinking-water at which no
       known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur, and which allows an adequate
       margin of safety. The MCLGs are not legal limits set for public water systems and are not enforceable.
       Rather, they are based solely on human health considerations. The Chemical Contaminants Rules
       also set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for each contaminant within three contaminant groups:
       inorganic contaminants, including nitrate and arsenic; volatile organic contaminants; and synthetic
       organic contaminants. These MCLs are enforceable. The MCL weighs the technical and financial barriers
       with public health protection with the aim to set MCLs as close to the health goal as possible. As an
       example, the MCL for arsenic is 10 µg/l, while the MCLG is zero.

10   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
5 Getting started
5.1         Who should be involved and consulted
Typically, development or revision of drinking-water quality regulations and standards
includes consultation with or the involvement of numerous stakeholders, helping to
ensure that the regulations and standards are well supported and allowing the process to
benefit from a range of expertise (see Box 5.1). In some countries, a national standards
agency is responsible for establishing drinking-water quality regulations and standards,
although the agency may have little technical knowledge or working experience of
drinking-water issues. In other countries, the regulator (often under the health ministry)
is responsible for establishing the regulations and standards, although the agency may be
under-resourced and/or lacking technical knowledge. In these circumstances, stakeholder
coordination, cooperation and communication is particularly vital to success. For
example, water sector professionals should have a key role to play, as they are likely to
be aware of pathogens and chemicals that may be present in significant concentrations
in some drinking-water supplies. This is a body of local knowledge that has been built up
by practical experience over a period of time and through the systematic identification
of potential sources of hazards, and it is invaluable as an input into the regulations and
standards development or revision process.




  BOX 5.1         Establishing a national standards committee in
                  Viet Nam
  A multistakeholder working group was established in Viet Nam to support the revision of the Viet
  Nam National Technical Regulations on Water Quality. The composition of the working group included:
    Health Environmental Management Agency of the Ministry of Health
    Administration of Technical Infrastructure of the Ministry of Construction
    Department of Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
    Department of Water Resources of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment
    Directorate of Standards, Metrology and Quality of the Ministry of Science and Technology
    Viet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association

                                                                                      Getting started   11
     A useful first step is to convene a meeting of representatives from each of the agencies
     with a role in the provision of drinking-water to identify the key issues that need
     to be addressed in regulations and standards; to identify the agency that will lead
     the development or revision of the regulations and standards, as well as the agency
     responsible for their implementation and enforcement; and to confirm the scope of
     responsibility of each institution in the process.

     Stakeholders that could be engaged include:
     • national public health authorities
     • environment, agriculture and/or resource management authorities
     • drinking-water supply agencies
     • local/regional environmental health agencies
     • local governments
     • industry groups, including plumbers/operators
     • professional groups (e.g. engineers, toxicologists, microbiologists)
     • national accreditation bodies
     • academics and universities
     • analytical laboratories
     • consumer representatives (see Box 5.2)
     • water, sanitation and health (WASH) nongovernmental organizations (depends on
       the country context).



            BOX 5.2      Public participation
            When developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards, it is important to ensure that
            the process is open and transparent. Therefore, it is important to engage with the public through the
            development process. Consumers should be encouraged to provide input on the scope and features
            of the regulations and standards. This can be achieved by encouraging written submissions and
            participation in open communication sessions where the public can ask questions of regulatory
            agencies and provide opinions and comments on proposed regulations and standards. These
            sessions should be held at various locations/centres to encourage attendance. Consultation should
            be continued through each stage of development.
            An open and transparent development process helps build public trust in the regulations and
            standards.




12   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
5.2             Suggested process
Table 5.1 presents seven steps involved in developing or revising national or subnational
drinking-water quality regulations and standards. See Box 5.3 for a country example
of the process of revising a national standard.


TABLE 5.1           Suggested steps involved in developing or revising drinking-
                    water quality regulations and standards

    STEP                               This institution would:
                                          prepare a plan for developing or revising the regulations and standards;
    Identify the lead                     drive the process;
    institution                           convene meetings and distribute tasks;
                                          support research; and
                                          process and record the information discussed and decisions made.

    STEP                               To support this, the lead institution could:
                                          create a regulations and standards committee (see Box 5.1);
    Define roles to support               select a group of advisorsa (as necessary) to support the regulations and
    the process                           standards committee;
                                          identify and maintain communication with stakeholders; and
                                          assign responsibilities and share criteria, methods and timeframes.

    STEP                    This would involve establishing why the regulations and standards are being
                             developed or revised, as well as:
    Define objectives and      defining clearly the types of systems the regulations and standards are expected
    scope of the regulations   to cover, e.g. large supplies, small supplies, self-supply systems, non-piped
    and standards              supplies, vended water, and/or bottled water;b
                               determining the point(s) of compliance (see Section 9.2), which is usually the
                               delivery point to consumers, e.g. hand pump or, for piped systems, the delivery
                               point to buildings/dwellings or inside taps; and
                               agreeing on the major topics to be addressed in the regulations and standards,
                               e.g. proactive risk management by suppliers, parameters and limits, monitoring
                               and independent surveillance.

    STEP                               When existing regulations and standards are being revised, the actual outcomes,
                                        strengths and challenges of the existing regulations and standards should be
    Review existing                     reviewed. Some useful questions may be:
    regulations and                        Did they help to improve the quality of drinking-water and contribute to
    standards                              improved public health? If so, how and to what extent? If not, why not?
                                           Were there any recurring problems with implementation? If so, what were
                                           these and how might they be overcome in the future?
                                        It is important to focus on lessons to be learned for the new regulations and
                                        standards. Stakeholder focus group discussions may be useful tools.

    Water vending and bottled water tend to be managed differently. Water vendors are subject to the GDWQ and should be included in drinking-
    water quality regulations and standards where appropriate. However, while guidelines and standards for bottled water are generally derived from
    the GDWQ, bottled water is typically regulated through national food legislation.

      STEP                      It is important that regulations and standards are informed by careful analysis
                                 of local data, including:
      Gather baseline data for      source water quality data;

                                    water quality surveillance data;
                                    drinking-water consumption rates;
                                    risks identified through WSPs, e.g. from local industry, agricultural activity
                                    and urban settlements;
                                    cultural habits related to drinking-water;
                                    human and financial resources available;
                                    compliance issues; and
                                    capacity issues.
                                 See Section 5.3 for guidance on water quality data sources.

      STEP                      Most of the effort will be in this step, which is the focus of the guidance provided
                                 in Sections 6–10. The details will be driven by the table of contents of the
      Prepare the separate       regulations and standards, but activities will generally include:
      sections of the              specifying responsibilities;
      regulations and              specifying requirements for proactive risk management by water suppliers
      standards                    (e.g. sanitary inspections or WSPs);
                                   selecting the parameters to be included;
                                   deciding the parameter limits;
                                   selecting monitoring requirements and methodologies (e.g. frequencies,
                                   locations, methods and reporting); and
                                   specifying additional independent surveillance requirements.

      STEP                      It is advisable for draft(s) to be reviewed by independent experts who are
                                 aware of the national context so that any expert advice provided is relevant
      Ensure peer review         for the local situation.



     The time needed to develop or revise the regulations and standards depends on:
     • A country’s institutional working practices and procedures.
     • The quality, amount and variability of surveillance and monitoring data.
     • The need for additional water quality data and the ease with which it can be obtained.
       For example, it may take considerable time to get samples (particularly when there
       is seasonal variation in parameter concentrations) and send elsewhere for testing
       where laboratory capabilities are limited.
     • Inputs from stakeholder consultations.
     • The time since the last review.




14   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
As a guide, nine to 18 months should be allowed, but this timeframe may vary according
to local circumstances. It is important to take sufficient time to develop sound regulations
and standards without allowing processes to be subject to unnecessary delays.

     5.3      Water quality data sources
     As described in Table 5.1, reviewing available water quality data and sources of
     contamination is an important preparatory step for developing customized national
     or subnational regulations and standards. Ideally, data for both the raw water (surface
     water and groundwater) and the drinking-water supplied to the population should
     be reviewed. Potential sources of data will include water suppliers, the surveillance
     agency, other government agencies (e.g. ministry of health, ministry of environment),
     major industries that may discharge into the water source (e.g. mining and rubber
     companies), and research and development agencies. Risk assessments undertaken
     as part of WSPs can also be a useful data source.

     The microbiological quality of drinking-water is always of paramount importance.
     Microbiological data normally take the form of Escherichia coli (E. coli) results, as an
     indicator of faecal contamination and the potential presence of pathogenic bacteria,
     protozoa or viruses. Where microbiological data are not available, it should be assumed
     that pathogens are likely to be present, particularly for surface water supplies.

     Aesthetic or nuisance water quality issues (e.g. bitter or salty tastes, hard water,
     indications of blue-green staining from copper content, laundry staining, rusty or
     corrosive water) reported by customers may also be useful. Customer complaint
     records from water suppliers may therefore be another source of data.

     Some typical data sources for chemicals that are categorized based on the source of
     the substance are:
     • Naturally occurring chemicals: Geological survey departments and mining companies.
     • Chemicals from agricultural activities: Information on fertilizer and pesticide use
       and importation from government authorities/regulators that issue approvals for use.
     • Chemicals from human settlements: Water supply and wastewater agencies, local
       government and municipal authorities, and environmental agencies.
     • Chemicals from industrial activities: Environmental agencies and major industries.
     • Chemicals used in water treatment and distribution: Water suppliers and
       surveillance agencies (including monitoring records).


     Refer to Chemical safety of drinking-water: Assessing priorities for risk management (WHO,
     2007) for further details on potential data sources for chemical contaminants.




16   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Chemical data are frequently not available and assumptions are often required. Where
this is the case, the risk-based approach outlined in Chemical safety of drinking-water:
Assessing priorities for risk management (WHO, 2007) can be followed to identify priority
chemicals (see Section 7.3). This can be used as the basis of a targeted sampling and
testing programme to complement existing data.

Legislation and monitoring data from neighbouring countries with similar drinking-
water sources and quality may be also considered among the information sources.

Where there are gaps in existing data, new studies can be commissioned where practical
to obtain the relevant data. However, where such studies may take considerable time,
this should not unnecessarily delay the development or finalization of regulations and
standards.




                                                                         Getting started    17
     6 Overview of typical
       content
     This section presents an overview of the topics typically covered in national or
     subnational drinking-water quality regulations and standards. While the structure
     and content of regulations and standards will vary by country, and may be influenced
     by legislative norms in individual countries, Table 6.1 provides general guidance on
     typical content. The topics shaded in blue are covered in more detail in Sections 7–10.


     TABLE 6.1    Typical drinking-water quality regulations and standards content

      Topics to consider Remarks
      Introduction         This would typically cover the importance of regulations and standards, specific
                           goals and objectives (see Box 6.1), a brief history and guiding principles.
      Timelines            This would specify when the regulations and standards take effect, including
                           discussion of any phased or staged implementation.
      General clauses      This would usually include:
                             Scope, e.g. whether the regulations and standards cover drinking-water for the
                             general population and/or other uses, as well as types and sizes of water supplies
                             for which the regulations and standards apply.
                             At which points in the water supply systems the regulations and standards apply.
                             Proposed revision process and the frequency of revision for the regulations and
                             standards.
                             General principles for drinking-water emergencies/waterborne disease outbreaks.
                             Definitions.
      Exceptions/          This would present the terms surrounding any exceptions/exemptions allowed (including
      exemptions and       whether they are to be permanent, temporary or phased), as well as derogations.
      derogations
      Roles, rights and    This section would typically include the roles and responsibilities related to standard
      responsibilities     setting, provision of water supply, and the implementation and enforcement of the
                           regulations and standards. The roles and responsibilities of specific institutions
                           should also be included in relevant enabling legislation, with each relevant institution
                           listed and their roles, rights and responsibilities described.
      Water safety plans   Recommendations or requirements for a risk management approach, such as a
      (WSPs)               WSP, should be a fundamental component of regulations and standards. Proactive
                           risk management by the water supplier is essential, and promotion of this good
                           practice is of primary importance for regulations and standards. The regulations
                           and standards should generally focus on the key principles of WSPs and refer to
                           separate guidance for details, such as national or international WSP manuals.a It is
                           important that implementation of WSPs is supported by a mechanism of WSP audit
                           undertaken as part of surveillance to make sure WSPs are adequate and effective
                           (see surveillance section of this table).




18   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
TABLE 6.1           Typical drinking-water quality regulations and standards content
                    (continued)


    Topics to consider Remarks
    Table of parameters            These tables should present the most relevant parameters in the local context,
    and limits                     with appropriate limits. Historically, these tables were usually the most visible and
    Sections 7 and 8               consulted part of the regulations and standards. Considering the GDWQ’s strong
                                   promotion of preventive management, however, the attention given to these tables
                                   is now expected to be balanced with recommendations or requirements for WSPs or
                                   similar. To reinforce a focus on proactive risk management, it may be appropriate to
                                   locate these tables in an appendix. See Sections 7 and 8 for guidance on selecting
                                   appropriate parameters and limits.
    Monitoring                     This would specify water quality monitoring requirements, including frequencies,
    requirements                   locations and reporting requirements, which would need to take into account available
    Section 9                      resources. See Section 9 for guidance on specifying monitoring requirements.
    Analytical                     This would typically specify any analytical requirements to strengthen the accuracy
    requirements                   of water quality testing, such as methods to be used, requirements for laboratory
    Section 9.4                    certification or accreditation, quality assurance and quality control, sampling
                                   guidelines and the required training and skills for analysts or sample collectors. These
                                   requirements should take into account local resources and capacities and should
                                   allow for variations (e.g. methods used and use of field testing where appropriate).
                                   There is little value in specifying requirements that cannot be achieved. See Section
                                   9.4 for additional guidance on specifying analytical requirements.
    Incident protocols             This would specify what to do in the case of incidents and exceedances. See Section
    Section 10/Annex 1             10 and Annex 1 for further guidance.
    Surveillance                   This would identify the:
                                     Responsible agencies for surveillance, as well as other stakeholders and their
                                     obligations (if not described sufficiently in the roles, rights and responsibilities
                                     section).
                                     Elements of surveillance, ideally including WSP auditingb and/or sanitary inspection
                                     to assess risk management, direct measurement of water quality through testing,
                                     and review of water quality monitoring reports prepared by suppliers.
                                     Any special considerations for the surveillance of small water supplies.
                                     Frequency of surveillance activities.
                                     Requirements for reporting surveillance results.
    Good practice      This optional content could cover nationally relevant topics, such as guidance
    recommendations or for monitoring practices or special water quality issues (e.g. pesticide and algal
    requirements       management). This content may be best placed in appendices.
    Violations, penalties          This would establish incentives for complying with the regulations and standards
    and incentives                 and/or penalties for violations. Normally, the use of penalties is a last resort and more
                                   proactive support to water suppliers facing difficulty with compliance is encouraged.

20   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
7 Parameters
A critical and challenging step in the development of realistic drinking-water quality
regulations and standards is the selection of the particular parameters to be included.
This section discusses the importance of keeping the list of parameters short and
relevant and presents guidance to support prioritization of microbiological, chemical,
acceptability and (where appropriate) radiological parameters for inclusion in regulations
and standards.


7.1      Keeping the list of parameters relevant and short
It is not necessary or desirable to include all the GDWQ parameters in national or
subnational regulations and standards. The GDWQ cover a broad range of constituents
that can affect drinking-water quality, and not all of these constituents will be relevant
within a country.

By including parameters in regulations and standards, there is an implication that there
will be some monitoring of those parameters. In most cases, this will be an explicit
requirement, i.e. monitoring frequencies will be included. Excessively strict regulation
that requires monitoring of all chemicals in the GDWQ is unlikely to provide health
benefits, would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming, and would undermine
the credibility and usefulness of the regulations and standards.

It is important that the parameters included in the regulations and standards are only
those that have been, or may reasonably be, detected in water supplies in the country.
There is little or no benefit to regulations and standards including contaminants that
do not, or are unlikely to, occur in a water supply. Nationally relevant parameters
should be reviewed and prioritized so that scarce resources are not unnecessarily
directed towards the management of parameters that do not pose a threat to health
and/or do not affect the acceptability of drinking-water. As resources permit, additional
parameters could be incrementally included in the regulations and standards where
new information becomes available from local investigations indicating a parameter
represents a significant concern. For example, this approach was used by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency when it used the Information Collection Rule
Federal Database to collect occurrence information on microbial contaminants and
disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking-water to refine its assessment of public
health risks and associated response. Once information becomes available and important
parameters are identified, regulations and/or standards are revisited (US EPA, 1997).



                                                                              Parameters     21
     As a general rule, where there is a recorded history of a contaminant in drinking-water
     that affects public health or acceptability, inclusion in the regulations and standards
     would be considered appropriate. Parameters not specifically included in the regulations
     and standards could be covered by a general “catch-all” clause (see Box 7.1).



            BOX 7.1      Catch-all clause
            To account for potential parameters of concern that are not specifically included in the regulations
            and standards, it is valuable to include a general statement such as: “Water suppliers have an
            obligation to provide safe water for consumers. If any parameters or substances are identified
            in the water which are not specifically included in these regulations and standards, the current
            edition of the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality shall be the primary reference to assess
            the safe level of those substances and parameters.”



     Public health principles to consider when choosing which parameters to specify in
     regulations and standards include:
     • Priorities should be directed at the most important public health concerns. Control
       of microbiological contaminants in drinking-water is the highest priority.
     • Consideration needs to be given to other exposure routes of the parameter.
       Exposure to chemicals from drinking-water is typically minor in comparison with
       other sources with a few important exceptions (e.g. arsenic and fluoride). Where
       the overall burden of disease from multiple exposures is high, there is limited value
       in setting strict targets if drinking-water only provides a small proportion of the
       total exposure to that chemical (see Box 8.2).
     • For most chemical parameters, there is no direct evidence that they have a significant
       impact on public health as a consequence of exposure through drinking-water.
       These should have a lower priority for action, even if present, compared with
       microbiological parameters and chemicals for which there is direct evidence of
       health impact through drinking-water (e.g. arsenic and fluoride). These chemicals
       should be considered within overall public health priorities.
     • Radiological parameters are unlikely to have a significant impact on public health as
       a consequence of exposure through drinking-water in non-emergency situations.
       However, consideration needs to be given to areas where there are high levels of
       natural radionuclides in the underlying rocks and soil and, therefore, in groundwater
       sources of drinking-water.




22   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Cost considerations to bear in mind when choosing which parameters to specify in
regulations and standards include:
• Control and monitoring of parameters require financial resources. Particularly
  where there are limited resources, e.g. in the case of small supplies, it is important
  to ensure these are targeted to the highest priority issues.
• If risk assessment shows that a contaminant is rarely present and/or well below the
  GDWQ guideline value, it may not be appropriate to include it in the regulations
  and standards because the cost of monitoring would not be justified in terms of
  the benefits.
• Even if a substance is present at a concentration close to or above the GDWQ guideline
  value, it is appropriate to consider the costs of control in setting the parameter limit,
  as long as no immediate health impacts are expected (see Box 8.2).


7.2      Microbiological parameters
In order to decrease the risk of waterborne diseases in any country, ensuring that
drinking-water is free of microbiological hazards is the most important priority for
regulations and standards. Waterborne microbial disease is essentially acute, potentially
occurring after even a single exposure.

The recommended approach to assessing faecal contamination and verifying the microbial
safety of drinking-water is based on testing of indicator organisms. The organism of
choice is E. coli, although thermotolerant coliforms provide a less precise but acceptable
alternative. (Annex 3 provides additional information on other microbial indicators.)
E. coli is excreted in large numbers in the faeces of humans and other warm-blooded
animals; while most are non-pathogenic, certain strains can cause acute diarrhoea.
Despite having some shortcomings, particularly as an indicator of viruses and protozoa
due to higher sensitivity to inactivation and environmental pressures, E. coli remains an
important indicator of the presence of faecal contamination and associated pathogens.

As a complement to E. coli testing, certain operational parameters can serve as
indicators of pathogen removal or inactivation and are often included in regulations
and standards, namely:
• Turbidity: Where treatment is applied, turbidity provides an indication of the
  effectiveness of particle removal processes and/or of disinfection effectiveness (as
  high turbidity can interfere with disinfection). It also provides an indication of rapid
  changes in source water quality and distribution system integrity.




                                                                               Parameters     23
     • Disinfectant residual: This serves as an important indicator of pathogen inactivation
       at the treatment plant and of protection against recontamination in the distribution
       system.
     • pH: This is an important operational parameter in determining disinfection efficacy.

     Turbidity, disinfectant residual and pH should be measured where samples are
     collected for E. coli. Where resources for monitoring are particularly constrained
     and only occasional E. coli testing is feasible, e.g. in the case of some small supplies,
     these other parameters can serve as surrogates for gauging microbial water quality
     between E. coli monitoring events.

     All key parameters related to confirming microbiological water quality can be measured
     using field testing kits (see Section 9.4).


     7.3      Chemical parameters
     In contrast to the acute and immediate nature of waterborne microbial disease, the
     great majority of chemical contaminants only exert an effect after a long period of
     exposure (i.e. years).

     When developing or revising regulations and standards, the challenge is to select the
     most important chemicals in a given setting. As noted in Section 7.1, for most chemical
     parameters, there is no direct evidence that they have a significant impact on public
     health as a consequence of exposure through drinking-water. These chemicals should
     therefore be a lower priority for action, even if present, compared with microbiological
     parameters and chemicals known to impact human health through drinking-water. A
     chemical should be prioritized if:
     • There is evidence that health effects can arise specifically from exposure to a chemical
       through drinking-water (e.g. arsenic, fluoride, nitrate, lead and possibly manganese).
     • The chemical is widely present in water sources in the country.
     • There is a reasonable chance of consumers being exposed to the chemical at
       concentrations of concern, i.e. above or close to the GDWQ guideline value. Where
       concentrations vary between supplies, it may be appropriate for the regulations
       and standards to allow for flexibility according to site-specific risk assessments
       (see Section 9).




24   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
       It is important to pay particular attention to the limited number of
    chemicals that have been found to present serious human health hazards
     due to exposure through drinking-water. These include fluoride, arsenic,
                      nitrate, lead and possibly manganese.


A list of potential chemical hazards is required to establish chemicals of concern in the
local context. To support the development of such a list, Box 7.2 provides examples of
potential chemical contaminants according to five source categories: naturally occurring,
agricultural sources, human settlements, industrial activities, and water treatment and
distribution. For further guidance on preparing a list of potential chemical hazards,
see Chemical safety of drinking-water (WHO, 2007); Protecting groundwater for health
(WHO, 2006); and Protecting surface water for health (WHO, 2016).

To identify priority chemicals, available water quality data should be reviewed, (see
Section 5.3), along with the likely sources of the contaminants. To assess the potential
sources of contaminants and their significance, the approach outlined in Chemical safety
of drinking-water (WHO, 2007) can be followed. This approach involves categorizing
chemical parameters into five source categories (see Box 7.2) and identifying risk
factors related to the probability of exposure close to or above the GDWQ guideline
value. Those chemicals with higher probability of elevated exposure, particularly those
with known public health impacts, should be prioritized.

An additional consideration when prioritizing chemicals for inclusion in regulations
and standards is that there may be other sources of exposure (e.g. pesticides in
food, heavy metals in fish, lead in paint) that should be considered when weighing the
costs and benefits of controlling and regulating levels in drinking-water, particularly
for chemical parameters that have a direct impact on human health. In some cases,
drinking-water will be a minor source of exposure, and controlling levels in water may
have little if any impact on overall exposure. In other cases, controlling a chemical in
water may be the most cost-effective way of reducing exposure to the public. The
chemical fact sheets in Chapter 12 of the GDWQ, including supporting background
documents referenced in the fact sheets, give some background data on the exposure
of each chemical from drinking-water compared with other sources, although local
circumstances may vary.




                                                                             Parameters     25
       BOX 7.2   Examples of chemical contaminants by source category

               Naturally    Many of these chemicals generally have a far greater impact on groundwater
              occurring     than surface water (e.g. arsenic, fluoride, uranium), with the notable exception
              chemicals     being cyanobacterial toxins.
                            The concentrations of naturally occurring chemicals are generally, but not
                            always, stable in groundwater.
                            Cyanotoxins can be produced by some cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are
                            common in surface water, with occurrence often linked to seasonal conditions
                            and nutrient availability (primarily phosphorus).

         Chemicals from     These will depend on the nature of the industry and need to be identified
              industrial    through the development of a list of industrial processes undertaken locally.
              activities    See Chemical safety of drinking-water (WHO, 2007) for guidance.
                            Some commonly used degreasing agents, e.g. trichloroethene, can persist
                            in groundwater.
                            Specific chemicals associated with certain production industries include:
                             – battery manufacturing can be a source of cadmium, lead, nickel, manganese,
                               mercury, copper and lithium;
                             – electroplating and tanneries can be a source of chromium; and
                             – chemical and pharmaceutical industries can discharge chemicals
                               associated with their products.
                            Mine sites can be sources of contaminated waste materials, particularly
                            where management practices are poor or where mines have been abandoned.
                            Chemicals associated with extractive industries include:
                             – those being extracted, e.g. uranium, copper and other base metals,
                               hydrocarbons;
                             – those used to extract deposits, e.g. cyanide, mercury; and
                             – chemicals released due to the method of extraction (such as acid leaching)
                               and from acid mine drainage, e.g. arsenic, antimony, cadmium, chromium,
                               fluoride, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium.

         Chemicals from     Chemicals of significance will vary depending on use, precipitation, run-off
            agricultural    and leaching, and include:
              activities     – pesticides (types depend on local use);
                             – nitrates (e.g. from inorganic fertilizers and manure), which can impact
                               surface water and groundwater; and
                             – phosphorus (e.g. from inorganic fertilizers), which generally will not have
                               a direct health impact, but can support the growth of cyanobacteria in
                               surface water.

         Chemicals from     Chemical contamination may result from:
                  human      – use of chlorinated solvents (e.g. trichloroethane);
            settlements      – fuel storage (petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene,
                               xylene);
                             – sewage and waste disposal (nitrate and ammonia);
                             – industrial waste discharges;
                             – urban run-off (e.g. nitrate, ammonia, heavy metals); and
                             – landfill sites where industrial solids and liquid materials are stored.




26   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
BOX 7.2   Examples of chemical contaminants by source category (continued)

 Chemicals from           Chemicals associated with water treatment and distribution fall into two
 water treatment          broad categories, namely:
 and distribution          – Substances resulting from the addition of chemicals used for water
                             treatment, including coagulants and disinfectants. These chemicals
                             are intentionally added but can give rise to residues or by-products (e.g.
                             acrylamide from polyacrylamide coagulant or DBPs from chlorination).
                             Treatment chemicals can also contain contaminants.
                           – Substances that arise from the corrosion of pipes or leach from materials
                             used in distribution or plumbing (e.g. lead, nickel, copper, or vinyl chloride
                             from pipes, solder and fittings).
                          Disinfection should never be compromised in an attempt to control DBPs.
                          The preferred approach to controlling chemicals associated with water
                          treatment and distribution is through a certification system (see Box 7.3).




    BOX 7.3      Certification schemes
    Drinking-water in a piped distribution network is exposed to numerous surfaces, and it is important
    that no materials used in the network leach high concentrations of hazardous chemicals, promote
    microbial growth, impart unacceptable tastes and odours or react with drinking-water (e.g.
    leaching of N-nitrosodimethylamine [NDMA] from rubber seals). It is also important to ensure
    that chemicals used in treatment or associated by-products do not pose a risk to health. This
    includes consideration of impurities contained in treatment products (e.g. aluminium sulfate can
    contain trace amounts of lead). The preferred approach to controlling chemicals associated with
    water treatment and distribution (e.g. vinyl chloride from plastic piping or chemicals leaching
    from ion-exchange resins or membranes) is through a certification system, whereby materials and
    chemicals are tested to confirm compliance with defined standards and certified to be of suitable
    quality and type for drinking-water applications. Various tests can be carried out to determine
    whether the material, additive or contaminant arising from the material or additive can adversely
    affect general water quality (e.g. taste and appearance) and/or exceed permissible levels and
    pose a health risk to consumers. Certification systems can be overseen by government agencies
    or private organizations. Where a country has yet to establish a certification scheme, it may be
    appropriate to consider using materials already approved through another country’s certification
    scheme. (Note that these schemes may or may not address the ability of the materials to support
    or promote microbial growth.)




                                                                                              Parameters      27
     A further consideration when prioritizing chemicals for inclusion in regulations and
     standards is whether or not there is a guideline value in the GDWQ. For some chemicals,
     no formal guideline value is included because occurrence is only at concentrations
     well below those that would be of concern for health. The GDWQ do not propose
     guideline values for such substances so as not to encourage countries to incorporate
     these chemicals into regulations and standards when inclusion is neither necessary nor
     appropriate. However, the GDWQ may present health-based values (rather than formal
     guideline values) for these substances to help assess the significance of occurrence if
     they are found in drinking-water or in source water. Note that acceptability concerns
     (see Section 7.4) may be relevant for some of these chemicals without a guideline value.


     7.4      Acceptability parameters
     In addition to pathogens and chemicals that affect health, a secondary but important
     consideration is for parameters that influence the acceptability of the water to
     consumers. These parameters are typically related to the taste, odour or appearance
     of drinking-water, and they may lead to consumers rejecting the drinking-water
     and turning to other water that is aesthetically more acceptable but potentially less
     safe. In addition, some of these parameters may cause operational problems such as
     corrosion, fouling of filtration media, or encrustation of distribution systems, which
     may have an indirect impact on public health by compromising the ability to maintain
     a safe drinking-water supply.

     Typical parameters that can reduce acceptability are physical parameters (e.g. taste,
     turbidity, odour, colour) and some inorganic constituents and contaminants (e.g. iron,
     manganese, aluminium, sodium, sulfate, total dissolved solids, pH, ammonia, chloramines,
     chlorides, chlorine, chlorobenzenes, copper, dissolved oxygen, hydrogen sulphide, zinc).

     Generally, the concentrations that affect acceptability are significantly lower than
     those of concern for health. Some parameters have no direct health effects at any
     concentration. Where a parameter is normally detected aesthetically at concentrations
     lower than those of health concern (e.g. chlorobenzenes and some petroleum derived
     hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene):
     • It is not normally necessary to directly regulate or monitor such substances. Rather,
       these parameters may be addressed through a general requirement in the regulations
       and standards that the drinking-water supplied must be acceptable to most consumers.




28   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
• For these parameters, the GDWQ may include a health-based value1 in order to
  assist in determining a response when problems are encountered and to provide
  reassurance with regard to possible health risks. (Note that health-based values,
  rather than formal guideline values, are also established in the GDWQ for parameters
  that are less frequently encountered on a global basis, as discussed in Section 7.3.)


An exception to the general rule above is manganese, which is widely found in
drinking-water sources. The current edition of the GDWQ includes a health-based
value for manganese of 0.4 mg/l. This concentration is above concentrations normally
causing acceptability problems in drinking-water.2 However, there are circumstances
in which manganese can remain in solution at concentrations of health concern in
some acidic or anaerobic waters, particularly groundwaters. It may therefore be
appropriate to regulate and monitor manganese and consider both aesthetic as well
as health aspects when considering the acceptability of drinking-water (see Annex 4
for more information).


7.5              Radiological parameters
The health risks associated with radionuclides are generally low compared with those
from microorganisms or chemicals. Health risks for radionuclides in drinking-water
will not be acute or immediate. However, there are circumstances where natural
radionuclides are significant and may dominate the chemical hazards, for example some
deeper groundwater sources in the Middle East. Concentrations of radionuclides in
drinking-water are most likely to be from naturally occurring radionuclides, although
mining, medical facilities and nuclear energy facilities are also potential sources.

Where it is considered appropriate to include radiological parameters in regulations
and standards, a screening approach for radionuclides, consistent with the approach
included in the GDWQ, should usually be applied. This involves inclusion of gross α
and gross β screening to assess whether there is a radiological hazard present. The
screening approach enables a cost-effective and efficient means to assess radiological
hazards, minimizing the need to carry out detailed radionuclide analysis when the
screening values are not exceeded.




1
    The GDWQ address acceptability related parameters in two ways: (i) a guideline value designated as a “GV (C)” is included, or (ii) a health-based
    value, rather than a formal guideline value, is included. Both approaches indicate that these substances can impact on the acceptability of the
    drinking-water supply, usually at levels that are far below those of health concern. For example, Table A3.3 in Annex 3 of the GDWQ presents
    guideline values for approximately 90 substances. Some of these (e.g. chlorine, ethylbenzene, styrene) are designated with (C), indicating that
    concentrations at or below the (health-based) guideline value may affect acceptability.
2
    For example, at concentrations above 0.1 mg/l, manganese in water supplies may cause an undesirable taste in beverages, and stain sanitary
    ware and laundry (WHO, 2017a).


                                                                                                                                     Parameters         29
     When the screening value is exceeded, detailed analysis for individual radionuclides
     should be required. Specialist input may be needed to support the identification of
     the radionuclides that are causing the problem.

     It should be noted that this screening approach is not applicable for radon. However,
     standards for radon do not generally need to be established even in areas where radon
     is in water sources, as exposure is predominantly from inhalation inside buildings
     rather than drinking-water.

     For further information, see Management of radioactivity in drinking-water (WHO, 2018b).



       Additional reading
       A global overview of national regulations and standards for drinking-water quality (WHO, 2018a)
       summarizes information from 104 countries and territories on the microbiological, chemical, acceptability
       and radiological parameters specified in national drinking-water quality standards. The report shows
       considerable variability in parameters from country to country. Any comparisons should be approached
       with caution, as local circumstances will vary widely and regulations and standards should always
       reflect due consideration of local priorities and available resources.




30   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
8 Parameter limits
Determining appropriate numeric limits for the various parameters that are prioritized
for inclusion in the drinking-water quality regulations and standards requires careful
consideration in order to ensure public health protection while also making limits
realistic and appropriate. The health benefits and costs associated with achieving the
parameter limits set should be considered, as should the health benefits and costs of
controlling levels in drinking-water as compared with controlling other sources of
exposure, such as food or air.

In many circumstances, it will be appropriate to adopt the GDWQ guideline values
as the numeric limits for those parameters included in the regulations and standards.
Where a GDWQ guideline value is not considered achievable or cost-effective due
to practical constraints in the local context, e.g. where existing treatment systems
(or lack thereof) are incapable of sufficiently reducing concentrations, it is important
to ensure that the parameter limit established in the regulations and standards is
both protective of human health and realistic. Interim and/or ideal versus mandatory
limits can be established, as discussed in Section 4. Additional options for establishing
parameter limits that differ from the GDWQ guideline values are presented in the
next sections according to parameter type.


8.1      Microbiological limits
Ideally, E. coli should not be present in any samples of drinking-water. However, this
may not always be achievable. For example, small community supplies may have difficulty
in meeting this target. Table 5.2 of the GDWQ presents a grading approach based on
the proportion of samples that are negative for E. coli and the population size. Grading
schemes can be used in combination with sanitary inspections to categorize systems
and identify priorities for improvement (see Box 8.1 for further discussion of the role
of sanitary inspection in achieving microbiologically safe water).




       BOX 8.1     The role of sanitary inspection
       Recognizing that it is not feasible to monitor for all potential waterborne pathogens and that all
       monitoring is necessarily limited in space and time, the focus of ensuring the microbiological
       safety of drinking-water should be on proactive risk assessment and risk management. This can
       be addressed in regulations and standards by promoting or requiring WSPs or sanitary inspections,
       and by including sanitary inspection and/or WSP auditing in water quality surveillance programmes.




                                                                                       Parameter limits     31
     8.2         Chemical limits
     For those substances that are particularly difficult to control, such as some of the
     natural contaminants found in groundwater, it is possible to set a parameter limit
     higher than the GDWQ guideline value while still being protective of health. The
     process for determining such values is beyond the scope of this guidance document,
     although key considerations are presented in Annex 2. In brief, this involves comparing
     the assumptions made in deriving the GDWQ guideline values (which are generally
     conservative) with local conditions and/or undertaking a local risk assessment to
     determine safe limits. Examples of substances for which adaptation of the GDWQ
     guideline values may be appropriate include arsenic and fluoride (see Box 8.2).



       BOX 8.2         Setting limits higher than GDWQ guideline values
       It is important to consider overall exposure from a chemical when determining appropriate drinking-
       water limits, including exposure from food, consumer products and air. For example, food and/or dental
       preparations may be significant sources of fluoride exposure. In some cases, it may be more practical to
       exert control through reducing exposure from food and allowing higher concentrations in drinking-water,
       particularly when considering small supplies that may not have appropriate treatment in place. For
       example, high fluoride in water in one state in India has been managed by using low fluoride surface
       water sources for irrigation in order to reduce fluoride concentrations in crops. By reducing fluoride
       exposure through food, the fluoride intake from drinking-water can be increased while staying within
       the limits of the maximum daily fluoride intake deemed safe. This approach, combined with increasing
       the intake of calcium (which helps to reduce the impact of fluoride), allowed authorities to set the
       limit for fluoride in drinking-water at 3 mg/l (as compared with the GDWQ guideline value of 1.5 mg/l)
       without a higher risk of skeletal effects.
       Setting a parameter limit higher than the GDWQ guideline value may also be justified on the basis
       of a local health risk assessment. A number of countries, including Bangladesh, have set their limit
       for arsenic at 50 µg/l, which is five times the current GDWQ guideline value of 10 µg/l. (50 µg/l is the
       previous GDWQ guideline value for arsenic.) After consultation with health authorities, it was determined
       that achieving 50 µg/l will have a clear and measurable impact on the burden of disease from arsenic,
       while it is more difficult to demonstrate additional gains at lower concentrations (WHO, 2011). The
       assessment by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives concluded that, “For certain
       regions of the world where concentrations of inorganic arsenic in drinking-water exceed 50–100 μg/l,
       some epidemiological studies provide evidence of adverse effects. There are other areas where arsenic
       concentrations in water are elevated (e.g. above the GDWQ guideline value of 10 μg/l) but are less than
       50 μg/l. In these circumstances, there is a possibility that adverse effects could occur as a result of
       exposure to inorganic arsenic from water and food, but these would be at a low incidence that would
       be difficult to detect in epidemiological studies.”

       Further information on how the GDWQ guideline values are calculated and can be adapted is available in Annex 2
       and in Chapter 8.2 of the GDWQ.




32   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
When there is no guideline value or health-based value presented in the GDWQ
but a suitable international toxicological review is available in which a tolerable daily
intake (TDI), allowable daily intake (ADI) or tolerable weekly or monthly intake has
been determined by the International Programme on Chemical Safety, the Joint FAO/
WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants, or the Joint Meeting
on Pesticide Residues, this can be used to determine a suitably safe level for drinking-
water following the WHO methodology as described in Chapter 8.2 of the GDWQ.


8.3              Radiological limits
The screening values and radionuclide guidance levels in the GDWQ are based on an
individual dose criterion (IDC) of 0.1 mSv/year. In countries where natural radioactivity
in drinking-water is not an issue, adopting the IDC (and corresponding screening values
and guidance levels) should be appropriate. However, in situations where it is difficult
to achieve the IDC (e.g. where natural radionuclides are an issue), countries may wish
to use a different dose criterion and adjust the screening values and guidance levels
accordingly. In these situations, regulatory authorities may establish a dose criterion
greater than the IDC of 0.1 mSv/year, but generally less than the International Basic
Safety Standard reference level of 1 mSv/year, depending on the circumstances.1 Factors
to consider in establishing the dose criterion include the costs of remediation and the
availability of other drinking-water supplies. In any case, it is recommended to set a
national reference level as low as reasonably achievable. For further information, see
Management of radioactivity in drinking-water (WHO, 2018b).

    The International Basic Safety Standard for Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources, co-sponsored by eight UN agencies, including
    WHO, recommends a dose criterion (reference level) for drinking-water of approximately 1 mSv/year. A reference level represents the level of dose
    or risk above which it is judged to be inappropriate to plan to allow exposures to occur and below which optimization of protective actions should
    be planned in order to keep doses as low as reasonable achievable. It should not be regarded as an acceptable dose or as a dose limit. Source:

     9 Compliance monitoring
     One of the key functions of drinking-water quality regulations and standards is to
     establish requirements for compliance monitoring (see Box 9.1), which is the focus
     of this section. Minimally, regulations and standards should address:
     • which entities are responsible for monitoring;1
     • which parameters to monitor (Section 7);
     • frequency of monitoring (Section 9.1);
     • where (in general terms) monitoring should take place (Section 9.2);
     • routine reporting requirements (Section 9.3);
     • acceptable sampling and testing procedures (Section 9.4); and
     • what action to take in the event of non-compliance (Section 10 and Annex 1).



          BOX 9.1          Operational versus compliance monitoring
          When establishing monitoring requirements in drinking-water quality regulations and standards, it is
          important to consider the distinction between compliance monitoring and operational monitoring.
          The regulations and standards should stipulate that certain monitoring must be undertaken to demonstrate
          compliance with the regulations and standards. This monitoring may be undertaken to assess the
          performance of a treatment process (e.g. by measuring operational parameters such as turbidity, chlorine
          residuals and pH) or to verify that the drinking-water being supplied to consumers is safe. Regardless
          of where the monitoring occurs or which parameters are monitored, if the requirement to undertake this
          monitoring activity is specified in the regulations and standards, it is compliance monitoring. Compliance
          monitoring may be undertaken by the water suppliers and/or by the surveillance agency.
          An important complement to the compliance monitoring required by the regulations and standards is
          operational monitoring, which is undertaken by water suppliers as and where needed to confirm that the
          system is functioning as expected, to inform operational decisions (e.g. chemical dosing rates) and to
          provide evidence that the system will deliver water that meets the regulations and standards. Operational
          monitoring is generally undertaken at a higher frequency than compliance monitoring, with the particular
          monitoring locations (e.g. raw water, filtered water) and water quality targets at each location determined
          by the water supplier. Operational monitoring data are generally for the water suppliers’ own use, whereas
          compliance monitoring data are shared with the regulator. (Note that water suppliers may also undertake
          investigative monitoring as part of risk assessments of drinking-water supplies, including catchments.
          This monitoring is also generally for the water suppliers’ own use.)
          Within this document, “monitoring” refers to compliance monitoring unless operational monitoring is
          specifically indicated.




     1
         When the water supplier and the surveillance agency both undertake monitoring activities, it is important for the programmes to be coordinated
         and for data to be shared.


34   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
As with all elements of the regulations and standards, it is important to consider
practical constraints when setting out monitoring requirements, including available
human resources to carry out sampling, availability of analytical facilities and budgets.
The principle of incremental improvement should be applied as appropriate, whereby
a modest monitoring schedule could be established initially and expanded as resources
become available over time. In all cases, and particularly where there are limited capacity
and resources to perform laboratory testing, sanitary inspections and/or WSP audits
to confirm risk management along the water supply chain are important complements
to water quality monitoring to verify the safety of drinking-water supplies.

Also, when establishing monitoring requirements in the regulations and standards,
there should be some flexibility built in so that water suppliers can propose alternative
monitoring programmes based on the actual risk that a particular parameter will be
present at concentrations of concern. This concept is discussed in in Box 9.2 and in
Section 9.1.


       BOX 9.2     Risk-based monitoring programmes
       Water suppliers should be given an option to develop risk-based monitoring programmes that
       deviate from the monitoring requirements set out in the regulations and standards on the basis
       of a system-specific risk assessment. Issues to consider include:
         historical water quality monitoring results;
         the different sources of water (e.g. groundwater, surface water, springs);
         potential contamination sources (e.g. industrial, agricultural);
         treatment processes (e.g. chlorination); and
         size and complexity of the water supply system.
       All decisions regarding risk-based monitoring need to be justified, documented and approved by
       the drinking-water regulator before being implemented.




9.1      Sampling frequency
The frequency of compliance monitoring should depend on the:
• quality and variability of the source water;
• type of treatment the water receives;
• risks of contamination in various parts of the system;
• complexity of the system (e.g. number of pressure zones, intermittency of operation,
  pipe material, pipe condition, reservoir condition);
• water quality history;
• size of the population supplied with drinking-water; and
• availability of data produced by monitoring for other purposes (e.g. environmental
  monitoring).

                                                                           Compliance monitoring        35
     These conditions should also be balanced with consideration of the availability of
     personnel, transport, laboratory facilities and funds to undertake monitoring. That is,
     it is the resources available to both the water suppliers and the surveillance agency
     that will dictate what may feasibly be assigned to these entities. Higher frequencies of
     analysis will have higher costs and require greater resources. It is generally appropriate
     to require more frequent monitoring for better resourced systems, e.g. professionally
     managed versus community-managed systems.

     Similarly, it is important to consider which entity is likely to undertake monitoring
     when establishing frequency requirements. Where compliance monitoring is undertaken
     by water suppliers, more frequent monitoring will generally be feasible. Where the
     surveillance agency is expected to carry out the required monitoring, as may be the
     case for small water supplies, monitoring will generally need to be less frequent due
     to resource limitations.

     Some key considerations for establishing the appropriate monitoring frequency for
     the various parameters included in the regulations and standards are described below.

     Parameter stability: For those parameters that have the potential to change rapidly,
     such as microbiological indicators or chemicals used in water treatment, the required
     sampling frequency should be greater than that required for more stable parameters,
     such as some of the inorganic chemicals found in groundwater. Groundwater sources
     are likely to be less variable and typically require less frequent monitoring relative to
     surface water, depending on the contaminant and its importance. For stable parameters,
     sampling once per year (or even less) may be adequate. Where parameter concentrations
     are both stable and well below the GDWQ guideline value or established parameter
     limit, monitoring as infrequently as once every five years or less could be justified.

     In the case of radiological parameters, it is generally recommended to monitor new
     sources with a significant radiological risk at least four times per year for one year
     (i.e. once per season). Then, in the absence of exceedances, the frequency can be
     decreased to once per two to five years (or longer), depending on the level of activity
     concentrations in the water, the source of the supply (surface or groundwater) and
     how likely it is that activity concentrations may vary across the year (e.g. groundwater
     sources may display less variability than surface water sources), the size of the population
     supplied and the quantity of historical monitoring records. For further information,
     see Management of radioactivity in drinking-water (WHO, 2018b).




36   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Likelihood of occurrence at concentrations of concern: The frequency of monitoring
for chemical parameters should reflect the risk that a parameter will be present at a
concentration of concern. For instance, monitoring for cyanobacterial toxins should
not be performed on a regular basis, but rather should only be undertaken when
there is evidence of significant cyanobacteria growth.1 As risk will often vary between
individual water supply systems, the frequency set out in the regulations and standards
should be sufficient to account for higher risk scenarios while also making allowance
for lower frequencies where justified through a system-specific risk assessment. See
Box 9.3 for an example of such allowances within regulations and standards, and see
Box 9.4 for tips on when a reduced monitoring frequency may be justified.

Seasonal influences: The presence of certain substances may be subject to seasonal
influences, for example, pesticides resulting from agricultural activities. The timing and
frequency of required monitoring should account for any seasonal variations.




      BOX 9.3 Example of risk-based monitoring frequency
      The European Union has adopted a risk-based sampling approach in Annex II of the DWD. This enables
      the development of customized monitoring programmes based on system-specific risk assessment. Under
      this approach, when the risk assessment shows that there is a low risk of a parameter exceeding the
      established limit, a lower frequency of monitoring for that particular parameter can be justified. Where
      a system-specific risk assessment has not been conducted (and approved by the competent authority),
      the water supplier would monitor according to the parameter and frequency schedule set out in the DWD.

    Every effort should be made to prevent blooms forming, and this should be the primary management approach. Where there are heavy algal
    blooms, it is best to consider an alternative source of water unless appropriate treatment is available.


                                                                                                           Compliance monitoring             37
            BOX 9.4      Justifying reduced monitoring frequency
            Where a system-specific risk assessment shows that a substance is not expected to be present
            in a particular water supply, there may be no need for more than very occasional monitoring to
            check for its presence, or no monitoring at all may be required. For example, if a water supplier
            can demonstrate that a parameter or the process giving rise to the parameter is not present or
            in use within a particular water supply system, the supplier could be exempted from associated
            monitoring. For instance, where chlorination is not applied, there would be no need to monitor for
            chlorine residuals, trihalomethanes (THMs) or haloacetic acids (HAAs).
            As another example, if a substance is present, but at less than approximately 50% of the GDWQ
            guideline value, the following questions should be considered:
              Does the concentration change or is it stable over time? If it is stable over time, reduced monitoring
              may be justified, even with a concentration of up to 75% of the GDWQ guideline value.
              Is operational monitoring carried out for this substance at the treatment works, e.g. for aluminium?
              If undertaken correctly, such monitoring can justify reduced compliance monitoring requirements.
            Risk assessments that are used to justify customized monitoring programmes will ideally be
            undertaken as part of a WSP. It may be appropriate to start with more frequent monitoring to gain initial
            information for WSPs, and then adjust accordingly, based on the outcomes of the risk assessment.




     9.2      Sampling locations
     Compliance monitoring data should reflect the quality of the drinking-water that
     consumers receive. The regulations and standards should therefore provide guidance
     on sampling locations for those parameters that will be used to assess compliance
     with the regulations and standards.

     The number of sites at which monitoring is undertaken will impact on resources (financial,
     as well as sampling and testing) and needs to be balanced against other requirements
     associated with ensuring drinking-water quality (e.g. implementation of WSPs).

     Some broad principles to follow when selecting monitoring locations are:
     • Optimal sampling locations depend on where in the system the contaminant is
       expected to be introduced and the likelihood that the parameter’s concentration
       or character will change through the water supply system (see Table 9.1).
     • Sample sites in a distribution system should give good geographic representation of
       the water supply system and enable the comparison of water quality over time for
       particular sections of the system. While the regulations and standards may not be
       specific in this regard, they could state this as a principle that needs to be followed
       when designing compliance monitoring programmes.
     • It is best if sites are rotated amongst the designated sample sites throughout the
       distribution system. However, a limited number of sites could be maintained in
       order to collate a series of historical data.


38   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
• The sampling of microbial parameters or indicators should be representative in terms
  of exposure (e.g. more samples need to be collected in areas of higher population
  densities) and be designed to detect contamination if it occurs. This means that
  sampling locations should account for:
  – locations within the system with long travel times;
  – times of increased likelihood of contamination (e.g. seasonal variations or in
     intermittent water supplies); and
  – deterioration in water quality as a result of the condition of the distribution system
     or household storage.
• If water is supplied through point source supplies, e.g. village wells, ideally samples
  should be collected for microbiological testing from the point of collection and from
  the home in order to identify any degradation of water quality through household
  practices (e.g. storage, treatment and handling).

                                                                                                                 Compliance monitoring                39
     9.3      Review and reporting of results
     To realize the full benefit of water quality monitoring, monitoring results must be
     periodically reviewed. All monitoring data need to be examined, even if the concentrations
     are below the established parameter limits, in order to assess trends (e.g. the stability
     of concentrations over time). It is therefore important that regulations and standards
     specify requirements for routinely reporting monitoring results. (Reporting in the
     event of a parameter limit exceedance or other incident is addressed as a separate
     topic in Section 10.) As a minimum, the regulations and standards should address:
     • Who is responsible for compiling and submitting reports? This may be the
       drinking-water supplier and/or field divisions of the surveillance agency.
     • To whom should reports be submitted? Generally, reports should be submitted to
       the appropriate level within the regulatory (or surveillance) agency. In cases where
       monitoring is led by an entity other than the water supplier, e.g. the surveillance
       agency, it is critical that results are also shared with the water supplier as soon as
       possible after the results become available.
     • How often should reports be compiled and submitted? This will generally be
       more frequent (e.g. monthly) for larger, better resourced water suppliers and less
       frequent (e.g. annually) for smaller water suppliers.
     • How will the results be shared with consumers? Regulations and standards should
       require results to be shared with consumers. It is important to consider how, how
       often and possibly in what format the monitoring results will be made available to
       consumers. For example, results may be disseminated through a website, posted
       or available for review at the office of the water supplier, provided upon request
       and/or summarized in a publicly available annual report.

     9.4      Analytical requirements
     To strengthen the accuracy of water quality monitoring results, regulations and
     standards should specify analytical requirements, which may include methods to be
     used, requirements for laboratory certification or accreditation, quality assurance and
     quality control, sampling guidelines and training and skills of analysts or sample collectors.

     Various collections of “standard” or “recommended” methods for water analysis have
     been published by a number of national and international agencies. It is often thought
     that adequate analytical accuracy can be achieved provided that all laboratories use
     the same standard method. However, experience shows that this is not always the
     case, as a variety of factors may affect the accuracy of the results. Examples of issues
     that can lead to inaccurate results include: reagent impurity; the type of apparatus
     used; the performance, calibration and general maintenance of the apparatus used;



40   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
the degree of modification of the method applied by the laboratory; and the skill and
care of the analyst. These factors are likely to vary both between laboratories and
over time within an individual laboratory. Moreover, the precision and accuracy that
can be achieved with a particular method frequently depends upon the adequacy of
sampling and nature of the sample.

A number of considerations are important in specifying analytical requirements:
• While the use of standard methods is ideal, alternatives could be considered provided
  that they have been validated to confirm that they are fit for their intended uses.
• The overriding consideration in selecting methods is that the method chosen is
  demonstrated to have the required sensitivity and accuracy. Other factors, such
  as speed and convenience, should be considered only in selecting among methods
  that meet this primary criterion.
• A list of approved analytical methods could be included in an appendix to the main
  document. Alternatively, a set of minimum performance characteristics of the
  methods could be established, including limits of quantification, which need to be
  below regulatory limits.
• External laboratory certification is highly desirable. However, if not available, the
  regulations and standards could instead specify an approval process for laboratories.
  Requirements such as application of standard methods, quality assurance and control,
  and skills and training of analysts could be described in an appendix to the main
  document or in supporting guidance.

It is also important to consider field testing when specifying analytical requirements. Many
types of low-cost, portable field test kits are available to measure the concentrations
of various contaminants in water, e.g. E. coli, chlorine residuals, turbidity, pH and some
chemicals. Some parameters, such as chlorine residuals and temperature, have to be
measured in the field given their instability. Field test kits have the advantage of being
simple to use in non-laboratory environments and are often available at relatively
low prices, and they allow those carrying out the testing (e.g. surveillance officers) to
share and discuss results with operators or community members during site visits.
However, their analytical accuracy is generally lower than laboratory methods. Many
of the test kits are semi-quantitative, while others simply measure the presence or
absence of a contaminant. However, when properly used, they provide valuable tools
for rapidly assessing numerous contaminants in a non-formal laboratory setting at low
cost compared with commercial laboratory tests, and may be particularly useful for
monitoring in remote settings. It is recommended that field test kits be validated for
performance against reference or standard methods and approved for use. Regular
calibration of test kits is also required. Quality assurance of all analytical methods and
testing is essential regardless of who is carrying out the activities.


                                                                   Compliance monitoring       41
     10 Incident protocols
     Incident response and reporting protocols should be addressed in drinking-water
     quality regulations and standards to protect public health in the event of a parameter
     exceedance or other incident, such as a major fault or loss of treatment.

     If a parameter limit established in the regulations and standards is exceeded, or
     if another type of incident or contamination event occurs that may impair safety,
     the water supplier should take appropriate action as quickly as possible to prevent
     unacceptable risks to consumers. It is also important to report the issue to the
     appropriate agency or agencies, which should be identified in the regulations and
     standards. The regulations and standards may also specify the timeframe in which such
     reports need to be submitted to the appropriate agency or agencies.

     Broad indications of what must be done could be included in the regulations and
     standards. Refer to Annex 1 for more guidance on this issue.




42   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Annex 1
Responding to exceedances

Occasionally, a test result will exceed an established parameter limit even in systems that
are usually in compliance with all of the parameter limits. Such results can arise from
a number of causes that are related to analytical error, or they can happen by chance
through variations within the analytical procedure, particularly if the concentrations
are normally close to the parametric limit for the analytical procedure. Such causes
should never be assumed, and all exceedances require investigation to determine if
the result is credible and to check that there is no threat to public health.

While an investigation for an exceedance of the parameter limit for E. coli is essential
due to the immediate public health threats from a single exposure, investigation for
an exceedance of a chemical parameter limit is also important because the result may
be an indication of a more severe problem. Decisions should be made on the basis
of facts rather than assumptions.

Guidance following detection of E. coli (or thermotolerant coliforms)
All reasonable actions should be taken to ensure that E. coli is not present in samples
of drinking-water. However, in practice, low concentrations of E. coli may occasionally
be detected. If this occurs, an immediate investigation should be undertaken including
the following actions:
• Immediately collect further samples to confirm the presence of E. coli, identify
  possible sources and extent of the contamination. As a minimum, if E. coli is detected:
  – In piped systems: A repeat sample should be collected from the original sample
    location, an upstream sample location (e.g. a service reservoir) and a downstream
    sample location.
  – At the consumer’s tap: One repeat sample should be collected at the tap, another
    one outside the house, and another one in a house nearby to determine if the
    problem is in the distribution network or in the household system.
  – In non-piped systems: A repeat sample should be collected from the point of
    supply (e.g. hand pump).
• If the contamination is widespread through the system, immediately inspect the
  catchment area to identify the possible source of contamination.
• Immediately inspect the drinking-water system to identify and rectify any failures,
  including breaks in pipework, or failure or poor performance of treatment processes
  (e.g. check disinfectant residuals in disinfected systems).
• In disinfected systems, concentrations of the disinfectant could be increased, service
  tanks could be chlorinated, or mains flushing could be considered.

                                                                                  Annex 1     43
     • In non-disinfected systems, consider chlorination as a temporary emergency measure.
     • Where corrective actions are taken, further samples should be collected to verify
       they have been effective.
     • If E. coli is detected in repeat samples, or if faults are identified that could lead to
       repeat events, the health regulator should be notified to enable further action to
       be determined.

     Guidance following exceedance of chemical and radiological parameters
     Exceedance of chemical or radiological parameters should be a signal, as a minimum, to:
     • Collect further samples to confirm exceedances and assess the persistence of the
       chemical or radionuclide.
     • Investigate the cause with a view to taking remedial action as necessary.
     • Consult the authority responsible for public health for advice on suitable action,
       taking into account the extent of exceedance, duration of exceedance, intake of the
       substance from sources other than drinking-water, the toxicity of the substance, the
       likelihood and nature of any adverse effects, the practicality of remedial measures
       and the availability of alternative water supplies.

     Chemicals almost invariably require long-term exposure to high levels to cause health
     effects and, generally, there is a substantial margin of safety built into the GDWQ
     guideline values. Therefore, exceedance does not necessarily imply health effects and
     the extent of any health impact depends on the value and duration of the exceedance.
     Refer to Annex 2 for guidance in assessing risks to health from chemical contaminants.

     These general principles are also applicable to radiological parameters. However,
     confirmed exceedance of the screening value should trigger a more detailed investigation
     to determine which radionuclides are present.




44   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Annex 2
Implications of exceeding chemical guideline
values

This annex provides guidance on how to assess the health risks if monitoring indicates
that the GDWQ guideline value or national/subnational parameter limit is exceeded.
This guidance may also be useful in tailoring the GDWQ guideline values to national
contexts.

This annex does not attempt to give guidance on acute values in emergencies or in
rapid responses.

In assessing health risks, it should be remembered that chemical guideline values in the
GDWQ are generally conservative with respect to the health endpoints considered.
For example, values for threshold chemicals1 are based on the most sensitive endpoint,
incorporate large safety factors, and generally assume lifetime continuous exposure
at the guideline value concentration. Values for non-threshold chemicals (usually
genotoxic carcinogens) are based on potentially causing less than one excess cancer
per 100 000 people after 70 continuous years of exposure at the guideline value
concentration using conservative models.

Assessing risks to health from chemical contaminants
Stage 1 is to determine the magnitude of exceedance against the GDWQ guideline
value or the parameter limit established in the drinking-water quality regulations and
standards.

Stage 2 is to determine the expected period of exposure to the elevated level and
whether it is short term (e.g. hours or days) or longer term (e.g. weeks, months or
years).

GDWQ guideline values are generally protective for lifetime exposure. For these
chemicals, when the guideline value is exceeded for a shorter period, a small exceedance
is unlikely to result in any discernible increase in risk.

When a longer term exceedance is anticipated, there will be a need to consider either
issuing public notification or a derogation allowing the exceedance for a period, during


1
    Threshold chemicals are those chemicals for which a level of exposure exists below which adverse effects will not occur even after a long-term
    exposure.


                                                                                                                                        Annex 2      45
     which action can be taken to remedy the situation. A derogation should only be
     granted following an assessment of the risk to public health, and usually there will be
     a specified period allowed to remedy the problem. In some exceptional cases, often
     with small supplies, a derogation may be allowed for an extended period, but should
     be reviewed at intervals.

     Stage 3 is to review the assumptions and uncertainties involved in the derivation of
     the GDWQ guideline value or parameter limit, including:
     • Assumed exposure from drinking-water compared with other sources of
       exposure: Where the guideline value or parameter limit was derived assuming a
       proportion of a TDI or ADI allocated to drinking-water,1 it may be appropriate to
       adjust the proportion allocated to drinking-water, which will impact the concentration
       considered safe in drinking-water. The allocation assumed in the GDWQ is typically
       20%, although there can be variation depending on the substance. Where exposure
       from other sources is less than assumed, it is possible to increase the allocation to
       drinking-water to derive a new value against which to compare the concentration
       of the parameter detected. For example, the GDWQ guideline value for barium of
       1.3 mg/l is based on the allocation of 20% of a TDI of 0.21 mg/kg body weight for a
       60 kg adult drinking 2 litres of water, and is based on a lifetime study in laboratory
       animals. If less barium is believed to be coming from other exposure routes than
       assumed in the GDWQ, allowing an allocation of 30% of the TDI to come from
       water would allow a parameter limit of 1.9 mg/l, or potentially 2 mg/l after rounding.
       Another example could be carbon tetrachloride, which was widely used as an industrial
       solvent and degreasing agent and is found as a contaminant in some groundwaters
       impacted by poor disposal practices. The GDWQ guideline value is based on an
       allocation of 10% of the TDI to drinking-water. However, exposure from food has
       fallen significantly in most countries, therefore it may be appropriate to increase
       the allocation of the TDI to drinking-water, taking into account actual exposure.
     • Considerations for non-threshold chemicals: As noted earlier, the models used
       to derive these guideline values are often conservative. The models compute an
       estimate of risk at a particular level of exposure, along with upper and lower bounds
       of confidence on the calculation. The lower bound may be zero or below zero, and
       the GDWQ guideline values are set according to the upper-bound value. This value
       does not equate to the number of cases of cancer that will be caused by exposure
       to the substance at this level; rather, it is the maximum potential risk, and it is highly
       probable that the actual level of risk is less than this.



     1
         ADI or TDI cover exposure from all sources, e.g. food, water, air, soil and consumer products.




46   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
In establishing drinking-water quality regulations and standards, countries may
consider that a different level of hypothetical risk is more appropriate than less than
one excess cancer per 100 000 people (risk level of 10-5) after 70 continuous years
of exposure, which is the risk level associated with these GDWQ guideline values.
The guideline values could be multiplied or divided by 10, relating to a risk level of
10-4 or 10-6, respectively. At the lower risk level, this may also require consideration
of non-cancer endpoints. However, as indicated, a small exceedance may not have
any (or only marginal) public health implications.




                                                                               Annex 2     47
     Annex 3
     Additional microbial indicators

     This annex presents information on coliform bacteria and heterotrophic plate counts
     (HPCs), particularly their value and limitations as indicators of drinking-water quality.
     For more information on these and other microbial indicators, see Chapter 7.4 of the
     GDWQ, the microbial fact sheets in Chapter 11 of the GDWQ and Assessing microbial
     safety of drinking water: Improving approaches and methods (OECD, WHO, 2003).

     Coliform bacteria
     Coliform bacteria include a wide range of bacteria traditionally defined by their
     ability to produce acid from lactose or demonstrate the presence of ß-galactosidase
     enzyme on laboratory media at 35°–37°C. Coliform bacteria occur in both sewage
     and natural waters and some, such as E. coli, are excreted in the faeces of humans and
     other animals. However, because the coliform bacteria group includes organisms that
     can survive and grow in water and plumbing systems, total coliforms are not a useful
     indicator of faecal pathogens and are of limited value in standards.

     Coliform bacteria can be a useful operational indicator, however. Coliform bacteria
     can be used to assess the cleanliness and integrity of distribution systems, as their
     presence can reveal regrowth and possible biofilm formation or contamination through
     the ingress of foreign material, including soil or plant material. Also, their presence
     immediately after disinfection indicates inadequate treatment. In the absence of E. coli,
     their presence in treated water samples may indicate a need to further investigate the
     cause of contamination rather than holding any significance as a contravention of a
     specified numerical value for compliance. If the drinking-water supply is not disinfected,
     coliform bacteria may be detected regularly.

     Heterotrophic plate counts (colony counts)
     HPCs will detect a wide range of heterotrophic microorganisms, including bacteria and
     fungi, based on the ability of the microorganisms to grow on the particular medium
     and at a defined temperature in the time period used for measurement. HPCs have
     no value as an indicator of the presence of faecal contamination or pathogens but
     can be useful, and are better than total coliforms, for operational monitoring of the
     efficacy of treatment processes (including disinfection) and the integrity of distribution
     systems. However, they are not a high priority where resources for monitoring are
     limited. HPC results can be highly variable and actual numerical counts are of limited




48   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
value, but the range of counts from regular sampling at particular locations within
the distribution system using the same analytical method can be useful. Changes of an
order of magnitude from an expected normal range may be an indication of a problem
with treatment or the distribution system, which requires investigation.




                                                                             Annex 3    49
     Annex 4
     Practical guidance on selected chemical and
     acceptability parameters

     This annex provides practical general guidance on some parameters for which questions
     are often raised by those developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards.
     This list is not exhaustive. Inclusion of a parameter in this annex does not imply that
     the parameter would typically be a candidate for inclusion in regulations and standards.

     For the parameters in this annex, and all other parameters of interest, more information
     can be obtained from:
     • GDWQ: Acceptability aspects (Chapter 10): In addition to biologically derived
       contaminants, this chapter provides additional information on 26 chemically derived
       contaminants than can result in acceptability issues.
     • GDWQ: Chemical fact sheets (Chapter 12): This chapter includes a summary
       of occurrence and health information for over 140 chemicals. Where a guideline
       value has been derived, information on analytical methods and treatment are also
       included. Further details on these chemicals are included in the chemical background
       documents that informed the development of these fact sheets (see: http://www.
       who.int/water_sanitation_health/water-quality/guidelines/chemicals/en/#B).
     • Chemical safety of drinking-water: Assessing priorities for risk management
       (WHO, 2007): Appendix 4 (Practical comments on selected parameters) provides
       some guidance on 51 contaminants, including monitoring advice, based on broad
       experience worldwide.

     Algal toxins: Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) can occur in large numbers (called
     blooms) in surface water bodies used for water supply. Some species of cyanobacteria
     contain toxins of concern for human health (e.g. microcystins) and these toxins can be
     released into the drinking-water when the algal cells are damaged. There is a range of
     toxins and it is probable that not all of the toxins have been identified. These toxins
     can be difficult to analyse at low concentrations in water. There are treatments to
     remove the toxins but these require careful assessment and operation so prevention is
     the primary management approach. Where heavy blooms occur, it is best to consider
     alternative sources of water unless appropriate and validated treatment is available. It
     is not usually considered necessary to monitor for toxins as the presence of blooms
     can be observed visually in water bodies.




50   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Arsenic: Arsenic is commonly found in groundwater in many parts of the world at
high concentrations. It is the only substance that has been proven to be a cause of
cancer in humans as a consequence of exposure through drinking-water. There is a
great deal of uncertainty as to the concentration that is a practical no effect level and
the basis of the GDWQ guideline value is practical achievability. Every effort should
therefore be made to keep concentrations as low as reasonably possible and below
the guideline value when resources are available. However, achievability may carry a
very heavy cost in relation to small supplies in particular, but also for larger municipal
supplies. See Box 8.2 for an example from Bangladesh of setting the national parameter
limit for arsenic at a higher level than the GDWQ guideline value on the basis of a local
health risk assessment. Ideally, it is important that the guideline value be retained as
a long-term goal and that the standard is included in a process of improvement that
will provide an equitable outcome for all consumers.

Where arsenic-rich water is used to irrigate crops such as rice, exposure may be
increased through accumulation in the crop. Under these circumstances, achievability
and practicality are important and there is an argument for differentiation between
large municipal supplies and small supplies and for stepped changes in drinking-water
quality regulations and standards to allow time for the introduction of appropriate
interventions.

Where concentrations are likely to be stable (i.e. deep groundwater), monitoring would
normally only need to take place infrequently. Where water supplies for populations
are subject to treatment to remove arsenic, samples are normally best taken at the
treatment works, where the frequency of monitoring should be sufficient to ensure
that the process is effective.

Asbestos: Asbestos fibres can be found in water naturally and from asbestos cement
pipes. There is little credible evidence of health effects arising from waterborne
asbestos. However, asbestos cement pipe deteriorates as the cement is leached away
and this results in threats to the integrity of the pipe. While it is not recommended
that existing asbestos cement pipes are removed, it is not considered appropriate to
lay new asbestos cement pipe. It is not recommended to monitor for asbestos fibres.

Disinfectants and disinfection by-products: Chlorine is often used to provide a
residual disinfectant in water supply systems to help maintain the hygienic status of
the distribution system. A free chlorine residual of at least 0.2 mg/l throughout the
distribution system is generally considered optimal under normal conditions, increasing
to greater than 0.5 mg/l during faecal contamination events or potential waterborne
disease outbreaks.



                                                                                 Annex 4     51
     Chlorine can react with natural organic matter to produce unwanted by-products such
     as THMs. WHO emphasises that disinfection efficacy should never be compromised by
     attempts to meet standards for DBPs. It is important to try and minimize by-product
     formation by removing as much organic matter as possible by optimizing coagulation
     and sedimentation where organic concentrations are elevated, such as in many surface
     sources. However, standards for DBPs are not as high a priority as other contaminants
     such as arsenic and fluoride. It should be noted that many countries have established
     standards for total THMs and total HAAs at about 100 and 80 µg/l, respectively. Both
     THMs and HAAs change in distribution. Where hypochlorite is used as a source of
     free chlorine, it may deteriorate to produce high concentrations of chlorate. While
     standards may not be a high priority, it may be appropriate to specify that appropriate
     management procedures should be implemented, such as not storing for longer than
     necessary and not mixing old and new hypochlorite. See the GDWQ chemical fact
     sheet in Chapter 12 (WHO, 2017a) for additional information.

     Fluoride: Fluoride is found in many parts of the world, particularly in groundwater.
     Fluoride can cause adverse effects on teeth and bones and, at very high concentrations,
     can cause crippling skeletal malformation called skeletal fluorosis. WHO suggests a
     guideline value of 1.5 mg/l to avoid discolouration of tooth enamel, but the value
     depends on the intake of water and the potential for exposure from other sources
     such as food. WHO has assessed fluoride and has suggested that significant effects
     are unlikely if the intake is less than 6 mg fluoride per day, but that above an intake
     of 14 mg fluoride per day, there is clear evidence for an increasing risk of adverse
     skeletal effects.

     Understanding the likely exposure from other sources is important. For example, if
     a large amount of brick tea is consumed as a beverage, this may be high in fluoride.
     Where crops are irrigated with water with high concentrations of fluoride, there
     may be some accumulation of fluoride in food, e.g. rice. See Box 8.2 for an example
     from India where fluoride intake is managed in part by reducing fluoride levels in
     irrigation water.

     Lead: In the case of a contaminant such as lead, which primarily comes from plumbing,
     solder or fittings containing lead in buildings, the concentration will vary according to
     the period that the water has been in contact with the lead bearing material. Therefore,
     it is not possible to make an assessment of the potential risk to consumers from just
     one sample or one property. Assessment of the risk requires consideration of exposure
     of the most vulnerable groups (usually bottle-fed infants and small children) over a
     period of several days, as it is the average exposure of an individual that is important.
     This is particularly important because the lead guideline value is not based on health
     but on practical considerations, and lead concentrations should be maintained as low

52   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
as reasonably practical. New sources of lead should not be introduced and low lead
alloy fittings should be used both in repairs and new installations.

Nitrate: Nitrate can reach surface and groundwater from agricultural activities, such
as spreading manure or excessive application of other nitrogen-rich fertilizers. It can
also come from poorly sited and maintained latrines and septic tanks. High nitrate
and nitrite concentrations well above the guideline value can give rise to blue-baby
syndrome in bottle-fed infants, particularly where there is endemic diarrhoea in infants.
It is therefore important to maintain good microbiological quality where nitrate and
nitrite levels are elevated. Nitrite and nitrate need to be considered together, but
monitoring for nitrite is difficult because formation will be in the distribution system.
Nitrate levels in surface waters can change quite quickly, but levels in groundwater
usually change very slowly unless the groundwater is heavily influenced by surface water.

Parameters affecting acceptability
Aluminium: Aluminium can occur in raw water, but the most important source is from its
use as a coagulant in drinking-water treatment. There is no guideline value for aluminium
in the GDWQ, but high concentrations reaching the distribution system can result in
deposits of aluminium flocs, which cause unacceptable turbidity or discolouration at the
tap if they are disturbed. Concentrations can normally be maintained below 0.2 mg/l, and
less than 0.1 mg/l should be easily achievable in well-run large treatment works. Control
is best achieved by optimizing coagulation and filtration, which are important barriers
against pathogenic microorganisms. Monitoring of aluminium is sometimes carried out
in the final water from treatment works for operational reasons.

Ammonia: Ammonia can be present in some drinking-water sources. Although it is
of no direct risk to health, it readily combines with free chlorine to form chloramines,
which are not as effective as primary disinfectants, and which can give rise to
unacceptable tastes if certain chloramines (e.g. dichloramine or trichloramine) are
formed. Ammonia is occasionally found in distribution systems where chloramine
is used as a residual disinfectant and if the process of producing chloramine is not
sufficiently well controlled. Monitoring could be carried out in the final water from
treatment works, but other parameters (e.g. free chlorine) are normally considered
to be more important.

Conductivity: Conductivity is a measure of the inorganic ion content of water and is
not of direct concern for health. High conductivity may be an indicator of acceptability
in high total dissolved solids (TDS) waters, and sudden changes can be an indicator
of pollution or ingress into distribution. It may therefore be a useful indicator or
operational parameter.


                                                                                Annex 4     53
     Dissolved oxygen: Dissolved oxygen is an indicator parameter and measurement
     can be used in a relative, not absolute, sense. It would not normally be a candidate
     for standard setting.

     Hardness: Hardness is a natural feature of water, reflecting calcium and magnesium,
     as carbonates, bicarbonates and sulphates. It is normally very stable. It can cause
     scale formation in distribution systems and plumbing in buildings, but it is not of
     consideration for health.

     Manganese and iron: Both occur naturally, ferric salts are used as coagulants, and
     iron can arise in distribution due to the corrosion of cast-iron pipes. Both metals
     can give rise to deposition in distribution with discolouration of water that may be
     unacceptable to consumers. There is new evidence that high manganese in drinking-
     water, where it remains in solution, such as in some anaerobic groundwaters, may
     have an adverse impact on learning capacity in young children, although there remain
     many uncertainties. WHO has proposed a health-based value and the lack of a
     formal guideline value does not mean that manganese is of no concern when soluble
     manganese concentrations are elevated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the
     health-based value is above concentrations of manganese normally causing acceptability
     problems in drinking-water and, accordingly, aesthetic as well as health aspects should
     be considered when setting drinking-water quality regulations and standards, and
     confirming the acceptability of drinking-water. Monitoring of manganese is only likely
     to be required for operational reasons where a potential problem has been identified,
     in which case, final water from the treatment works would normally be the most
     appropriate sample site. In some acidic or anaerobic groundwaters, manganese may
     stay in solution, even at levels exceeding 0.1 mg/l – the level that can cause impacts
     on taste and staining of laundry. However, these are normally smaller supplies and
     they may still be acceptable to consumers. Under these circumstances there may be a
     requirement to set a health-based standard and to instigate some form of monitoring
     to ensure control measures are working.

     Iron is controlled at the treatment works by optimizing treatment, and in distribution
     systems by a structured programme of maintenance. Iron is rarely a direct health concern
     in water. Monitoring is normally for operational reasons but may be undertaken in
     the final water from the treatment works, and in the distribution system.

     pH: pH is an important operational parameter, particularly in terms of the effectiveness
     of chlorination or the optimization of coagulation. It can be an important factor
     in corrosion of metals in distribution systems and plumbing, but it is not of direct
     concern for health.



54   Developing drinking-water quality regulations and standards
Taste and odour: Taste and odour are important for acceptability and drinking-water
should be acceptable to consumers. There are many factors that can impact taste or
odour that are not normally of direct concern for health, including chloride, sulfate,
hydrogen sulphide and some cyanobacteria.

Total organic carbon: Total organic carbon (TOC) is a measure of the amount of
dissolved organic carbon in water. It is non-specific and is not of direct concern for
health, but sudden changes can be an operational indicator of pollution and high TOC
is often reflected by high DBPs.

Turbidity: Turbidity is an important operational parameter as an indicator of the
efficiency of the treatment processes coagulation, sedimentation and filtration. Removal
of turbidity improves the effectiveness of chlorination, can help to minimize the
formation of DBPs, and is an indicator of the removal of microorganisms in filtration.
High turbidity at 4 NTU (nephelometric turbidity unit) and above can be seen by
consumers and may be unacceptable at the tap. However, efforts should be made
to reduce turbidity as much as possible through treatment and before distribution.
Large, well-run municipal supplies should be able to achieve less than 0.5 NTU before
disinfection at all times and an average of 0.2 NTU or less, irrespective of source
water type and quality. For further information on uses and significance of turbidity
in drinking-water, including turbidity targets for filtration and disinfection, as well as
guidance on monitoring frequency, see Water quality and health – Review of turbidity:
Information for regulators and operators of water supplies (WHO, 2017c).
