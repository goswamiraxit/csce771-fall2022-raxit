Role of the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality

The Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ) are one of the longest-standing normative
publications of the World Health Organization (WHO), with the first edition published in
1958. The GDWQ are an international reference point for the establishment of national or
regional regulations and standards for water safety. They are addressed to water and health
regulators, policy-makers and their advisors, mainly to assist them in the development of
national standards. The GDWQ are also used by many others as a source of information on
water quality and health and on effective management approaches.

The GDWQ include an assessment of the
health risks presented by the various                 Box 1. Guidance levels, guideline

quality standards. To better understand the
extent to which the GDWQ are used and
reflected in these standards, a global review of
various country regulations and policies was
conducted. This report summarizes information from 104 countries and territories on values
specified in national drinking-water quality standards for aesthetic, chemical, microbiological
and radiological parameters. The aim of the report is to enable regulators and other key
stakeholders to access and compare data when setting or revising national drinking-water
quality standards, although comparison should be approached with caution. The report is not
intended to provide guidance on selecting appropriate parameters and parameter limits for
drinking-water quality standards. The separate publication, Developing Drinking-water Quality
Regulations and Standards (WHO, in press) should be consulted for such guidance.

Data sources and methods

The data reviewed in the report were obtained from members of the WHO International
Network of Drinking-water Regulators (RegNet)1, WHO regional and country office contacts,
through internet searches or purchased from the relevant standards organizations. Data were
collected for 104 countries and territories (Figure 1) up to 2015, and were reviewed and
validated. The data validation entailed an online public review, as well as review by WHO
regional and country office contacts, and RegNet members, who were asked to clarify
inconsistencies and provide data updates wherever relevant.




    Figure 1: Countries and territories represented in the survey

These countries and territories have a total population of approximately 6.5 billion people,
representing approximately 89 % of the world population2. Countries that are members of the
European Union (EU) are subject to the requirements of its Drinking-water Directive and
European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) which specifies radionuclide requirements.
However, all these countries have their own regulations, some of which differ from the

Directive with more stringent requirements or include additional parameters. In addition, it is
understood that the following countries and territories use the standards specified in the
GDWQ without currently publishing separate documentation listing regulatory parameters and
values at the time that data for this report were collected: Burkina Faso, Kiribati, Kuwait, Mali,
Nauru, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu.

Countries and territories specify parameter values for drinking-water quality in a variety of
formats; regulations, standards, specifications, laws, decrees, requirements and norms. For the
purposes of this report these are all referred to as standards. The drinking-water quality
standards specified by countries and territories for inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals,
aesthetic and microbiological parameters were compared to the GV or HBV; and radiological
parameters were compared to the GL of the fourth edition of the GDWQ (WHO, 2011)3.

This report does not include detailed background information on the parameters, including
derivation and adaptation of guideline values and appropriate risk management strategies; the
report should be read in conjunction with the GDWQ to provide this information. The report
also does not include the extent and effectiveness of compliance monitoring by national
regulatory authorities against national standards, including information on how many samples
are required or taken for each parameter; or whether drinking-water quality in each country and
territory meets the values specified.

Documentation and the report

According to the documentation reviewed, the oldest specifications of values for drinking-
water in current use date back to 1978. Fourteen countries and territories’ values, (42 including
the members of the European Union (EU) through the European Drinking-water Directive)
date to the 1990s. However, many EU Member States have implemented the Directive through
more recent documentation but these have not been included in the survey because they differ
little in requirements from the original Directive. The other 62 countries and territories have
produced documentation in the year 2000 and later. As countries and territories often review
their legislation and values, these findings are constantly subject to change.

  The most recent edition of the GDWQ is the fourth edition, first addendum published in 2017. For the first
addendum, risk assessments for the following parameters have been revised, resulting in updated guideline or
health-based values: barium, bentazone, diquat and MCPA. As the first addendum was published after the cut-off
date for the review and further, as countries have had little time to consider the first addendum in their national
standards, an analysis against these updated values has not been included in this document. Information on the
changes made in the first addendum to the fourth edition of the GDWQ can be found at the following link:
http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/gdwq4-1st-addendum/en/


                                                         4
Thirty-seven countries and territories directly reference the GDWQ in their standards, although
this number is likely to be higher because the full documentation was not available in all cases.
Botswana and Pakistan list the WHO GV alongside their values.

Although the GDWQ encourage countries and territories to set their own water-quality
standards to ensure they are locally relevant in terms of parameters included, limits, etc., none
of the documentation received includes a full explanation on why parameters are included and
how countries and territories derived their values, including where they differ from the WHO
GV. However, this is now becoming more readily available in separate documentation such as
that produced by Health Canada. Others more generally reference WHO and other countries
and territories’ values, such as those of the European Union, the United States of America,
Nigeria and South Africa. Some countries and territories’ standards also reference the
analytical method required. In some cases the names of the members of expert committees
who drew up the values are listed.

Some countries and territories include in their standards details of the likely origin of
parameters and their associated risk. This may help the understanding of those who have to
control and analyze drinking-water quality. Examples are Australia, the Dominican Republic,
Fiji, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Uruguay and the
USA. Other countries and territories may provide similar information in separate
documentation or consider the information included in the GDWQ sufficient.

In addition to setting values for specific parameters, many countries and territories’
documentation includes a general statement along the lines of: “water intended for human
consumption should: not contain concentrations of compounds which could, either alone or in
combination with other compounds, be harmful to human health; and not contain any micro-
organisms and parasites in such a number that could be harmful to human health”.

For the purposes of this report, all values for chemical parameters have been converted to mg/l.
The values used in this report are the highest listed by countries and territories in their
standards for normal (non-emergency or severe weather-affected) water supplies. Not all the
values countries and territories have listed are mandatory; some are advisory, for guidance or
occasionally described as operational. This applies particularly to the aesthetic and other
parameters. The GDWQ suggest values with a wide margin of safety, and countries and
territories are advised to adapt their drinking-water quality standards to local conditions and
circumstances.



                                                 5
For clarity and convenience this report has adopted the terms “higher” or “above” for values
greater than those specified in the GDWQ and “lower” or “below” for values less than those
specified in the GDWQ. Countries and territories may have good reasons to specify a value
more, or less stringent than WHO based on an overall risk-benefit strategy to protect public
health, whereby scarce resources directed to provide greatest public health benefits. In
addition, differences in the number of parameters specified by countries and territories are to
be expected, according to the relevance of the parameters to the countries and territories
concerned. A list of source documentation used in this survey is provided at the end of the
report.

Inorganic parameters

The 4th edition of the GDWQ includes GVs or HBVs for 24 inorganic parameters. All 104
countries and territories specify values for copper, lead and nitrate, and all but one specify
values for manganese. The least specified inorganic parameters were: beryllium (12 out 104
countries); glyphosate (11); and uranium (17). All the median values equalled or were below
the GV except for cadmium (GV 0.003 mg/l, median 0.005 mg/l).

 It is possible to reduce the concentration of chlorine effectively to zero (<0.1 mg/l) by reduction; however, it is
normal practice to supply water with a chlorine dioxide residual of a few tenths of a milligram per litre to provide
some protection against microbial regrowth during distribution.

Chlorine is the inorganic parameter with the largest range between minimum and maximum.
No country had a value above the GV. Thirty two countries and territories specified a level
below 1 mg/l. Eleven countries and territories specified the GV. Some countries and
territories set a range, specifying minimum and maximum levels. It was not always clear if the
set value referred to free or total chlorine.

The GDWQ link together glyphosate and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid
(AMPA). Because of their low toxicity, the health-based value derived for AMPA alone or in
combination with glyphosate is orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of glyphosate
or AMPA normally found in drinking-water. Under usual conditions, therefore, the presence of
glyphosate and AMPA in drinking-water does not represent a hazard to human health. For this
reason, the establishment of a formal guideline value for glyphosate and AMPA is not deemed
necessary. Glyphosate is one of the least specified parameters; with only 11 out of the 104
countries and territories setting a value. No country or territory specified a value for AMPA.

 The GV was changed to a HBV in the 4 edition of the GDWQ, recognizing that manganese is not of health
concern at levels normally causing acceptability problems in drinking-water. Manganese can cause aesthetic
issues, including taste impacts and staining of laundry at concentrations above 0.1 mg/l. However, there are
circumstances in which manganese can remain in solution at concentrations of health concern in some acidic or
anaerobic waters, particularly groundwaters. Therefore, aesthetic as well as health aspects should be considered in
the establishment of standards and confirming the acceptability of drinking-water.
All countries and territories in the survey set a value for manganese with the exception of one.
The majority set a value below the previous GV. Some countries and territories listed the
parameter as aesthetic, some as inorganic, and some as both.

 The GDWQ also include a value for combined nitrate plus nitrite as: The sum of the ratios of the concentrations as reported or detected in the
sample of each to its guideline value should not exceed 1.


Nitrate is one of only three inorganic parameters with a value set by all countries and territories
in the survey. Many quoted their value as 10 mg/l (as N) which has been converted to 45 mg/l
(as NO3-) for the purposes of this report but counted as being at the GV. Several countries and
territories including the European Union countries included a formula that reduces the nitrate

 The GDWQ also include a value for combined nitrate plus nitrite as: The sum of the ratios of the concentrations as reported or detected in the
sample of each to its guideline value should not exceed 1.


Many countries and territories’ values for nitrite have been based on older WHO guidance.
Only two countries had values above the revised GV. Thirty-nine countries and territories
specified the revised GV (or its equivalent as mg N/l). Several countries and territories



                                                                      17

Uranium is one of the least specified parameters; with only 17 out of the 104 countries and
territories setting a value. The majority specified a value based on the previous GV, with no
country specifying the latest.




                                                   18
Organic parameters

The 4th edition of the GDWQ includes GVs or HBVs for 89 organic parameters. The most
specified organic parameters are: aldrin and dieldrin (71 out of 104 countries and territories);
benzene (77); tetrachloroethene (71); and 1,2 dichloroethane (67). Among the least specified
values are: 2-phenylphenol (1); fenitrothion (2); nitrobenzene (3); and N-nitrosodimethylamine
(NDMA, 3). No country or territory specified a value for cyanuric acid, sodium
dichloroisocyanurate or hydroxyatrazine.

Seven countries and territories did not specify values for any inorganic parameters, while some
included notes with general requirements for low levels of pesticides. For the organic
parameters that had specifications, all but four had median values equal to or below the GV.
The exceptions were: cyanazine (GV 0.0006 mg/l, median 0.0007 mg/l), but only specified by
five countries and territories; dibromoacetonitrile (GV 0.07 mg/l, median 0.0775), specified by
16 countries and territories; dichloroacetonitrile (GV 0.02 mg/l, median 0.06 mg/l), specified
by 17 countries and territories; and vinyl chloride (GV 0.0003 mg/l, median 0.0005 mg/l),
specified by 60 countries and territories.

Forty-six countries and territories do not specify values for most individual pesticides other
than aldrin and dieldrin, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide. Instead, they include a blanket
statement that the value for all individual pesticides is 0.0001 mg/l, and for total pesticides
0.0005 mg/l (where “total pesticides” is defined as the sum of all individual pesticides detected
and quantified in the monitoring procedure), or similar requirement. Where a country or
territory does not specify a value for an individual parameter in its standards, it is not included
in the tables below.

 The GV was changed to a HBV in the 4th edition of the GDWQ, recognizing that it is not recommended for direct
addition to drinking-water as part of WHO’s policy to exclude the use of any pyrethroids for larviciding of
mosquito vectors of human disease

Permethrin was specified by 17 countries and territories. The majority specified values less
than the HBV of 0.3 mg/L, with 13 countries and territories specifying 0.02 mg/l.

Under the WHO Pesticides Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) the recommended dosage of pyriproxyfen in potable
water in containers should not exceed 0.01mg/l.

Pyroproxifen is a pesticide used for vector control in drinking-water sources and containers.
While the 3rd edition of the GDWQ included a GV of 0.3 mg/l, the 4th edition of the GDWQ
does not specify a value for pyriproxyfen as it is not considered appropriate to establish
guideline values for vector control pesticides. However, it has been included here because a

Parameters relating to acceptability, taste and odour and appearance

The GDWQ identify 26 chemically derived parameters and four biologically derived
parameters relating to acceptability, taste, odour and appearance. The importance of these
parameters is that if the water is unacceptable to consumers, it may lead to rejection of the
water, and use of other aesthetically more acceptable but potentially less-safe waters. Generally
the concentrations that cause rejection are significantly lower than those of concern for health.
As such, with the exception of manganese, which is widely found in drinking-water sources, it
may not be appropriate to directly regulate or monitor such parameters, as they may be
addressed through a general requirement in the national standard or regulation that water be
acceptable to the majority of consumers. For these parameters, the GDWQ may include a
HBV, or a GV(C) in order to assist in determining a response when problems are encountered
(and to provide reassurance with regard to possible health risks).

Some parameters have recommended values, mainly based on consumer acceptance. All the
countries and territories in the survey specified values for some of the chemical and physical
parameters. Three countries and territories included general statements that potable water
should be free of algae. Most of the values that were set were guidance or indicator levels
rather than mandatory standards.

The acceptability parameters most often specified were pH (hydrogen ion) (specified by 103
countries and territories), chloride (100), iron (99), aluminium and sulfate (97). The least
specified parameters were petroleum oils (3), and dissolved oxygen (4). In addition, 79
countries and territories had descriptive requirements for the taste parameter, and 78 for the
odour parameter, such as: “acceptable to most consumers”, “not offensive”, “not
objectionable”, “acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change”. Eighteen countries and

The threshold odour concentration of ammonia at alkaline pH is approximately 1.5 mg/l, and a
taste threshold of 35 mg/l has been proposed for the ammonium cation. Ammonia is not of
direct relevance to health at these levels, and no health-based guideline value has been

The GDWQ advise a taste threshold for calcium ion of 150 – 300 mg/l, depending on the
associated anion. Thirty-one countries and territories specified a value for this parameter,
although it was not always clear if the value specified was quoted as calcium ion or as a
calcium salt.

A GV of 3 mg/L is set for monochloramine, and the information is presented in the inorganic
parameters section. No HBV or GV is set for di- and trichloramines, as the available data is
inadequate to derive a health-based GV. For dichloramine, the organoleptic effects between 0.1
and 0.5 mg/l were found to be “slight” and “acceptable”. Odour and taste thresholds of 0.15
and 0.13 mg/l were reported, respectively. An odour threshold of 0.02 mg/l has been reported
for trichloramine, and it has been described as “geranium”. Six countries and territories set a
value for chloramines, ranging from 0.15 to 4 mg/l.

Chloride is one of the most specified aesthetic parameters, with 100 countries and territories
specifying a value. The GDWQ mention that concentrations in excess of 250 mg/l are
increasingly likely to be detected by taste, and most countries and territories specified this
value.

No GV has been set for chlorobenzene, however the GDWQ mention that odour thresholds of
0.002–0.01 and 0.0003–0.03 mg/l have been reported for 1,2- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene,
respectively. Odour thresholds of 0.01, 0.005–0.03 and 0.05 mg/l have been reported for 1,2,3-,
1,2,4- and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, respectively. A taste and odour threshold concentration of
0.03 mg/l has been reported for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Seven countries and territories
specified a value for chlorobenzene, ranging from 0.001 to 0.3 mg/L.

However, the GDWQ indicates a precautionary level of 2 mg/l, which does not present a hazard to health

Almost all countries and territories set a value for this parameter. Fifteen countries and
territories set a value above the GDWQ aesthetic limit of 0.3 mg/l at which staining of laundry
and fixtures may occur. Thirty-five countries and territories specified the lowest value of 0.2
mg/L.

The GDWQ advise that the taste threshold for magnesium is probably less than the 150 – 300
mg/l range for calcium. Thirty-four countries and territories specified a value for this
parameter, although it was not always clear whether the value specified was quoted as
magnesium ion or as a magnesium salt.

Petroleum oils can give rise to the presence of a number of low molecular weight hydrocarbons
that have low odour thresholds in drinking-water. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes
(BTEX) are considered in the organic parameters section. Only three countries and territories
set values for this parameter.

The GDWQ do not establish a GV for pH, as it usually has no direct impact on consumers at
levels found in drinking-water. It is however an important operational parameter, and the
GDWQ indicate an optimum pH range of 6.5-8.5. Only one country out of the 104 included in
the survey did not specify a value for this parameter. Forty-eight countries and territories
specified a value above the GDWQ suggested pH 8.5, but many included the note that chlorine
disinfectant is only effective below pH 8. The highest value of pH 9.7 was set by one country,
and was described as an operational limit.

The GDWQ notes that turbidity should ideally be <1 NTU for water to be disinfected and that
large well-run municipal supplies should be able to achieve turbidity levels of < 0.5 NTU at all
times, with an average of </= 0.2 NTU. It also notes that turbidity levels of 4 NTU and above
is visible to the naked eye. Sixteen countries and territories specified a value of 1 NTU or less.
Many values were accompanied by comments, including one country that specified 20 NTU
but stated that the monthly average of results must not exceed 2 NTU; and another that quoted
5 as an aesthetic limit but 1 NTU as an operational limit. Fifteen countries and territories had
descriptive statements only such as “acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change”.

The GDWQ note that zinc concentrations at around 4 mg/l may affect the taste of water.
Thirty-five out of 72 countries and territories reporting a value for this parameter specified 3
mg/l or less.




                                                   76
Radiological parameters

The GDWQ suggest screening levels for gross alpha and gross beta activity, as the process of
identifying individual radionuclides is too cost-intensive for routine monitoring given their
generally low concentration. If the screening levels for gross alpha and gross beta activity
suggested by WHO are not being exceeded, the individual dose criterion (i.e. total dose) of 0.1
milliSieverts per year (mSv/year) will usually not be exceeded either. The idea of screening
levels is that radioactivity should be assessed against these during routine monitoring. If the
screening levels are being exceeded after having taken further samples to validate the findings,
the contribution of K-40 (beta) should be subtracted from the gross beta activity following a
separate determination of total potassium. If the screening values are still being exceeded, an
analytical strategy for individual radionuclides should be determined.

In general, countries and territories that specified values for radiological parameters did not
deviate significantly from the GDWQ. Forty-eight countries and territories specified screening
values for gross alpha and gross beta activity, two in terms of a ratio or annual dose. Some
expressed their values in terms of Picocurie per litre (pCi/l); these have been converted to their
equivalents as Becquerel per litre (Bq/l) for this report. Thirty five countries and territories
specified a value for total dose in terms of mSv/yr. Only three of these also specified values
for gross alpha and beta activity.

The GDWQ list guidance levels for 191 radionuclides. However, most countries and territories
specified values for only a few of these, including: radon (seven); radium-226 (seven);
strontium-90 (five). Where countries and territories specified values for gross alpha and beta
activity and total dose, most included advice on the steps that should be taken if any of these
values were exceeded.

*
 This value is translated into operational targets to be measured by water suppliers and regulators as the screening
values (gross alpha and gross beta, which are listed in the tables below) and guidance levels (which are listed in
Table 9.2 of Chapter 9 of the GDWQ). The GDWQ notes that the IDC represents a very low level of health risk
and also refers to the International Radiation Basic Safety Standards (BSS), (IAEA, 2014) reference level. The
BSS, which is co-sponsored by eight international organizations including WHO, has established a reference level
for the radiation dose due to the consumption of drinking-water of 1 mSv/year. It is generally advisable for
countries to establish a national standard between 0.1 and 1 mSv/year, where 0.1 mSv/year is achievable for most
countries.

Almost all countries have established their IDC as 0.1 mSv/year, and the EC Council Directive
2013/51/EURATOM also adopted a total indicative dose of 0.1 mSv/year. Only two countries
out of the 36 that specified a value for this parameter set a value above 0.1 mSv/year.

Microbiological parameters

The GDWQ identify 43 microbial parameters, which include bacterial, viral, protozoan, and
helminth pathogens, as well as toxic cyanobacteria. The verification of microbial water safety
is normally based on testing of indicator organisms, and the GDWQ include a GV for
Escherichia coli (E. coli) or thermotolerant coliforms). Countries and territories in the survey
designated numerical standards for 24 microbiological parameters. However, nine of these
parameters were designated by only one country and a further nine by less than ten countries
and territories.

Values for E. coli (or faecal coliforms or thermotolerant coliforms) were specified by 102
countries and territories, then total coliforms (97 countries and territories), enterococci (faecal
streptococci) (46 countries and territories), sulphite-reducing Clostridia (Clostridium
perfringens) (44 countries and territories), total heterotrophic bacteria at 22°C(19 countries and
territories) and total heterotrophic bacteria at 37°C (13 countries and territories). The other
parameters were: Enteric viruses and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight countries and territories);
Cryptosporidium and Giardia (five countries and territories); Salmonella, somatic coliphages
and Staphlococcus aureus (four countries and territories); pathogenic protozoa and Shigella
(three countries and territories); and amoeba, Vibrio cholera, free living organisms, helminths,
Legionella, nematodes, parasites and plankton (one country).

The normal value for microbiological parameters, other than heterotrophic bacteria, was zero
or absent per volume (usually 100 ml for bacterial parameters and 10 litres for protozoa)
although many countries and territories’ values accepted that coliform bacteria would be
detected in samples on occasions.

In addition to setting values for some microbiological parameters, many countries and
territories’ documentation included a statement the same as or similar to that in the European
Drinking-water Directive that drinking-water “shall be free from any micro-organisms and
parasites which, in numbers or concentrations, constitute a potential danger to human health”.

 Minimum value set                                                             0 per 100 ml

The GDWQ state that Clostridium perfringens has only limited value as a possible indicator of
enteric viruses and protozoan (oo)cysts but may be useful as an indicator of the effectiveness of
filtration processes. All countries and territories specifying a value for this parameter specified
zero per 100 ml (or in some cases 20 ml or 50 ml) for this parameter.

Coliform bacteria (Total)
 WHO Guideline value                                                        None specified

 Maximum value set                                                          150 per 100 ml
 Minimum value set                                                             0 per 100 ml
 Median value                                                                  0 per 100 ml

The GDWQ highlight that total coliform bacteria include organisms that can survive and grow
in water so they are not useful as an indicator of faecal pathogens. It recommends that total
coliforms should be absent immediately after treatment and presence of these organisms
indicates inadequate treatment. Few countries and territories appeared to recognize this in their
setting values. While six countries and territories did not specify a value for total coliforms,
the others generally specified a value of zero for this parameter. Some specified <1.1 per 100
ml for analysis by most probable number technique. Where the value specified was greater
than zero (e.g. 10 per 100 ml; 6 per 100 ml; or 3 per 100 ml), in most cases this was qualified
by not detecting coliform bacteria in two consecutive samples or 95% of annual samples or
both. One country specified 10 per 100ml as an operational value; another specified 100
coliform bacteria per 100 ml in a maximum of 1% of samples;10 per 100 ml in a maximum of
4% of samples; and “not detected” in a minimum of 95% of samples. One country designated
the highest value as a maximum allowable range of 50 – 150 per 100 ml, but a recommended
maximum limit of 10 per 100 ml.

The GDWQ advise that intestinal enterococci can be used as an indicator of faecal pollution
and may survive longer in water than E coli. All countries and territories specifying a value for
this parameter specified zero per 100 ml, and one specified that the value should be zero per
100 ml in 95% of samples (where more than 20 are taken annually) and not be present in
consecutive samples.

For the purposes of this survey, faecal coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms have not been
counted separately where they have been specified by countries and territories in addition to E
coli because the value has always been zero per 100 ml. The GDWQ advise that the presence
of E coli (or thermotolerant coliforms) provides evidence of recent faecal contamination. All
countries and territories specified a value of zero per 100 ml except one country which
specified 1 per 100 ml in a maximum of 1% of samples. One country did not specify a value
for this parameter, just specifying zero per 100 ml for coliforms.

The GDWQ advise that the test for this parameter has little value as an indicator of pathogen
presence but can be useful in operational monitoring as a treatment and disinfectant indicator
and for assessing the cleanliness of distribution systems. The objective is to keep numbers as
low as possible. The EU countries specified “no abnormal change” for this parameter.

Additional parameters

In the documentation used for this survey countries and territories specified 865 numerical
values for 287 inorganic, organic, aesthetic and physical parameters that do not have a WHO
GV, HBV or aesthetic limit. The additional parameters with numerical standard values most
often specified, and reported in this section are: Conductivity (51 countries and territories);
total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (44); oxidizability (permanganate value) (43);
phenols (35); formaldehyde (19); silver (24); potassium (12); and propanil (11).

Almost half (51/104) of the countries and territories included in the survey specified a value for
conductivity. A wide range of values were specified, from 170 to 2,700 S/cm. Twenty-eight
countries and territories specified 2500 S/cm.

The GDWQ advise that this parameter occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below
those of health concern and specifies a tolerable concentration of 2.6 mg/l for ingested
formaldehyde. Nineteen countries and territories specified a value for formaldehyde, and of
these, eleven set 0.9 mg/l.

The GDWQ do not advise a health-based guideline value for total PAH. Benzo(a)pyrene has a
health-based value of 0.0007 mg/l (see organic parameters). For fluoranthene it advises that it
occurs in drinking-water at concentrations well below those of health concern but a health-
based value of 0.004 can be calculated on available data. Forty-four countries and territories
specified a value for total PAHs, of these, 33set 0.0001 mg/l.

The GDWQ do not advise a health-based guideline value for total phenols. 2,4,6-
Trichlorophenol has a provisional GV (C) of 0.2 mg/l (see organic parameters), and summary
information on chlorophenols other than 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is presented in the sections on
acceptability parameters. Thirty-five countries and territories specified a value for phenols.
Almost half (15/35) set 0.002 mg/l.

The GDWQ advise that currently, there is no evidence that potassium levels in municipally
treated drinking-water, even water treated with potassium permanganate, are likely to pose any
risk for the health of consumers. It is not considered necessary to establish a health-based
guideline value for potassium in drinking-water. Twelve countries and territories specified a
value for potassium.

 Minimum value set                                                               0.02 mg/l
 Median value                                                                    0.02 mg/l

The GDWQ advise that although a health-based value for propanil can be derived, this has not
been done, because propanil is readily transformed into metabolites that are more toxic. Two
of these metabolites, 3,4-dichloroaniline and 3,3′ ,4,4′ -tetrachloroazobenzene, are more toxic
and more persistent than the parent compound.
Therefore, a guideline value for propanil is considered inappropriate and there are inadequate
data on the metabolites to allow the derivation of guideline values for them. All of the eleven
countries and territories setting a value for propanil specified 0.02 mg/l except one, which
specified 0.7 mg/l. No country or territory specified a value for metabolites of propanil.

The GDWQ advise that the available data is inadequate to permit the derivation of a health-
based guideline value; however, a concentration of 0.1mg/l could be tolerated without risk to
health. Twenty-four countries and territories specified a value for silver, and none set a value
above 0.1 mg/l.




                                                   87
Conclusion

The GDWQ emphasize the importance of setting risk-based standards and adopting the
specifications in the guidelines to local resources and needs. The GDWQ do not only provide
guidance on standard-setting, but also on a holistic water safety framework that includes the
establishment of national standards, as well as preventive risk management approaches (e.g.
Water Safety Plans), and independent surveillance.

For the purpose of this report, only the standards that countries and territories are specifying
for different water quality parameters were reviewed. In that context, it was found that the
GDWQ play an overall significant role in countries and territories’ setting of values that define
drinking-water quality. More than half of the countries and territories in the survey reference
the GDWQ directly (e.g. Iceland) or indirectly (e.g. Norway) by referencing other countries
and territories which referenced the GDWQ. This figure is actually likely to be higher as the
full value standard was not always available. Another limitation of this report is that direct
comparison between countries and territories is difficult because standards in different
countries and territories can be mandatory, recommended and/or risk-based. Direct comparison
is further difficult and should be approached with caution, as national standards should be
developed considering the local context. It must also be kept in mind that countries and
territories review their specification for drinking-water quality with a different rhythm than to
when updates to the GDWQ are published. However, the values included in the GDWQ and
their role in providing orientation to countries and territories is underlined by the number of
countries and territories making reference to the GDWQ in their specifications, and in a great
many cases specifying GVs.
